We use the concept of the access possibilities frontier to explain   how difficulties in managing risk and transaction costs involved in SME lending makes   financial institutions and markets so reluctant to reach out to this group of enterprises    especially in developing countries. We discuss different policies and reforms that can   entice financial institutions and markets to lend to SMEs and comment on the role of the   government in institution building  providing the regulatory framework and undertake   marketfriendly activist policies.  However  we also point to pitfalls in government's   involvement in SME financing.

Introduction          Small and medium enterprises account for a large share of enterprises and a large     share of overall employment in the private sector of most economies.  Employment in     enterprises with up to 250 employees constitutes over 60% of total employment in     manufacturing in many countries (Figure 1)  which justifies the statement that “SMEs are     the emerging private sector in poor countries and thus form the base for private sectorled     growth” (Hallberg  2001).  Crosscountry evidence  however  also shows that small and     medium enterprises are more constrained in their operation and growth than large     enterprises and access to financial services features importantly among the constraints     (Ayyagari  DemirgüçKunt and Maksimovic  2006).       This paper summarizes recent empirical evidence on SMEs’ financing constraints     and patterns. While offering broad crosscountry comparisons  it should be noted that this     paper focuses mainly on developing and emerging markets.  It offers a conceptual     framework to understand why financial institutions in most countries are so reluctant to     reach out to these enterprises and discusses different policies and reform that can increase     SMEs’ access to external finance.  Based on this framework  the paper goes on to discuss     government’s role in enhancing access to finance  ranging from institution building over     providing regulatory frameworks to marketfriendly activist policies  while at the same     time noting potential pitfalls in governments’ attempts to enhance SMEs’ access to credit.       Policy efforts targeted at SMEs have often been justified with arguments that (i)     SMEs are an engine of innovation and growth  (ii) they help reduce poverty as they are     more laborintensive  but (iii) they are constrained by institutional and market failures.1      While countrylevel and microeconomic studies have not provided conclusive evidence                                                      1 See Biggs (2002) for an overview.          1     on these arguments  recent crosscountry evidence does not support the claim that     countries with a larger share of SMEs in the manufacturing sector grow faster or see their     poverty rates fall faster (Beck  DemirgüçKunt and Levine  2005). Specifically  there     does not seem to be any robust relationship between the share of small  medium or large     enterprises and economic development. On the other hand  crosscountry research has     pointed to the institutional and business environment in which enterprises operate as an     important factor for economic development.  The business environment includes – among     other elements  welldefined property rights  both between private parties and protection     against government expropriation  effective contract enforcement  competitive product      labor and capital makers  and a legal framework that allows for relatively easy entry and     exit of enterprises. Klapper  Laeven and Rajan (2006) show how different elements of the     business environment affect economic growth through the entry of new firms.     Specifically  high firm registration costs hamper new firm creation and growth  while     property right protection and regulations fostering access to finance are conducive to firm     creation and growth. The effect of policies might also explain the absence of a robust     relationship between the size of the SME sector and growth  as a comparison between     Italy and the UK illustrates.  On the one hand  Italy has high registration costs and many     old  inefficient and slow growing SMEs  while the UK with low entry barriers has firms     that enter at a lower scale than in Italy but grow more rapidly (Figure 2).      Taking together  this implies the policy focus shifting away from sizeoriented     policies towards policies that level the playing field between firms of different sizes and     allow for entry of new enterprises.  While small firms suffer more from financing and     other constraints than large firms  it is not size itself that justifies intervention  but rather          2     the potential of small firms to grow into medium and large enterprises and to contribute     to the economy and the fact that institutional and market failures create an uneven     playing field between firms of different sizes. As we will argue below  the focus should     therefore be both on reforms of the business environment that affect all enterprises and     foster entrepreneurship (Klapper and QuesadaDelgado  2007)  but also on policies that     can help SMEs overcome financing constraints particular to their firm size and risk. The     focus should be less on subsidies to small enterprises per se.     The remainder of this paper is structured as follows.  Section 2 summarizes recent     empirical evidence on SMEs’ financing constraints and patterns.  Section 3 offers a     conceptual framework to understand why financial institutions are reluctant to reach out     to SMEs.  Section 4 uses this framework to discuss policies to overcome these constraints     and section 5 discusses in detail government’s role.  Section 6 concludes.           2. SMEs’ financing constraints – the evidence2     Access to and cost of finance is often ranked as one of most constraining feature     of the business environment by SMEs (Figure 3).  Specifically  the cost of finance is     rated by over 35% of small and medium enterprises as major growth constraint in a     sample of 71  mostly developing  countries  more than any other characteristic of the     business environment  including tax rates and macroeconomic instability  also rated by     many SMEs as major growth constraints.  Access to finance is rated as major constraint     by around 30% of small and medium enterprises  a similar proportion as economic policy     uncertainty and corruption.  Further  financing is one of the few characteristics of the     business environment that – together with crime and political instability  is robustly                                                      2 This section builds on Beck and DemirgüçKunt (2006).           3     linked to firm growth  while other features have at most an indirect effect on firm growth     (Ayyagari  DemirgüçKunt and Maksimovic  2006).     Small firms consistently report higher financing obstacles than medium and large     enterprises (Beck  DemirgüçKunt  Laeven and Maksimovic  2006). Smaller  younger     and domestic (as opposed to foreignowned) enterprises report higher financing     obstacles even after controlling for other firm characteristics.  The relationship is not only     statistically but also economically significant.  The probability that a small firm lists     financing as a major obstacle (as opposed to moderate  minor or no obstacle) is 39%     compared to 36% for mediumsize firms and 32% for large firms.     The higher financing obstacles reported by small as compared to large firms are     also reflected in financing patterns (Figure 4).  While small firms finance less than ten     percent of their investment needs with bank finance  large firms finance more than 20%     with bank credit.  Large firms have a similar  through not as strong  advantage  in trade     credit and development finance  while small firms seem to finance a larger of investment     with equity and informal finance  compared to large firms. Small firms also finance a     significantly larger share of their new investment with internal resources than large firms.      Further  small firms are less likely to use bank finance and other sources of external     finance (Figure 5).  While 30% of large firms use bank finance to finance new     investment  only 12% of small firms do.      Small firms do not only report higher financing obstacles  they are also more     adversely affected by these obstacles. As shown in Figure 6  small firms’ financing     obstacles have almost twice the effect on their growth that large firms’ financing     obstacles do (Beck  DemirgüçKunt and Maksimovic  2005). The difference between          4     small and large firms is at least as big or even bigger for some of the specific financing     obstacles  such as collateral requirements  bank paperwork  interest rate payments  the     need for special connections and banks’ lack of lending resources. Also the lack of access     to specific forms of financing such as export  leasing and longterm finance is     significantly more constraining for small firms’ growth than for large firms’ growth.        Quasinatural experimental evidence confirms the importance of credit constraints     for firm growth. Banerjee and Duflo (2004) analyze detailed loan information on 253     Indian SMEs’ before and after they became eligible for a directed subsidized lending     program and find that the additional credit resulted in a proportional increase in sales     rather than a substitution for other nonsubsidized credit  indicating that these firms were     credit constrained before receiving subsidized credit. Similarly  Zia (2007) finds that     small nonlisted and nongroup firms in Pakistan reduce their sales after they become     ineligible for subsidized export credit  indicating the existence of credit constraints; in     contrast  large  listed and group firms do not reduce their sales after losing access to     subsidized credit.  It should be stressed that this evidence does not support subsidized     credit as a means to alleviate small firms’ credit constraints – a topic to which we will     return below   but they show that small firms are constrained by their lack of access to     external finance.     Recent research also shows the importance of the business environment for firms’     financing constraints and patterns. Beck  DemirgüçKunt  Laeven and Maksimovic     (2006) show that institutional development  measured very broadly  is the most robust     countrycharacteristic predicting crosscountry variation in firms’ financing obstacles      even after controlling for crosscountry differences in GDP per capita. Firms in countries          5     with higher levels of institutional development report significantly lower financing     obstacles than firms in countries with less developed institutions. The positive effect of     financial and institutional development can also be observed in the use of external     finance. Better protection of property rights increases external financing of small firms     significantly more than it does for large firms  particularly due to the differential impact it     has on bank and supplier finance (Beck  DemirgüçKunt and Maksimovic  2004b).     Financial and institutional development helps create a level playing field between     small and large firms  while the lack of an effective financial system explains the     phenomenon of the missing middle observed in many developing countries.  Beck      DemirgüçKunt and Maksimovic (2005) show that the effect of growth obstacles on firm     growth is smaller in countries with betterdeveloped financial and legal systems.  The     effect of financial and legal development on the constraintsgrowth relationship is     significantly stronger for small firms than for large firms.   Financial and institutional     development thus helps close the gap between small and large firms. This is also     confirmed by more detailed country comparisons.  For example  Sleuwaegen and     Goedhuys (2002) show that smaller firms grow relatively faster in Germany than in Côte     d’Ivoire  while the opposite holds for large firms.  Using crossindustry  crosscountry     data for 44 countries and 36 industries in the manufacturing sector  Beck  Demirgüç    Kunt  Laeven and Levine (2005) show that financial development exerts a     disproportionately large positive effect on the growth of industries that are naturally     composed of more small firms. Their results suggest that the furniture industry (an     industry with many small firms) should grow 1.4% per annum faster than the spinning     industry (an industry with relatively few small firms) in Canada (a country with a well          6     developed financial system) than in India (which has a low level of financial     development).  Since the average industry growth rate in their sample is 3.4%  this is a     relatively large effect.  This suggests that financial market development helps small firms     more than large firms overcome financial market frictions thus leading to a more level     playing field between firms of different sizes.      The constraining effect of financial and institutional underdevelopment also     shows up in a distorted size distribution. Kumar  Rajan and Zingales (1999) find that the     average size of firms in human capitalintensive and R&D intensive industries is larger in     countries with better property rights and patent protection. Similarly  Beck  Demirgüç    Kunt and Maksimovic (2006) show in a cross country sample that large firms  i.e. firms     that are most likely to be able to choose the boundaries of the firm  are larger in countries     with betterdeveloped financial and legal systems.  Finally  Aghion  Fally and Scarpetta     (2007) find for a sample of European countries that financial development enhances new     firm entry in sectors that depend more heavily on external finance and that the smallest     size firms benefit the most in terms of higher entry from higher financial development.      They also show that financial development promotes the postentry growth of firms in     sectors that depend more on external finance. These results suggest that agency problems     between outside investors and corporate insiders keep firms smaller in countries with     weak legal and financial systems. Firms thus stay smaller in countries with     underdeveloped financial and legal systems.  On the other hand  access to financial     services can help new entrepreneurs survive beyond the first year  as evidence from     Bosnia shows (DemirgüçKunt  Klapper and Panos  2007) and can help enterprises     innovate at a faster rate (Ayyagari  DemirgüçKunt and Maksimovic  2007)           7     3. SMEs’ financing constraints – a conceptual framework3     The empirical evidence that financing constraints and access to external finance     are inversely correlated with firm size matches theoretical models that use fixed     transaction costs and information asymmetries and the resulting agency problems as basis     for financial market frictions (see Levine  2005 for an overview).  In the following  we     will build on this theoretical literature and the empirical evidence to derive a conceptual     framework explaining SMEs’ financing constraints and thus set the basis for the policy     discussion of the next section.     Transaction costs and information asymmetries drive the variation in access to     finance across firms of different sizes.  Take first transaction costs.  Fixed transaction     costs in credit assessment  processing and monitoring result in decreasing unit costs as     the size of the loan increases. These fixed transaction costs exist at the transaction  client      institution and even financial system level.  Assessing an individual loan request entails     costs that are at least partially independent of the loan amount. Maintaining a client     relationship over time and across different financial products  including loan  deposit and     savings services  implies costs that are partly orthogonal to the number and amount of     financial transactions with the client.  At the level of the financial institution  fixed costs     range from brickandmortar branch installations over computer system to legal services     and are again partly independent of the number of clients or the size of their loans. Fixed     costs might even arise on the financial system level in the form of regulatory costs and     the costs of payment and settlement systems  which are up to a point independent of the     number of transactions  clients and institutions in the system.                                                         3 This section builds on Beck and de la Torre (2007).           8     These fixed transaction costs drive a wedge between funding costs of financial     institutions and the lending rate they charge borrowers.  In a world of uncertain returns on     investments  higher transaction costs and the resulting higher lending costs can increase     the likelihood that borrowers cannot pay due to too high of a repayment burden.  Rather     than increasing the interest rate to the market clearing rate  financial institutions might     ration at a lower interest rate than the market equilibrium rate because higher interest     rates would lead to lower expected repayments (Williamson  1987).  High transaction     costs do therefore not only increase the cost of borrowing  but can also restrict access to     external finance for some borrower groups.      While transaction costs are restraining for all borrowers  there are arguments that     they are even more constraining for small and medium enterprises.  Their diverse     characteristics and their relative opaqueness increases assessment and monitoring costs.     Unlike other credit categories  such as consumer credit or mortgage lending  SME     lending is still considered a highcost lending product.  More specifically  unlike other     lending products that can be reduced to simple transactions  SME lending often still     depends heavily on relationships between borrowers and lenders (Berger and Udell      1998  2006).     In addition to transaction costs  the outreach to small and medium enterprises is     constrained by default risk. Default risk can be either borrowerspecific or systemic.  In     the following  we will focus on the borrowerspecific risk and more specifically on risks     arising from asymmetric information between borrower and lenders.   If the debtor is     privy to information about her project or her effort and the lender may only secure this     information at a prohibitively high cost  this can lead to two different sources of risk           9     adverse selection and moral hazard.  Adverse selection refers to difficulties of choosing     good credit risks exante  while moral hazard refers to the inability of the lender of     effectively enforcing the agreed credit contract expost.   Although such risk can be     compensated by increasing the interest rate  this would increase adverse selection and     moral hazard. As the interest rate rises  this will attract riskier borrowers to the pool and     will entice borrowers to undertake riskier project with a higher probability of default.       The impossibility to use interest rates as screening technology entices lenders to use non    interest screening devices such as collateral  warrants or assessment based on audited     information. In its ultimate consequence  however  lenders will ration credit rather than     allow the interest rate to rise to the marketclearing level  as first shown by Stiglitz and     Weiss (1981).          To illustrate the nonlinear relationship between interest rates and credit supply     due to transaction costs and agency problems  Figure 7 plots the nominal interest rate i     and the return for the lender r.  In a world with costs and risks  the two would be identical     as illustrated by the 45% line. In a world of transaction costs and agency problems      however  there is an increasing wedge between nominal interest rate and return.  As i     increases  there is a higher default probability and the return to the lender therefore     increases at a decreasing rate.    Similarly  as i increases  the borrower pool becomes     riskier  which again results in a higher default probability.  Eventually  the marginal     benefit of an interest rate increase due to higher revenues is equal to the marginal costs     due to higher default and at higher nominal interest rates  the return to the lender     decreases.            10     As in the case of transaction costs  SME lending is more affected by the inability     to manage risks than other lending products.  Compared to large firms  SMEs are     commonly more opaque  less likely to be able to post collateral and often do not have     audited financial statements that allow a better picture of the enterprise and its projected     profits.  These features of the SME lending market make the curve in Figure 7 flatter and     the flexion point lower than in other lending markets.     Lenders must develop loan technologies that enable them to choose such SMEs     that  for any given lending interest rate  will yield the highest riskadjusted expected net     return.    To select such debtors  the creditor must compare  (i) the allin costs of lending     to different debtors/projects; (ii) the differences in expected returns (capacity to pay)     across such debtors/projects that the lender considers to be equally risky; and (iii) the     differences in risks and willingness to pay across such debtors/projects that the lender     considers to be of equal expected returns (or capacity to pay).  The scope for optimization     that the lender will have in managing lending costs and risks will be constrained by state     variables  such as the contractual and informational frameworks  macroeconomic     environment  technology and other characteristics of the business environment in which     both lender and borrower operate  such as physical infrastructure  crime and political     instability.  These state variables are not only outside the reach of lenders’ actions  but     neither can they be changed in the shortrun by policy makers.   The weaker these state     variables  the flatter the curve in Figure 7 and the less the maneuvering room for credit     supply optimization.  Given the constraints  a prudent lender will rather not offer loans at     a higher interest rate if she is not reasonably sure of her ability to appropriately measure     costs  sort out risks for a given expected return  and identify expected returns for a given          11     risk.  However  there is also the possibility that lenders will not maximize their lending     opportunities to SMEs given by the state variables.  On the other extreme  lenders might     act imprudently and lend more to SMEs than sustainable under the current state variables.      Using the concept of state variables allows us to define the Access Possibilities     Frontier for SME lending as a rationed equilibrium  i.e. the maximum share of viable     loan applicants that could be served by financial institutions prudently given the existing     state variables.4 To derive the frontier and thus the bankable share of loan applicants  we     have to take into account both demand and supply side factors  while holding the state     variables constant. The demand for loanable funds is a positive function of expected     returns on investible projects and a negative function of the lending interest rate and     voluntary selfexclusion.  By enabling debtors to seek resources for risky projects that     they would not undertake with their own money  the option to borrow gives rise to the     problems of adverse selection and moral hazard discussed above  which can result in an     imprudently high loan demand.  While the loan supply is thus a positive function of the     nominal lending interest rate  this relationship is nonlinear and might turn negative     beyond a threshold. Lenders will thus not satisfy all the loan demand but rather ration it     at an interest rate below the marketclearing rate. This is an inevitable cost of prudence in     a world of uncertainty and agency problems—some “good” debtors have to be left out in     order to minimize the set of “bad” debtors that are let in. In statistical terms  this is the     tradeoff between type I and type II errors.      The Access Possibilities Frontier  however  is not timeinvariant  as the example     of technology shows.  The increasing use of IT in lending reduces processing costs and                                                        4 While we derive the Access Possibilities Frontier for SME lending  this concept can also be applied to   other lending products and markets.  See Beck and de la Torre (2007) for a more detailed discussion.          12     thus overall transaction costs related to lending  but can also improve risk management      through the introduction of credit scoring (Berger  Frame  and Miller 2005; Frame  Padhi     and Woosley  2004; Frame  Srinivasan and Woosley  2001).     Given costs and risks and demandside constraints  we can use the Access     Possibilities Frontier to identify several types of access to credit problems. A first type of     access problem is demandoriginated and consists in too low a number of loan applicants     simply because of selfexclusion resulting from cultural barriers or financial illiteracy.      Alternatively  there could be a lack of profitable investment projects in the economy that     deserve financing based on their expected return. A second type of access problem can     arise due to supply suboptimization that leads to credit markets settling at a point below     the Access Possibilities Frontier.  This can reflect  for instance  regulatory distortions or     insufficient contestability that cause lenders not to fully exploit all the outreach     opportunities  given the state variables.  A third and very different access problem is     associated with “excess access ” that is  an equilibrium above the Access Possibilities     Frontier with loans being granted to a larger share of loan applicants than is prudently     warranted  given the lending interest rate and the state variables. A final access problem     consists of too low a prudent Access Possibilities Frontier due to deficiencies in state     variables compared to countries with similar levels of economic development.         Each of these access problems calls for different policies.  The first type of     problems calls for demandside measures that educate and encourage the healthy use of     financial products by SMEs.  A problem of profitable investment projects  on the other     hand  has to be addressed through nonfinancial sector policies and is primarily not a     problem of access to finance.  The second problem calls for interventions and policies          13     that encourage financial institutions to maximize outreach to SMEs given the contractual     and macroeconomic environment  while the third problem calls for restraining measures.      The final set of policies are general reforms of the business environment and institutional     framework that are not specific to the SME lending market.  We will discuss these     different policies in the next section.          4. SMEs’ financing constraints – policies     The Access Possibilities Frontier derived in the previous section allows us to     discuss different policies to alleviate SMEs’ financing constraints.  Specifically  we will     distinguish between marketdeveloping policies that will help push out the frontier      marketenabling policies that push incumbent and new financial institutions towards the     existing frontier and marketharnessing policies that prevent the financial system to move     beyond the frontier towards a point of financial fragility.  Let us discuss each in turn.     Market developing policies aim at improving the state variables and include     reforms in the contractual and informational frameworks and macroeconomic     performance.  As discussed above  while these reforms are not specific to the SME     lending market  they will help level the playing field between small and large enterprises.     The results of such reforms can take a longtime; nevertheless they are indispensable in     order for the financial system to reach a higher sustainable equilibrium and be able to     provide SMEs with the necessary financial services in a commercially viable manner.      High lending interest rates may reflect doubts about fiscal solvency and a history     of asset confiscation or inflation volatility  and will be often associated with crowding out     of private investment due to the absorption by the government of a large share of          14     society’s financial savings. This crowding out will especially hurt small and medium     enterprises that unlike large and multinational enterprises do not have recourse to     alternative finance providers.  Under such circumstances  the appropriate policies to     foster access to credit would be those that aim at enhancing the resiliency of fiscal     solvency and at establishing a credible record of low and stable inflation.      A shallow credit market with low access may also result from major shortfalls in     the contractual and informational frameworks (Beck and Levine  2005).  The appropriate     policies in this case would span a wide range  from titling of land property to the     upgrading of laws affecting collateral repossession or execution of guarantees; from the     modernization of corporate reorganization and bankruptcy proceedings to improvements     in the functioning of the judiciary; from raising accounting and disclosure standards to     establishing the appropriate legal framework and right incentives for the development of     credit registries.       Changes in the state variables involve changes in fundamental institutions and can     take a long time to materialize.   To the extent that a financial system is operating below     the possibilities frontier  there is room for marketenabling policies that may foster the     broadening of access even in the absence of perceptible changes in state variables. Where     the lack of profitable  creditdeserving investment projects is the main problem  non    financial sector policies are called for.  Where the main reason for being below the     possibilities frontier is the demand problem of selfexclusion  the appropriate policies     would emphasize raising financial literacy.  If – as is more likely  the main problems     reside with suboptimization in credit supply  by contrast  a wider range of policy options     can be considered  starting with competition policy.          15     While theory and some empirical work suggest that market power might entice     banks to invest in longterm relationships with small and opaque enterprises as they know     that they can regain the initial investment in the relationship at a later stage (Petersen and     Rajan  1995; Bonaccorsi di Patti and Dell’Ariccia  2004)  other empirical papers point to     the healthy effect of competition on availability of lending to SMEs (Cetorelli and     Strahan  2004; Beck  DemirgüçKunt and Maksimovic  2004a).5  Complicating the     debate is that market structure  as for example measured by concentration ratios  is not     the same as competitiveness  which is also influenced by the segmentation and     contestability of a market (Claessens and Laeven  2004).   Further  state variables such as     the contractual and informational frameworks can influence the competitiveness of a     financial system through the ability to transfer collateral easily from one lender to another     and the ability of SMEs to build up reputation capital through a credit registry.      There is mixed evidence concerning the effect of foreign bank entry on SME     lending.  On the one hand  firmsurvey evidence suggests that firms report lower     financing obstacles in countries with a higher share of foreign banks  a finding that holds     across different size groups of firms.  (Clarke  Cull  and Martinez Peria  2006).  This     positive effect can be a direct or an indirect one.  Foreign banks can bring the necessary     knowhow and scale to introduce new transaction lending techniques. By competing with     domestic banks for large corporate clients  they can also force domestic banks to go down     market to cater to SMEs (de Haas and Naaborg  2005). On the other hand  banklevel     information from specific countries suggests that foreign banks are less likely to lend to     small and opaque companies than domestic banks (Mian  2006; Gormley  2006). So  any                                                        5 See Berger et al. (2004) for an overview          16     positive effect of foreign bank entry on SME lending seems to be more indirect than     direct.      Regulatory policies can be important to push the system towards the frontier of     SME lending.  Regulatory frameworks that enable leasing and factoring – traditional     SME lending products – have featured prominently on the agenda.  Leasing is an     attractive financing tool for SMEs as it is based on the cash flow of the financed asset      such as machinery or vehicle  rather than reputation of the enterprise or the asset base of     the enterprise  it often includes tax advantages  and it allows for easier recovery if the     correct legal framework is in place.  Factoring  the discounting of sales receivables  is     attractive for small suppliers of large creditworthy buyers  as it does not rely on     information about the “borrower”  but rather on the obligor (Klapper  2006).  Both     leasing and factoring rely on a legal framework governing these transactions  but rely to a     lesser extent on the contractual framework of a country  so that they can be help push a     financial system towards the frontier of SME lending  even if this frontier is low.  Both     transaction forms can also benefit a lot from electronic registration systems and electronic     security laws  which will allow electronic processing and therefore reduction of     transaction costs (Klapper  2006  2007).      Loan classification and provisioning rules can also affect SMEs’ access to     finance  through reliance less on collateral than on forwardlooking assessment of     payment performance.  Further  Adasme  Majnoni and Uribe (2006) show that SME     lending might require more provisioning but less capital  given that the distribution of     losses from small loans is less skewed than that for large loans.  Another regulatory issue          17     is the equal taxation of financial products that are offered by different financial     institutions  thus creating a competitive even playing field.      A third group of policies  which we define as marketharnessing  try to prevent     the financial system from moving to an unsustainable equilibrium beyond the frontier due     to imprudent lending.  Such imprudent lending binges can arise from the same     competition that marketenabling policies try to foster if not accompanied by a proper     defined regulatory and supervisory framework.  Indiscriminate free entry for new     deposittaking credit institutions or the intensification of competition among incumbent     institutions can lead to widespread fragility  especially in the context of implicit or     explicit government guarantees  poor accounting and disclosure practices  deficient early     warning system and prompt corrective action regimes  and dysfunctional failure     resolution frameworks.  Marketharnessing policies therefore aim at keeping banks’     incentives to take aggressive risks in check through a mix of measures aimed at     strengthening market and supervisory discipline.  The absence of too generous deposit     insurance – implicit or explicit – and disclosure and transparency requirements give large     creditors and depositors incentives and possibilities to monitor and discipline banks. In     addition  market signals in the form of deposit interest rates  yields on subordinated debt     or equity prices of publicly listed banks moving in response to risk taking and     performance of banks provide additional information to bank supervisors and should be     coupled with effective official intervention into institutions that the market has identified     as weak.  Summarizing  policy makers have to strike a fine balance between market    enabling policies that push financial institution towards the frontier and market         18     harnessing policies that prevent them from moving beyond the frontier  with the balance     varying from country to country.           5. SMEs’ financing constraints – the role of government          The different policies discussed in the previous section seem to call for an     important role of the government in the “SMEAccess to Finance” debate.  But what     exactly government’s role is  is still subject to discussion.  While research has been able     to identify which government interventions have not worked over the past decades in the     SME lending market  researchers are still struggling to define exactly  which policies can     work under which circumstances.  There is a tradeoff between market failures and     government failures  the tendency to remedy market failures through government     interventions  which then in turn can lead to government failures.  In the following we     will discuss different areas of government intervention  but would like to emphasize that     this is an area still being researched  with no standard answers for all countries and     markets and no predesigned policy packages ready to be taken off the shelf.  What works     in one country  might not work in others; a contextsensitive approach that takes into     account country circumstances  is therefore called for (Honohan and Beck  2007).  Where     government intervention is involved  the strength of governance arrangements might be     an important factor to be taken into account.      Least controversial is the role of government in providing the contractual and     informational framework and ensuring a stable macroeconomic environment.      Government is the natural provider of key institutions such as legislation and court     systems.  Similarly  given the government’s monopoly over the issue of monetary          19     instruments  ensuring macroeconomic stability is a natural government task.  As     discussed above  it is through these policies that the government can help push outwards     the Access Possibilities Frontier and ensure a longterm sustainable increase in SMEs’     access to finance.  While these business environment reforms do not focus specifically on     SMEs  they help close the gap between firms of different sizes and level the playing field.     Through these policies the government helps develop markets that can then be used by     financial institutions to reach out to SMEs.       However  these markets are not always used and the financial system is likely to     settle at an equilibrium below the frontier  which raises the question on government’s     involvement in ensuring that the system moves towards the frontier.  We already     discussed marketenabling policies  such as providing regulatory frameworks for leasing     and factoring and fostering competition.  Some of these policies might require more     active government involvement.  Improving the informational framework through the     introduction of a credit information bureau is a specific area where government might     have to step in.  While banks might be interested in establishing systems to share negative     information  incumbent financial institutions might be less interested in sharing positive     information.  On the other hand  positive information sharing allows SMEs to build up     reputation collateral and thus fosters competition.  Overcoming banks’ opposition to     share positive information can enhance the contestability of a financial system and might     be an area where governments have to take a proactive role.       Beyond targeting competition per se  governments can also try produce a     movement towards the possibilities frontier by addressing hindrances such as     coordination failures  first mover disincentives  and obstacles to risk distribution and          20     sharing. While not easy to define in general terms  given their variety  these government     interventions tend to share a common feature in creating incentives for private lenders     and investors to step in  without unduly shifting risks and costs to the government (de la     Torre  Gozzi and Schmukler  2006).  Three examples illustrate this approach.  One is the     creation by NAFIN (a Mexican development bank) of an internetbased market  which     allows small suppliers to use their receivable from large creditworthy buyers to receive     working capital financing (Klapper  2006).  Another example is the Chilean program     (FOGAPE) to promote lending to SMEs via the auctioning of partial government     guarantees (Benavente  Galetovic  and Sanhueza  2006).  Finally  the Mexican     development fund FIRA has brokered a variety of structured finance packages to finance     agricultural production (e.g.  shrimp  corn) to realign credit risks with the pattern of     information between financial institutions and different participants in the supply chains     of these agricultural products (de la Torre  Gozzi and Schmukler  2006).   While     intriguing examples  it is not for sure whether risk is really not being shifted to     government and taxpayers through such interventions and whether these interventions     have sunset clauses that will allow the government to withdraw once its engagement is     not needed anymore.  There are also governance concerns stemming from a government     intervention in a private market.  Finally  from political economy viewpoint  such     schemes might take away the pressure to implement the longterm institution building     that is necessary to push out the frontier and expand SME lending sustainably in the long    term.            21          Partial credit guarantee (PCG) schemes feature prominently among market    activist policies.6   While they also exist on a private basis  governments and donors have     been aggressively pushing for their establishment to overcome the limited access to bank     credit SMEs face.  By providing a guarantee  such as scheme can help overcome the lack     of collateral of most SMEs  but issues of appropriate pricing  funding and the institutional     structure are important.  While such schemes could be run on a selfsustainable basis      they often involve significant subsidies and contingent fiscal liabilities to cover losses.       While it is difficult to compute such costs exante  it is even more difficult to measure the     benefits  which would be partially captured by additionality  i.e. the share of borrowers     that would not have gained access to finance if it were not for the PCG.   An even more     accurate measure would be the extent to which borrowers that would have gotten access     to credit in a world without market frictions  could access the credit market due to PGCs      minus the extent to which borrowers gained access through the PCG that would not have     gotten access in a frictionfree world.   Ultimately  the cost of any government     intervention has to take into account the return on each dollar of taxpayer’s money in     such an intervention compared to other interventions  including interventions outside the     financial sector.      While the government often does not intervene directly in the market in the case     of most PCG schemes – if credit assessment and monitoring is still left with the banks       the past forty years have seen many examples of marketsubstituting policies to foster     SME lending  with the result balance tipping heavily into the negative.  Such policies     include directed credit  often combined with interest rate subsidies  and the establishment     of development finance institutions focused on SME lending.  These policies share the                                                      6 For an overview of the literature on PCGs  see World Bank (2007).           22     problems of all governmentmanaged financial sector programs – the tradeoff between     commercial and social goals results in high losses and nonsustainability of many of these     programs.   Undercutting market conditions results in crowding out of private providers      even where the latter would be willing to enter due to changes in the general business     environment or due to technological advances.   Political subversion of these programs     often leads to corruption and channeling of funds to political cronies or to specific     electoral groups (Cole  2004; Dinc  2005; Khwaja and Mian  2005).            6. Conclusions     This paper surveyed empirical research on SMEs’ financing constraints and     patterns.  A conceptual framework showed that transaction costs and asymmetric     information between borrower and lender are the driving factors explaining the limited     access to external finance by many SMEs in developing as well as developed economies.      This conceptual framework allowed us to distinguish between marketdeveloping policies     such as reforming the contractual and informational framework  marketenabling policies     such as fostering competition and providing regulatory frameworks for leasing and     factoring and marketharnessing policies such as the financial safety net that prevent     imprudent lending booms and busts. Government has an important role in reforming the     institutional environment  providing regulatory frameworks and fostering competition.      International experience  however  has shown the widespread failure of government    owned or –managed financial institutions focusing on specific borrowers groups or     directed lending programs.  Less clear is the role of government in intervening through     activist policies  such as credit guarantee schemes.           23     There is a broad research agenda going forward to better understand SMEs’     financing needs in developing and emerging economies.  First  it is important to better     understand SME lending practices by financial institutions and identify best practices.      Even more important  however  is it to understand how these practices depend on the     business environment in which the financial institutions operate.  Efforts are under way     using banklevel surveys and interviews (De la Torre  Martinez Peria and Schmukler      2007; Beck  DemirgüçKunt and Martinez Peria  2007).  Second  while we have focused     mainly on the banking system – driven by the observation that banks still constitute the     largest component of financial systems in the financial system of most developing and     emerging markets – the role of nonbank financial institutions and financial markets  both     on the debt and the equity side  has to be explored in more detail.  Third  the role of     technology in expanding SMEs’ access to financial services has been little explored.      While the introduction of credit scoring has been shown to expand SME lending in the     U.S.  it is not clear whether this technology can be easily applied to developing countries     (Miller and Rojas  2004).  By enabling more costeffective consumer lending      technological advances such as credit scoring or alternative delivery channels such as     electronic or mobile finance  might push lenders out of the SME lending market  thus     even exacerbating SMEs’ financing constraints. Fourth  case studies on marketfriendly     activist government interventions have been undertaken  but a more rigorous impact     evaluation is necessary  such as has been started for microfinance institutions (World     Bank  2007).  Finally  future research will also try to understand better the impact of the     institutional structure  funding and pricing of partial credit guarantee schemes on SMEs’          24     access to finance (Beck  Klapper and Mendoza  2007).  Such research is necessary to     inform policy makers about the costs and benefits of different interventions.          25     References     Adasme  Osvaldo  Giovanni Majnoni and Myriam Uribe. 2006. “Access and Risk    Friends or Foes?
