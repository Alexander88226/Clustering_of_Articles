b"herein fileCaroline Stern 1Fintechs and their emergence in banking  services in CESEE Over the last years the development of financial technology in the banking sector got a new twist with the emergence of numerous small startups called fintechs. Some of the new technologies will probably make specific areas of the banking business more efficient while others may have the potential to disrupt the traditional banking sector. This paper presents the outcome of a stocktaking exercise and shows that most of the new financial technologies are still being used on a small scale. Given that the CESEE region is usually omitted in discussions of fintechs this paper aims at closing this gap by giving an idea of which activities exist in this region with regard to financial technology. Focusing on three business areas \\xe2\\x80\\x93 (1) financial services (2) payments and (3) financing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 this study finds that the level of adoption of new technologies varies across the CESEE countries. Also a handful of countries seem to have a more active fintech scene in some areas (e.g. peertopeer lending) than many of their Western neighbors.JEL classification G21 G23Keywords fintech nonbank financial institutions banksIn the recent past new financial services companies have received ample media coverage. Frequently referred to as fintechs which is short for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinancial technology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d such firms could change the banking world as we know it. The fintech scene is characterized by thousands of small startups but also wellestablished companies like Alibaba Amazon and Google. The current dynamic in this field is reflected by venture capital investments in fintechs which soared from USD 9 billion (2010) to  USD  24.7  billion  (2016)  worldwide  (KPMG  2017).  In  the  financial  sector these developments are expected to go hand in hand with enhanced efficiency as well as with a workforce reduction. Moreover fintechs may foster financial inclusion especially in emerging countries. Traditional banks have already reacted to the rise of fintech by embarking on new digitalization projects. The European Commission (2017) defines fintechs as technologyenabled  innovation  in  financial  services  regardless  of  the  nature  or size of the provider of the service. A small body of research dealing with fintechs already exists in the U.S.A. the U.K. and China. There are hardly any pertinent studies focusing on Central Eastern and Southeastern Europe (CESEE) however. Therefore this paper is meant to fill this gap and to shed light on the CESEE region2  with regard to fintechs. It is structured as follows section 1 describes the current  developments  with  regard  to  fintechs.  Section  2  gives  a  more  indepth overview of different fintech business areas and their emergence in CESEE and section 3 concludes. 1   Oesterreichische Nationalbank Foreign Research Division caroline.stern@oenb.at. The views expressed in this paper are exclusively those of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of the OeNB or the Eurosystem. The author would like to thank Peter Back\\xc3\\xa9 Thomas Reininger Julia W\\xc3\\xb6rz (all OeNB) as well as two anonymous  referees for helpful comments and valuable suggestions.2   This study includes the following countries the CESEE EU Member States (Bulgaria the Czech Republic Estonia Croatia Hungary Lithuania Latvia Poland Romania Slovenia and Slovakia) the Western Balkan countries (Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina and Serbia) Russia and Ukraine. However data are not available for all the abovementioned countries in all areas of this study.42  OESTERREICHISCHE NATIONALBANK\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEE1  Fintechs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 current developmentsFintechs offer financial services which have to date usually been provided by traditional banks. In contrast to the latter most fintechs do not hold a banking license. Yet some fintechs which had risen to a critical size and started offering additional financial services had to be licensed as a bank/credit institution (e.g. Alibaba in China and N26 in Germany). Still most fintechs are small startups that by their own account have a competitive advantage over traditional banks. After all they offer new and unique  innovative  financial  services  while  at  the  same  time  being  much  more flexible in adapting to new market situations in comparison with big traditional banks. In fact fintechs usually specialize in only one particular type of service and consider retail customers and/or small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) their main target groups. As the financial services on offer can be standardized they may be provided at very low variable costs.Unlike traditional banks fintechs which are usually not licensed as a bank do not have to fulfill comprehensive regulatory requirements. However this does not mean that these companies are not regulated at all. One approach to fintech regulation is to use the existing regulatory framework and/or to amend it to capture fintech companies. For example in the EU many fintechs fall under the Payment Services Directive (PSD 1 or Directive 2007/64/EU) and especially the new Payment Services Directive 2 (PSD 2 or Directive 2015/2366/EU) which was recently amended to integrate new business models (mainly fintechs). Still the PSD 1 and PSD 2based regulatory requirements for payment  service   institutions  are  far  less  comprehensive  than  the  regulatory  requirements for credit institutions laid down in the Capital Requirements Regulation (CRR or Regulation 575/2013/EU) and the Capital Requirements Directive (CRD or Directive 36/2013/EU) that are applicable in the EU. However this also implies that credit institutions have more farreaching  competences than payment service institutions. The former are allowed to take deposits and perform term and risk transformations with deposits and other funds. In contrast under PSD 1 and PSD 2 payment service institutions are not allowed to take deposits; they may grant loans to a very limited extent and have to immediately safeguard3 any funds they receive. Following a different approach some countries have introduced special regulatory requirements for  fintechs (e.g. Switzerland and the U.K.) and/or regulatory sandboxes. The latter offer companies the possibility of experimenting on a limited scale with innovative financial services without having to comply with strict supervisory requirements. One may argue that in a sandbox environment companies as well as supervisors can learn how innovative financial services work. Usually regulatory sandboxes are not limited to small startups only but are also open to traditional big banks. The European Commission likewise considers the introduction of regulatory sandboxes. In its consultation paper on fintech it poses the question whether  regulatory sandboxes should be facilitated or created on an EUwide basis (European Commission 2017). Currently supervisory sandboxes exist for example in the U.K. in Hong Kong Singapore Australia and Malaysia. How3   Safeguarding means that payment institutions have to (1) immediately deposit the funds to a credit institution or (2) invest them in secure liquid and lowrisk assets. In the first option the funds have to be secured by an insurance company; in the second option the funds are insured by the credit institution as they are part of a deposit insurance scheme (see Article 10 Directive (EU) 2015/2366).FOCUS ON EUROPEAN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Q3/17  43\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEEever when it comes to the details each of these countries has its own interpretation of how a regulatory sandbox should work. To the author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knowledge no CESEE  country  has  yet   introduced  a  supervisory  sandbox  for  fintechs.  Russia  by contrast has seen the establishment of an Association for Financial Technology Development which focuses in particular on the development of blockchain i.e. the technology behind for instance bitcoin. Once fintech startups grow to a material size they could pose a risk to financial stability. This may well call for stricter regulation.One might assume that fintechs are mainly active in developed countries as fintechrelated  media  coverage  and  research  are  concentrated  on  developed  countries (e.g. the U.K. and U.S.A.). Yet there are also remarkable developments in some emerging countries. As a case in point China is the market with most peertopeer (P2P) lending platforms \\xe2\\x80\\x93 namely around 2300 as of February 2017 with a lending volume of CNY 2000 billion according to wdzj.com.4 Kenya is a country where twothirds of adults use their mobile phone to send and receive payments (DemirgucKunt et al. 2015). To this end they employ services like MPesa5 that are provided by telecommunications companies. Consequently this has sparked a lively discussion about whether fintechs could act as a catalyst promoting financial inclusion6 above all in emerging countries. Chart 1 illustrates the state of play of financial inclusion in terms of having a bank account a debit card and a credit card in a number of advanced economies CESEE economies and the two largest emerging market economies.7 One innovative feature of fintechs operating in payment services is that they very often offer payment services which do not require the ownership of a bank account. Instead for many such services it suffices to have a mobile phone the ownership of which is already widespread in emerging countries (see also chart 4). Even though according to Global Findex data in most CESEE countries more than 60% have a bank account bank account penetration is still much lower in many CESEE countries than in Western European countries (see chart 1). Ukraine Bosnia and Herzegovina (around 50% have a bank account) as well as Albania (less than 40% have a bank account) exhibit the lowest levels. Chart 1 also shows that the ownership of a bank account does not necessarily result in the holding of a debit card. Moreover credit cards are not popular in the CESEE region where less than 40% own a credit card and even less so in China where only 20% have a credit  card.  Hence  the  distribution  and  adoption  of  new  innovative  payment methods  that  do  not  depend  on  a  bank  account  could  boost  financial  inclusion  significantly albeit in one specific area only.4   Wdzj.com is a private company operating in China that collects data on China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s P2P lending industry.5  MPesa is a service offered by Vodafone for transferring money with a mobile phone. It does not require a bank account an Internet connection or a smartphone.6  Financial inclusion is measured by the G20 in three dimensions (1) access to financial services (2) usage of  financial services and (3) the quality of the products and the service delivery (G20 2016). The indicators used in this study are mainly access and usage indicators.7  The World Bank Global Findex database is used in this study which is a comprehensive database on financial inclusion. Data stem from a survey carried out in partnership with Gallup World Poll. The database is based on interviews with about 150000 nationally representative and randomly selected adults (aged 15 and over) in more than 140 countries (DemirgucKunt et al. 2015).44  OESTERREICHISCHE NATIONALBANK\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEEUse of traditional banking products varies signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cantly across CESEE countries1% of respondents aged 15+100Chart 19080706050403020100DE AT US UKEESILV HR CZ LT PLAccount at a \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutionDebit cardSK HU RS RU BG RO UA BA ALCredit cardCN INSource Global Findex Database.1 Data as at 2014.Business models of fintechs do not only rest on payment services though. They are extensive ranging from payment to financing as well as financial and investment advisory services. Moreover fintechs explore new business areas on a continuous basis. For clarity this paper centers merely on companies that offer banking services and excludes the following business areas virtual currencies (e.g. bitcoin) blockchain (i.e. distributed ledger technology) foreign currency  exchanges companies that offer insurance products (insurtechs) fintechs which offer services  related  to regulatory requirements (regtechs) or corporations dealing with big data analysis and security (e.g. cyber security). Hence in this study fintech is broken down into three broad business areas (1) financial services (2) payments and (3) financing.

The flip side is that some of these business models may pose a threat to financial stability if the startups reach a certain size and/or expose their customers to various risks they may not be fully aware of e.g. risks related to cyber security. 2  Fintech business areas and their emergence in CESEEThis section explores opportunities and threats of different fintech business models and reports on fintech activities in financial services payments and financing in the CESEE countries.2.1  Financial servicesUnder  financial  services  we  summarize  businesses  that  offer  Internetbased  applications  for  (1)  managing  personal  finances  (2)  trading  securities  (trading platforms) and (3) automating financial services (robotization).Fintechs providing tools that help individuals or companies manage their finances support customers for instance in managing their financial cash flows and in optimizing their spending structure. They also offer financial accounting solutions for SMEs but also bigger companies. One example of this category is the app \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpendee\\xe2\\x80\\x9d developed by the Czech firm CLEEVIO which connects the user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mobile phone with the customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bank account and downloads transactions sorting them into different categories. It helps the customer track their expenses by amount and by location. Moreover users may define different wallets and share these with other people.  Such  analytical  features  are  usually  not  offered  by  traditional  banks  a number of which have however already introduced at least some analytical features \\xe2\\x80\\x93 mostly in their online banking applications. Helping improve customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 insights into  their  personal  finances  income  and  expenses  structure  is  likely  to  foster  financial education.Securities trading is traditionally associated with high ancillary expenses like transactionbased trading fees and relatively high deposit fees. For securities trading to be economically viable large volumes are a prerequisite. Consequently many people are excluded from securities trading. Yet fintechs operating in this business area offer online trading platforms with very low or no deposit fees and very low transactions costs. Hence lower trading volumes make economic sense too. As a rule  the  customer  interacts  solely  with  the  trading  platform  via  the  Internet. Since these fintechs do not offer persontoperson or investment advisory services their services cost less than those of traditional banks. On the one hand online trading platforms lower the entry barriers for private customers and open new  investment possibilities for them given the reduced transaction costs. On the other hand not all private customers may be fully aware of the risk of suffering losses when investing in financial market securities. Moreover money already transferred to the platform but not yet invested may not be covered by a deposit insurance scheme and may be lost should the platform become insolvent.Finally one large business area fintechs are active in is robotization. Services offered  in  this  area  are  very  often  connected  to  the  other  two  business  areas  discussed above. One example of a connection with personal finances is the automation of invoice payments with a program automatically paying invoices on time. Another example is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSuperFaktura\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a Slovak program for automating the creation 46  OESTERREICHISCHE NATIONALBANK\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEEof  invoices. Robotization is also very popular when it comes to wealth management. Socalled roboadvisors are programs that invest money automatically based on  mathematical  logarithms.  These  automated  investments  may  be  straightforward e.g. the roboadvisor always makes deposits at the bank with the highest deposit rate up to the deposit insurance threshold amount. But they may also be much more complex. For instance roboadvisors may base their portfolio investment strategy on several customerrelated imputations and decide on the optimal  investment strategy based on these imputations coupled with a mathematical algorithm. Therefore roboadvisors have the potential to lower the search costs for personal customers e.g. by finding the best rate and taking a decision on the best investment strategy. Furthermore financial advice based on mathematical algorithms may be neutral compared with financial advice from humans. On the flip side personal customers might not be fully aware of how their inputs translate into investment decisions by roboadvisors which could lead to undesired investments (see also Philippon 2016). Moreover if large volumes are invested and investment decisions are based on the same mathematical algorithms herding behavior could be amplified on financial markets. Last but not least customer service is being robotized. As a case in point the Romanian lender Banca Transilvania has introduced \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLivia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to communicate with customers on Facebook and Skype.2.2  PaymentsFintechs  providing  innovative  forms  of  electronic  payments  mostly  do  so  via emoney which is transferred via the Internet or via mobile phones. At the same time some fintechs offer services (e.g. instant payments) that make \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional\\xe2\\x80\\x9d forms of electronic payments more efficient.While the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional\\xe2\\x80\\x9d forms of electronic payments (debit card credit card credit transfer and direct debit) are linked to a bank account the more innovative solutions work without a bank account but have another prerequisite a mobile phone or Internet access. Only cash continues to be the payment method universally available without any technical prerequisites.Companies offering innovative payment services have the potential for enhancing financial inclusion in many countries where bank accounts are not as common as in advanced economies. Moreover many of these companies offer their services free of cost or at very low cost. Electronic payments may also help reduce corruption and the shadow economy because of their traceability (see Goel and Mehrotra 2012). Yet some of these innovative payment methods may also be used for illegal purposes because of their anonymity.8 At least in the EU the PSD 1 and the revised PSD 2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the latter has to be transposed into national law by each Member State by January 13 2018 at the  latest \\xe2\\x80\\x93 already regulate most fintech companies operating in the area of payment services.  It  is  worth  mentioning  that  innovative  electronic  payment  services  not linked  to  a  bank  account  are  offered  not  only  by  small  fintech  startups  but  increasingly also by large wellestablished commercial banks. One example is the biggest  bank  in  Croatia  Zagreba\\xcb\\x87cka  banka  which  has  been  selected  by  EMEA 8   For  virtual  currencies  the  EBA  considers  this  a  major  risk  (European  Banking  Authority  2014)  and  the  EU  perceives this as a dominant feature of virtual currencies so that they have already been taken into account in the AntiMoney Laundering Directive (Directive (EU) 2015/849).FOCUS ON EUROPEAN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Q3/17  47\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEE Finance as the most innovative bank in CESEE.

The bars reflect the number of electronic transactions broken down by payment method per inhabitant and year (lefthand scale) and the diamonds indicate the share of the adult population that uses electronic payments (righthand scale).Most popular electronic payment methods credit transfers and card payments1Number of electronic payment transactions per inhabitant per year (as at 2015)Use of electronic payments % of respondents aged 15+ (as at 2011)100450Chart 3400350300250200150100500US UK DE ATEE CZ LVSI HROther% of respondents using electronic payments (righthand scale)EmoneyChecks LTSKDirect debitsPL HU RU BG RO ALCredit transfers9080706050403020100CN INCard paymentsSource BIS ECB Bank of Albania Global Findex Database.1 Number of cash payment transactions not available.For the CESEE countries the importance of electronic payments correlates positively with the possession of a bank account (as shown in chart 1). Electronic payments are most popular in Estonia the Czech Republic Latvia and Slovenia and least used in Albania Romania and Bulgaria. Credit transfers and card payments (either by debit or by credit card) are the most common electronic payment methods while checks are virtually nonexistent in Europe. At present emoney is not used very widely. Looking to the righthand scale of chart 3 we see that in most countries less than half of the respondents indicated that they have already made electronic payments. Estonian respondents are in the lead in this respect. According to the pattern evident in chart 3 the technology while being in principle available in the CESEE countries is only used by a small fraction of the population. Chart 4 shows the relationship between the structural conditions and actual usage of the structures available for electronic payments. The left panel depicts Internet usage in general and usage of the Internet to pay bills. The right panel shows access to a mobile phone or the Internet at home and usage of an account to make transactions over a mobile phone.48  OESTERREICHISCHE NATIONALBANK\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEEChart 4Relationship between structural conditions and actual usage of electronic paymentsCountries with high Internet usage also have higher shares of Internet purchases% of respondents using the Internet to pay for purchases (as at 2014)Payments with mobile phones are still very often performed via an account at a bank/\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institution% of respondents using an account to make transactionsvia a mobile phone (as at 2014)16706050403020100UA4050BGROAL60EELVCZSKSILTHURUPLHRRSBA14121086420LTRSBGUAROBARULVAL708090100889092949698100% of individuals using the Internet (as at 2015)% of respondents having access to a mobile phone or Internet at home (as at 2014)Source International Telecommunication Union Global Findex Database.The left panel shows clearly that the higher the share of Internet users in general the higher the share of individuals using the Internet to pay bills or buy things. At the same time mobile payments are not yet widespread. The data refer to mobile payments that are performed using an account at a bank or other financial institution. The  Global  Findex  Database  also  gives  us  information  on  the  usage  of  mobile phones to pay bills where no account is involved. Note however that the data stem from the year 2011 and that the fraction of respondents answering that they used their mobile phone to pay bills is below 3% in almost all CESEE countries. The only exception is Albania where onefifth of respondents answered in the  affirmative. It is worth mentioning that MPesa has been active also in Albania (since 2015) and in Romania (since 2014). To sum up there is a group of countries in the CESEE region where electronic payments are widely used namely Estonia the Czech Republic Latvia and Slovenia. Mobile payments are exceptionally popular in Albania. Notably in many Southeastern European countries electronic payments play only a minor role. 2.3  FinancingFintechs offer financing in the form of equity and/or debt to individuals and companies  (mostly  SMEs).  Usually  financing  is  provided  via  a  platform  matching  investors and lenders. In most cases the fintech company does not lend/finance on its own and does not take on the risk of the loan or investment. Financing activities may be divided into equity/equitylike9 financing (crowdfunding) and debt financing (P2P lending). Such business models are also often referred to as marketplace lending because funds are provided by peers or the crowd and not by a single institution.9   Equitylike means that some crowdfunding platforms offer participation via deeply subordinated debt or convertible instruments instead of genuine participation in equity.FOCUS ON EUROPEAN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Q3/17  49\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEECrowdfunding can be broken down further into profit and nonprofitoriented forms as the money raised could either be (1) a donation or (2) an investment. In the latter case the funding might involve interest payments. Repayment (and if applicable interest payments) may take the form of a payment in kind (e.g. bread when a bakery is financed). Profitoriented crowdfunding platforms finance virtually only SMEs. By contrast the majority of P2P lending platforms tend to be specialized in consumer loans. In the CESEE region P2P lending is much more popular than crowdfunding (see chart 5). There is a group of countries \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the Czech Republic Estonia Russia Lithuania and Poland \\xe2\\x80\\x93 where several (domestic) P2P lending platforms are active. Some of them also operate in more than one CESEE country (see the list in the annex for details). In addition to the number of platforms shown in chart 5 foreign platforms (crowdfunding and P2P lending) are active in several CESEE countries. Cases  in  point  are  Indiegogo  and  Kickstarter.  No  evidence  for  activities  of  any  (domestic or foreign) platforms was found in Albania Bosnia and Herzegovina Hungary Serbia and Slovenia.Several funding platforms are already active in some CESEE countries1Number of platforms10Chart 527269876543210765321CZEERULTP2P platformsPLROCrowdfunding platformsSK2HR1LVTo the author's knowledge no domestic P2P or crowdfunding platforms operate in these countries.11BGUAALBAHURSSISource Author\\xe2\\x80\\x99s compilation.1 This chart only shows domestically established platforms that to the author\\xe2\\x80\\x98s knowledge had active users at the time this study was compiled. Foreign platforms operating in some of the countries are excluded. For a list of all platforms see the annex.In the CESEE region most P2P lending platforms intermediate their loans in local  currency  but  one  platform  extends  loans  in  foreign  currency  e.g.  Swiss francs. According to our knowledge investors in P2P lending platforms in this region could be natural and legal persons or specialized companies that establish trusts/funds and invest exclusively in loans provided via P2P lending platforms. On top of the variations already mentioned the business model of P2P lending platforms may be very different (see also charts 1 to 3 in the box). 50  OESTERREICHISCHE NATIONALBANK\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEEThe Czech Republic Estonia and Lithuania have already started to regulate P2P lending platforms. In the Czech Republic they are supervised as small payment institutions  and  are  hence  restricted  in  terms  of  size  (the  average  annual  total amount of payment transactions must not exceed EUR 3 million per month) and geographic  reach  (they  are  only  allowed  to  provide  their  services  in  the  Czech  Republic). In Estonia the Creditors and Credit Intermediaries Act was introduced in March 2015. This act also covers activities of P2P lenders and makes it necessary for them to be licensed as credit intermediaries or creditors. Lithuania in turn considering  P2P  lenders  to  be  public  consumer  lenders  or  intermediaries  has tightened regulatory requirements as of February 2016. Note however that new regulations were also introduced to regulate other nonbank lenders (e.g. payday lenders) which had mushroomed in the Czech Republic Estonia and Lithuania. In Lithuania for example the lending volume of nonbank lenders well exceeds that of P2P lenders (EUR 225 million vs. EUR 4.6 million as of July 2016) (Lietuvos bankas 2016)10.Chart  6  compares  the  gross  lending  volume  of  P2P  lending  platforms  since their start of business.

However three CESEE platforms have already achieved a lending volume of over EUR 100 million namely Twino PrivatBank and Mintos. The other platforms operating in CESEE pale in comparison with Twino which boasts a lending volume of EUR 350 million. It is interesting to note that the companies Twino and Mintos work together with (several) loan originators. Also noteworthy is that PrivatBank which was nationalized in December 2016 has stopped its P2P 10  Lietuvos bankas does not seem to consider the company Mintos to be a P2P lender.FOCUS ON EUROPEAN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Q3/17  51\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEElending activities. The National Bank of Ukraine has announced that it would stop PrivatBank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s P2P lending activities and bring the P2P loans back onto the balance sheet of PrivatBank. Comparing  the  lending  volumes  of  P2P  platforms  with  the  amount  of  total outstanding loans in the respective countries does not make much sense for two reasons. First P2P lenders usually only disclose the overall amount they have lent over the lifetime of a given platform and not the currently outstanding loan volume. Second some P2P lenders are active in more than one country (unless restricted by regulatory requirements) and do not provide information on the lending volume in each country. One approach to get an idea of the relevance of P2P lending platforms in the consumer loan market is to compare the average yearly new consumer loan volumes since the establishment of the respective P2P lending platforms with the lending volumes indicated by the P2P platforms. This calculation results in a maximum amount as P2P lenders are also active in SME lending and some of them do business in more than one country. Accordingly P2P lending platforms make up onequarter of  average new consumer loans in Latvia (Mintos) and Lithuania (Twino). These figures clearly have an upward bias given that these platforms which are incorporated in a small country are also active in several other larger markets (Mintos e.g. in the Czech Republic and Poland; Twino in the Czech Republic Russia and Poland). In contrast the lending volumes of Kokos the biggest P2P lender in Poland account for only 0.02% of average yearly new consumer loans. But also in smaller countries of the region (the Czech Republic and Slovakia) loans by P2P lenders11 amount to no more than 0.01% of average yearly new consumer loans. Finally we can compare these  data  with  lending  volumes  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  U.K.  has  a  P2P  Finance Association which publishes lending volumes for almost the entire P2P lending industry. In the U.K. P2P lenders provided GBP 3 billion in 2016 which equals 10% of new consumer loans extended in 2016. This figure too is biased upward as many U.K.based P2P lenders likewise do business in other countries and extend also loans other than consumer loans.Box Business models of P2P lending platforms in CESEEBusiness models of P2P lending platforms may vary greatly. We identified the following three types in the CESEE countries described in more detail in charts 1 to 41 below (1) classical P2P lending (2) P2P lending platform with one or more credit originators and P2P lending  platforms as a subsidiary of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctraditional bank\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and (3) crowdvouching.Chart 1Classical P2P lending business modelInvestorsP2Plending platformBorrower1  Arrows in charts 1 to 3 indicate the direction of the cash flow.

In chart 10 arrows may refer to the cash flow guarantee or fee payments as indicated next to each arrow.52  OESTERREICHISCHE NATIONALBANK\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEEInvestors (i.e. natural or legal persons) invest in loans to borrowers that have posted a request for a loan via the P2P lending platform. In this case the role of the P2P lending platform only consists in bringing together investors and borrowers. The platform usually earns fees from the borrower and/or investor. Many P2P lending platforms use business models which are variations of this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclassical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d P2P lending model as is shown in charts 2 to 4. The first variation of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclassical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d P2P lending business model is that borrowers do not P2P lending platforms with one or many credit originatorsP2P lending platform with one credit originatorChart 2InvestorsP2Plending platform(subsidiary of credit originator)CreditoriginatorBorrowerP2P lending platform with many credit originatorsInvestorsP2Plending platformCreditoriginatorsBorroweron their own initiative request credit via the P2P lending platform but rather a credit originator grants the loan. The P2P lending platform may work together with one credit originator that could also be the parent company or with many credit originators that collaborate with the P2P lending platform on a contractual basis. This business model works as follows The credit originator granting a loan also finances the loan and the credit risk is first borne by the originator. In a second step the P2P lending platform offers these loans on the Internet. Once an investor decides to invest in a loan the said loan is transferred to the investor via a (partial) assignment. The transfer of loans to an investor could also be organized via securitization. In many cases the risk of the loan is also transferred to the investor. Consequently the loan is derecognized from the balance sheet of the credit originator. Finally the cash proceedings of the sale of the loan are forwarded to the credit originator. Thus refunded the credit originator may use the funds to grant new loans.Traditional bank with P2P lending platform as subsidiaryLicensed bankNonbank subsidiary P2P lendingInvestorsChart 3BorrowerFOCUS ON EUROPEAN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Q3/17  53\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEEChart 3 shows another variation of this business model where a licensed bank establishes a P2P lending subsidiary that is not a bank. This platform then acts like a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclassical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d P2P lending platform. The parent bank benefits from this in that it is able to grant loans and earn fees without permanently taking the risk of the loan on its own balance sheet which eventually relieves regulatory capital pressure. However this business model was observed only once in the CESEE region \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at PrivatBank in Ukraine. With PrivatBank having been nationalized the National Bank of Ukraine announced to stop P2P lending at PrivatBank.Crowdvouching the final variation of P2P lending as illustrated in chart 4 does not involve Chart 4CrowdvouchingCrowdvouching platform(puts credit applications onto the platform)LenderGuaranteeLoanGuarantorsFeeBorrowerfunding by peers. First the crowdvouching platform puts the loan application on the platform website. Potential guarantors receive information (e.g. photo ID and credit history) from each loan applicant on their mobile phone app. With a mere swipe they may then decide if they grant a guarantee to a particular applicant or not. For a loan application to be accepted by the crowdvouching platform many positive decisions by potential guarantors are necessary. Upon acceptance of the application the lender (which could also be a bank) grants the loan and transfers the agreed amount of funds to the borrower. The potential guarantors become actual guarantors for this loan and receive fees from the borrower. If the borrower defaults on the loan the guarantee takes effect and the guarantors have to pay the open balance of the loan to the lender. This business model is offered by a Russian platform called Suretly. The company is still in the startup phase but already operates legal entities in Russia  Kazakhstan and the U.S.A.P2P lending and crowdfunding can lead to positive effects but also involves a number of risks. On the positive side P2P lending is likely to enhance access to finance  for  retail  and  SME  customers  catering  to  an  otherwise  unattended  segment of credit demand. A study on the German P2P lending market found that P2P lenders indeed serve a slice of the consumer credit market which is neglected by banks namely highrisk and smallsized loans (de Roure et al. 2016). Hence crowdfunding may increase access to equity financing for SMEs providing more risk capital for SMEs especially startups.On the downside there are also a number of risks associated with marketplace lenders. The main feature of P2P lending is that the risk of the credit is not borne by the platform itself but by the investors. This is very different from the traditional banking business model where the bank takes deposits and performs risk and term transformations. In this case the risk of the depositor is not directly dependent on the risk of the loan a bank grants to a borrower. On the other hand when money is deposited at a bank the depositor cannot influence in which assets (i.e. loans 54  OESTERREICHISCHE NATIONALBANK\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEEsecurities) the bank invests the money. This stands in contrast to P2P lending as well as crowdfunding there the investor decides who or what project will be financed.When it comes to P2P lending the investor is not protected by a deposit insurance scheme. Quite the contrary the investor usually bears the full credit risk and is subject to asymmetrical information because the lender is fully dependent on the information provided by the borrower and normally does not have the possibility of performing any additional due diligence. Moreover investors will face undiversified credit risk if they do not actively reduce it by financing different loans with different risk profiles. As mentioned above most P2P lenders grant unsecured consumer loans  which  usually  suffer  from  high  default  rates.  Such  losses  will  have  to  be borne by the investors i.e. natural or legal persons. A study performed with data of Lending Club (the biggest P2P lending platform in the U.S.A.) shows that the higher interest rates charged on highrisk borrowers are not enough to compensate for the higher probability of default (Emekter et al. 2015). In addition in most countries P2P lenders are not subject to any special regulatory requirements beyond the normal legal requirements for doing business. When it comes to crowdfunding investors are susceptible to special risks not yet mentioned above. Crowdfunding platforms enable investors to invest in SMEs mostly startups. The participating interest takes the form of equity or equitylike investments with all the risk usually inherent in an equity investment for investors. However it is safe to assume that investments in startups bear a higher risk of  default than equity investments in wellestablished companies. Hence it is of utmost importance with respect to crowdfunding that investors are aware of the highrisk nature of this type of investment and of the fact that they stand to lose their entire investment.3  Summary and concluding remarksIn recent years the development of financial technology in the banking sector got a  new  twist  with  the  emergence  of  numerous  small  startups  called  fintechs. Chances  are that some of these new technologies will make parts of the banking  business more efficient while fintech companies may have the potential to disrupt the traditional  banking sector if they manage to grow to a certain size. Even though most of the new  financial technologies are still being used only on a small scale traditional banks have taken note of this  development and have started to either cooperate with fintechs or create  innovative financial products on their own. Fintechs  are  usually  specialized  i.e.  they  tend  to  offer  only  one  financial  product e.g. payments. In contrast traditional banks normally offer the full range of  financial  products  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  from  payments  to  loans  and  financial  advisory  services. Moreover  fintechs mostly do not provide services that require a banking license. Regulators  are  however  already  paying  attention  to  fintechs  by  introducing  special  legislation  or  regulatory  sandboxes  to  better  understand  these  new  technologies. This study only revolves around fintechs that are active in three business areas (1) financial services (analysis of personal finances trading platforms and robotization) (2) payments (traditional forms of electronic payments i.e. debit and credit card credit transfer and direct debits and innovative forms of electronic payments i.e. emoney P2P payments) and (3) financing i.e. crowdfunding and P2P lending which is also called marketplace lending. FOCUS ON EUROPEAN ECONOMIC INTEGRATION Q3/17  55\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEEFinancial services is a business area where many fintech startups are operating and where traditional banks have already started to cooperate with fintechs or to develop their own innovative financial services. For the CESEE region we find some activity in this area. However not enough meaningful data are available to give a complete picture of this area.With regard to payments we differentiate between traditional and innovative payment  methods.  The  main  innovative  feature  of  emoney  (payments  that  are  often effected via a mobile phone or the Internet) is that the customer does not necessarily need a bank account to make payments. With bank account penetration still  low  in  some  CESEE  countries  the  adoption  of  mobile  phone  payments  or  payment via the Internet might boost financial inclusion in the region. As a rule of thumb traditional payment methods are available from traditional banks whereas innovative payment methods are offered mostly by fintechs. There are however exceptions to this rule in some CESEE countries (e.g. Croatia) traditional banks have incubated the most innovative forms of payment. Yet data from the Global Findex Survey show that mobile payments are not yet widespread in the CESEE region or in other European countries. The fintech business area of financing is quite vibrant in the CESEE region with P2P lending being far more common than crowdfunding. In the Czech Republic Estonia Russia Lithuania and Poland a number of platforms are active. The business models of P2P lenders in the CESEE region may differ significantly from the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclassical\\xe2\\x80\\x9d P2P platforms. The share of loans granted by P2P lending platforms and companies financed via crowdfunding is still very small in comparison with the total consumer loan market. P2P lending may enhance access to finance for retail and SME customers catering to an otherwise unattended segment of loan  demand. On the other hand P2P lending entails a number of risks. First the total credit risk is borne by the investor and remains undiversified as long as the investor does not actively reduce it by financing different loans with different risk profiles. Moreover the investor is subject to asymmetrical information because the lender is fully dependent on the information provided by the borrower and normally has to make do with the due diligence provided by the platform.In light of this especially P2P lending could pose significant risks to customers and to financial stability if it reaches critical mass. In some countries (namely the Czech Republic Estonia and Lithuania) regulators have already started to introduce special regulatory requirements for these platforms (usually classified as \\xe2\\x80\\x9csmall payment service providers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). With regard to P2P lending the following recommendations might be worth considering enhancing transparency and reducing asymmetrical information between the borrower and the lender by requiring the disclosure of certain figures (e.g. lending volume or loans defaulted) and details with regard to the P2P lending platform (e.g. disclosure of how the ratings are calculated). Moreover the most recent financial crisis has shown that structures where the originator/intermediary of a loan does not bear at least part of the credit risk lead to undesired moral hazard effects. Therefore a requirement that the originator or P2P lending platform has to retain at least part of the credit risk would probably reduce this moral hazard effect.To sum up the topic of fintechs is currently being discussed around the globe but to date little attention has been paid to the CESEE region. This paper is meant to close this gap by taking stock of fintech activities in CESEE. Adoption of new 56  OESTERREICHISCHE NATIONALBANK\\x0cFintechs and their emergence in banking services in CESEEtechnology is very heterogeneous across the CESEE countries. Interestingly some of them seem to have a more active fintech scene in some areas (e.g. P2P lending) than many of their western neighbors.ReferencesDeloitte. 2016.  FinTech in CEE.
