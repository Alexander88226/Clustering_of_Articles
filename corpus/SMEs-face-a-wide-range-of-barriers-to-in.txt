They also pursue a wide   range of innovation activities and consequently face   different barriers to innovation.     Enterprises that do not pursue pioneer strategies face   barriers to innovation particularly often. Different barriers   to innovation predominate in different SME groups  with   financing problems affecting primarily small and young   SMEs and businesses pursuing growth strategies.   Bureaucratic obstacles  in turn  mainly affect companies in   the construction industry. For a further group of SMEs    organisational and skills problems in combination with   financing difficulties and high market risk are the most   widespread barriers to innovation. These are often   companies in traditional ‘lowtech’ sectors  craft industries   and businesses with a low level of profitability. The two   groups mentioned last are also characterised by the fact   that they usually bring forth incremental innovations.     The heterogeneity of the SME sector and the diversity of   obstacles to innovation suggest that innovation support for   SMEs should be broadbased as well and comprise both   financial and nonfinancial support. It is particularly in   enterprises whose innovations are not based on their own   R&D  but emerge primarily from the normal work process   and through interaction with customers and suppliers that   the availability of skilled workers  organisational problems   and lack of technological expertise constitute key   obstacles to developing innovations. Major building blocks   that promote innovation include measures aimed at   training and upskilling staff  support for the development of   innovation management systems  and the transfer of   scientifictechnical knowledge – in addition to continuous   improvements to the financing situation.     Small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) are regarded as   guarantors of growth and employment. SMEs’ innovation   activity – a key source of competitiveness – has declined in   the past years  however. The proportion of innovators among   SMEs (companies with a turnover of up to EUR 500 million)     fell from 43 % between 2004 and 2006 to 29 % between 2012   and 2014.1 The share of innovation expenditure by enter  prises with fewer than 500 employees also dropped from   42 % in 1995 to 22 % in 2014.2     SMEs’ innovation activity has developed in different ways.   The proportion of innovators remained comparatively steady   in the R&D intensive manufacturing sector (e.g. engineering    electronics  pharmaceuticals) over the past ten years. But   innovation momentum has declined particularly among the   small enterprises and companies in the construction and   services sector and in the less R&Doriented industries of the   manufacturing sector. In other words  innovators have been   lost precisely in those segments that conduct R&D more   rarely and bring forth innovations at irregular intervals.     This development itself indicates that  contrary to what is   often assumed  SMEs are anything but a homogeneous   group. Besides their size and the branch of industry to which   they belong  SMEs differ substantially particularly in the focus   of their innovation activities. For example  just under two   fifths of innovators conduct R&D activities of their own   occasionally or continuously. That also means that around   three fifths conduct no R&D at all. Their innovation strategies   and goals also differ. Two thirds use their innovations to   develop individual customer solutions. One fourth of them   aim to be the technological leaders in their respective   industry. Equally as many SMEs state that they merely   respond to their competitors’ innovations.3     It stands to reason that SMEs include diverse types of   innovators that also face barriers to innovation of different   intensity. The Institute for Small Business Economics at the   University of Göttingen (ifh Göttingen) and KfW Research   have therefore examined together what obstacles hamper   the innovation activity of various groups of SMEs (see Box 2   for methodology).4 The analysis focused on the less R&D  active segments of the SME sector  where the innovative   output has fallen most sharply since the middle of the last   decade. Digitalisation was addressed in a separate study.   The analysis allows the SME sector to be classified into four   typical groups.

This   cluster includes roughly 24 % (extrapolated) of the surveyed   SMEs. These are mainly larger and older enterprises. With   an average of 72 employees  they are significantly bigger   than the enterprises in the other clusters (Table 1).     The average company age is also the highest  at 40.6 years.   Importantly  the enterprises in this cluster are characterised   by a high profit margin. These characteristics should explain   why barriers to innovation affect them less than average.   Furthermore  this cluster has more R&Dintensive   manufacturing and knowledgebased service enterprises   (Figure 1).

As was to be expected from their frequent R&D activity    enterprises whose investment goals are more often explicitly   stated as innovation and R&D are concentrated in the first   cluster (Figure 3). Companies in this cluster also aim for   pioneer roles in modern technologies  new products and   services more frequently than others. This confirms that   enterprises in this first cluster can be allocated to the   ‘science  technology and innovation (STI)’ mode (Box 1).

Economic   literature therefore distinguishes between two different   modes of bringing forth innovations.     The first mode is based on conducting R&D. Innovations   primarily emerge in the framework of systematic and for  malised work by inhouse R&D departments. This activity   generates new scientifictechnical knowledge. This new   knowledge forms the basis for innovations created by the   respective enterprise. Partnerships with research facilities   also contribute to innovations. This R&Dintensive mode   falls under the label ‘science  technology and innovation   (STI) mode’.6     In contrast  the second mode is based on experience  based skills acquired through ‘learning by doing  using   and interacting’ (DUI mode). In generating innovations    informal processes of learning and understanding domi  nate here given the key importance of applicationrelated   skills. Innovations result from the normal production pro  cess or in close interaction with customers and suppliers.   The ability to bring forth innovations therefore is strongly   based on applicationrelated and employeebased experi  ential knowledge acquired over the years.      Innovations that emerge in this manner are often   incremental and very specific problem solutions. They are   frequently tailored to specific needs in the course of   gradual optimisations.     These two modes obviously represent theoretical   extremes. In practice  enterprises must be capable of   combining various forms of learning and knowledge in   order to successfully generate innovations.     The STI mode is relatively easy to capture by asking   whether the enterprise conducted R&D of its own. This is   much more challenging for the knowledge component   “applicationrelated  employeebased experiential   knowledge”. To obtain answers the survey examined   whether a company primarily conducted activities that can   be attributed to the skilled crafts. This seems appropriate   because the crafts sector can be expected to be domi  nated by an experiencebased learning and innovation   mode.7 It is precisely the masterapprentice learning   relationship that is typical of the skilled crafts  in which the   apprentice develops particular skills under a guided   learningbydoing approach  which is regarded as a   showcase example of how experiential knowledge is   transferred.8     SMEs facing barriers to innovation in the areas of   organisation and skills   Features of cluster 2  SMEs facing barriers to innovation in the areas of   organisation and skills     Older companies   Traditional ‘lowtech’ sectors  other manufacturing (e.g.   food industry  manufacture of metal products  rubber and   synthetic products)  construction   Crafts enterprises   Low profitability   Investment goals  rationalisation and cost reduction   Innovation goals  incremental innovations        For enterprises in cluster 2 the main barriers to innovation   activity are at the level of organisation and skills. These   include lack of technological expertise  lack of relevant   market information and a shortage of skilled workers.   Financing difficulties and market risk also constitute   obstacles to innovation in this cluster. An extrapolated 17 %   of SMEs are in this group.     This group of companies has the lowest profit margin (2.2 %)   which  among other reasons  is probably a consequence of   problems in the area of organisation and skills. It can be   assumed that these internal difficulties adversely affect   business success  which probably gives rise to their financing   difficulties as well.     The businesses in this cluster are slightly older than the   sample average and are often found in less R&Dintensive   manufacturing and more often in construction (Figure 1).     Focus on Economics     Problems with organisation and skills are therefore   widespread particularly in the sectors that comprise a large   number of rather more traditional industries.

Businesses in this cluster seek to   evade such pressure through incremental innovation activity.   Consequently  their most important innovation strategies   consist in specialisation  customerspecific solutions and   flexibilisation of products and services.     Cluster 2 also includes a comparatively high number of   SMEs that primarily operate in the skilled crafts sector   (Figure 2). Innovations here often result from the normal work   process and through interaction with customers and   suppliers. Applicationrelated and employeebased   experiential knowledge is likely to be their most common   source of innovation. The high importance of problems in the   areas of organisation and skills in this cluster underscores   the particular learning and knowledge conditions under which   innovations are brought forth here (Box 1).

These businesses represent the   biggest group  at 37 %. Small and young businesses tend to   be more abundant in this cluster. This finding impressively   underscores the structural disadvantages these companies   face in financing innovations. Since young and small   businesses per se constitute a higher risk9 and often request   low amounts from the point of view of potential lenders    obtaining external financing for innovations is a particular   challenge for these enterprises.     Businesses in this cluster also tend to achieve low profit   margins. This  too  reduces their ability to finance innovations   from internal or external funds. Financing problems are   therefore most common in this group.     In contrast  cluster 3 is not marked by any single innovation   strategy or individual  specific targets. However  investments   undertaken by these enterprises are directed strongly at   increasing turnover and expanding (and renewing) their   product range. This is consistent with the fact that the   enterprises in this cluster are small and young businesses.   Investments aimed at increasing turnover and introducing   new product lines are probably an expression of a drive   towards growth  which is often hampered by financing   problems in this cluster.

They include obstacles that   originate in legislation  legal requirements and standards  as   well as lengthy administrative and approval procedures. The   affected businesses tend to be older and their size corres  ponds with the sample average. This cluster mainly includes   construction firms. Bureaucratic obstacles are no surprise   here as construction activity in particular is subject to a strict   legal and regulatory framework.     Similarities exist between clusters 2 and 4 with respect to   investment and innovation targets. Cost reductions and   rationalisation are important investment goals for these   enterprises as well. Incremental innovation activity is also   prevalent in this cluster. Specialisation  customerspecific   solutions and flexibilisation of products and services are the   most important innovation strategies.

This may   seem surprising at first glance because enterprises in this   cluster also perceive the legal and regulatory framework as a   major obstacle. However  it has to be noted that legal   requirements may also provide incentives for innovation.   Environmental regulations that encourage the development   of ecologically safe products and processes are one   example.     Conclusion   The above analysis examined the innovation obstacles faced   by SMEs. The focus was on SME segments not   characterised by a pronounced R&D orientation. The   analysis shows that enterprises that do not pursue any   pioneer strategies are affected particularly often by obstacles   to innovation. In line with the broad diversity of the SME   sector  various innovation obstacles exist in a variety of   constellations. Thus  financing problems primarily affect small   and young enterprises and companies pursuing growth   strategies. The next two groups of businesses  in turn  are   characterised by incremental innovations. Bureaucratic   obstacles to innovation are particularly significant for   construction enterprises. A further group which includes   businesses from traditional ‘lowtech’ segments and the     skilled crafts sector is affected primarily by problems at the   level of organisation and skills combined with financing   problems and market risk.     Given the heterogeneity of the SME sector and the diversity   of obstacles to innovation  innovation support for SMEs must   be broadbased as well and comprise both financial and non  financial support. This allows different support offerings to   address the main innovation obstacles faced by various SME   groups (Table 2). Obstacles in the area of organisation and   skills play an important role particularly in enterprises whose   innovative output is based on applicationrelated and   employeebased experiential knowledge. The demographic   trend is likely to further exacerbate the skills shortage.   Measures aimed at mobilising  training and upskilling workers   are therefore very useful. In addition  the competencerelated   obstacles demonstrate that more traditional SMEdominated   segments in particular need support in incorporating external   scientifictechnical knowledge.     Moreover  innovative SMEs can compensate the lack of in  house R&D to a certain degree by structuring their learning   and innovation processes more systematically.10 Support in   implementing an adequate  employeeoriented innovation   management system should therefore be another important   approach to removing skillsrelated barriers to innovation. ■     Table 2  Approaches to promoting innovation in less R&Dactive segments of the SME sector and maintarget   enterprises           Reducing financing obstacles     Age of company   Size of enterprise     Economic sectors     Skilled crafts     Strategic orientation          Young enterprises   Small enterprises   Less research and   knowledgeintensive   segments of the   manufacturing and services   sector     Enterprises with growth   strategies     Reducing obstacles in the area of   organisation and skills (e.g. skills   shortages  transfer of scientific and   technical knowledge  innovation   management)   Older enterprises         Reducing bureaucratic   barriers     Older enterprises     Enterprises from traditional low  tech segments     Construction     Crafts enterprises     Incremental innovators     Incremental innovators     Page 5     KfW Research     Box 2  Dataset and methodology   The analysis is based on the 11th survey wave of the KfW   SME Panel. This survey explored the significance of ten   different innovation obstacles on a fivepoint scale for the   period 2008–2010. The 2011 survey also included a range   of additional information that permitted a more indepth   classification of innovation obstacles in the specific context   of the surveyed businesses. The survey included   enterprises with fewer than 500 employees that introduced   product or process innovations within the enterprise from   2008 to 2010. The survey was also limited to enterprises in   which specific obstacles to innovation activity led to longer   implementation periods  reduced scope or aborted   innovation projects  or in which innovative ideas did not   even reach the implementation phase.     In a first step the ten surveyed barriers to innovation were   combined into closely correlated clusters of variables with   the aid of a factor analysis. The factor analysis arrived at   the conclusion that the surveyed barriers to innovation can   be clustered into four barrier factors (Table A1). Factor 1   clusters the barriers to innovation into “prohibitively high   innovation costs” and internal or external funding   difficulties.     The generic term “funding problems” was therefore   selected for the first barrier factor. Factor 2 (“problems in   the areas of organisation and skills”) combines   competencerelated obstacles  organisational problems    lack of technological expertise  lack of relevant market   information  and a shortage of skilled workers. Factor 3   (“bureaucratic barriers”) comprises barriers to innovation   due to legislation  legal requirements and standards as well   as lengthy administrative and approval procedures. Finally    factor 4 (“market risk”) refers to the market environment of   innovative SMEs. Here  high innovation costs are   associated with high commercial risk and lack of relevant   market information. The proportion of variance in the   sample explained by the factor analysis was 69.7 %.     In a second step  a cluster analysis was conducted to   identify the relevance of these clusters of barriers    particularly in less R&Dactive segments of the SME   sector. The estimated factor values of the four clustered   barrier factors as well as the information on the enterprises’   R&D activity were used as cluster variables. The cluster   analysis was based on the information provided by 1 663   enterprises. A classification into four groups of SMEs can   be made (Table A2).
