The cashless system is not just anecessity but also a need of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s order. Over the past few years efforts to drivefinancial inclusion in India have delivered mixed results. Access to bank accountshas increased dramatically driven by a strong policy and regulatory push. Howeverthe usage of these accounts and the uptake of formal financial services beyond savingsaccounts has remained exceptionally difficult. The recent initiatives by the Governmentaround  demonetization  and  the  move  to  cashless  transactions  will  further  driveinnovation and new entrants into the Industry. The amendments to the banking actclearly demonstrate the Government RBI and Banking institutions intent to ensurestable growth of the economy by ensuring a healthy BFSI. Building Trust within theindustry  will  be  paramount  to  India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  further  growth.  Newer  technologies  posedifferent challenges to the banks and regulators with security being a key concern.With cyberfrauds on the rise the regulators and the bankers would have to cometogether to ensure control mechanisms are in place. A strong push from the Governmentof India has given the nonbanking population easy access to financial products.Payment organizations have demonstrated the advantages of mobileled solutionsand the traditional banking organizations are now trying to make inroads into ruralIndia by launching innovative mobilebased banking solutions. With support fromthe government large technology companies are using new ways of reaching out tothe rural masses and educate them about the various financial products thus ensuringthat their hardearned income is rightly invested.Keywords  Financial  Transactions  Digital  Apps  Rural  Population  JELClassifications GINTRODUCTIONWith  the  progress  of  the  Indian  economy  especially  when  the  focus  is  on  theachievement of sustainable development there must be an attempt to include the* Assistant  Professor  University  of  Petroleum  &  Energy  Studies  Dehradun  Email** Assistant Professor Lal Bahadur Shastri Institute of Management & Technology Bareilly Emailvkandpal@ddn.upes.ac.inakki06jr@gmail.com\\x0c86 Vinay Kandpal and Rajat Mehrotramaximum number of participants from all the sections of the society. The lack ofawareness  and  financial  literacy  among  the  rural  population  of  the  country  ishindering the growth of the economy a majority of the population does not haveaccess  to  formal  credit.  This  is  a  serious  issue  for  the  economic  progress  of  thecountry. In order to overcome such barriers the banking sector emerged with sometechnological  innovations  such  as  automated  teller  machines  (ATM)  credit  anddebit  cards  internet  banking  etc.  Though  the  introduction  of  such  bankingtechnologies brought a change in the urban society a majority of the rural populationis still unaware of these changes and is excluded from formal banking.Fintech is a new term and has been gaining popularity since early 2015. Thisterm  is  usually  confused  for  being  a  strictly  technological  and  techsavvy  term.When in reality this term is the merger of financial services provided by variousclients with the developments and advancements in the technological arena.The  basic  point  is  that  Fintech  developed  more  as  a  necessity  out  of  thedevelopments  in  the  areas  of  financing  services  and  the  rapid  growth  of  thetechnology that due to the need of such services. The merger of technology withfinancial  service  here  means  that  various  applications  and  platforms  are  beingbuilt and developed to provide you with an ease of using financial services includingapplying for business loans online personal loans etc. easily.Review of LiteratureDevelopment Research Project (2013) attempted to understand the financialneeds of poor in longterm and shortterm by exploring how the surplus fund isused  to  meet  shortterm  longterm  and  emergency  requirements  to  developstrategies  for  financial  inclusion  and  designing  financial  products.  The  ruralhouseholds  follow  their  own  strategies  of  cash  management  for  their  dailyexpenditure  and  thereby  taking  advantage  of  this  several  informal  financialinstitutions and instruments are serving this section of society. In this context thereport examines 107 households of Ernakulam district in Kerala as was suggestedby the RBI. The aim of the study was to understand the nature of the cash flowsand outflows of a sample of poor households in the district. The project also analyzedthe cash flow management strategies of the poor households. Further assessmentwas done to analyze the structure of the financial assets and liabilities of the poorhouseholds. The project focuses on the saving patterns of the poor households andexamined factors responsible for the extent of dependence of the poor on formaland informal financial instruments /institutions for savings and credit. Two methodswere used in this project for collecting data. First the sample of poor householdusing questionnaire and keeping a track using financial diary method of the samesample. Second the analysis provided emphasis on rural and urbanCRISIL (2013) measured the extent of financial inclusion in India in the formof an index. It makes use of the nonmonetary aggregates for calculating financialinclusion. The parameters used by the CRISIL Inclusix took into account the number\\x0cFinancial Inclusion The Role of Fintech and Digital Financial Services in India87of individuals having access to various financial services rather than focusing onthe loan amount. The three parameters of the index were the branch deposit andcredit  penetration.  These  parameters  were  updated  annually  and  based  on  theavailability of data; additional services such as insurance and microfinance wereadded. The key findings of the report were as follows one in two Indians has asavings account and only one in seven Indians has access to banking credit; CRISILInclusix at an allIndia level stood at a relatively low level of 40.1 for 2011 (on ascale of 100). In short CRISIL gave groundlevel information regarding the progressof financial inclusion in the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rural and in urban areas.RBI (2014a) focused on the provision of Financial Services to small businessesand lowincome households. Among the main motives of the committee includeddesigning principles for maximum financial inclusion and financial deepening andframing policies for monitoring the progress in the development of financial inclusionin India. Thus in order to achieve the goal of maximum financial inclusion andincreased  access  to  financial  inclusion  the  committee  proposed  the  followingmeasures provision of fullservice electronic bank account; distribution of ElectronicPayment Access Points for easy deposit and withdrawal facilities; provision of creditproducts  investment  and  deposit  products  insurance  and  risk  managementproducts by formal institutions. The main findings of the report highlighted thefollowing key issues. First the majority of the small businesses were operatingwithout  the  help  of  formal  financial  institutions.  Second  more  than  half  of  therural and urban population did not have access to the bank account. Third savingsin terms of GDP have declined in 201112. To address these issues the Committeerecommended that each individual should have a Universal Electronic Bank Accountwhile registering for an Aadhar card. The committee also proposed for setting up ofpayments  banks  with  the  purpose  of  providing  payments  services  and  depositproducts to small businesses and lowincome households. In addition banks shouldpurchase portfolio insurance which will help in managing their credit exposures.Further the Committee recommended for setting up of a State Finance RegulatoryCommission where all the state level financial regulators will work together. Forthe interest of the bank account holders the committee recommended for the creationof Financial Redress Agency (FRA) for customer grievance redress across all financialproducts and services which would coordinate with the respective regulator.RBI  (2014b)  presented  a  report  to  study  various  challenges  and  evaluatealternatives in the domain of technology that can help the largescale expansion ofmobile banking across the country. The report divided the challenges into 2 broadcategories \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Customer enrollment related issues and Technical issues. Customerenrollment related issues include mobile number registration MPIN (mobile pin)generation process concerns relating to security as a factor affecting onboarding ofcustomers education of bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s staff and customer education. On the other handtechnical issues include access channels for transactions cumbersome transactionprocess  and  coordination  with  MNOs  (Mobile  Network  Operators)  in  a  mobilebanking ecosystem. The report has a detailed comparison of four channels of mobile\\x0c88 Vinay Kandpal and Rajat Mehrotrabanking    SMS  (Short  Message  Service)  USSD  (Unstructured  SupplementaryService  Data)  IVRS  (Interactive  Voice  Response  System)  and  Mobile  BankingApplication and evaluates each one of them based on accessibility security andusability. To resolve the different problems identified the report suggests developinga common mobile application using SMS and GPRS channels for all banks andtelecom operators. The aforementioned application should enable the user to performbasic mobile banking operations such as enquiring his/her account balance transferand remittance of money. The application is expected to be developed in such a waythat it provides a simple menu driven interactive interface to the user. Such anapplication can be developed by the combined efforts of telecom operators and banks.The application can be embedded on all new SIM cards so that any person buyinga new card has a preinstalled application. For customers already using SIM cardsthe application can be transferred \\xe2\\x80\\x9cover the air\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (OTA) using a dynamic STK (SIMApplication Tool Kit) facility.Issues Affecting Fintech in IndiaAlthough India has been rising to match the other countries with their Fintechdevelopments it is clear that India is quite behind when compared to them. Indiahas  a  huge  market  for  growth  in  this  sector.  However  there  are  many  factorswhich make it hard for the Fintech sector in this country to rise and be equal to themore developed markets and economies.Some of these factors are discussed belowLow Internet Penetration For Fintech sector to grow in a population as bigas India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population we need a good connectivity. However as we know Indiadoes not have that. The majority of the population is still very new to the concept ofsmartphones and other gadgets; therefore the connection via the internet is still inthe developing stage.Bank Accounts India has a huge population and is a great economy for theFintech sector but sad as it sounds the majority of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population lives in ruralareas or is below the poverty line. In addition to this there are many people who donot even own bank accounts which makes it hard for Fintech to grow in the Indianeconomy.An  absence  of  Hardware  and  More  Hands  The  absence  of  the  righthardware and the right information makes it rather hard for this new sector togrow. The growth of this sector largely depends upon the understanding of the newlanguage and put that into work. The absence of the easy to understand languagefor the local people has been causing a lot of trouble for the sector. This not onlyleads to fewer hands and minds to work in the given sector but also reduces thepopulation that understands the working of the new Fintech sector.Lack of Funds Majority of the Fintech sector applications are the children ofstartups. In addition it is common knowledge that startups usually are not able\\x0cFinancial Inclusion The Role of Fintech and Digital Financial Services in India89to raise enough funds for their projects. A lack of resources difficulty in gettingbusiness loans is as bad as a lack of idea. India could grow into a great market forFintech but the present scenario with the funds and money does not give enoughspace for this sector to grow up to its potential.Although India has a huge population which favors the growth of the new andbudding Fintech sector the economy and the present scenario of the country is notfavorable for its growth. The major difference between the global Fintech sectorand the Indian industry is the presence of various factors that hamper the growthof Fintech in India as discussed earlier. India may be able to stand shoulder toshoulder with the more developed economies when all these factors as mentionedwill begin to disappear. The primary requirement for any Fintech startup to settlewill be a consumer base a high internet penetration and more minds to work onthe project.India is growing at a fast pace and due to many changes in the economy agreat revolution is coming in the financial sector with the emergence of Fintech. Asthe need for business loans rises more and more people are coming to terms withthe idea of digital lending. The market is still new and our economy is still growing.Therefore in the coming years this sector will grow as well.Innovative  business  models  have  enabled  fintech  companies  to  emerge  as  acatalyst for growth for SMEs not just locally but globally too. Fintech companiesare thus becoming a \\xe2\\x80\\x98onestop shop\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for the financial needs of small enterprises.Online lending platforms (as opposed to subsectors such as payments or wealthmanagement) are seeing several new entrants in the market offering novel financialproducts.  The  potential  impact  of  fintech\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  efficient  lending  processes  can  bemeasured in severAccording to Mckinsey a substantial majority (about 75%) of fintech lendersare focusing on retail banking lending wealth management and payment systemsfor MSMEs. The numbers look promising despite the ineligibility for classificationas direct or indirect finance to MSE sector that takes all such loans to NBFCs outof the \\xe2\\x80\\x98priority sector classification.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 It isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t surprising then that MSMEs are turningaway from traditional collateralchasing banks. Even the investor sentiment ispositive vis a vis the touted success of Fintech.Future Prospects of Fintech towards Financial InclusionThe  importance  of  MSMEs  as  a  major  driver  of  the  economy  and  a  criticalemployment generator cannot be overstated. Moreover there is a large market ofunserved/underserved populations that Fintech can reach out to. This game changerfor inclusion has only reached elite customers in TierI and TierII cities of India sofar. The need of the hour is to innovate for the mass market and address challengessuch as lack of financial and digital literacy and restrictive regulatory policy. Inaddition being able to sustain relations with SME customers despite delinquenciesis an onus that rests entirely on a Fintech organization. The problem of delayed\\x0c90 Vinay Kandpal and Rajat Mehrotrapayment  in  financing  more  so  in  the  MSME  space  tantamount  to  being  anoccupational hazard that cannot be done away with. However looking at the biggerpicture ensuring continuity of partnerships and staying resilient is the key. Inaddition there is substantial interest from foreign investors in the Indian Fintechspace wanting to capitalize on the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s steadily growing GDP. Initiatives suchas \\xe2\\x80\\x98Digital India\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98Make in India\\xe2\\x80\\x99 the recent demonetization drive and the push tomake India a cashless economy are laying strong foundations for synergies betweenFintech and MSMEs.Technology and the Financial Services in the Indian MarketUnderstood simply Fintech refers to the scope of financial services that can beavailable on digital platforms. This new disruption in the banking and financialservices sector has had a wideranging impact.Scope for Growth in IndiaFintech service firms are currently redefining the way companies and consumersconduct transactions on a daily basis. This is why global investments into Fintechventures have been increasing at record speed \\xe2\\x80\\x93 tripling to US$ 12.2 billion in 2014from US$ 4.05 billion in 2013 and reaching US$ 19.1 billion in 2015. In India thescale has been much smaller but at similar growth rates \\xe2\\x80\\x93 investment in India\\xe2\\x80\\x99sFintech industry grew 282 percent between 2013 and 2014 and reached US$ 450million in 2015.Additionally India has a large untapped market for financial service technologystartups \\xe2\\x80\\x93 40 percent of the population is currently not connected to banks and 87percent of payments are made in cash. With mobile usage expected to increase to64 percent in 2018 from 53 percent currently and internet penetration steadilyclimbing the growth potential for Fintech in India cannot be overstated. Moreoverby some estimates as much as 90 percent of small businesses are not linked toformal financial institutions. These gaps in access to institutions and services offerimportant scope to develop Fintech solutions (such as funding finance management)and expand the market base.Disruptive Potential in the Traditional Finance and Banking SectorFintech firms are breaking new ground in the formal finance sector through theinnovative  and  dynamic  use  of  technology  in  the  lending  process.  For  instancewhile  traditional  banks  (around  100)  and  NBFCs  (around  1100)  in  India  usetechnology to simply calculate credit scores Fintech ventures use machine learningalgorithms and alternative data points such as social media footprints call recordsshopping histories and payments to utility service providers to increase efficiencyand provide greater access to credit. The turnaround time is also much faster forthe approval and disbursal of loans by Fintech firms despite several banks (StateBank  of  India  ICICI  HDFC  and  Axis  bank)  digitizing  and  speeding  up  theseprocesses markedly.\\x0cFinancial Inclusion The Role of Fintech and Digital Financial Services in India91Challenges and Opportunities for Fintech ExpansionWhile digital finance firms have benefited from the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s prostartup policiesand  flexible  regulatory  conditions  imposed  by  the  Reserve  Bank  of  India  (RBI)formal  institutions  possess  an  established  infrastructure  and  legacy  that  is  noteasily replaceable. Fintech startups need to instill greater confidence among Indiancustomers  already  known  for  being  conservative  in  their  financial  preferences.Figuring out how to market to their needs and influence financial behavior aresome of the biggest challenges as is setting up a strong and responsive regulatoryinfrastructure to keep pace with the speed of technological innovation.On the other hand traditional banking and financial institutions can leveragetheir existing customer base and adopt digital products that nurture strong financialrelationships  while  improving  service  efficiency  and  broadening  access  to  meetchanging needs. The disruptive potential of Fintech firms can provoke the muchneeded modernization of the traditional sector reducing costs in the process andincreasing the size of the banking population.Responding to these opportunities and challenges banks like HDFC and Axishave launched mobile phone applications to ease digital transactions; Federal Bankannounced  a  partnership  with  Startup  Village  to  develop  innovative  bankingproducts;  U.K.  giant  Barclays  is  set  to  operationalize  its  fifth  global  Fintechinnovation  center  that  will  be  located  in  India;  and  Goldman  Sachs  PrincipalStrategic Investments Group (GSPSI) is looking to invest in Bengaluru\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fintechstartup scene.Thus  the  growth  prospects  in  technological  innovation  may  not  necessarilyproduce  a  mutually  exclusive  relationship  between  traditional  institutions  andFintech firms in India.The Right Combination of Incentives Policies and RegulationInitiatives by the RBI and parallel government efforts have focused on fosteringfinancial  inclusion.  This  has  meant  encouraging  competition  and  innovation  inIndia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s nascent Fintech sector on a more or less even playing field. This has allowedboth online and offline solutions to emerge and has created a safer financial systemwith farreaching access.Reserve Bank of India The RBI recently set up a multidisciplinary committeeto study the Fintech business in India. The goal is to understand the risks involvedand the emergence of new models and assess how the banking system could thenadapt and respond to them. The RBI has so far promoted the Unified PaymentsInterface and the Bharat Bill Payments System as well as digital payments P2Plending and the use of automated algorithms to offer financial advice. Moreoverthe RBI has granted licenses to 11 Fintech entities to establish payment banksthat provide savings deposit and remittance services.\\x0c92 Vinay Kandpal and Rajat MehrotraGovernment  Schemes  These  include  the  Jan  Dhan  Yojana  Digital  Indiaprogram and Aadhar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Unique Identification system that have provided importantenabling platforms for technology innovators. In addition egovernance systemspromoted  by  the  current  government  facilitate  transparency  by  removing  theinvolvement of intermediaries. The removal of surcharges on electronic transactionstax  benefits  for  consumers  and  businesses  using  epayments  and  changes  inauthentication  requirements  are  other  examples  of  the  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  efforts  toencourage the growth of a Fintech ecosystem in India.Fintech Startup Sector This is probably the greatest empowering incentivetowards the expansion of Fintech ventures in India. An encouraging regulatoryenvironment has enabled the launching of 174 Fintech startups in 2015 alone asper data analytics company Traxcn. As mentioned earlier several national andinternational banks and investment groups are also investing in India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Fintechstartups and funding Fintech solutions.Observations The digital and technological revolution transformed businessoperations across all industries and the financial and banking sector is no exception.What is heartening is that the Indian government and regulatory institutions havein effect promoted an entrepreneurial rather than obstructive climate for Fintechin India. However policies and governance will need to match the speed of innovationin this sector particularly to ensure secure and transparent growth.Conclusion Normally customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s confidence and trust in traditional bankingsystem will make customers less likely to adopt new technologies. New technologieswill not be successful until customers are satisfied with privacy and security aspects.It also requires some time to earn confidence among the customers even it is easierand cheaper than the traditional methods.ReferencesAgarwal Parul (2014) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinancial Inclusion in India a Review and Initiatives and Achievements\\xe2\\x80\\x9dIOSR Journal of Business and Management Volume 16 Issue 6 June.Chakrabarty K.C.
