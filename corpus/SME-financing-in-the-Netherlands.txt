The problem stated by   MM&C is that since the financial crisis it has become harder to consistently find funding at banks for   their SME clients. MM&C therefore wants to also use alternative ways of financing to fulfill the   funding need of their clients. However  it is unclear what all the available alternative financing   options are and which ones are suitable for MM&C’s clients.     This problem resulted in the following research goal  analyze the current Dutch financing market for   SMEs  research the newly emerged alternative financing options and develop a tool for proposing   suitable financiers in the market for a certain financing need of an SME.       First  an analysis is presented of the current Dutch financing market and the difficulties that SMEs are   currently facing.   In 2015 there were in total 348.815 SMEs between 2 and 249 employees (24% of all firms) active in   the Netherlands. SMEs are the engine of growth for the economy  are important for employment   and contributed to 64% of the national GDP in 2014. It is of high importance to the Dutch economy   that SMEs have good access to funding as they need it for the execution of activities. The total credit   volume outstanding by financial institutions to nonfinancial corporations used to be on average   €303 billion in 2013 and was on average €266 billion in 2016 of which Dutch banks had a total of   €130 billion of loans issued to SMEs. The biggest decreases are in loans up to €250k. SMEs applied for   €14 billion of funding in June 2015  May 2016. The Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs claims that   with micro and small companies 52% of loan applications got rejected and medium companies 28%   in 2016.   SMEs have suffered a double blow since the ‘07‘08 financial crisis. On one hand the demand for   goods and services have decreased and on the other hand banks have gotten more risk averse in   issuing loans to SMEs in the Netherlands. Increased capital requirements for banks imposed by the   Basel II and Basel III regulations made it less attractive to issue loans  especially to the relatively risky   SME segment. Monitoring cost and information costs are high and for relatively small SME loans a lot   of costly time is spent on the credit approval phase. Furthermore  SMEs are riskier than large   corporations because they are less diversified  have weaker financial structures  lower buffer   capacity  are less transparent and are often dependent on one main shareholder. This makes them   more vulnerable in times of crises resulting in banks downscaling their SME loan portfolio.        This development has created a great base for new alternative financiers to emerge in the Dutch   financing market. The research continues with an exploratory research on the new alternative   financing options available to SMEs. The most notable new alternative financing options are   individual invoice factoring  regional development companies  institutional investment funds  SME   stock exchanges  crowdfunding  online credit suppliers  credit unions and microfinancing. Despite the   need for more capital  SMEs currently use relatively few of these alternatives to bank financing.   Alternative financing options are still relatively unknown to SMEs. The market for new alternatives is   responsible for less than 0 5% of total SME funding but is growing rapidly.                            3     A finance decision support tool was created for MM&C which generates a funding proposal for SMEs   based on a specific funding need. This funding proposal includes new alternative financing options.   The funding decision support tool aids MM&C in selecting the most suitable financing options   available on the market for their SME clients. The user is required to fill in financial statements    desired funding goals and answer a number of questions about the company in order to receive a   funding proposal for each funding goal. Furthermore  the tool compares the firm and several   financial ratios with averages of firms in the same industry and employee segment. On top of that    the tool has the ability to generate a credit rating of the firm and a balance sheet after funding when   a certain type of funding is chosen.      The core function of the tool (generating a funding proposal) is validated by two completed client   cases of MM&C dealing with an SME in need of funding. For both cases the tool suggests the   financing options that MM&C also used to fund their clients and for several funding goals the tool   suggests other suitable financing options that could have been used as well. The tool also performs   well in giving clear suggestions about which type of finance is of best interest to the firm regarding its   risk and financial situation. It was concluded that the tool fundamentally functions as intended. As   with every new tool  it will greatly improve with further optimization.      The practical contribution is that with a funding proposal generated by the tool  MM&C can apply at   selected financiers promptly without having to research the market first. On top of that  it provides a   basis for combining financing options to fulfill a total funding need. Above all  MM&C will have   knowledge about all financing options in the Dutch financing market. Therefore MM&C can more   adequately service their clients by also arranging funding from financiers other than banks or   combining funding from new financiers together with banks. This will result in a higher funding   success rate for clients of MM&C  hence improving service.          The theoretical contribution of this research is that it lists all the financing options and its   characteristics because there is currently little academic literature on alternative financing options in   the Netherlands. Not only does this research give insight into which financing options are available   for SMEs but also insight is given into which financing options are suitable for an SME’s specific   funding need. Furthermore  this thesis is a source for academics from other countries to learn from   the alternative financing market in the Netherlands.                     4                  Preface    The thesis in front of you has been carried out in order to complete the Master Operations   Management & Logistics at Eindhoven University of Technology. My first university supervisor Mr.   Boray Huang and myself agreed quickly on the topic alternative financing as it was in our mutual   interest. I appreciate the fact that he gave me the freedom to execute my proposed plans and ideas   as well as the ability to meet in his office for feedback soon after I called.       Mr. Alfred Algra  the founder and owner of Mondriaan Management & Consultancy  has given me   the opportunity to do this research and gain work experience in the financial consultancy profession.   Although the university advises not to ‘work’ at the firm during the thesis period which indeed   turned out to be challenging to combine at times  the work experience has been proven to be   complementary to the thesis. In fact  work experience was rather necessary in order to execute a   more focused research and increase the quality of the thesis. Besides that  it was an incredible   educational practice. Thank you!   Related to this  I would therefore advise any engineering student aspiring entrepreneurship or a   management position to gain (some) knowledge (and preferably experience) in finance to become   financially literate. It is practically guaranteed that it will come across your career in one way or   another.      Mr. Piet Poos was my main company supervisor during the thesis. His constructive feedback  helpful   advice and his combined financial and academic experience was indispensable during the process.    Mr. Ruben van de Sande  a former colleague in the beginning phase of my internship made corporate   finance and accounting come to life for me and always took the time to roll towards my desk and   help me when I got stuck.    I am also glad that Mr. Johan Jansen could clearly explain financial concepts  helped me right away   on the spot whenever I had a question and for being a fun colleague!    Mrs. Roosmarijn Leenheer  I appreciate you could help me with the layout of my thesis  practical   office matters and fuel my travel plans. Furthermore  the workspace provided definitely contributed   to the prosperous course of the project.       Last but not least  I want to express my appreciation to family  friends and housemates who were   involved  interested  I could depend on and who served as discussion partners. You also pulled me   through periods my motivation reached the natural depths by means of healthy spirit. And grandpa    thanks for letting me borrow your car!

This was done in close   cooperation with Eindhoven University of Technology (TU/e). To give an idea of MM&C’s activities    first a brief description of the business is given and from there on the introduction advances with the   problem statement  research goal  research questions and the research methodology.       1.1  Description of Mondriaan Management & Consultancy (MM&C)   MM&C is a relatively small consultancy firm founded in 2007 which provides their clients in the small   and medium enterprise (SME) segment advice on mainly financial  strategical  organizational and   business process matters. The firm is based in Goirle  a suburb of Tilburg and was founded by Alfred   Algra  a former ING Bank executive. A large group of clients initially contact MM&C as a result of   financial problems or large investment decisions. Subsequently  MM&C often stays connected as   financial & strategical management partner or supervisor with their clients. A large part of MM&C’s   activities consists of finding new funding starting from €500k for their clients. Clients of MM&C are   from a variety of industries.     1.2  Background problem context and problem statement   As is commonly known  the ‘07‘08 financial crisis had its impact on the commercial bank lending   market for a lot of SMEs. Whereas banks before the crisis were generous in issuing loans  now they   have gotten more risk averse. The general voice of managers and owners of SMEs is that it is   significantly more difficult to apply for bank loans in current times.      Also MM&C has noticed that since the ‘07‘08 financial crisis  banks have gotten less risk appetite   and are now more reluctant to issue loans  especially to the more risky SME segment. The most   widely read financial newspaper of the Netherlands  Het Financieele Dagblad  writes practically daily   about the problems of SMEs finding adequate funding for their business plans. The development of   shrinking supply by traditional financing options created a great base for new alternative financiers   to emerge on the financing market (Benthem  2016). Het Financieele Dagblad writes frequently that   SMEs have great difficulties in finding out which of those alternative financiers is suitable for their   financing need.     As MM&C noticed that it became harder to consistently find new funding for their clients via banks    MM&C wanted to first of all research why exactly banks have become less willing to finance SMEs.   Second  because MM&C did not have a clear view of the new financing alternatives available  they   wanted a research done on all new alternative financiers available on the Dutch financing market.   They value this research because MM&C can then start fulfilling the funding need of their clients also   via these new alternatives. This problem that MM&C pointed out formed the basis of this research   project  resulting in a problem statement described as follows       Problem statement by MM&C   Since the financial crisis it has become harder for MM&C to find funding at banks for their SME   clients. MM&C therefore wants to also use alternative ways of financing to fulfill the funding   need of their clients. However  it is unclear what all the available alternative financing options   are and which ones are suitable for MM&C’s clients.                                      10     The problem statement formulated by MM&C formed the basis for doing further research on the   state of the current Dutch financing market in chapter 2. This is done in order to first of all   understand the root cause of the difficulties SMEs are currently facing regarding access to funding in   the Netherlands. The exploratory research on all the new alternative financing options is discussed in   chapter 3.     1.3  Research goal and questions   From the problem statement  an overall goal of this research is derived. This results in several   research questions (RQs) that construct the thesis. The answers to these research questions lead to   achieving the overall goal.      An analysis of the current Dutch financing market for SMEs and the alternative financing options will   be of value to MM&C and SMEs in general. However  MM&C would then still have to put a lot of   time in deciding which financing options can be suitable for the financing need of a particular SME as   each financing option has their own characteristics and specifications. Therefore in the second part   of this master thesis  a funding decision support tool (from now on also referred to as ‘tool’) is   designed to aid an MM&C financial consultant in proposing a selected shortlist of financing options   for an SMEs financing need. In this way the user does not have to do a market research on his or her   own but can immediately contact and apply for the right financiers which are likely to finance the   SME’s need.       The overall goal of the master thesis is formulated as follows       Overall goal   Analyze the current Dutch financing market for SMEs  research the newly emerged alternative   financing options and develop a tool for proposing suitable financiers in the market for a certain   financing need of an SME.                 It is chosen to focus on SMEs because  as mentioned before  clients of MM&C are merely SMEs. In   addition  currently big corporations are not having trouble applying for traditional bank loans (Het   Financieele Dagblad  2016). To support the achievement of the overall goal  a set of research   questions has been formulated      Research question 1    What is the current state of the financing market for SMEs in the     Netherlands?                Sub question 1  What are the financing needs of SMEs?    Sub question 2  How are SMEs currently financed?   Sub question 3  What is the situation for SMEs applying for funding  what   difficulties do they face and what are the reasons for this?      Research question 2    Which forms of suitable financing options exist for MM&C’s clients and     what are each ones most important characteristics?      Research question 3    What is (are) the most suitable financing option(s) available for a client of     MM&C to choose from when having (a) certain funding need(s)?                                   11     First of all the research is divided into roughly two distinct parts. The first part describes the analysis   of the current financing market for SMEs in the Netherlands and the alternative financing options   available for MM&C’s SME clients (first two RQs). The second part of the research focuses on the   created finance decision support tool described previously (RQ3).    For the first research question it is chosen to not necessarily compare the current financing market   with the financing market of before the crisis as it does not add extra value for the overall goal of the   research. It is merely of interest to research the current situation of the financing market for SMEs.   However  causes of the current situation can be consequences of the ‘07‘08 financial crisis and are   evidently referred to. Furthermore  it has been decided to only research the Dutch financing market   for SMEs. From the literature review completed prior to the thesis it was noticed that the financing   market in other countries  even as close as the U.K. or Germany  is substantially different.    For the second research question  all possible financing options for SMEs are researched other than   classic bank loans and current accounts. It is assumed that readers of this research already possess a   fair amount of knowledge about the functioning of banks. Only the alternative financing options in   the Netherlands are discussed as MM&C’s clients are all based in this country.       1.4  Methodology   The research is conducted by using the regulative cycle of van Strien (1997). The regulative cycle is a   problemsolving cycle which consists of the following steps  problem statement (1)  analyses and   diagnosis (2)  plan of action (3)  intervention (4) and evaluation (5). The cycle is depicted in the   following figure       Figure 1  Regulative cycle of van Strien (1997) in relation with the thesis.          With the help of Figure 1 it is explained how the phases of the cycle of van Strien are related to   answering the research questions. At this point the first step  problem statement  has been   completed.    The second ‘analysis and diagnosis’ step is fulfilled by the first and second research question. The   current Dutch finance market for SMEs is analyzed and the reasons for SME funding problems are   clarified. Furthermore  the alternative financing options in the Netherlands are analyzed. As a result   of the second step  the problem statement of paragraph 1.2 is clarified and sharpened  therefore   providing a good basis for a plan of action in step 3.                        12     The plan of action  intervention and evaluation phase is covered by the third research question. The   created funding decision support tool is the intervention step and the validation is completed by   testing the tool with two completed (anonymous) client cases of MM&C where their aim was to fund   these businesses. The finance proposal that is given for each of the two company cases is compared   with how the business was financed in practice.     1.5  Theoretical and practical contribution      1.5.1  Theoretical contribution   The literature review brought up the fact that there is limited academic literature on alternative   financing options for SMEs in the Netherlands.    The literature about ‘traditional’ financing alternatives for SMEs i.e. factoring  leasing and informal   investors however are plentiful. Options such as crowdfunding and private equity firms are widely   spread in the literature  however not focused on the Dutch market in specific. New alternatives such   as individual invoice factoring  credit unions  microfinancing  regional development companies    institutional investment funds  government guarantees  SME stock exchanges and emerging online   credit suppliers are more or less absent in literature  let alone described for the Dutch market.   Besides  senior lecturer at TiasNimbas Business School in Tilburg  Mr. Poos  mentions that the   developments in the alternative financing market are fast  resulting in academic literature lagging   behind.     This thesis first of all contributes to the academic literature by stating all financing options in the   Netherlands meant for the SME segment (also options not suitable for MM&C). This research does   not end with stating the options available but also each one’s characteristics (i.e. amounts  type of   finance  financing period  financing goals etc.) is described. In this way academics will not have to do   a market research for the Netherlands anymore and academics from other countries can learn from   the alternative financing options available in the Netherlands. Another addition to the literature that   results from the research is that insight is given into which financing options in the Netherlands are   suitable for an SME with a certain financing need.     1.5.2  Practical contribution   This thesis provides a finance decision support tool for MM&C that filters the appropriate financing   options (including the new alternative financiers) based on the financing needs of the SME. With this   finance proposal the user can apply at selected the financiers for funding promptly without having to   research the market first. This tool will save a significant amount of time when searching for relevant   financiers. On top of that  it provides a basis for combining financing options to fulfill a total funding   need. As a financier nowadays is less willing to supply the total amount of required funding on their   own (higher risk)  multiple financiers can be combined to supply the total amount required. This new   emerging trend is called ‘stacking’ financing options and is boosted by the declined willingness of   banks since the crisis to finance a complete funding need. Say an SME requires funding and the   funding need can be split up into multiple goals  the tool proposes financing options for each of the   goals. Subsequently  these options can be combined to arrange all funding required making each   financier less prone to risk. By splitting up the funding need over multiple financiers  the business   makes it more attractive for each financier to participate. Especially when the returns of a firm are   temporarily low (Huijgens  2016). This is regularly the case for clients of MM&C.   Above all  MM&C will have knowledge about all financiers in the Dutch financing market. Therefore   MM&C can more adequately service their clients by also arranging funding from financiers other                       13     than banks or combining funding from new financiers together with banks. This will result in a higher   funding success rate for clients of MM&C  hence improving service.          1.6  Thesis structure   This introduction chapter stated the problem formulated by MM&C  discussed the overall goal of the   thesis and the research questions to be answered in order to achieve the goal. Next to that  the   methodology along which the thesis is structured is described and the contribution of this thesis to   the academic literature and in practice at MM&C is clarified.     The following chapter continues with an exploration of the current Dutch financing market and the   accompanying difficulties for SMEs. Chapter 3 states all alternative financing options suitable for   SMEs in the Netherlands and which one of these are suitable for MM&C’s clients. Chapter 4   describes the functioning of the finance decision support tool together with the choices and   assumptions used for the design. Two case studies (MM&C’s clients) are used to validate the tool in   chapter 5 and suggestions for future research and improvements of the tool will be discussed in the   last chapter.                            14     2  Current Dutch financing market for SMEs   This section analyzes the current Dutch financing market for SMEs. After the literature methodology   is described  the definition of an SME is reported. SMEs require funding for various reasons and   therefore the funding needs of SMEs are described. Subsequently the Dutch financing market is   analyzed and at last the difficulties that SMEs are currently facing on the funding market are   discussed.     2.1  Literature methodology   To increase the quality of the literature used  the inclusion and exclusion criteria are stated. For this   chapter only literature since 2009 was used because literature before the financial crisis does not   adequately reflect the current situation on the funding market. Also professional literature and   government reports from 2009 and onwards were used. Regarding academic literature  papers from   2009 – 2012 were only used if they have an above average number of citations. From 2013 onwards    all relevant academic papers were used. Academic articles have been critically assessed if the   information also applies to SMEs in the Netherlands as the nature of the funding markets varies quite   significantly across countries. Books and websites were also used as a source. The useful literature   found during the process is an equal mix of academic literature  professional literature and research   reports funded by the Dutch government.      2.2  Definition of an SME   Before the current Dutch financing market is analyzed  it is important to define an SME because it is a   wide definition. First  it is defined what companies belong to the category ‘SME’. The opinions differ   across the world but it is chosen to state the two most important definitions       1.  Since 1 January 2005 the European Commission (2005) defines SMEs as the following  “The     category of micro  small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) is made up of enterprises   which employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50   million euro  and/or an annual balance sheet total not exceeding 43 million euro” (Table 1).     Table 1  Definition of an SME by the European Commission (2005).     Category     Medium     Small     Micro          Employees     Turnover     Balance sheet total     < 250     < 50     < 10     ≤ € 50m     ≤ € 10m     ≤ € 2m     ≤ € 43m     ≤ € 10m     ≤ € 2m     2.  Since 1 January 2016 the Dutch Chamber of Commerce defines SMEs more or less the same   as the European Commission except for the fact that the balance sheet total cannot exceed   €20m (Kamer van Koophandel  2016). See Table 2.                    15                  Table 2  Definition of an SME by the Dutch Chamber of Commerce (2016).     Category     Medium     Small     Micro          Employees     Turnover     Balance sheet total     < 250     < 50     < 10     ≤ € 50m     ≤ € 12m     ≤ € 0 7m     ≤ € 20m     ≤ € 6m     ≤ € 0 35m     In 2015 the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) counted in total 1.465.405 companies in the   Netherlands. 2.840 of these are companies with over 250 employees (category big companies) and   1.116.590 have one employee. This implies that 99 8% of the companies in Netherlands belong to   the SME class (see Figure 2). This research however is focused on SMEs that have between 2 and 249   employees. This group consists of 348.815 firms (23 76%) in the Netherlands. The Netherlands has   the most SMEs per capita in the European Union (CBS  2015).

When alternative financing options are researched  it is   important to know which type of SMEs are clients of MM&C.    MM&C’s SME clients exclude micro companies and starters. The client base is entirely formed out of   the categories small and medium from Table 1 and Table 2 (Figure 2  4 03% of the companies in the   Netherlands). All clients are established for at least three years  have a track record and are all Dutch   ‘Besloten Vennootschappen’  the equivalent of a private limited company in the U.K. or a limited   liability company in the U.S.     2.3  Funding needs of SMEs   Beck & Mac an Bhaird (2013) note that SMEs are important for the contribution to employment. In   2014  the total contribution to the GDP was 64 2% (Autoriteit Consument & Markt  2015). This   percentage is not only high in absolute terms but also in comparison with other European countries                       16     where the contribution to the GDP was on average 57 8% in 2014 (Autoriteit Consument & Markt    2015). Degryse  de Goeij & Kappert (2010) write the following  “Small unlisted firms make up for   more than 90% of all existing firms  and are the engine of growth in most economies”. It is of high   importance to the Dutch economy that SMEs have good access to funding as they need funding for   the execution of activities.       The average amount an SME orientates on is €300k. This varies between €100k in micro companies    €300k in small companies and €2m in medium companies (Panteia  2016). These needs can come   from investment goals (i.e. housing  machines  vehicles) or to improve working capital. For short  term financing  SMEs mainly use current accounts (Autoriteit Consument & Markt  2015). For long  term finance mostly loans with collateral are used. External finance can be in the form of corporate   bonds  loans or capital from shareholders.      Panteia (2016) states that in the period June 2015 until May 2016  31% of the companies   (approximately 100.000) with two or more people have orientated for funding. Around 80% of these   companies actually applied for funding (totaling 25% of all companies with more than two   employees). Companies that were profitable in 2015 have orientated more than average for   obtaining finance. This also applies to companies with a more than average solvency (Panteia  2016).   It is plausible that a financially wellperforming company is focused on investment and expansion.   Companies with low solvency often also orientate for obtaining financing. For these companies there   is a greater need for working capital (Panteia  2016). Fast growers orientate often for obtaining   financing. This is obvious because without adequate funding growth is jeopardized. Most SMEs do   not apply for external financing. The main source for investing activities is still a firm’s internal   resources (Benthem  2016; SociaalEconomische Raad  2014).     A large proportion (about 50%) of the financing needs of SMEs come from working capital (Sociaal  Economische Raad  2014). Also Hebbink  Kruidhof & Slingenberg (2014) mention that SMEs mainly   require funding for working capital.        Panteia (2016) mentions that other important funding needs are caused by housing  equipment    other fixed assets  refinancing of existing loans and acquisitions. In comparison with previous years    refinancing loans and financing investments has taken a bigger share of the total financing needs   than in previous years. This can be seen by comparing earlier yearly research of Panteia dating back   until 2010. This can be explained for a large part by the fact that in 2015 and 2016 the interest rates   were more favorable than in prior years. The Dutch Chamber of Commerce (2015) researched the   funding needs of SMEs with 2 – 50 employees and the result can be viewed in Table 3.                                 17     Table 3  Financing needs of SMEs with 250 employees. Multiple answers were possible in the research of the Chamber   of Commerce (2015).      Type of financing need     Micro and small SMEs (250 employees)     Purchase of machinery  assets (incl.

The research only surveyed micro and small SMEs in the Netherlands. It was not   possible to find better and more reliable data on funding needs for all SME categories in the   Netherlands. Nevertheless  Table 3 does provide a decent indication of the funding needs of Dutch   SMEs and shows again that most of the funding is required for working capital.      Panteia (2016) researched the nature of funding applications and concluded that 91% of the actual   applications were for debt finance (see Figure 3).

This list is reported in section 4.2.1.1 and the user of   the tool is able to choose a funding need from this list.     2.4  Current financing market in the Netherlands in numbers   The largest part of the funding of Dutch SMEs comes from the three ‘big banks’ namely ABN AMRO    ING and Rabobank. They have for years financed 85% of the SMEs (Autoriteit Consument & Markt    2015). Autoriteit Consument & Markt (2015) claim there are no other banks that fund SMEs on a   large scale. The smaller banks that are active however focus on a specific market segment (Triodos   Bank  Deutsche Bank and Svenska Handelsbanken). Since 2008 a number of banks have been merged   or taken over  for instance the takeover of Friesland Bank by the Rabobank and Fortis Bank by ABN   AMRO. Furthermore  a number of banks decreased their lending activities to SMEs (Deutsche Bank)   or even stopped (SNS Bank). Deutsche Bank mentioned that they abandoned part of their SME   lending activities because the service model of customized loan approvals was not profitable   anymore (Het Financieele Dagblad  2016). Almost all SMEs with a loan have one at one of the three   major banks  see Figure 4.     Figure 4  Survey among 509 SMEs asking at which bank SMEs have a loan outstanding (Gfk  2014).     Figure 5  Survey among 509 SMEs asking what type of credit SMEs have at their particular bank (Gfk  2014).                                  19     Despite the need for more capital  SMEs use relatively few alternatives to bank financing. The Dutch   association of Banks (2016) claims 80% of SMEs are financed by banks loans and 20% by alternative   ways of finance. This last group mostly consists for more than 19% out of the traditional alternatives   informal investors (business angels)  leasing and factoring. New alternative ways of financing (i.e.   crowdfunding  credit unions  microfinancing  SME stock exchanges  institutional investment funds   etc.) are responsible for less than half a percent of total SME funding (Nederlandse Vereniging van   Banken  2016).    Regarding other countries  the market for alternative financing in the Netherlands is relatively young   and undeveloped (Financieel Dagblad  2016; Wardrop et al.  2015). However  the market for   alternative financing is currently growing fast.      Dutch banks had a total of €130 billion of loans issued to SMEs in 2016 (Nederlandse Vereniging van   Banken  2016). It can be seen from Figure 6 that most (85%) of the granted loans are smaller than   €250k. However  these loans make up for only 9% of the volume of all loans outstanding to SMEs   (Figure 7).     Granted bank loan amounts to SMEs 2016     <= € 0 25 mln     > € 0 25 mln and <= € 1 mln     > € 1 mln     5%     10%     85%     Figure 6  Bank loan amounts (De Nederlandsche Bank  2016).     Volume of granted loans by banks to SMEs in Q2 2016     <= € 0 25 mln     > € 0 25 mln and <= € 1 mln     > € 1 mln     9%     27%     64%     Figure 7  Volume of granted loans by Dutch banks to SMEs (De Nederlandsche Bank  2016).     Panteia (2016) researched that 72% of SMEs that applied for funding received the full amount  8%   received part of their request and 19% of applications got rejected. The rejection rates have   improved with regard to previous years. For instance in 2014  Panteia found that 38% of bank loan                       20               applications were rejected. Big corporations are more likely to receive the funding than SMEs   (Panteia  2016). For the classes small and medium companies (Table 1 and Table 2) the success rates   are higher than for micro companies. For micro companies the success rate was just 57% in the   period June 2015 – May 2016 (Panteia  2016). Henk Kamp  the Dutch Minister of Economic Affairs   claims that with micro and small companies 52% of loan applications got rejected and medium   companies 28% (NRC  2016).     SMEs orientated for a total of €18 billion from June 2015  May 2016 of which only €14 billion was   actually applied for (Panteia  2016). One can understand these numbers in the way that after first   orientation talks with banks or other suppliers of capital  these SMEs already feel their plans will not   have a big chance to be funded. On top of that  applying for funding requires much time. This   combination can make many SMEs decide not to apply. Looking at it from a broader perspective one   can conclude that € 4 billion of needed funding was already rejected before actually applying. Of the   amount actually applied for  28% got rejected fully totaling €3 92 billion (Panteia  2016). One can   therefore conclude that €4 + €3 92 = €7 92 billion of needed SME funding was not received in the   period June 2015 – May 2016. Looking at these numbers in this way  one could conclude that a little   more than half of the required funding  56%  was actually received.      According to Panteia (2016)  in general SMEs pay higher interest rates for loans than big companies   because funding SMEs is riskier. Micro companies pay the highest interest rate (about 1 6% more   than the average SME). Furthermore  Panteia (2016) claims that the most common reasons for   rejecting funding applications are too large risk  too low solvency and a too large debt comparing to   profit. 47% of the rejected companies claim that a rejection for a fund application had serious   consequences for growth impediment including not being able to invest. For 1% of the rejected SMEs   it meant discontinuation of the company (Panteia  2016). The average processing time of an   application for funding is seven weeks. The average processing time of an application for funding is   higher than what businesses deem acceptable (Panteia  2016).     Figure 8 composed by De Nederlandsche Bank (2016) indicates that the total amount of credit   supplied by Dutch monetary financial institutions (MFIs) to all nonfinancial corporations in the   country is decreasing since 2013. The Minister of Economic Affairs  Henk Kamp  confirms this in a   letter written in December 2016 to the Dutch House of Representatives. The credit volume   outstanding used to be on average €303 billion in 2013 and was on average €266 billion in 2016 (De   Nederlandsche Bank  2016). The biggest decreases are in the loans up to €250k (Hebbink  Kruidhof  &   Slingenberg  2014).                       21     Credit supply by Dutch MFIs to Dutch nonfinancial     corporations          20    15    10    5    0    5    %       10    2004 2005 2006 2007 2008 2009 2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015 2016    Monthly  growth  (Ras)    Annual  growth  (Las)    %       4 0    3 0    2 0    1 0    0 0    1 0    2 0         Figure 8  Growth/decline of credit supply by Dutch monetary financial institutions (De Nederlandsche Bank  2016).     Since 2016 the demand for credit is rising again after the demand dropped between 2009 and 2015   (Centraal Plan Bureau  2016).    10% of the SME loans are more than 90 days late with repayments and are monitored by special   departments of banks for accounts that experience repayment problems (Elsevier  2016). The   percentage of problem loans is currently declining suggesting a recovery in the economy   (Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken  2016). The percentage of problem loans compared to total   loans in the Netherlands is relatively low when compared with other European countries   (Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken  2016).     2.5  Difficulties in SMEs funding   Since the financial crisis  the funding landscape for SMEs changed dramatically. It is clear that before   the crisis banks were less critical towards loan applications and it was much easier for SMEs to get   funding (McKinsey & Company  2014). Practically all the media and academic articles after 2009   relating to SME funding mention that funding for SMEs became more difficult since the economic   crisis. Holton  Lawless & McCann (2013) proved that banks increase credit conditions when the   economy is weak. This section examines how these difficulties are caused.    Many academic articles mention SMEs as the group who appears to have great difficulty acquiring   financial means in the postcrisis time through traditional bank lending (Artola and Genre  2011;   Casey and Toole  2014; Mac an Bhaird  2013; Paulet  Parnaudeau and Abdessemed  2014). This   causes a measured negative effect on a firm’s investing activities (Artola and Genre  2011; Behr    Norden and Noth  2013; Mamica and Tridico  2014).      Wehinger (2014) mentions that European SMEs have been affected more by the crisis than American   ones. He also claims SMEs suffered a double blow since the crisis  on the one hand an important   decrease of demand of goods and services and on the other hand a tightening of credit conditions.                       22     Also McKinsey & Company (2014) confirms this. Wehinger (2014) claims SMEs are in general more   vulnerable in times of crises than big corporations for the following reasons  they are less diversified    have difficulties downsizing activities as they are already small  have weaker financial structures    little or no credit ratings and have fewer financing options. Mills (2014) confirms this. SMEs have less   buffer capacity  lower profit and reduced value of collateral since the crisis (Hebbink  Kruidhof  &   Slingenberg  2014). At last SMEs are often dependent on one main shareholder which is the engine   of the organization  making it more risky by definition. Large corporations are on average less risky    have lower operational costs and have a better negotiation position. They therefore pay a lower   interest than SMEs (Autoriteit Consument & Markt  2015).      According to Commissie Hoek (2013) the reduction in outstanding loans can on one hand be   explained by a decline in demand for funding of SMEs since the crisis. In a situation of economic   stagnation the demand for working capital  assets  housing and investment decreases. According to   Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken (2016)  the decreased domestic consumption and lower growth   expectations reduced demand for financing. Combined with the reduced risk appetite of banks  this   translated into a decrease in loan volume outstanding since 2013 as can be seen in Figure 8. The   demand for credit however (after a long time of decreasing demand) is rising since 2016 while the   acceptation criteria have not become milder  if not  more strict (Centraal Plan Bureau  2016).     According to McKinsey & Company (2014)  the number of problem loans has increased in the period   of 20082013 by at least four times. Currently  the number of problem loans is 10% of the total loans   issued (Elsevier  2016). Money which is lent out cannot be reinvested (NRC  2016). This forced banks   to tighten lending conditions. According to McKinsey and Company (2014)  banks admit they have   too easily issued loans before the crisis. Furthermore  they claim that lending to SMEs by itself has   become a lowprofit business. Monitoring and information costs are high and for relatively small   loans a lot of costly time is spent on the credit approval phase. The costs for risk judgment and other   handling costs are independent of the size of the loans (Kamp  2016). On top of that  SMEs are   frequently nontransparent making them more costly to judge (Baalhuis  2011). Kamp (2016) states   in his letter to the Dutch House of Representatives that the most important reason for the decrease   in the supply of funding is the stricter acceptation criteria of banks. According to him  mainly earning   capacity  the size of the firm  healthy cash flow and solvency figures are key for successfully   attracting funding.       In addition  McKinsey and Company (2014) note that increased capital requirements (Basel II and III)   made it even less attractive for banks in general to provide loans to the relatively risky SMEs. For   loans to small companies a bank needs to reserve 614% capital (McKinsey & Company  2014). In   relation to the high cost of administration of the loans  the yields are relatively low. Goverde (2016)   explains Basel II and III as “an international framework for liquidity risk measurement  standards and   monitoring for the banking sector. The objective of the reforms is to improve the banking sector’s   ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress  whatever the source  thus   reducing the risk of spillover from the financial sector to the real economy. During the economic   crisis  many banks were holding insufficient liquidity buffers and were not able to cope with credit   losses. The weaknesses in the banking sector were exposed to the financial system and real economy   and resulted in a massive contraction of liquidity and credit availability”.   Because of Basel II and III banks have to finance every loan with a minimum required amount of   equity. This means that banks are limited in their capacity to supply loans because of the equity                       23     restrictions. For riskier types of lending  such as SME lending  Basel III now requires banks to hold   additional capital. Dutch banks are forced to improve their capital ratios and there are three ways of   doing that  retain earnings (1)  raise new equity (2) or reducing the balance sheet total (3) (Het   Financieele Dagblad  2016). Raising new equity is extremely costly (and even impossible for the   major bank Rabobank due to their cooperative structure). Banks therefore decide to shorten their   balance sheet total which implies a cut in credit supply (SociaalEconomische Raad  2014).     De Nederlandsche Bank and Centraal Plan Bureau state that Basel III will have severe implications for   SME lending  especially because Dutch banks decide to process these standards even earlier than   2019 (SociaalEconomische Raad  2014). Basel III also requires banks to hold additional capital for   unused overdraft limits and working capital financing. Healthy SMEs (which deserve a lot lower risk   weight) are automatically at disadvantage. These higher risk weights will soon lead to a reduction in   lending  either in volume or by the price of credit. All in all  the new regulations of Basel III will   provide less room for SME lending and plans for Basel IV imply even more stringent capital   requirements (ICAEW  2017). Mainly SMEs with funding needs smaller than €250k will experience   trouble in the future because profits for banks will be too low or negative (SociaalEconomische   Raad  2014). A report of BNP Paribas is showing that economic growth is already and will be even   more limited due to the shortage of SME credit supply by banks (NRC  2016).     Mr. J. Koelewijn  professor of corporate finance at Nyenrode Business School states in Het   Financieele Dagblad (2017) that SMEs are ‘suffering’ from the tightening credit conditions of banks.   Banks are filling up their balance sheets with safe mortgages resulting in less money being available   to finance companies  especially SMEs. He also mentions that lots of SMEs in the Netherlands have   too low solvency which causes banks to restrain from financing. The demand for risk capital   therefore is emerging but banks generally do not supply this. Alternative financiers will have to fill   this gap up. Minister Kamp (2016) of Economic Affairs makes it also clear that there is a growing need   of risk capital for SMEs and that it is currently hard for SMEs to get access to alternative financing   options. The reason for this is that the knowledge about these financiers is lacking among businesses.   Also  the distribution function of these new alternatives form a bottleneck. Generally  there is capital   from alternative financiers available and there is plenty of demand from SMEs as well. However it is   difficult for the suppliers and customers to find each other.    Furthermore  Benthem (2016) states that the cost of capital of alternative finance is perceived as   high in contrast to traditional financing (whether this is true or not) and is perceived as rather an   option for constrained companies. He concludes that alternative finance organizations are troubled   with image and trust complications resulting in them being overlooked by SMEs. Ecorys (2016)   mentions that entrepreneurs are having difficulties finding the right funding party because of the   abundance of new alternatives. Benthem (2016) states that alternative finance can be a solution for   the current SME financing complication.      Concluding  this section described the difficulties on the financial market for SMEs in the Netherlands   and its reasons. The need for other financing options is evident. The main problem is that these   alternatives are relatively unknown to SMEs. This problem was described by previous references and   is reported frequently in recent newspaper articles of ‘Het Financieele Dagblad’. Therefore in the   following chapter the alternative financing options are researched and described.                    24                  3  Alternative financing options   In this chapter  the alternative financing options which are available to Dutch SMEs are discussed. It   is assumed that the traditional financing activities of banks are well known to a reader of this thesis   and are only shortly elaborated. It is chosen to elaborate first on traditional alternative financing   options and subsequently on new alternatives (since the ’07’08 financial crisis) which are suitable for   MM&C’s SME clients. New financing options which are suitable for SMEs in general but not for   MM&C clients are listed in section 3.4. It is discussed why these are not suitable for MM&C’s clients   because these arguments are also regarded as added value to the research.    As mentioned in section 2.2.1  MM&C has no starting SME clients (<3 years lifetime). All clients are   established enterprises with long track records. MM&C provides mainly funding for their SME clients   starting at €500k up until €5m. Most financing options which are mentioned are ones that supply   funding in this range. However  some financing options available fund significantly smaller amounts.   The ones which finance up until €250k are still chosen to be included in the list because they can   form part of a total funding solution consisting of multiple financiers.      3.1  Literature methodology   It was preferable to use most recent academic and professional literature because rapid   developments in alternative financing options make literature about this topic fairly quickly   outdated. As several financing alternatives exist since long before the crisis  prefinancial crisis   academic papers  professional literature and government reports have also been used. Websites and   books were used as well. Only academic papers until 2009 with an above average number of   citations were used and all relevant academic papers from 2010 on the topic of alternative financing   were used. In practice mainly recent (20132016) professional literature and research commissioned   by the Dutch government were used. It was discovered that academic literature is lagging behind   regarding the current developments on the Dutch financing market.     3.2  Visits to alternative finance seminars and fairs   The literature about alternative financing that was used did provide useful information but did not   supply enough details and exact information about how these alternative financiers operate and   what their conditions are. It was therefore decided to visit four events which all had a plenary session   and a fair with alternative financiers present. These visits made it possible to properly investigate   these financiers by consulting representatives of these institutions. A great deal of the information   about these new financiers in the following section and how they operate come from noted   conversations with these representatives. Statements of these representatives were as far as   possible verified with literature and discussed with experienced financial experts of MM&C. Also   professional literature could be verified with practice this way. The following events (translated from   Dutch to English) were visited and described in the following order  date  event title  organizer and   location.                   29092016  “Day of the new funding”  Rabobank  Tilburg;   05102016  “Alternative finance”  Municipality of Almere  Almere;    15112016  “New funding event”  KroeseWevers Accountants  Enschede;    29112016  “Special Financing”  Synpact and MKB Nederland  Utrecht.                    25                  3.3     Suitable traditional and alternative financing options for MM&C and   their characteristics.     First  the traditional (and traditional alternative) financing options are described and subsequently   the newly emerged alternatives. A list of names of each financing option is listed in the tool.     3.3.1  Banks (traditional)    MM&C’s experience is that secured loans from banks are a lowcost source of financing (36 %   interest). Current accounts supplied by banks are particularly interesting when a business needs   working capital or if the business experiences strong seasonal fluctuations (De Hooge Waerder    2017). Current accounts are generally more expensive than regular loans because there is no fixed   repayment scheme (De Hooge Waerder  2017). Huijgens (2016)  Het Financieele Dagblad (2016) and   MM&C note that banks mostly fund firms starting at €250k.    One notable initiative named Rabo&Co started was started in May 2016 by a major bank in the   Netherlands  Rabobank. The idea of Rabo&Co is to issue loans to SMEs which are for 50% supplied by   wealthy private investors who are looking for higher gains on their capital (Het Financieele Dagblad    2016). When the Rabobank wants to lend to an SME but cannot fully provide the loan because of   either Basel capital restrictions or the risk  half of the loan can be provided by a private investor. In   this way the bank can still fulfill its core function  namely judging loan applications and lending   money but now without having to state too many loans on their balance sheet. With this initiative    the Rabobank banks can provide loans to SMEs they could otherwise not have. On top of that    unused liquid assets from investors can be invested in the Dutch economy. Private investors will pay   a premium (1%) to the Rabobank for their credit approval process and their monitoring function   (Elsevier  2016). Interest rates are around 3% to 8% and it is an online platform (Het Financieele   Dagblad  2016). Investors have to take part with at least €100k  implying loans amounts for SMEs   start at €200k. It is a 5050 cooperation between the bank and the private investor implying the risks   are shared as well.     3.3.2  Funding from nonfinancial institutions (traditional alternatives)      Informal investors     3.3.2.1   S. Dolmans (2015) explains informal investors as wealthy individuals aiming to invest equity in   companies in order to make a profit. A subcategory of informal investors are socalled business   angels  who are closely involved with the company in which they invest. The advantage is that they   often bring their own network and knowledge on top of the fact that SMEs have an important   ambassador. This involvement can also be a disadvantage  often investors want control because they   own shares in the company. Investments are usually in the range of €25k  €250k. Investors look for   high growth  scalable business models and a strong business forecast keeping in mind an exit   strategy in the longterm (35 years). Business angels usually invest in the starting or high growth   phase of the business and often prefer to invest in their region of residence or with people they   know (S. Dolmans  2015). Business angels also can supply risk capital in the form of subordinated   loans (Matchinvest  2016).     It is also possible that managers of a business can supply equity finance in return for partial   ownership of the firm. It is chosen not to define this type of finance as management buyouts or buy  ins (MBO or MBI) because an MBO or MBI implies taking over a large part or the entire business.   MBOs and MBIs are only practiced when businesses are being sold. Wanting to sell a business cannot                       26     be regarded as a financing need. If a manager wants to fund a business by buying part of the   company’s shares  he or she can be seen as informal investor.     Supplier credit     3.3.2.2   If a business’s current creditor days are low (i.e. 1545 days)  it can consider asking their suppliers for   a longer payment period (i.e. 90 days). This is a costless way to raise working capital (no interest)    however it can result in missing out on discounts terms provided by suppliers when paying on short   notice.     Vendor loan     3.3.2.3   When a business wants to purchase expensive assets and can only pay a part of the purchasing price   immediately  it can arrange a loan from the vendor for the remaining price of the asset. This is a   relatively lowcost type of loan and often vendors offer to finance part of the price of the asset in   order to make more sales. This type of finance is also suitable for acquisitions whereby the prior   owner supplies a loan for part of the acquisition price to the buyer.        3.3.3  Leasing (traditional alternative)   Leasing is a traditional alternative for financing and widely used by companies nowadays. There are   two types of leasing  financial and operational lease. In the case of financial lease  the lessee is (or   will be) the owner of the object being financed and the asset will therefore appear on the balance   sheet. With operational lease  the lessor remains owner (and thus is responsible for functioning) of   the asset which does not appear on the balance sheet. Therefore operational lease can be compared   with rent. A firm with low solvency can use operational leasing (in contrast with buying an asset) to   influence financial ratios positively (Huijgens  2016). Leasing is suitable for funding assets such as   machines or vehicles and does not need to be expensive from MM&C’s experience. Lease institutions   are specialized in knowledge on the value of their assets over time which serves as collateral. Leasing   is provided by banks or specialized lease institutions.     3.3.4  Factoring (traditional alternative)   Factoring is a traditional financing alternative and is together with leasing the most used alternative   to conventional bank loans (Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken  2016). Factoring is used often in   combination with bank loans. Goverde (2016) states in her research the following definition of   factoring  “factoring account receivables is an economic decision whereby a specialized firm assumes   the responsibility for the administration and control of a company’s debtor portfolio. It is a method   for raising shortterm capital in exchange of selling trade debts at a discount  or for a prescribed fee   and interest. The customer of the client firm becomes the debtor of the factor and thus  has to pay   the factor directly”.    It can be helpful by solving cashflow problems of a business as companies in the Netherlands pay on   average after 54 days (Het Financieele Dagblad  2016). Before financing a client  a factor will first   check the creditworthiness of their client’s debtors. Based on this  from MM&C’s experience the   factor will finance a certain percentage (60%  90%) of the client’s debtor portfolio. Clients are not   able to select which debtors to factor. In the case that 90% of the invoices are factored  it is often   required for the firm to have trade credit insurances. Factoring has benefits especially for companies   which have late accounts receivable and therefore suffering from cash flow problems. Factoring is   suitable for growing firms because the funding grows along with the size of the debtor’s portfolio   (Nationale Financierings Wijzer  2016). The costs of factoring is dependent on the risk profile of the   clients’ debtors  the total amount of turnover  the financial situation of the company and the debtor                       27     collection period. The costs of factoring are on average between 3% and 6% of the turnover of the   invoices and higher for nonrecourse factoring (appendix II). Factors are mainly banks or separate   factoring institutions.      3.3.5  Private Equity Firms (traditional alternative)   A private equity firm is an organized group of informal investors investing in a company. They   provide capital in exchange for shares of the company and (temporary) coowner rights   (Ondernemersplein  2016). In some cases private equity firms provide subordinated loans although   this is not their core activity (Huijgens  2016). Also fast growing startups belong to this group. In this   case it is called venture capital. Because MM&C does not have starting SMEs as clients  it is decided   to not go into further detail on venture capital firms.    Often private equity firms are specialized in company life phases or industry branches. Minimum   investments for private equity firms start at €1m (Ondernemersplein  2016). Cooperation with a   private equity firm mostly lasts no longer than five years (NVP  2016). Huijgens (2016) claims that   private equity firms cooperate with a firm for 47 years. The NVP (2016) states that the most   common reason for using private equity finance are  growth by internationalization  acquisitions    changing financing structures of firms  financing IPOs or taking companies of the stock exchange.   Cooperation with a private equity firm not only supplies funding but also specific knowledge and   network (Nationale Financierings Wijzer  2016).   Since 1981 the first private equity firm started operating in the Netherlands (Huijgens  2016). About   1400 companies in the Netherlands are financed by private equity firms and in 2015 private equity   firms invested €3 3 billion in 348 companies (NVP  2016). 83% of the private equity finance is   invested in SMEs but mainly for medium sized companies. 87% of the investments were smaller than   €5m (NVP  2016). Private equity firms are only interested in big investments with potentially high   gains when exiting and selling their stock. 70 private equity firms are active in the Netherlands   (Ondernemersplein  2016).      Individual invoice factoring (new alternative)     3.3.6   Online individual invoice factoring institutions comprehend the same idea of factoring but the only   difference is that individual invoices are sold to the factoring company. Some individual invoice   factors match tobesold invoices with individual investors  creating a marketplace where SMEs with   invoices can sell to investors. To estimate the risk  these factoring companies mostly use machine   learning and big data (Het Financieele Dagblad  2016). The price is about the same as described in   the previous description of conventional factoring. Individual invoices are not factored by banks.      3.3.7  Regional Development Companies (new alternative)   All Dutch provinces have their own private equity firms meant for financing companies in the region.   Their goal is to strengthen the regional economy. Funding supplied by regional development   companies (RDCs) is in the form of risk capital  so either subordinated loans or equity finance   (Ondernemersplein  2016). The specific goals of RDCs differ per region but it is mainly for promoting   risky innovation and development of SMEs (innovative product and services)  enhancing employment   opportunities  restructuring deteriorated business parks  inviting foreign companies to settle in the   Netherlands and prevent Dutch companies from moving abroad (Ondernemersplein  2016). A   regional development company can be a suitable source of finance  especially for companies with   highrisk profile (Nationale Financierings Wijzer  2016). The RDCs see it as their task to invest in risky   companies with high potential because private parties often find it too risky to invest in. In 2016 all                       28     RDCs combined had €320m available for investing (Het Financieele Dagblad  2016). RDCs offer   expertise and provide finance for both startups and established companies which have innovation    expansion or acquisition plans (Ecorys  2016). More than half of the funding in the Netherlands for   innovative startups is supplied by RDCs (NVP  2016).   It is difficult to compare different RDCs because they differ in size and each one’s capacity to finance   is dependent on what the government supplies (Ecorys  2016). Five RDCs are partly owned and   subsidized by the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs and these are therefore the ones with the   largest investment capacity. These are named in the following list together with their finance   capacity and provinces they operate in.     LIOF (€102 3m  Limburg);          Brabantse Ontwikkelingsmaatschappij (BOM) (€86 3m  NoordBrabant);     Oost N.V. (€64 5m  Gelderland  Overijssel);     Noordelijke Ontwikkelingsmaatschappij (NOM) (€39 1m  Friesland  Groningen  Drenthe);        Innovation Quarter (€20 0m  ZuidHolland).     Each of these five RDCs focus their funding on particular industry branches which are related to the   regional economic policies of their provinces (Ecorys  2016). The remaining RDCs (OMFL Flevoland    NHN NoordHolland  Impuls Zeeland  OMU Utrecht) have significantly less resources (range €110m)   as they are not supported by the Ministry (Ecorys  2016). In the tool these latter RDCs can still appear   in the funding proposal  however the user must note a small chance of funding from these non  government supported RDCs.    The maximum amount an RDC can invest in a single SME is €2 5m (Het Financieele Dagblad  2016).   RDCs start investing at €100k  making it lower than the minimum of private equity firms because   RDCs also finance innovative starters (NVP  2016).      Institutional Investment funds (new alternative)     3.3.8   In the Netherlands exist several investment funds that enable institutional investors like pension   funds and insurance companies to invest directly into Dutch SMEs. For pension funds and insurance   companies individual investments in SMEs are too small  costly and timeconsuming. They prefer   bundling their money into one investment fund that invests it for them in SMEs. Several institutional   investment fund credit managers which finance SMEs are Neos  FundIQ and the Subordinated Loan   Fund (ALF).    Neos provides loans (and subordinated loans) between €250k and €10m with a maximum duration of   7 years (Neos  2016). Often a loan of Neos will be part of a total funding solution in cooperation with   a bank where Neos receives underprivileged collateral rights. FundIQ is also an investment fund   which manages capital from wealthy individuals and provides fully subordinated loans in the range of   €250k  €2 5m for a maximum of 6 years (FundIQ  2016).    ALF invests only in subordinated loans to Dutch SMEs in combination with bank loans (Aegon Asset   Management  2016). The idea is that an SME applies for a loan at a bank and in the case the bank   judges the loan too risky for the full amount  the bank can cooperate with the ALF (subordinated   loan) to fully finance the SME. Mostly the SME needs to attend this possibility at the bank. It is a 50  50 cooperation. To encourage economic growth  the Dutch Government guarantees 50% of the   losses on the principal amount of the subordinated loans of the ALF to its institutional investors. ALF   loans range from €150k  €5m with a duration of maximum eight years and the SME needs to be                       29     existent for at least three years. This implies that the funding need should be at least €300k and at   the utmost €10m (Aegon Asset Management  2016).      A subordinated loan issued by these institutional investment funds make it easier for banks to   finance an SME afterwards because these loans increase the SME’s solvency (a subordinated loan can   be seen as owners’ equity). SMEs are often in the core healthy companies but have too little   collateral or equity to provide security for the bank. Funds investing in subordinated loans are only   getting paid back when the bank (or sometimes even after all creditors) has been paid back. These   loans are riskier and result in higher interest rates (10+%) than the bank. However combining a high   interest subordinated loan with a normal lowinterest bank loan can still result in decent costs.    Institutional investment funds are becoming increasingly interesting for pension funds  insurance   companies and wealthy individuals to invest in because in 2015 they have made striking low (and   even negative) returns since the European Central Bank lowered interest rates (Het Financieele   Dagblad  2016). Het Financieele Dagblad (2016) also note that experts expect returns for pension   funds to be structurally lower in the coming years and they search other investments opportunities   (for instance these investment funds) in order to fulfill their future payment obligations.     3.3.9  SMEs stock exchange (new alternative)   NPEX is an online stock exchange in the Netherlands that focuses specifically on SMEs with growth   plans. Companies can issue shares or issue bonds through this platform. Contrary to the normal stock   exchange (i.e. Euronext)  shares and bonds of SMEs are not exchanged as rapidly. Companies can   attract capital from investors at a minimum amount of €500k either via issuing shares or bonds   (NPEX  2016). A listing is relatively expensive if the SME needs less than €1m as the preparations are   timeconsuming (Huijgens  2016). An SME that wants to participate must be existent for at least   three years and have been profitable for at least one year. Furthermore  a firm wanting to go to the   stock exchange must be stable and have a solid track record. The SME stock exchanges focus on   companies that are looking for growth capital amounting between € 500k and € 10m   (Ondernemersplein  2016). NPEX standardized its processes so that companies can be listed faster   and cheaper than a regular exchange. The costs for being listed consist of a single listing fee and a   fixed annual fee together with a premium for the number of investors in the company (NPEX  2016).   Partly funding an SME with equity via this stock exchange can make it more interesting for banks to   provide loans. On the NPEX website there are currently 28 listings listed which partly consists of   investment funds as well. The total amount of tradable assets on the NPEX exchange was €474m on   1632017 (NPEX  2016). Alternatives for NPEX are Enternext  a European orientated SME Stock   Exchange which has in total 750 listings in the Netherlands  Belgium  France and Portugal. A   disadvantage of a stock exchange for an SME is the mandatory information duty (i.e. public yearly   and half yearly financial statements) and the lengthy process prior to listing.      3.3.10  Crowdfunding (new alternative)   Baardwijk (2014) gives the following definition of crowdfunding  “the process where a twosided   market is formed by a request from entrepreneurs to a relatively large number of investors (‘the   crowd’) to provide relative low investments amounts each for funding in exchange for a form of   value  generally supported by a webbased platform”. A total of 140 crowdfunding platforms are   active of which only 10 are responsible for 99% of the market volume in the Netherlands (BNR    2016). In 2015 businesses have been crowdfunded for a total of €128m (Nederlandse Vereniging van   Banken  2016). This is more than double the amount in 2014. Crowdfunding seems to be growing                       30     fast; only in the first half of 2016 businesses have already been crowdfunded for €86m already   (Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken  2016). Each crowdfunding platform differs in target audience   and method. Some platforms focus on a niche and specialize in for instance only sustainable   businesses  like One Planet Crowd.     Spotcap (2016) discusses that a successful campaign can provide a lot of exposure and is fairly   accessible to start. Furthermore  it is tested right away if there is a demand in the public for the   product or service. Disadvantages are that crowdfunding campaigns do not always get the desired   amount (all or nothing principle)  the entire process could take months and starting a campaign can   be timeconsuming. Moreover  the high degree of visibility could also have adverse effects and most   often entrepreneurs are held personally liable because crowdfunding platforms do not have licenses   to pledge.     Having talked to multiple account managers of crowdfunding platforms  it can be concluded that   loans of more than €250k rarely occur. On average businesses had been crowdfunded for €90k   (Nederlandse Vereniging van Banken  2016). Occasionally it occurs that a loan in the range of €1m   has been issued but this is rarely the case in the Netherlands. Furthermore  crowdfunding platforms   mostly accept businesses that have at least a 23 year track record  unless it is an exceptionally good   business plan. Lending is the most dominant form of crowdfunding which needs to be paid back in a   period of 45 years on most crowdfunding platforms. Crowdfunding also can take place in the form of   donations  rewards or equity (S. Dolmans  2015). In the case of equity financing the advantage is that   the owner does not lose a lot of power over the business as opposed to private equity firms or   informal investors. Representatives from crowdfunding agencies disclose that interest rates on loans   vary from project to project but are in general slightly higher (average 8%) than bank loans. Funded   companies however also have to pay a percentage commission (usually about 2% of the loan) and a   €500 fee when being actually listed on the platform.   It is decided to include crowdfunding as a financing option for clients of MM&C because a loan from   a crowdfunding campaign of €250k can be part of a total funding solution.     3.3.11  Online credit suppliers (new alternative)   Spotcap is an online supplier of credit  mainly for the purpose of supplying working capital. By using   data and algorithms in combination with investing knowledge this firm can quickly decide (12 days)   whether a company qualifies for a loan. In contrast to banks wherein the average application takes   seven weeks to get a decision (Panteia  2016). Spotcap issues loans ranging from € 10k  € 250k and it   can be chosen to repay in a period of 3  15 months (Spotcap  2016). No collateral is required.   Interest rates are about 1012% for a one year loan (Spotcap  2016). Lendico is another online credit   supplier operating in a similar way but supplies loans for multiple purposes up to 5 years as well   (Lendico  2017). Because Spotcap and Lendico each finance a maximum of €250k  it can still be used   for MM&C’s clients when combining it with other sources of finance as well.     3.3.12  Government   In total the Dutch government provides around 2600 types of guarantee schemes  loans and   subsidies on regional  national and European level (Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland  2016).      Government Guarantee schemes      3.3.12.1   Nationale Financieringswijzer (2016) and Kamp (2016) note that through various arrangements the   Dutch government wants to stimulate growth of SMEs. The most important ones suitable for                       31     MM&C’s clients are the SME Guarantee arrangement (BMKB) and Growth Facility (GF) arrangement.   With the BMKB arrangement  the Dutch Government secures (not supply) a maximum of 50% on the   total loan issued by a bank in the case an SME defaults. The bank can make use of the BMKB   arrangement if it decides that the loan is too risky or if there are not enough securities available. The   BMKB is the most widely used guarantee scheme and exists since 1915  however not all SMEs know it   exists. The government can guarantee the bank to cover a maximum loss of €1 5m on a total loan of   €3m provided by the bank (Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland  2016). To make use of this   scheme  the SME has to pay the government 4 8% premium on the amount that the government   secures (Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend Nederland  2016). It is often the case that the SME needs to   attend the bank of the BMKB arrangement if the bank is reluctant to supply the full amount of a loan.   The BMBK guarantee makes it possible for SMEs to receive the full loan in the case banks deem the   SME too risky.   The same idea goes for the Growth Facility arrangement. The only difference is that the Government   backs up a maximum of 50% of the risk capital (share capital or subordinated loans) invested in an   SME by a private equity firm or an issuer of subordinated loans.       Another government initiative is the Innovation fund SME+ (Innovatiefonds MKB+). SMEs with risky   innovative projects (max 5 years) can apply for these loans. The government is willing to partly   finance (2545% of the costs) risky fast growing projects as they are often too risky for banks (NRC    2014). Innovative projects include substantial technical risks and therefore financial risk. Both   starting and established SMEs can utilize this facility. NRC (2014) notes that these loans are only   provided if at least half of the total loan amount is supplied by another party. The innovation fund   SME+ will finance a minimum of €150k and a maximum of €10m on a project (710% interest rate)   and if the project fails the loans is exempted from being repaid (Rijksdienst voor Ondernemend   Nederland  2016). There are also other funds that the Dutch government provides which are not   suitable for MM&C’s clients such as the fund for upcoming markets for SME that are willing to invest   in developing countries and the seed capital fund which supplies equity finance for innovative   starting businesses.       Subsidies     3.3.12.2   A subsidy is a temporary or permanent grant supplied by the government for activities which are of   general interest and cannot be carried out by the government but it does want to encourage. There   are hundreds of grants available which are mainly suitable for specific sectors or for firms that are   highly innovative and are engaged in research and development. Businesses frequently complain   about the fact that it is hard to find the suitable subsidies in this ‘jungle’. In order to get a shortlist of   the available subsidies relevant for a particular financing need of an SME  the website   ‘www.open4b.nl/almerebus’ is able to filter the suitable available subsidies.      3.4  Alternative financing options unsuitable for MM&C     3.4.1  Credit Unions (new alternative)   A credit union is a nonprofit cooperation between entrepreneurs from the same sector  profession   or region  which lend each other money. Wealthy members make money available to fellow   entrepreneurs which is then allocated by the credit union board to entrepreneurs. The starting point   for the credit union is to provide coaching to fellow entrepreneurs to whom money is lent. Credit   unions are suitable for companies with a relatively low risk until €250k which need long or shortterm                       32     loans (De Hooge Waerder  2017). Financing investments exceeding €250k can be possible when   credit unions work together with other sources of financing (Nationale Financierings Wijzer  2016). A   disadvantage of credit unions is that it is only accessible when the SME is part of a specific region    industry or profession. This also means that the available capital is dependent on the wealth of the   members of the union. The goal is to improve the community and not necessarily make profits.   Profits are used to fund other projects or part of it is shared among members. Borrowing money via a   credit union is often cheaper than at a bank and SMEs have better access to specialized knowledge.   Both borrowers and lenders are coowners of the credit union.   Although credit unions finance projects until €250k and could be part of a funding combination  the   reason for not including credit unions as suitable financiers for MM&C’s clients is because the   decision process within credit unions is too slow. Representatives of credit unions mention that it is   often the case that there is not a central amount deposited and being managed by one credit   committee. Instead  every member investor who is willing to invest a part of the amount will decide   for themselves. This results in a lengthy decision process. Furthermore  the Dutch Minister of   Economic Affairs H. Kamp (2016) states that financing capacity of credit unions is limited  although   there is abundant interest in developing credit unions. Only €4 6m has been used by ten credit   unions to finance SMEs in the Netherlands (Kamp  2016). It must be noted that it is unclear from this   source in exactly which time period is referred to. No other sources were found with more accurate   data on the financing volume of credit unions. Nevertheless  it can be concluded from this source   that their financing capacity is indeed limited. Huijgens (2016) notes there are few credit unions that   are actually active. Many however are in preparation. Huijgens (2016) expects that credit unions will   be able to finance more than €250k in the near future.     3.4.2  Microfinancing (new alternative)   Starting and established entrepreneurs who need maximum €250k for setting up or expanding their   business can make use of microfinancing. MKB service desk (2016) notes that Qredits is the only   micro financier (loans up to €50k) in the Netherlands for starting businesses. Qredits is a nonprofit   organization and was introduced by the Dutch government. Qredits offers beside ‘microcredit’ also   ‘SME credit’ (MKBservicedesk  2016). Qredits (2016) states that microcredits are loans up to €50k   mainly meant for starting entrepreneurs. Interest rates start at 9 75% per year. Kerste & Weda   (2016) mention that since the start of Qredits until July 2015 a total of €98 5m microcredit has been   issued. ‘SME credit’ is a loan from € 50k  € 250k and are meant mainly for starting entrepreneurs as   well. Interest rates start at 8 75%. It is also possible to receive subordinated loans since 2016    evidently for higher interest rates (Kamp  2016). This type of credit is mainly meant for businesses   whose bank loans applications have been rejected. A disadvantage is that Qredits demands that the   borrower is held personally liable. In addition to the loans  Qredits offers the possibility to receive   paid coaching which is often as important as the loan itself for starting businesses.   The ‘microcredit’ and ‘SME credit’ options of Qredits are mainly meant for starting entrepreneurs   and therefore have not been included in the finance decision support tool.      There is also another moneylender which lends on small scale namely ‘PIN Voorschot’. The difference   with Qredits is that their purpose is not to help businesses start but provide solutions for established   businesses in the form of down payments and working capital. In January 2015 ‘PIN Voorschot’ was   launched. They offer short (612 months) loans from € 2k  € 50k to businesses which have facilities   for paying with debit cards (European Merchant Finance  2016). The maximum loan is dependent on                       33     the weekly turnover by a shops’ paybycard terminal. Interest rates start at 9% for a half year loan   and 19% for a loan of a year (European Merchant Finance  2016). The loan is repaid by charging a   percentage of the paybycard terminal turnover which automatically goes back to PIN Voorschot.   Several advantages are that loans can be approved in several days and no collateral is required. The   loans are mainly aimed for healthy businesses with a proven paybycard turnover. The idea is that   business can purchase extra stock  new equipment or a makeover/expansion (European Merchant   Finance  2016).   The reason to not include ‘PIN Voorschot’ is because the maximum of €50k is too little for MM&C’s   clients  even when it is part of a total funding combination.     3.5  Conclusion    The complete list of financing options in section 3.3 is used when creating a funding proposal for a   client of MM&C. The financing options of section 3.4 are not used because of the arguments   mentioned. It must be noted from experience of the four visited events that the alternative financing   market is developing rapidly. Frequently  new private initiatives emerge as well as governmental   ones resulting from new incentive policies. In general  the returns demanded from alternative   financing options is relatively high compared with the interest rates traditional financial institutions   provide (Benthem  2016).                                                                        34     4  Funding decision support tool   In this chapter the created finance decision support tool is described. The tool is made to aid MM&C   in selecting appropriate financiers for a certain funding need of their clients. It is made with the use   of Microsoft Excel and is (only) suitable for      Established SMEs (>3 years lifetime);   SMEs of the small and medium segment  so excluding the micro segment (section 2.2);             A funding need starting at €500k;        Dutch ‘Besloten Vennootschappen’ (U.S.A.  limited liability company).     SMEs of all industries;     The reasons for adapting the tool to this segment of SMEs is made clear from section 1.1 and 2.2.1.   To give the reader a general interpretation of the functioning of the tool  first a conceptual overview   is given. From section 4.2 onwards  the choices and assumptions used for the design are reported   and elaborated on. Furthermore  the tool is explained more accurately.      4.1 Conceptual overview   In the conceptual overview  the steps that the user will need to go through to achieve a funding   proposal are displayed in Figure 9 and Figure 10           Figure 9  Highlevel conceptual overview of the funding decision support tool.

This   stage is discussed in section 4.2.1. Subsequently  questions about the company and funding goals will   need to be answered (section 4.2.2) and the user can decide to score on criteria resulting in a credit   rating for the SME as well (4.2.3). The black box is not a user step in the process but can be   considered as ‘the engine’ of the tool. Amongst other functionalities  the black box’s main task is to   select the suitable financing options according to input given in step 1 and step 2. The suitable   financing options for the selected funding goals will be displayed in step 4. Frequently  there are   multiple financing options suitable for a company’s financing need. Depending on the input of the   financial statements in step 1 and the questions in step 2  advice will be given on the most   appropriate financing options to select. Correspondingly  the user must select the most suitable   financing option for every funding goal in step 4 to examine the influence on the balance sheet after   funding in step 5.     4.2 Input (step 1 2 & 3)     4.2.1  Financial statements (step 1)   The major financial statements aim to give an overview of the financial position and performance of   a firm (Atrill & McLaney  2011). The financial statements in the tool have been made in accordance   with the Dutch Civil Law Code on models of financial statements.    The financial statements consist of the profit and loss account (P&L)  balance sheet and the   statement of cash flows which are interrelated. The P&L account is used to measure how much   wealth (profit or loss) is generated in a certain period (Atrill & McLaney  2011). The balance sheet   states the accumulated wealth of a firm at a particular time moment (Atrill & McLaney  2011). It sets   out the firm’s assets and the claims (equity and liabilities) against the firm. MM&C considers   subordinated debt as part of owner’s equity on the balance sheet because when a company defaults   they are the last to receive any part of the proceeds. Subordinated debt can therefore be defined as   risk capital. The statement of cash flows deals with the cash movements that took place over a   particular period (Atrill & McLaney  2011). It shows the sources and uses of cash for a period and   reveals the amount of cash the company has on hand. Each statement itself provides only a part of   the information on a company’s financial status. Together they provide a complete picture   (Investopedia  2017).      The user is asked to first fill in the profit and loss account and the balance sheet from three years ago   until two years in the future. This implies that on the completion date of this thesis (3132017)  the   years 2014 until 2018 are asked to be filled in for both statements. MM&C consultants consider it   important to look at the history of a firm’s financial position and to a larger extent its financial   performance as it is often a predictor of the future. A prognosis can be made fairly well for the   current year and the one after. After this time prognoses tend to become unreliable according to   MM&C.      The balance sheet in the tool contains a separate ‘revaluation’ column to adjust the balance sheet of   the previous year. MM&C notes that when financing businesses  financiers compare the market   value with the book value of assets on the most recent auditor’s annual account. This is done in   order for financiers to more accurately judge the collateral capacity of a business which is further   elaborated in section 4.2.1.2. Suppose on 31122016 the inventory of a business was valued €250k   on the balance sheet by the auditor. However  the inventory is actually worth €175 because part of                       36     the inventory appears to be damaged and therefore cannot be resold in case of company default.   The user of the tool is then able to mutate the value on the 2016 balance sheet conveniently   resulting in an adjusted balance sheet 2016 after revaluation.    The adjusted balance sheet after revaluation also takes into account deferred taxes in the case of   increased value adjustments of assets. Suppose it is decided to increase the value of a machine by   €100k  around 2025% of this amount will be stated as a provision for deferred tax on the balance   sheet and the remaining part is added to owner’s equity.     Completing financial statements of five years requires the user to spend a decent amount of time but   it forms a good overview of the company’s financial performance and position. The financial   statements are made in a format which can be displayed to financiers when applying for funding. In   the case the user has little time  it is only necessary to fill in the balance sheet of 2016 together with   its revaluations in order to receive a funding proposal in step 4. The financial statements have been   made suitable for production firms as well service firms.      The financial statements need to be completed before completing the second input sheet ‘questions’   (step 2) because when determining funding goals and collateral available for financiers  values are   used from the adjusted balance sheet of 2016.     4.2.1.1 Financial ratios   An additional advantage of completing the financial statements is that multiple financial ratios can be   automatically derived. Atrill & McLaney (2011) state that “Financial ratios provide a quick and   relatively simple means of assessing the financial health of a business. By calculating the ratios it is   possible to build up a revealing picture of the performance and strengths and weaknesses. There is   no generally accepted list of ratios that can be applied to financial statements”. It is decided to   automatically calculate the ratios that MM&C considers relevant when it comes to decisionmaking   on funding. In collaboration with MM&C consultants it is decided that the tool incorporates the   following ratios which are important for making credit decisions       1.  Current ratio;   2.  Quick ratio;   3.  Working capital;   4.  Solvency;   5.  Accounts receivable days;   6.  Accounts payable days;   7.  Earning capacity EBITDA(L);   8.  Net debt/EBITDA(L);   9.  Debt service coverage ratio;   10. Interest coverage ratio;   11. Free cash flow.      The definition  meaning and interpretation of these ratios can be found in appendix III.      In particular the solvency  earning capacity EBITDA(L) and free cash flow are important ratios when   financing a business. This is explained in section 4.4.1.1 on funding guidelines.   The only ratio that can only be partly derived from the financial statements is the free cash flow   (FCF). It measures the cash flow available for distribution to all company stockholders (Investopedia                        37     2016). It can be regarded as cash available after the financing of projects to maintain or expand the   asset base. Companies with a higher operating and free cash flow tend to have higher share value   (Investopedia  2016).   The FCF surplus/deficit is the net profit after tax plus depreciation minus the change in working   capital minus capital expenditures. The operating cash flow is calculated likewise  but without the   capital expenditures (Investopedia  2016).    The calculation of the operational cash flow is automatically derived from the profit and loss account   and balance sheet. The FCF is partly automatically derived from the profit and loss account (net profit   after tax  depreciation) and balance sheet (mutations in provisions  working capital and longterm   debt). The user will still need to manually fill in the cash movements of dividend payments  capital   contribution by shareholders  investment expenses or other expenses of each year resulting in the   FCF surplus or deficit. The reason for this is that dividend payments and capital contribution reflect in   the equity account but cannot necessarily be derived directly. Investments expenses reflect in   mutations of asset values but cannot be derived directly either.     4.2.2  Questions (step 2)   The second input sheet requires the user to first fill in questions about the firm  name  number of   employees  industry and the region of the Netherlands the firm is operating in. The industry and the   number of employees need to be known in order to compare the company with other companies of   the same industry and employee amount category. It is decided to let the user choose the industry   from the ‘Standard Industrial Classifications 2008’ list (SBI 2008) which is composed by the Central   Bureau of statistics (CBS  2017). This list is on itself based on the industry activity classification of the   European Union (NACE). This information is compared in the black box to data mainly from the   Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) which is described in section 4.3.3 and subsequently displayed in   the output in step 4 (section 4.4.1). The region the firm is based in is demanded so that if a regional   development company (RDC) is listed as a suitable financing option  it automatically generates the   name and other information of the RDC which is active in that region (see section 3.3.7).      4.2.1.1 Funding goals   Seventeen different funding goals have been defined. It is chosen first of all to order the funding   goals in four general categories namely investments in innovation  expansion  replacement and   refinancing. There exists a significant difference between applying for expansion capital or   replacements investments as for instance equity financiers are only willing to finance businesses that   have high growth potential. Furthermore  a larger working capital need originates when a firm is   expanding from experience of MM&C. The choice of order the funding goals in four categories forces   the user to think about the type of investments the firm wants to make. In cooperation with MM&C   consultants  an exbanker and the literature of section 2.3 on funding needs of SMEs  the four   general categories have been extended with specific funding goals which are listed in Table 4.                    38                  Table 4  Funding goals for SMEs that can be chosen from in the tool.     1.   2.     Innovation investment > R&D   Innovation investment > R&D project shorter than five years for highly innovative   product(s) or service(s)     3.  Expansion investment > acquisition  goodwill   4.  Expansion investment > property  plant or housing     5.  Expansion investment > machines  equipment (incl. ICT/Software)     6.  Expansion investment > transportation vehicles     7.  Expansion investment > working capital > prefinancing inventory   8.  Expansion investment > working capital > invoices   9.  Expansion investment > working capital > individual invoices   10. Expansion investment > working capital > other   11. Expansion investment > extra employees  reorganization  optimization or other   12. Replacement investment > property  plant or housing   13. Replacement investment > machines  equipment (incl. ICT/Software)   14. Replacement investment > transportation vehicles   15. Replacement investment > renovation property  plant or housing   16. Refinancing > refinancing debt   17. Refinancing > refinancing equity        When selecting funding goals the user can choose from this dropdown list. The funding goals have   been listed in the sequence they appear on the balance sheet. The first goal (R&D) includes   product/service innovation and development. The second goal (R&D project shorter than five years   etc.) is added to the list because the government initiative ‘Innovation fund MKB+’ can be a financing   option (section 3.3.12.1). The goal ‘expansion investments for transportation vehicles’ is mainly   meant for transportation firms or firms with an insourced transportation department.    For financing invoices  the complete debtor’s portfolio can be factored or one can choose to factor   individual invoices. Therefore a distinction between goal 8 and 9 is made.     As refinancing debt is a common practice  in accordance with an exbanker it is decided to also   include goal 17  refinancing equity. Refinancing equity happens when a wellperforming company   lacks cash to pay out dividend to its shareholders. In this case a company requires a loan to pay out   its shareholders. Suppose a firm has a solvency of 50% (implying 50% equity  50% debt). The firm can   then refinance for instance 10% of its equity with a loan which is used to pay out dividend. The   solvency will afterwards decrease to 40%.   Investments in marketing and advertising have been chosen not to include because from MM&C’s   experience it happens rarely that clients need funding for specifically for this goal. The latter purpose   is mostly financed by internal resources or an informal investor.     In total  the user can define four separate funding goals (needs) in the tool and can for each chose a   funding amount and expected financing period. This forces the user to split up the total funding need   and define it precisely. This results that for each funding goal suitable financiers will be listed in the   funding proposal (output). In this way financing options can be combined to form one total funding   solution. This choice is made in accordance with the newly emerging tendency toward ‘stacking’                       39     finance forms as discussed in section 1.5.2. When choosing an expected finance period for debt   finance  it is advised to not take a loan longer than the depreciation period of the asset (Kers &   Partners  2007). For financing (individual) invoices  a maximum of three months can be chosen. This   will be displayed as a pop up in the tool when the user selects either of these goals. Furthermore it   displays a maximum or minimum amount that can be factored based on the accounts receivable item   on the adjusted balance sheet 2016.     Furthermore  the user needs to state separately if the owner tolerates making the business idea   public online. If not  crowdfunding as a financing option will be excluded from the funding proposal.   The toleration of power and influence of a financier combined with dilution of existing shares is also   asked. If not  financing options which only supply equity finance will be excluded from the funding   proposal as well. At last it is asked if pawning restrictions of creditors are active on invoices    indicating if factoring invoices will be possible or not.     4.2.1.2 Collateral   The user is asked to fill in the current existing credit facilities of the business (loan  current account    loan  subordinated loan  vendor loan  vendor loan subordinated) and for each facility the amount to   be repaid along with the collateral amount issued if it has been provided to this facility. If it turns out   that the collateral provided for a credit facility is in excess of the amount due to be repaid  this value   will be automatically calculated and displayed. This gives MM&C a signal to contact the credit   supplier in order to renegotiate the collateral terms down to approximately the amount that needs   to be repaid. This can result in being able to offer more collateral to new financiers  increasing the   likelihood they will be included in the financing proposal.     The company’s assets can serve as collateral for financial institutions that require them. However    from MM&C’s experience and Huijgens (2016)  financiers view only a percentage of the book value of   the assets as collateral. Intangible assets such as goodwill  software and intellectual property are   often not used as collateral from experience of MM&C. This is confirmed by Kers & Partners (2007)   and Borsboom  Dekker & Huls (2006).    Huijgens (2016) provides in his book an indication of the minimum and maximum percentages banks   utilize as guidelines for estimating the collateral capacity of a firm. Next to that  a former banker was   asked to give input from his experience on these percentages. The results are listed in Table 5.     Table 5  Minimum and maximum collateral percentages utilized by banks for estimating collateral capacity of a firm from   its assets. Two sources are used  Huijgens (2016) and the experience of a former banker.      Assets (collateral)      Min.   Huijgens   (2016)     Max.   Huijgens   (2016)     Min. Ex  banker     Max. Ex  banker     Property and plant    Machines and equipment    Means of transport    Inventories (incl. finished goods & work in progress)    Accounts receivable (trade)   Cash          60%   25%   40%   10%   30%   100%     80%   50%   60%   35%   60%   100%     25%   25%   50%   10%   50%   80%                       70%   70%   70%   25%   70%   100%     40     The biggest difference in the two sources is their view on the assets ‘property and plant’ and   ‘machines and equipment’. The reason for this as stated by the former banker is that some business   premises are specific for an industry and are difficult to be sold (e.g. steel factory). Therefore a   (much) lower minimum is indicated. Furthermore  the former banker mentions that machines are in   general fairly easy to sell for decent prices resulting in a higher maximum percentage.   The user of the tool can manually decide in a dropdown list which percentage of the business’ asset   can serve as collateral. The user can choose percentages in the range provided by the former banker   because he first analyzed the values of Huijgens (2016) and subsequently gave his comments from   experience. Note that the user must always insert the percentage which resembles the execution   value of the asset in case of default as that is the value most financiers work with when determining   collateral capacity. The total collateral amount available resulting from the user’s input on   percentages will then be corrected for the collateral that has already been issued. This results in the   total collateral available for issuing to new financiers. Note that the original assets values are   collected from the adjusted 2016 balance sheet after revaluation of assets done in step 1.     4.2.3  Credit rating (step 3 – optional)   As the tool is considered an ‘expert’ decision support tool and therefore requires to give the user an   idea of the creditworthiness of a firm  an optional credit rating model can be filled in. The basis of the   credit rating is taken from Huijgens (2016) supplemented by ‘small firm premium factors’ of the   research conducted by van de Sande (2012) and remaining criteria which MM&C consultants   consider important factors when grading the creditworthiness of a firm.    The credit rating model from Huijgens (2016) consists of three main components       Table 6  The three main components of the credit rating model and each element’s weight in the overall score.     Weight   50%   35%   15%     Components   Financial ratios   Entrepreneur & company qualities   Rating of the firm’s industry      Every criterion of all main components needs to be rated from 1 (very bad) to 5 (very good). Most of   the financial ratios are rated automatically from the ratios calculated in step 1. Each criterion carries   a different weight (also 15) which was judged by an expert panel of MM&C. The rating criteria of the   model can be found in appendix IV. For each of the three main elements a score will be generated.   Subsequently  the overall credit rating consists of the weighted average of the main components to   form an overall credit score.    The original weights mentioned in Table 6 were originally valued 60%  25% and 15% respectively by   Huijgens (2016). However  when consulting a former banker  it became clear that more emphasis   needed to be on the entrepreneur and company qualities. MM&C regards the owner/main   shareholder as the main drive behind the enterprise  especially when it comes to SMEs. This resulted   in the weights displayed in Table 6.     As mentioned earlier  the credit rating model of Huijgens (2016) has been supplemented with small   firm premium criteria from the research of van de Sande (2012). Van de Sande (2012) shows there is   more risk involved in the valuation of an SME  compared to the valuation of a big corporation. To   account for this risk  small firm premium factors were added to his valuation model for SMEs. In his   valuation model it was asked to first of all score these small firm premium factors which would then                       41     be incorporated in his valuation model. These small firm premium factors are also asked to be scored   in this credit rating model. The factors include dependence on customers  dependence on suppliers    dependence on management  spread of activities  barriers of entry and flexibility to deal with   changing market or demand conditions. These factors have been added as criteria to the element   ‘Entrepreneur & Company Qualities’. Furthermore  in consultation with MM&C  the criteria debt   service ratio  the topicality of financial statements and an expert judgement score of the company   were added to the credit rating.    The topicality of financial statements is considered important because not uptodate financial   statements could suggest a disorganized financial administration. The user has the ability to add an   expert judgement score of the firm (score 15) which has a relatively big impact (33%) on the total   score. The reason for adding this criterion with its large corresponding weight is because a truthful   credit rating of an SME firm cannot only be formed by a systematically modeled credit rating   method. The entrepreneur is often the main ‘engine’ and a determining factor in the firm’s success.   Especially in the case of SMEs  it is important to judge this aspect as well. Judgements on trust    leadership  transparency and capability of the entrepreneur can be incorporated by means of this   expert judgement score.      The overall ‘MM&C credit rating’ is thus also a score between 1 and 5. Huijgens (2016) interprets the   meaning of a score in the way described in Table 7.     Table 7  Interpretation of the credit rating score by Huijgens (2016).     Score  Meaning   02   22 5   2 53     Extremely low rating  lending money is irrational.   Very low rating  lending money is unwise unless 100% collateral can be provided.     Lending is to be considered on condition that prospects and forecasts are well argued for   and collateral is provided. Preferably a loan shorter than 3 years.   Lending is appropriate for a fair price.     >3      It is possible to compare this score with Standard & Poor’s (S&P) credit rating definitions. Major   rating agencies such as S&P do not publicize how they rate firms but the meaning of their credit   rating is known (Standard & Poor's  2016). To give the user an indication of how these score   compare  the model displays the estimated corresponding S&P credit rating. The results are   displayed in Table 8.     Table 8  An indication of the relation between the credit rating of the tool and Standard & Poor’s ratings.     Credit rating tool  S&P     comparable   D  C  CC   CCC  B   BB  BBB   A   AA   AAA     02   22 5   2 53   33 5   3 54   45      It is decided not to make the credit rating a mandatory requirement because it does not have direct   influence on the funding proposal. The credit rating gives the expert user an indication of the   creditworthiness of the firm and therefore also an indication of the interest rate to expect when                       42     applying for debt finance. Firms with lower credit ratings can be expected to pay for higher interest   rates (possibly causing liquidity problems or a longer repayment period) and for these firms it is   suggested in the output to also consider subordinated debt or equity finance. Evidently  also the   score for each of the individual criteria gives the user a feeling of the firm. For instance  if a firm has   high current liabilities and high accounts payable days  it has a serious shortterm chance of default   (Borsboom  Dekker  & Huls  2006).     4.2.3.1 Altman Zscore for private firms   Another important criteria for making credit decisions is the Edward Altman Zscore model   (Borsboom  Dekker  & Huls  2006). This model has been composed by a multiple discriminant analysis   and predicts with the use of five financial ratios the chance of bankruptcy of a firm within two years   (Borsboom  Dekker  & Huls  2006). The model was originally designed for publicly held manufacturing   companies and later variations of the formula were designed in order for it to be applicable to   privately held firms  public nonmanufacturing firms and firms in emerging markets (Skuzet  2016).   The model does not give accurate results for financial companies (Altman  2000). Only private firms   are clients of MM&C  so only this specific variation of the formula is used. The Zscore formula for   private firms (applicable to all industries) uses multiple income and balance sheet ratios and is as   follows      𝑍 = 0 717 ∗ 𝑋1 +  0 847 ∗ 𝑋2 + 3 107 ∗ 𝑋3 + 0 420 ∗ 𝑋4 + 0 998 ∗ 𝑋5     X1 = net working capital / total assets    X2 = retained earnings / total assets   X3 = earnings before interest and taxes (operating result / total assets)   X4 = book value of equity / total liabilities   X5 = turnover / total assets     Skuzet (2016) gives the flowing interpretation of the Zscore (Table 9)      Table 9  Interpretation of the Altman Zscore for private firms.     Interpretation   Safe Zone  risk of bankruptcy is small.   Grey Zone.   Distress Zone  risk of bankruptcy is high.     ZScore   Z > 2 9   1 23 < Z < 2 9   Z < 1 23      The user is not required to take any action for calculation of the Altman Zscore. The score is   calculated automatically (independent of the credit rating model from the previous section) as long   as the financial statements of 2016 have been filled. It must be noted to be careful when making   conclusions about a firm on the basis of this Zscore as the formula is based on research of   companies in the United States in the period of 1946 until 1965 (Borsboom  Dekker  & Huls  2006).   Nevertheless  the Altman Zscore is still useful as a method for an indication of the chance of   bankruptcy of an SME to be financed as the model is accurate in 8090% of the cases according to   Altman (2000).     4.3 Black box   As mentioned in the beginning of chapter 4  the main function of the black box is to select suitable   financiers for the funding need(s) chosen in the input. In order to do this  data on all financial                       43     institutions has been imported. According to the inserted financial statements and funding needs   specified by the user  the black box runs a selection process in order to select suitable financiers. At   last the black box compares the firm with data on its industry and employee range  providing the   user with comparison figures on the solvency  current ratio  amount of companies active in the   industry and the bankruptcy rate.      4.3.1  Financing options   All the suitable financing options for clients of MM&C listed in section 3.3 have been inserted in the   tool. This also includes the options which fund amounts until €250k because they can form part of a   total funding solution consisting of multiple financiers. The tool selects from these 20 imported   financing options (Table 10)      Table 10  The 20 financing options which are incorporated in the tool.     1.  Bank  traditional loans   3.  Bank  factoring   5.  Leasing (operational/financial/vendor)   7.  Supplier credit   9.  Private Equity Firms   11. Institutional Investment fund  ALF &     Bank          Informal Investors/Business Angels     2.  Bank  current account    4.  Factoring individual invoices   6.   8.  Vendor loan   10. Regional development companies (RDCs)   12. Institutional Investment fund  FundIQ       13. Institutional Investment fund  Neos   15. Crowdfunding   17. Government guarantee scheme  BMKB     14. SME stock exchange   16. Online suppliers of fast credit (Spotcap)   18. Government guarantee scheme  Growth     in combination with a Bank     Facility      19. Government  Innovation credit MKB+     20. Government  Subsidies        The three institutional investment funds of section 3.3.8 (Neos  FundIQ and ALF) have been split up   into three separate financing options because it was found out that each institution operates   differently. For instance  Neos both supplies subordinated loans and normal loans whereas FundIQ   only supplies subordinate loans. The ALF supplies a subordinated loan in combination with a normal   loan of a bank. It is therefore evident that these financial institutions cannot be grouped under one   type of financing option in the tool.   For each financing option the following data attributes have been collected      1.  Financing amount range (min. and max.);   2.  Financing period range (min. and max.);   3.  Type of supplied finance  equity  shortterm debt  longterm debt  subordinated loans and/or     bonds;     4.  Which funding goals of Table 4 in section 4.2.1.1 are financed;   5.  Network and advice is available for SME  yes/no;   6.  Availability in the market/chance of approval  (score 15). If it is generally difficult to apply     and succeed in getting funding  the financing option receives a low score and vice versa;     7.  Estimated average duration of application time;   8.  Collateral demanded  yes/no;   9.  Maximum grace period allowed (for explanation  see appendix II);   10. Cost class  the desired margin by the financier (see the next page for explanation);   11. Power and influence of financier in business  yes/no;                       44     12. Industries particularly financed and which particularly not if explicitly known;   13. Relevant extra useful information if necessary for decisionmaking process of the user;   14. Names of financial institutions specific for a financing option where MM&C or the SME can     apply at.      In accordance with MM&C it is decided that these listed attributes are needed in order to select and   filter financing options. All data on financing options imported has been collected from section 3.3    professional literature  government reports  conversations with representatives of financial   institutions at the events named in section 3.2  websites and brochures of financial institutions and   from experience of MM&C (the latter mainly for banks). In appendix V it is shown how this data is   inserted in the tool by means of an example of one financing option.   Data attributes on financial institutions will evidently mutate over time. Modifications can therefore   easily be made in the tool. Most data has been collected and attributed to financing options in a   fairly straightforward way  however some important choices in attributing data to financing options   must be noted.   It is chosen that suppliers of equity finance such as private equity firms and informal investors mainly   look for potential highgrowth firms within five years. These institutions therefore do not supply   replacement investments. For the estimation of the cost of a financier  it is decided to attribute a   cost class to a financier instead of an actual cost or interest rate (Huijgens  2016). This is done   because it is difficult to predict the interest of a debt financier before having applied for funding.   Besides interest rates are dependent on the Euro Interbank Offered Rate (Euribor) set by the   European central bank and market prices of financiers fluctuate over time (Huijgens  2016). To make   a classification of cost classes  not the actual market prices have been compared but the desired   margin of the financiers in regard with the cost of their source of funding (Huijgens  2016). The   following cost classes have been used and are defined by Huijgens (2016)      Lowcost class (desired margin by financier <3% per year)          Mediumcost class (desired margin by financiers 36% per year)     Highcost class (desired margin by financier >6% per year)     In particular equity financing is the most expensive form of capital (de Vries & van der Wielen  2017).   All suppliers of risk capital (subordinated debt and equity finance) demand a high margin (Huijgens    2016). In case of default  the shareholders are the last in the line in the hierarchy of creditors (de   Vries & van der Wielen  2017).    Loans from banks  vendor loans  supplier credit and own equity are considered to belong to the low  cost class (Huijgens  2016). Debt is also cheaper because interest payments are tax deductible while   rewards of equity finance (dividend) are charged with corporate tax (Het Financieele Dagblad  2016).   Crowdfunding  leasing and factoring belong to the mediumcost class. Furthermore  shorter loans are   in general cheaper than longer ones due to the lower risk perception (Borsboom  Dekker  & Huls    2006).     4.3.2  Selection of financing options   Several data attributes on financing options from the previous section and the user input (step 2) is   used for automatically selecting financing options resulting in a generated funding proposal. In the   questions tab (step 2) the user is required to fill in four financing goals (along with the required   amount and expected financing period). For each of these funding goals a suitable list of financing                       45     options will be presented in the output sheet (step 4). A selection process is undergone per funding   goal to achieve the list. This is described in Figure 11.          Figure 11  Flow diagram of the selection process of financing options for a funding goal.     As can be seen from Figure 11  the selection decision process is based on the following input   information      Funding goal;          Whether equity finance is tolerable for the owner (power and influence in business);     Whether making a business idea public is tolerable for the owner;     Required funding amount;      Expected financing period;     Collateral available.     It depends on the funding goal  the financier and the type of finance if collateral is required when   funding. Equity finance by definition does not require collateral. Suppliers of subordinated loans   receive a higher interest because they have either no collateral or 2nd priority (after the bank)   pledges. Huijgens (2016) mentions that collateral forms a minor role for vendor loans and supplier   credit. For crowdfunding the role is larger but still limited (Huijgens  2016). With crowdfunding it is   often the case that business owners are held personally liable. Collateral is crucial for banks  lease   and factoring. However  suppose a firm decides to buy new housing property  lease new trucks or   factor its invoices  these same assets will serve as collateral. The financiers will then only have to   determine if the firm has enough cash flow to repay the loan as well as the interest.       It is decided that debt financiers (excl. subordinated debt financiers) require collateral for the funding   goals which do not directly fund an asset that could serve as collateral. In accordance with MM&C it   is chosen that the tool requires collateral by means of the firm’s assets when the user chooses   funding goal 1  7  10  11  15 or 17 from Table 4 in section 4.2.1.1. When selecting financing options   for one of these funding goals  the debt financing options (excl. subordinated debt) will be filtered   based on the firm’s collateral capacity. For instance if a firm requires €1m for an R&D project  banks   will be only listed as an option if the firm can provide at least €1m in collateral.    It is decided not to filter goal 3 and 16 based on the collateral capacity of the firm because it is   difficult to determine the amount of collateral which is required for these funding goals. When   funding an acquisition  part of the takeover amount is paid for the intrinsic value and a part for   goodwill. For the goodwill part  collateral is demanded by banks. However  the tool cannot filter   financing options based on collateral requirement only for the goodwill part of this funding goal.                       46     Input  Funding goalSelection of options which fund financing goalSelection of options which fund required amountInput  Required amountSelection of options which fund expected periodInput  Equity possible?

In the case a mortgage is   refinanced  the property serves as collateral. However  when for instance a subordinate vendor loan   is refinanced the new financier might (partly) demand collateral.     It is decided that when funding goal 7  collateral is also required for debt financiers because the   inventory itself only has marginal value as collateral. From experience of MM&C  inventories are   worth little when execution sales take place.     The data attributes from the list of section 4.3.1 which were decided not to use as selection criteria   for a funding proposal are number 5  6  7  9  10  12  and evidently 13 and 14. These characteristics do   not form crucial decision criteria for the initial proposal. Instead  these characteristics are mentioned   alongside the list of suitable financing options in the output so that the user can subsequently view   these characteristics per financing option to make a profound decision when selecting.    It was decided to not filter attribute 12 because the proposed list consists mostly of financing   options  not specific names of financing institutions. Evidently  it would be too timeconsuming to   research every institution’s excluded industries. For the specific financial institutions in the list   (government supported RDCs  Neos  FundIQ) however  the favored and excluded industries are   displayed together with the other nondecision characteristics mentioned above to give the user   adequate information for selection in step 4.      Industry data     4.3.3   As the tool is considered an ‘expert’ decision support tool  the user is provided with useful   information about the company’s industry and comparable firms. Therefore several sheets of   industry data from the Central Bureau of Statistics (CBS) have been added to the tool         Number of companies per industry  categorized per employee class from 20092016;     Number of bankrupted companies per industry from 20092016;        Financial performance indicators  solvency and current ratio of companies per industry   categorized per employee class in 2013 (excl. financial services industry).     All three sheets exclude data on freelancers (single employee firms) and companies with 250 or more   employees as they are not clients of MM&C. The industries in CBS data have been ordered according   to the ‘Standard Industrial Classifications 2008’ list (SBI 2008) which makes it convenient for the tool   to compare the company’s industry (input of step 2) with these data sheets.    The CBS was contacted if more recent data was available for the latter data sheet. The CBS pointed   out that their supplier of this data  the Dutch Ministry of Economic Affairs  stopped measuring these   financial performance indicators since 2014. It has been tried to retrieve more recent data from   other sources such as ING bank or the Chamber of Commerce but this data was not exportable to   software and was only available against high cost respectively. The CBS defines current ratio and the   solvency in this data sheet as (1 2)          1. Current ratio                2. Solvency (way of CBS)                𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠     𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠          𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑟’𝑠 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦    𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠          MM&C calculates the solvency in the following way                           47     3. Solvency (way of MM&C)      𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑟’𝑠 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 (𝑖𝑛𝑐𝑙.𝑠𝑢𝑏𝑜𝑟𝑑𝑖𝑛𝑎𝑡𝑒𝑑 𝑑𝑒𝑏𝑡) – 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠       𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 – 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠            The reason for calculating the solvency accordingly is because intangible assets possess a book value   but are highly unlikely to be sold for this value in case of company default. For the purpose of   comparing  it is also chosen to also calculate the solvency in the way of CBS for the output (step 4).   Furthermore a data sheet from Huijgens 2016 on solvency benchmarks per industry (no SBI 2008  a   less detailed classification) has been added to the black box (appendix VI). This will provide the user   an indication for what a good and bad solvency is for a company in a specific industry. The definition   of solvency used by Huijgens (2016) is again different      4. Solvency (way of Huijgens  2016)       𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑟’𝑠 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦  𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙            For the purpose of comparing  the solvency of an inserted firm in the tool is also calculated in the   way of Huijgens (2016).    In the output (step 4) relevant industry data for the user’s firm on the number of companies active    bankruptcy rates  solvency  current ratio and solvency benchmarks will be displayed along with the   funding proposal.      4.4 Output   Before the funding proposal  the output sheet first displays the credit rating if filled in (step 3) and   the Altman Zscore together with their interpretation. Subsequently  the number of companies in   2016 of the firm’s industry and employee class is shown together with the number of bankruptcies in   the industry from 20092016. To supply the user with a more relevant meaning of the number of   bankruptcies in the firm’s industry  also a bankruptcy rate (%) from 20092016 is calculated.   Besides  the average solvency and current ratio of the firm’s industry and employee class are given   (CBS data) together with the firm’s actual solvency and current ratio. At last the solvency benchmarks   (critical  low  sufficient  optimal  strong  surplus) from Huijgens (2016) of the firm’s industry are   displayed.         4.4.1  Funding proposal (step 4)   For each of the funding goals selected  a list of suitable financing options will appear. All available   financing options have been selected on the basis of criteria in the input mentioned in section 4.3.2.   For each of these options the user is supplemented with additional information from section 4.3.1 on   the cost class  type of finance supplied  which industries are and which are particularly not financed    network and advice function  availability in the market  average application time  maximum grace   period  extra useful information and a list of actual financial institutions the user of SME could apply   at. Furthermore  if factoring (individual) invoices is displayed as a suitable financing option  there will   be a warning for these options in the case pawning restrictions have been indicated active in the   input sheet of step 2.     The format of the funding proposal (a list of suitable financing options per funding goal) is   deliberately chosen to stimulate ideas about combining different types of financing options to form   one total funding solution (as discussed in section 1.5.2). The new way of financing is recognized by a   conscious choice of different financing options. Businesses which consciously choose financiers are   seen as more professional and are more likely to raise funding (Huijgens  2016).                       48     At this point the user can decide to end the process because the tool has provided the necessary   information on suitable financing options for the specified funding goals. However  if the user wants   to view the effects on the balance sheet of a funding option  the user will have to manually select a   financing option. Subsequently  it is asked to choose the type of finance that the selected financier   supplies. The user can use the guidelines in the following section to select the best options and types   from the shortlist.     4.4.1.1 Funding guidelines   In this section funding guidelines will be mentioned which the user can use to select the most   optimal financing option(s) for the funding goal(s). Huijgens (2016) notes that the three most   important selection criteria for the first filtering round of financing options are the duration of the   funding  the amount of funding and the risk perception. Because the tool already selects financing   options based on the funding duration and amount  only the risk perception of the firm is discussed   in this section.   A firm can not only be funded by debt but also requires equity finance. The main function of equity is   risk absorption (Huijgens  2016). If the firm temporarily realizes insufficient returns  there are no   obligations towards suppliers of equity finance in contrast with debt financiers. The more equity a   firm possesses (higher solvency)  the lower the financial risk of the firm because the firm is more   resistant to misfortunes (Huijgens  2016). The riskier the firm is perceived (low credit rating)  the   greater the amount of risk capital that is demanded (Kers & Partners  2007). On the current financing   market there exists great attention from financiers for sufficient equity in sharp contrast with the   precrisis era where banks used to fund SMEs royally. These times made enterprises get used to high   proportions of debt in relation to equity (Huijgens  2016). According to Huijgens (2016)  it is   important for the expert user to first analyze if the proportion equity/debt (solvency) of a firm is   sufficient. If not  the firm should not only acquire new debt  but also a portion of equity or   subordinated debt. It is often required to have sufficient equity in order to receive debt finance. Kers   & Partners (2007) mention that capitalintensive industrial/production firms have higher solvency   requirements than service companies. The tool advises the user in the output to apply for risk capital   in the case the solvency of the company (calculated in Huijgens way) is below the ‘critical’ level of   solvency benchmarks of Huijgens (appendix VI). The tool advises the user to apply for cheaper debt   finance if the solvency level is at least ‘sufficient’.      It is decided not to automate funding guidelines which would result in a most optimal proposal. The   reason for this is the time scope of the thesis  the complexity  the then resulting inflexibility of   choosing other financing options and because the user of the tool is an MM&C consultant considered   experienced in financing businesses.    The user can furthermore use the most important additional funding guidelines below to select the   best financing option(s). The additional guidelines are based on Borsboom  Dekker & Huls (2006)    Kers & Partners (2007)  Huijgens (2016) and MM&C.       Debt and interest payments must be able to be paid from the earning capacity  EBITDA(L). If     the EBITDA(L) of the firm is too low or just enough to cover these expenses  it is advised to   attract more equity finance. If the EBITDA(L) is high and the firm possesses stability there is   room for debt finance.   If the firm is expected to grow very rapidly in the near future (35) years and prefers to omit   the repayment burden  suppliers of equity finance are a suitable option.                             49                         The generated cash flow of a firm is roughly what is left when existing capital and interest   repayments are subtracted from the EBITDA(L). This cash flow combined with future   generated cash flows is the resource that can be used to make replacement investments and   expansion investments. If the investment cannot be paid back in time from current and   future cash flows (or if the investment will start generating returns only after a few years)    equity finance is required.    The amount left over from the EBITDA(L) after subtracting repayments  interest and   necessary replacement investments is the buffer capacity of the firm against times with   lower returns. The EBITDA(L) is generally more important for financiers than the collateral   capacity. In the case collateral capacity is a problem but the firm generates enough cash  it is   advised to try debt financing options with government guarantee schemes instead because it   remains cheaper than equity finance.     It is advised to finance fixed assets with longterm debt or equity and shortterm assets with   shortterm debt.   Finance the fixed core of the current assets with longterm debt or equity. Temporary   fluctuations in currents assets should be financed with current accounts. This makes it   possible to finance fluctuation in working capital in a flexible manner.     4.4.2  Balance sheet after funding (step 5)   At the top of this output sheet in the tool  each funding goal together with its chosen financing   option  type of finance and required amount is summarized. Furthermore  the adjusted balance   sheet of 2016 is displayed too.   To view the effect on the balance sheet after funding  the user can enter the mutations in the   ‘mutation column’ in the asset and liability side of the balance sheet. This will result in a balance   sheet after funding which can for instance be used to present to a financier when applying for   funding. Furthermore  the financial ratios mentioned in section 4.2.1.1 will also be updated according   to the balance sheet after funding so one can notice for instance the effect on solvency after funding.      The reason why the balance sheet after funding is not generated automatically is because of a   number of reasons which make it difficult to generate it correctly.   The main problem lies in the fact that if you decide to use funding to invest in assets  it will not   necessarily mean that the funding amount represents the same increase in asset value. A €100k   renovation investment a firm’s plant does not necessarily mean the plant has actually gained €100k   market value. When choosing a current account as financing option it unknown how much of this   credit will be actually used. When leasing  it can be chosen to lease financially or operational. In the   first case the asset appears on the balance sheet and in the second case it does not. It is even more   difficult to estimate the value mutations of investments in intangible assets such as software. Or in   the case of an acquisition where the takeover amount is split into intrinsic value and goodwill. As the   user is considered experienced when it comes to financing SMEs it is decided to let the user manually   enter the mutation(s) to obtain the balance sheet after funding.         4.5 Added value of the tool for MM&C   With the finance proposal produced by the decision support tool the user can apply at selected   financiers for funding  therefore saving significant time by not having to research the market every   time a client needs funding. In this way MM&C can more quickly approach suitable financier(s)    therefore improving service to its clients. On top of that  this tool provides a basis for combining                       50     financing options for different funding goals to fulfill a total funding need.    It must be noted that it is a highmaintenance tool which requires MM&C to regularly update the   tool with possible new financing options that emerge in the future or modified specifications (i.e.   finance period  amounts financed  type of finance) of the existing financing institutions inserted in   the tool.   Furthermore  the tool supplies MM&C with automatically calculated relevant financial ratios and a   developed credit rating model for decisionmaking purposes. It has been made accessible to compare   a client firm with industry data and quickly generate a balance sheet after funding for a chosen   financing option. Besides  instead of having to make new layouts of financial statements  manually   calculate financial ratios and develop a credit rating each time a client requires funding  this tool   incorporates these facets allowing the user to produce these items in relatively short time.                                 51     5  Case studies  validation of the finance decision support tool   In order to validate the tool  two completed client cases of MM&C were used. Both clients cases deal   with an SME in need of funding. First  the two SMEs and their corresponding funding need will be   shortly described. For confidentiality reasons the client cases are anonymized. Both client cases were   supplied with complete financial statements.   With the description of the firm and the financial statements  the tool was used to find out which   (optimal) financing options and type of finance are suggested for each of the SME’s funding need(s).   The outcome of the tool will be compared with the financing option(s) and type of finance that   MM&C used to fund the SME. On one hand  it is analyzed if the tool is suggesting the financing   options that were actually used by MM&C. On the other hand it is analyzed if the tool suggests other   (and/or better) financing options that could of have been used.    It is chosen to focus the validation section of this thesis on the financing proposal generated by the   tool as this is the main function of the tool. The tool however has already been verified with multiple   small fictive cases during the design of the tool. This happened in the way that a fictive company case   was created with the idea that the tool needed to give accompanying predefined outcomes. When   filling in the data and information of the fictive case it was checked if the projected accompanying   funding proposal was actually displayed. If not  the problem was found and the tool was adapted.    In the following sections  the two client cases will be described and subsequently used for validating   the tool.     5.1  Case study 1  Graphic printing company (GPC)   Table 11  Facts of GPC.     Number of employees   Establishment    Time period case   EBITDAL 2016   EBITDA 2016   Turnover and profit 2016   Solvency before funding 31122016     60   1934   September 2016  March 2017   €1.204k    €691k   €11 8m / €49k   1%      Description      5.1.1   Graphic printing company (GPC) is specialized in customized printing solutions for packaging and   pointofsale prints. GPC possesses a modern production facility which is suitable for the processing   of plastic  cardboard and paper. The firm is well organized and communicating with clients is one of   GPC’s USPs. GPC is innovative and helps every client personally with finding the best solution. The   company premises is located in an environment of good logistical infrastructure and the processes   are supported by an integrated workflow management system. GPC has experienced difficult times   since and during the crisis but from 2015/2016 the financial results show a clear recovery pattern   and meanwhile profits are being made again.     5.1.2  Management   By means of a management buyout (MBO) just prior to the financial crisis in 2007  the firm was taken   over from the former owner by the current owner for approximately €7m. The MBO was financed by   the bank (€4m normal loan) and by the vendor (€2.953k subordinated no collateral vendor loan +   €150k current account). The current owner has been active in the graphical industry his complete                       52     working life and is the main ‘engine’ of the firm. His management team consists of four members   (each at least five years active at GPC).      5.1.3  Role of MM&C   At the instigation of GPC’s main bank (due to financial problems in the financial crisis)  MM&C has   been involved as external consultant since 2009. MM&C has led a large reorganization since the crisis   and has since then always been actively involved at GPC. MM&C was also involved in the following   funding problem which is described below.     5.1.4  Funding goals   The goal was to make GPC autonomously fundable by improvement of returns and solvency after a   long period of high debt obligations (€5 1m repaid from 20072015). The funding problem took place   in mid2016. To realize financial independence and improvement of returns  the following funding   goals totaling €2 51m were defined      1.  Refinance €1 5m of subordinated vendor loan debt from the former owner. The outstanding     amount of the vendor loan remained €2.953k since the MBO in 2007 because GPC had   difficulties repaying the vendor due to financial troubles relating to the crisis.   As soon as €1 5m of the vendor loan has been refinanced  the former owner is prepared to   write off the other €1.453k and thus take a loss. This implies that GPC would have €1.453k   less debt to repay. The financier of the refinance is expected to be paid back in 68 years.     2.  €750k funding for three years for the final installment payment of the financial lease contract     for the printing presses. The original lease contract (ending 31122016) was for €4 3m and   was until 2016 repaid with €502 per year.     3.  €300k funding for five years for an extra punch press because the capacity of the current     single punch press forms a bottleneck in the production process.     Input of tool     5.1.5   First of all  in step 1 the financial statements have been filled in  which results in automatically   generated financial ratios. In step 2  the general questions were answered along with existing credit   facilities and the percentages of the firm’s assets which can be used for collateral. The result is that   the firm cannot supply collateral to new financiers because all collateral has been issued to existing   credit suppliers.    The first funding goal  refinancing debt  corresponds to goal number 16 of Table 4 in section 4.2.1.1   and is expected to be repaid in 68 years. The second and third funding goal are both considered   replacement investments in machines matching with goal number 13. The firm’s turnover is expected   to steadily grow in the future but there are no steep growth plans (or expectations). Therefore the   investments are considered replacement investments. The second funding goal is expected to be   repaid in three years and the third one in five years. The managers do not want to be financed by   equity. In step 3 the credit rating has been filled in.        5.1.6  Output of tool   In step 4  the output  it is displayed that the firm has a credit rating result of 2 87 (S&P  BB  BBB) and   a solvency of 1%. Furthermore  the Altman Zscore makes it clear that the firm’s chance of   bankruptcy is in the ‘grey zone’ defined by Altman (section 4.2.3.1). On the basis of these outcomes    the tool suggests the firm to apply for subordinate loans. Furthermore  GPC has a considerably lower                       53     solvency (1% compared with 23%) and current ratio (0 59 compared with 1 42) than similar sized   firms in GPC’s industry. The funding proposal is described below      1.  For the first goal it is suggested to refinance debt by means of the bank  the local regional   development company (RDC) Innovation Quarter in ZuidHolland (subordinated loan)  the   institutional investment funds Neos and FundIQ or the SME stock exchange (bonds).      2.  For the second goal  the tool suggests to finance the final installment payment of the printing     presses with a bank loan  leasing  vendor loan  all three institutional investment funds or a   bank loan with BMKB guarantee scheme.     3.  For the third goal the tool suggest to finance the new punch press by the same means as     stated in goal 2  but with RDC Innovation Quarter in ZuidHolland (subordinated loan) as an   extra option.     Because the firm has a low solvency  low credit rating and no collateral to issue  there are practically   no other options than to apply for subordinated debt for the first goal. For the second and third goal   however  the machines can serve as collateral making it possible to also be financed by normal long  term debt.     1.     It is chosen not to refinance the debt with bonds on the SME stock exchange. The reason for   this is that a listing is too costly regarding the amount to be refinanced and the process   would be too timeconsuming (explained in section 3.3.9). The bank cannot be chosen to   refinance either because this vendor loan debt cannot be backed by collateral. This leaves   three suitable options left  a subordinated loan from the government supported RDC   Innovation Quarter (ZuidHolland) or a subordinated loan from Neos or FundIQ.       2.  As the second goal consists of financing a final installment payment of a lease contract      leasing is evidently not an option anymore. Furthermore the institutional investment funds   are not advised for goal 2 because these supply more expensive (subordinate) debt.   Therefore the following options remain for goal 2  traditional bank loan (with or without   BMKB government guarantee scheme) or a vendor loan.     3.  For the third goal  the RDC and institutional investment funds are not advised because of the   highcost class. Therefore the following options remain for goal 3  traditional bank loan (with   or without BMKB government guarantee scheme)  leasing or a vendor loan.     5.1.7  Actual result of MM&C       Goal 1 was financed for €1.152k by the institutional investment fund Neos. Neos issued loan   subordinated to the bank (2nd priority pledges). It was agreed on an interest rate of 10% and   repayment within seven years. The remaining part of the amount to be refinanced was   supplied once again by the former owner by means of a subordinated loan. With this   construction the former owner immediately received €1.150k (€1m for the subordinated   vendor loan and €150k for the current account)  wrote off €1.453k and once more issued a   subordinated loan for €500k to GPC because Neos refused to refinance the complete vendor   loan.       Goal 2 was financed by means of a vendor loan from the lease institution. In this case  the     lease company which was previously the lessor of the printing presses now issued a loan to   GPC for the final installment payment of the lease contract. GPC will have to repay €250k per   year over a three year time period with an interest rate of 4 8%.                       54       Goals 3 is funded by means of operational lease from a lease department of another bank.     €52k will be repaid per year over 5 years with a final installment payment of €40k. In order to   not lower GPC’s solvency even more  it was wiser to make use of operational lease instead of   financial lease because the press will not be stated on the balance sheet in this way.     5.1.8  Comparison of result tool and result MM&C   For each goal  MM&C arranged funding from financial institutions that were also proposed by the   tool.      1.     2.     3.     For the first goal  the tool shows that MM&C could have also approached the new alternative   RDC Innovation Quarter in ZuidHolland or the institutional investment fund FundIQ. Pricewise   the options would not of have differed much  both Neos  FundIQ and the RDC are categorized   in the highcost class. However  FundIQ finances for maximum six years and GPC’s repayment   capacity could possibly form a problem.    For the second goal the tool shows that the final installment payment could have also been   financed by a traditional bank loan. However  the financial lease institution that supplied the   vendor loan is owned by GPC’s main bank so it was decided by the bank to fund the presses by   means of their lease institution.   For the third goal  GPC could have also been financed by a traditional bank loan or a vendor   loan instead of operational leasing. Pricewise this would not of have been a big difference. But   if GPC used a bank loan or a vendor loan however  the machine would have to be stated on the   balance sheet which would further reduce the firm’s solvency. Therefore operational lease was   the best option.       For this case the tool suggests the most suitable financing options that have actually been used by   MM&C to fund GPC. The most significant result of the comparison is that MM&C could have also   approached the RDC or FundIQ to fund the first funding goal.       5.2  Case study 2  Fencing protection company (FPC)   Table 12  Facts of FPC.     Number of employees   Establishment    Time period case   EBITDA 2015   Turnover and profit 2015   Solvency before funding 31122015     25   2005   October 2015 – April 2016   €385k   €6 2m / €237k   67%     5.2.1  Description   Fencing protection company (FPC) focusses on the production  sales  installation and maintenance of   highquality fence protection facilities of their selfdeveloped brand. The company has developed   quickly since the start and has also made stable returns during the recent financial crisis. The   company’s turnover is expected to grow 1012% per year to €6 7m in 2016 with an accompanying   EBITDA of €443k in 2016. FPC does not make use of a bank loan.                       55     5.2.2  Management   The current management of FPC consists of three managers (1  director  2  director technology and   3  director business development & marketing) which each possess 2030 years of experience in the   fencing industry. The first director possesses 50% of the shares of FPC.     5.2.3  Role of MM&C   MM&C has been asked by the managers of the firm to assist with the funding goal described in the   following section. It is the first time MM&C and FPC are cooperating.     5.2.4  Funding Goals   The managers of the firm have plans for growth of the firm  on strengthening the management team   and are determined on gaining extra knowledge. Therefore the second director wants to buyout   ‘silent’ FPC shareholders. The second director will then possess the other 50% of FPC’s shares. The   silent shareholders are united in a financial holding which are barely involved in managing FPC. The   first director is prepared to guarantee the repayments of the loan of the second director. With the   takeover of shares  the passive shareholders will be replaced by a new active owner which will   enable the firm to realize its growth plans.     MM&C was first asked to give an independent second opinion on the valuation of FPC after the   already made valuation of FPC by another financial consultancy firm. Second MM&C was asked to   assist in negotiations about the buyout amount and the funding related. After negotiation with the   vendors  it is determined that the to be sold shares are worth €1 7m euro. The €1 7m buyout amount   consists of €937k intrinsic value (owner’s equity) and €763 goodwill. The funding goal can therefore   be defined as           Fund the buyout of shares from silent shareholders totaling €1 7m split up into €937 intrinsic   value and €763 goodwill. The expected financing period is five years.     Input of tool     5.2.5   First of all  in step 1 the financial statements have been filled in  which results in automatically   generated financial ratios. In step 2  the general questions were answered along with the   percentages of the firm’s assets which can be used for collateral. The result is that the firm can   supply €745k worth of collateral.   As the goal of the funding is an expansion investment by means of buying out shares  the funding   goal is considered to be number 3 of Table 4 in section 4.2.1.1.    Because the takeover amount consists of intrinsic value and goodwill and the collateral amount is   €745k  it can be wise to split the funding goal in two. So one for €937k and one for €763k. The   expected financing period for both funding goals is five years. Note that evidently one funding goal of   €1 7m can also be filled in. The managers have indicated not to be wanted to be financed by equity.    In step 3 the credit rating has been filled in.        5.2.6  Output of tool   In step 4  the output  it is displayed that the firm has a credit rating result of 3 95 (S&P  AA) and a   solvency of 67%. Furthermore  the Altman Zscore makes it clear that the firm has little chance of   bankruptcy within two years. On the basis of these outcomes  the tool suggests the firm to apply for   lowcost debt finance as the firm has low risk and high solvency. Furthermore  FPC has a considerably                       56     higher solvency (67% compared with 26%) and current ratio (3 1 compared with 1 4) than similar   sized firms in FPC’s industry. The funding proposal is described shortly below           For the first €937k of the funding  the tool suggests to finance by means of a bank loan    vendor loan from the silent shareholders  regional development company (subordinated   loan)  the three institutional investment funds  SME stock exchange (bonds) or a bank loan   with BMKB guarantee scheme.   For the second €763k  the tool suggests the same.           Note that if only one funding goal of €1 7m is inserted  the suggestions are the same.     As mentioned earlier  because of the high solvency and credit rating the firm does not need to use   expensive equity finance or subordinated debt. Therefore an RDC  the institutional investment funds   and the SME stock exchange are out of scope for FPC’s funding proposal. The normal bank loan is still   suggested in the funding proposal for funding goal 3 even though not enough collateral can be   provided by FPC. The reason for this is described in section 4.3.2.                   It can now be chosen to fund the €937k intrinsic value of the shares by either a vendor loan   or a traditional bank loan with BMKB guarantee scheme. Because the firm has a collateral   shortage of €937k – €745k = €192k the firm cannot utilize a bank loan without the BMKB   guarantee scheme.    The €763k goodwill can be financed in the same way.   The total €1 7m cannot be financed by the bank and BMKB guarantee scheme alone because   of a collateral shortage for the bank  (1 7/2 = €850k) – €745k = €105k shortage.      With the help of this funding proposal  an option can be to finance the €937k intrinsic value of the   shares by a bank loan with BMKB guarantee scheme (mediumcost class) and the €763k goodwill by a   vendor loan (lowcost class). It is evident that in order for the vendor loan to be realized  the current   silent shareholders must first agree with this proposal. The current EBITDA of the firm is €385k and   expected to grow in the future. The firm will therefore have enough capacity to repay €1 7m in five   years (€340k per year) together with expected lowinterest payments.      5.2.7  Actual result of MM&C   MM&C arranged that of the €1 7m takeover amount  €900k was financed by a bank loan with BMKB   guarantee scheme. The remaining €800k was financed by the selling party  in the form of a vendor   loan. This vendor loan was subordinate in regard to the bank loan.    €900k was directly transferred from the bank to the vendors at the moment the shares were handed   over. This amount was chosen because it reflects approximately the intrinsic value of the shares.    All three major banks were willing to fund FPC against lowinterest rates because the deal was not   perceived risky. The cheapest offer with approximately 2% interest rate was chosen. The bank was   provided security with the following pledges  accounts receivable and inventory (including machines    software  office equipment etc.). This totaled €745k worth of collateral. Because the collateral   shortage for the €900k bank loan was €155k  the bank loan made use of the BMKB guarantee   scheme described in section 3.3.12.1. The €155 unsecured part of the loan is now covered by the   government in case FPC defaults.    The subordinated loan of €800k will need to be repaid in five years with an interest rate of 2%. The   silent shareholders possess second priority pledges on the accounts receivable and inventory.                        57     5.2.8  Comparison of result tool and result MM&C    The tool does suggest other financing options such as the new alternatives SME stock exchange    institutional investment funds and the local RDC. However  these were not optimal options for FPC.   The remaining optimal options resulting from the tool are the ones also used by MM&C to fund FPC.   in this way it can be concluded that MM&C chose the most optimal financing options which the tool   suggested.   A notable aspect of this case was that the percentages of assets that FPC’s bank utilized to calculate   the collateral capacity were low. For all assets  FPC’s bank chose the minimum percentages which   can be chosen in the tool (percentages stated in Table 5 of section 4.2.1.2). The low percentage   chosen for the asset property can be explained by past capitalized renovation costs which cannot   serve as collateral. For the other assets  it is unclear why the collateral percentages have been   chosen this low. This result suggests that the minimum and maximum percentages of assets which   can be used as collateral could possibly be reevaluated again in the future by experienced bankers.     5.3  Conclusion case studies   The validation of the tool was done by means of two completed client cases of MM&C. All in all it can   be said that validation proves the tool basically functions as intended. For both cases the tool   suggests the financing options that MM&C also used to fund their clients. Furthermore  for several   funding goals the tool suggests other suitable financing options which could have been used as well.   The tool performs well in giving clear suggestions about which types of finance is of best interest to   the firm regarding its solvency and credit rating. On top of that  the credit rating and the comparison   with industry data from similar firms functions as projected. Nevertheless  during the use of the tool   several suggestions for improvement of the tool came to mind to make it even more useful for the   user. These are discussed in chapter 7. Due to the time limit of the thesis only two cases were used   to validate the tool. In the future the validation can be made more rigorous if the tool is validated by   using more cases.                    58                  6  Reflection on research goal and research questions   Looking back at the research questions defined in section 1.3  it can be concluded that the all three   questions have been answered resulting in the achievement of the overall goal of the research.    An analysis was made of the current Dutch financing market for SMEs and the difficulties facing SMEs   have been studied (RQ 1). Subsequently  this research investigated all the traditional and new   alternative financing options on the market  specified and assessed these and judged them on the   appropriateness for MM&C’s client range (RQ 2). The last section of the thesis describes the   customized tool made for MM&C which proposes the most suitable financing options in the market   for a certain SME’s financing need (RQ 3). The tool supports the new trend to combine financing   options to form a total funding solution.                                  59     7  Suggestions for improvement of the tool    The finance decision support tool has been mainly designed to give a funding proposal for an SME   with a certain funding need. Fundamentally  the tool succeeds in accomplishing this goal. This was   demonstrated by the validation phase of this thesis.    However  the tool can be further optimized to display more relevant information  make the displayed   information more meaningful to the user and to create a more accurate funding proposal.    Suggestions for further improvements of the tool are       1.  As mentioned in section 4.5 the tool is a highmaintenance tool which requires MM&C to     regularly update the tool with future emerging financing options or modified specifications   (i.e. finance period  amounts financed  funding goals  type of finance) of the existing   financing options in the tool.     2.  The scoring criteria in the credit rating each have each been assigned a weight which     contributes to the total score. Currently  the credit rating gives a fairly accurate idea of the   creditworthiness of a firm. However  the credit rating still leaves room for improvement to   make it even more accurate. Although the criteria have been allocated weights by experts of   MM&C  it is still advised to regularly reassess these weights in the future. One way to do this   is by checking which criteria banks or other financiers use to rate MM&C’s clients and how   important they value these criteria in funding applications. Possibly some financiers develop   credit scores as well for MM&C’s clients in the funding application process which can be used   to finetune the tool’s credit rating model.     3.  The tool currently automatically calculates the Altman Zscore for a firm. However  the score   could inform the user even more if it can be compared with average Zscores of similar firms   in the same industry. The suggestion is to find data on Zscores of firms for each type of   industry and insert these in the tool in order to make a comparison of Zscores possible.      4.  Almost all financing options choose not to finance certain industries. Some specific financing     options such as RDC’s and the three institutional investment funds explicitly state the   industries they do not finance. This information is currently stated in the funding proposal   whenever one of these financing options is suggested. However  the tool does not filter   financing options based on industries they do not finance. A suggestion for the tool’s further   improvement is to first research which industries each financing options does not fund and   subsequently let the tool filter financing options based on this information. It must be noted   that this can be timeconsuming practice.     5.  As mentioned in section 5.3  due to the time limit of the thesis only two cases were used to     validate the tool. In the future the validation can be made more rigorous if the tool is   validated by using more cases.     The tool can also be improved in order to suggest an optimal funding option or combination on the   basis of price and financing period. This can be done with the following improvements      6.  Currently  the cost class of a financing option is displayed which aids the user in selecting     financing option(s) and combinations on the basis of price. A suggestion for further   improvement of the tool is to research the cost of funding (exact or a range) for each   financing option. The cost of each proposed financing option over its expected financing   period can be estimated making it possible for the user to subsequently chose the optimal   option or combination.                        60     7.  As mentioned in section 4.4.1.1  debt repayments and interest must be able to be paid from     the earning capacity  EBITDA(L). The tool can be further improved by using the current and   future P&L statements to automatically calculate in what time span debt and interest can be   paid. Subsequently  the tool can suggest an optimal financing period for a debt financing   option (within the range of the finance option) whereby the SME pays as little costs as   possible. Furthermore  the P&L statements can be used to detect a strong growth pattern in   turnover. It can then be used to suggest financing by means of equity.      MM&C may decide to further professionally develop this tool in order to make it available online and   therefore create a solution to the distribution problem of alternative financing options.                                                    61     Bibliography   Aegon Asset Management.

Debt   can be subordinated to for instance only the bank or even to all   creditors. Subordinated debt can be unsecured or (partly) secured.   Subordinate loans typically have a higher yield than senior debt due   to the higher risk involved.   By many financial institutions  subordinate debt is regarded as part of   owner’s equity for solvency calculations. Often banks only allow the   subordinated to loan to be repaid after the bank has been (partly)   repaid.     Risk capital                 Private equity or subordinated debt.       Intrinsic value      Goodwill      The intrinsic value of a firm is determined by subtracting the liabilities   from the total sum of the value of assets. The intrinsic value is   essentially the owner’s equity.     Intangible asset which can originate in the case of an acquisition. It   comprehends the part of the market value of a firm which is not   directly attributable to the assets of a firm. It can be regarded as the   surplus value of a firm on top of owner’s equity. Goodwill is   depreciated over a number of years.     Balance sheet total           Total assets or owner’s equity + liabilities          Deferred tax      Grace period      A future tax debt. Technically  the tax debt does not exist yet.   However  it is certain that the debt will be collected by the tax   authorities somewhere in the future. For example  if a company   premises is revalued for €100k by a certain amount on the balance   sheet  the firm is required to pay corporate tax over this amount (20  25% in the Netherlands) at the moment the property would be sold.     A with the financier agreed period in which no repayments of debt   have to be made. A grace period can be installed in for instance the   case an investment will start generating returns only after a certain   period. Normally interest payments will still have to made  but also   this is negotiable. Grace periods are usually active in the first months   or possibly years of the loan.      Nonrecourse factoring      Form of factoring whereby also the credit risk is transferred to the   factor. In other words  the factor will account for the risk of a bad   debt.           Final installment payment      The (extra) amount that has to be paid at the end of a lease contract.                                     69     Appendix III  Financial ratios    The sources of the definitions  meaning and interpretation of financial ratios are from practitioners of   MM&C  Atrill & McLaney (2011)  Investopedia (2017) and official annual accountant reports of Hoek   and Blok Accountants in Sliedrecht.        Current ratio           Quick ratio           Working capital                           𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠    𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠              Reveals the ability of a business to meet its shortterm payment   obligations. Different type of businesses require different type of   current ratio. The higher the ratio the more liquid the business is   considered to be. In general  a current ratio of 1 and higher is   considered sound.                              𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠−𝑖𝑛𝑣𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑜𝑟𝑖𝑒𝑠     𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠              The quick ratio is used for the same reason as the current ratio. It is   mostly used for firms which have nonliquid inventories. In general  a   quick ratio of 1 and higher is considered sound.           𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠 − 𝑐𝑢𝑟𝑟𝑒𝑛𝑡 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠     The capital a firm needs to fulfill its payment obligations. Current   assets such as inventories and accounts receivable create a funding   need which is funded by accounts payable and other current   liabilities. Working capital must be as small as possible  yet enough to   fulfill payment obligations.       Solvency (way of MM&C)           𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑟′𝑠 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦 − 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠  𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 − 𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑎𝑛𝑔𝑖𝑏𝑙𝑒 𝑎𝑠𝑠𝑒𝑡𝑠         Represents the proportion of owner’s equity and liabilities on a firm’s   balance sheet. Solvency benchmarks are different per industry but in   general a sufficient solvency is between 25 and 40% (appendix VI).   Solvency gives an indication of the creditworthiness  the capability of   a firm to pay back its liabilities in the long term.     Solvency (way of CBS)        Solvency (way of Huijgens)           𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑟′𝑠 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦    𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑙𝑖𝑎𝑏𝑖𝑙𝑖𝑡𝑖𝑒𝑠         𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙 𝑜𝑤𝑛𝑒𝑟′𝑠 𝑒𝑞𝑢𝑖𝑡𝑦  𝑏𝑎𝑙𝑎𝑛𝑐𝑒 𝑠ℎ𝑒𝑒𝑡 𝑡𝑜𝑡𝑎𝑙         Accounts receivable days      𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑠 𝑟𝑒𝑐𝑒𝑖𝑣𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒     𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟    × 365     Measures how long on average customers take to pay the invoice   after it has been sent. Businesses prefer a short average settlement   period because these funds can be used for more profitable   purposes. Having accounts which are more than 90 days late is   alarming.          70                       Accounts payable days       𝑎𝑐𝑐𝑜𝑢𝑛𝑡𝑠 𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑎𝑏𝑙𝑒     𝑝𝑢𝑟𝑐ℎ𝑎𝑠𝑖𝑛𝑔 𝑝𝑟𝑖𝑐𝑒 𝑜𝑓 𝑡𝑢𝑟𝑛𝑜𝑣𝑒𝑟    × 365     Measures how long on average the business takes to pay those who   have supplied good and services on credit. Accounts payable are a   free source of funding  however it must be noted not to risk the   goodwill of suppliers. An average of more than 90 days might be a   sign of liquidity problems of the firm.

A high ratio suggests a firm may not be   able to repay its debt in an appropriate time span and results in a   lower creditworthiness. Generally  a ratio of 4 or higher is considered   too high (but depends on the industry).    Short and longterm debt includes operational & financial lease but   excludes subordinated debt payments.

A DSCR higher than 1 means the firm has sufficient   income to service current debt obligations. Total debt and interest   payments of one year. Including lease but excluding subordinated   debt payments.     Interest coverage ratio       𝑜𝑝𝑒𝑟𝑎𝑡𝑖𝑜𝑛𝑎𝑙 𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑢𝑙𝑡  𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟𝑒𝑠𝑡 𝑝𝑎𝑦𝑚𝑒𝑛𝑡𝑠         It indicates the firm’s ability to pay off its interest obligations and   moreover how much the operational result can decline without the   firm getting into financial trouble. Generally a ratio between 3 and 5   is considered sufficient. Interest payments of one year.       The free cash flow surplus/deficit is the net profit after tax plus   depreciation minus the change in working capital minus capital   expenditures. The free cash flow is the cash available to the firm after   the financing of projects to maintain or expand the asset base. It   measures the cash flow available for distribution to stockholders.              71     Free cash flow                   Appendix IV  Credit rating criteria   As an example  this credit rating is filled in for GPC (case study 1).
