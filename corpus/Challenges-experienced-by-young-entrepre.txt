The  study  involved  nonprobability   purposive  sampling  sample  of  50  young  entrepreneurs  from  government  and  private  business.   The findings showed that a lack of support to young entrepreneurs from financial institutions  a   lack  of  personal  savings  and  business  regulations  were  prominent  challenges   which  affected   young entrepreneurs. The study also projected that education of the entrepreneurs affected their   perception towards  challenges. For instance  the  perception in startup and financing   running   business  and  business  support  services  were  almost  equal  between  the  graduate  and  the   postgraduate  entrepreneurs.  The  smallscale  entrepreneurs  experienced  many  challenges  in   business support services compared to the medium scale entrepreneurs. The sole proprietors and   partnership  business  had  almost  equal  perception  on  startup  and  financing   business   registration  and  regulatory  and  business  support  service  challenges.  However   the  sole   proprietors faced more problems in running their business.

INTRODUCTION     Young  entrepreneurs  are  faced  with  immense  problems  when  entering  the  small  and   medium  enterprise  sector.  India  has  the  second  largest  population  across  the  globe  with  1.2   billion  people   the  majority  of  which  are  young  and  unemployed  (Sarkar   2016).  The  Indian   Prime  Minister   Narendra  Modi   started  the  Standup  India  initiative  to  ensure  job  creation  for   the  young  people  through  bank  financing  of  their  startups.  Despite  the  incentives   young   entrepreneurs are still faced with immense challenges (Sarkar  2016). The government started the   Mudra  Bank  to  address  financing  issues  among  the  young  entrepreneurs  entering  the   manufacturing  and  the  small  business  units.  Some  of  the  perceived  challenges  include  lack  of   information  on  entrepreneurial  culture  and  awareness   taxation  issues   regulatory  issues  and   social  issues  such  as  limited  understanding  of  market  structure  and  lack  of  mentorship  and   guidance  among  the  young  entrepreneurs  (Sharifi  &  Hossein   2015).  According  to  Hyder  and   Lussier  (2016)   almost  50  percent  of  new  businesses  fail  in  their  first  five  years  of  operation.   Lack  of  adequate  capital  is  one  of  the  factors  that  attribute  to  the  failure  of  these  businesses.   Business  operations  require  adequate  funds  to  operate  effectively  (Adisa   2014).  Most  of  the   young  entrepreneurs  do  not  have  access  to  adequate  credit  to  support  their  business.  Adequate   finance  stimulates  the  growth  and  the  development  of  the  small  and  medium  business          1                                                                      15282686244176     Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal                                                                                                    Volume 24  Issue 4  2018        enterprises.  Lack  of  information  is  another  challenge  faced  by  the  young  entrepreneurs  as  they   try to enter or start small and medium business enterprises. Lack of information greatly hinders   the  flow  of  credit  to  the  entrepreneurs  (Chawla  &  Sujatha   2016).  Most  of  the  young   entrepreneurs do not understand the funding procedures  policies and eligibility.     The  study  established  that  the  young  entrepreneurs  in  Surashtra  Region  (Rajkot)  of   Gujarat State  India are faced with financing difficulties. Entrepreneurship education is essential   in the successful running of the small and medium business enterprises (Fayolle & Gailly  2015).   Lack  of  business  experience  and  family  commitment   which  obstruct  the  success  of  young   entrepreneurs   was  another  prominent  challenge  facing  the  young  entrepreneurs.  Compared  to   joint  businesses   the  sole  proprietor  has  individual  liability  for  the  debts  incurred  by  their   business.  They  are  personally  liable  for  the  legal  issues  of  their  business   whereas  in  joint   businesses   all  partners  are  liable  (Beyers  &  Maswanganyi   2016).  The  sole  proprietors  are  at   high risk of losing their personal assets whenever the business fails (Dorathy  2015).     LITERATURE REVIEW     This  section  addresses  the  findings  from  different  empirical  studies  on  the  challenges   experienced  by  the  young  entrepreneurs   education  of  the  entrepreneurs  and  perception  of  the   challenges  experienced  by  the  sole  proprietors  and  partnerships.  The  section  concludes  by   comparing the perception of challenges experienced by small and medium enterprises.          Challenges  Experienced  by  Young Entrepreneurs  When  Entering  the  Small  and  Medium   Enterprise Sector     Young entrepreneurs experience many challenges when entering into  business. Some of   these  challenges  include  insufficient  funds   unfavorable  government  policies  and  lack  of   experience  in  running  the  enterprise.  The  lack  of  funds  is  a  prominent  challenge  affecting   entrepreneurs in India (HampelMilagrosa et al.  2015). Insufficient funds from creditors restrict   the  growth  of  the  business.  The  small  ventures  need  adequate  funds  to  enhance  operational   efficiency.  Entrepreneurs  have  to  spend  money  to  make  an  impact  in  communities.  The   entrepreneurs  need  to  have  adequate  funds  to  ensure  they  address  all  aspects  of  the  business   stages (Khosa & Kalitanyi  2014). Capital is essential from the startup stages until the time the   organisation is mature and controls a bigger percentage of the market. Additionally  they require   adequate funds to expand the business  employ more  employees and provide them with a good   salary  according  to  their  job  description  (Porter  &  Kramer   2019).  Most  entrepreneurs  do  not   spend the money; therefore  their ventures become limited to growth. When sufficient funds are   not invested in a qualified workforce  technology  marketing  and provision of the best working   environment  its growth becomes limited (Sarkar  2016). A business enterprise requires a lot of   money  to  successfully  go  through  all  the  stages  of  development  and  expand  to  provide   employment  opportunities  to  more  employees  because  of  the  increased  workload.  Funds  are   essential  for  the  timely  payment  of  salaries   training  and  the  provision  of  bonuses  to  the   employees to ensure they are motivated  therefore  being able to invest their best skills within the   organisation. Limited credit is one of the biggest challenges facing new entrepreneurs.               2                                                                      15282686244176     Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal                                                                                                    Volume 24  Issue 4  2018        Education of Entrepreneurs with their Perception of Challenges      Entrepreneurship  education  is  essential  for  the  successful  running  of  the  small  and  the   medium  business  enterprises (Fayolle  & Gailly  2015). Education on entrepreneurship prepares   the  entrepreneurs  for  the  management   financing  and  the  marketing  elements   which  are   significant  in  the  running  of  the  business  operations.  Adequate  business  education  promotes   individuals  in  developing  successful  business  enterprises  through  enhancing  entrepreneurial   thinking   which  is  essential  for  a  robust  economy  and  sustainable  development  (Fayolle  &   Gailly   2015).  Challenges  are  inevitable  when  running  a  business;  therefore   education  of  the   entrepreneurs  becomes  a  tool   which  can  alter  these  challenges  into  opportunities   thereby   promoting the growth of their ventures.     Entrepreneurs’  education  helps  overcome  some  of  the  challenges   which  affect  the   entrepreneurs. According to Bae (2014)  there is a correlation between entrepreneurial education   and  entrepreneurial  intentions.  The  human  capital  and  selfefficacy  theories  support  this   ideology. The human capital theory is the greatest determinant for the development of the small   and  the  medium  enterprises.  The  skills  and  knowledge  of  the  human  capital  are  based  on   schooling   frequent   the   entrepreneurial selfefficacy  which is a catalyst for the entrepreneurial intentions.     training  and  experience.  Entrepreneurship  education  promotes     Education  provides  the  entrepreneurs  with  the  required  knowledge  on  how  to  run  their   ventures. Educated entrepreneurs address the problems in critical and creative ways compared to   those entrepreneurs with limited education (Nabi  2017). Education is essential in analysing the   competitors  advertising  keeping up with current trends and the target market. Skills alone might   limit the entrepreneurs  as the other aspects require an indepth understanding of the successful   running of business ventures. Education promotes entrepreneur in doing research about the other   ventures to identify their strengths and weakness.     Challenges Faced by Sole Proprietorship and Partnership Businesses.          Unlimited  liability  is  one  the  challenges  facing  the  sole  proprietorship  and  partnership   businesses. Both the sole proprietors and the partners in a joint business have unlimited liability    therefore  they are liable for the debts incurred by their business. They are personally liable for   the legal issues of their business (Beyers & Maswanganyi  2016). The sole proprietors are at risk   of  losing  their  personal  assets  whenever  the  business  fails.  Additionally   they  are  faced  with   governancerelated  challenges  (Dorathy   2015).  Most  of  these  businesses  face  challenges  of   recruiting  the  employees  who  possess  the  required  experience  and  right  skills  to  ensure  and   enhance  operation  efficiency  within  the  business.  It  becomes  difficult  for  the  organisations  to   recruit suitable workers because of lower pay and the limited responsibilities of some the smaller   organisations.  Skilled  and  experienced  employees  demand  higher  wages  and  other  benefits    which  are  provided  by  the  larger  companies  because  they  generate  greater  profits  and  have   bigger  operations.  Furthermore   they  are  faced  with  the  regulatory  challenges  (Abraham  et  al.    2017). Some countries have strict taxation policies  which affect  the profitability of a business.   They  are  taxed  heavily  with  regard  to  the  services  they  provide;  therefore   they  are  forced  to   raise  the  prices  of  their  products  and  services  and  in  doing  so   most  of  these  businesses  lose   many potential customers.               3                                                                      15282686244176     Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal                                                                                                    Volume 24  Issue 4  2018        Perception of Challenges Experienced by Small and Medium Enterprises     The size of the business is a determinant of the challenges facing the entrepreneurs. Small   and  medium  entrepreneurs  require  a  team  of  specialists  for  the  different  fields  like  human   resources and accountants (Burns  2016). Provision of employment to these people will require   constant  cash  flow  and  registration  with  the  relevant  authorities.  The  small  entrepreneur  will   require a limited number of employees  therefore  in most cases  their operations are manageable   (Burns  2016). The hiring of employees to aid in the provision of the services and the production   of the goods is a serial problem for most of the startups. Additionally  having the right team for   the effective operation is a challenge to most of the entrepreneurs. The growth of the small and   medium  enterprises  is  crippled  when  the  right  team  and  structure  is  not  in  place.  The  large   businesses have many operations; therefore  a lot of information of reports is generated from the   operation.  The  management  of  these  reports  is  critical  to  the  growth  of  the  business.   Additionally  the medium business  is faced with the management crisis.  Leadership determines   the operation of the organisation (Zhou  2016). The entrepreneurs are in full management of their   business  and  most  of  them  do  not  have  expertise  in  leadership  management  to  aid  in  strategic   decision  making  and  other  top  management  duties  for  their  ventures  (Fatoki   2014).  The  top   leadership is responsible for communicating vision  duties  goals and resolving the organisation   conflicts. Poor leadership is a precedent for the poor performance within the small and medium   business enterprises.     Johansen     (2014)  entrepreneurship  education     is  “the  promotion  of  different   entrepreneurial capabilities  students’ qualities  and their attitude towards different items in the   world  like  ready  to  take  actions.”  Some  studies  highlight  the  positive  relationship  between   entrepreneurship education and business startup intentions (Lena & Wong  2003) however and   besides  that   personal  characteristics  also  have  an  important  role  in  shaping  the  motivation  to   start up a business.     Problem Statement     RESEARCH METHODOLOGY          Entrepreneurs  are  exposed  to  adverse  challenges  when  joining  the  small  business   enterprises.  According  to  Fatoki  (2014)   government  policies  have  attributed  to  the  challenges   facing  the  entrepreneurs.  For  instance   heavy  taxation  does  not  provide  a  good  working   environment for the small business especially those competing with the bigger institutions or the   government institutions to offer the same services. Whenever sole proprietors fail to meet the tax   requirement  they are often penalised with huge fines  which become the genesis for the failure   of the organisation to pick up and make an impact to the community (Everhart  2018). Another   factor  which hinders the growth of the business enterprises  is task orientation (Trofimov  2017).   Many  of  the  entrepreneurs  focus  on  the  jobs  and  tasks  they  have  at  hand   which  they  perform   brilliantly   but  they  forget  about  the  longterm  strategy  that  is  essential  for  the  growth  of  the   organisation. Furthermore  the education of the entrepreneurs  the nature and type of the business   are critical in determining the severity of the challenges that face the entrepreneurs.                    4                                                                      15282686244176     Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal                                                                                                    Volume 24  Issue 4  2018        Research Objectives     The research objectives for the study are as follows      Objective 1  To study the challenges experienced by young entrepreneurs.   Objective  2   To  compare  perception  of  challenges  experienced  by  sole  proprietors  and   partnership businesses.   Objective  3   To  compare  perception  of  challenges  experienced  by  young  entrepreneurs  with   different educational qualifications.   Objective4  To compare perception of challenges experienced by small and medium enterprises.        Null Hypothesis     H01   There  is  no  significant  difference  in  mean  perception  of  challenges  experienced  by  Sole  Proprietor     and Partnership business.     H02   There  is  no  significant  difference  in  mean  perception of  challenges  experienced  by Graduate/Lower     and Post Graduate entrepreneurs.     H03  There is no significant difference in mean perception of challenges experienced by entrepreneurs from     small and medium scale firms.     Need for the Study     The need for this study was to provide a better understanding of the reasons why young   entrepreneurs  fail  in  establishing  a  small  and  medium  business.  Understanding  of  these   challenges the young entrepreneurs face should avail assistance and vital information for the new   entrepreneurs  to  succeed.  Several  studies  have  established  that  lack  of  adequate  capital    entrepreneurial  education  and  poor  government  policies  are  some  of  the  challenges  affecting   young  entrepreneurs.  The  present  study  elaborates  on  these  challenges  and  how  they  limit  the   growth  of  small  and  medium  business  enterprises   by  examining  the  correlation  between   entrepreneurial  education  and  perception  of  the  entrepreneurial  challenges.  Additionally   the   study of these challenges focuses on the size and type of the business  therefore  providing young   entrepreneurs with indepth knowledge to manage their enterprises.     Study Population     The aim of this study is to investigate the challenges experienced by young entrepreneurs   in Rajkot city of Saurashtra region  Gujarat  India. Therefore  the study population of the current   study consists of fifty young entrepreneurs in Saurashtra region.     Sample Description      Questionnaires  were  distributed  to  and  completed  by  young  entrepreneurs  from  the   manufacturing and service sectors. The researcher personally approached each entrepreneur via   phone  or  email.  Out  of  all  contacted  entrepreneurs   fifty  were  selected  using  convenience   sampling   which  is  a  nonprobability  purposive  sampling  method.  As  it  was  difficult  to  get  an          5                                                                      15282686244176     Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal                                                                                                    Volume 24  Issue 4  2018        appointment  with  all  entrepreneurs  from  Saurashtra  region   the  researcher  obtained  contact   details  of  entrepreneurs  from  government  offices  and  unions  of  entrepreneurs  in  that  region.   After obtaining contact details  the researcher tried to contact each entrepreneur through personal   calls  or  emails  and  sent  out  the  questionnaire  to  be  completed.  It  is  a  descriptive  exploratory   analytical research work carried out using pretested questionnaires.     Sampling Methods     Sampling  is  a  method  of  getting  a  portion/part  from  a  whole  group  or  population  of   concern   selected  based  on  scientific  method  in  such  a  way  that  it  can  be  representative  of  the   entire  population.  Nonprobability  purposive  sampling  technique  is  appropriate  because  young   entrepreneurs who are be able to define challenges they face when entering the SME sector  were   required to partake of this study. The sampling was based on the availability of the participants   and those who were willing to participate in the survey.      Research Instrument     This  is  a  descriptive  and  exploratory  study  using  a  quantitative  approach.  Quantitative   data  such as personal information  views on developing entrepreneurship and grading challenges   faced by young entrepreneurs in India  will be gathered through pretested semistructured close   ended questions. The closed ended questions related to challenges faced by young entrepreneurs   in India and were asked in the form of a fivepoint Likert scale as follows  1) Strongly disagree    2) Disagree  3) Neutral  4) Agree  5) Strongly agree.     Quality Control     In the current study  two forms of validity  namely construct validity and content validity   were checked. To check construct validity of the instrument  factor analysis was carried out and   total  statements  were  grouped  into  meaningful  factors/variables.  Content  validation  of  the  tool   was done by distributing prepared tool to five subject experts. Their opinions were incorporated   in  final  draft.  In  this  way   content  validity  was  checked.  Reliability  refers  to  the  replicability   and/or  reproducibility.  The  reliability  of  the  research  instrument  was  checked  using  the   Cronbach’s Alpha statistics.     Informed Consent and Voluntary Participation     Informed consent is the agreement to take part in a study with knowledge of the process    the  advantages  and  the  disadvantages.  To  ensure  compliance  with  the  ethical  principal  of   informed  consent   the  entrepreneur  was  informed  of  the  true  nature  of  the  study  as  well  its   objectives  so  that  they  could  make  an  informed  decision  to  allow  this  study  to  take  place.  In   addition  the participants of the study  which were the young entrepreneurs  were provided with   sufficient information so that they could make an informed decision whether to take part in the   study or not. Participants were asked to  give consent that reflected their desire to participate in   the  study  voluntarily.  No  participant  was  forced  to  take  part  in  the  study.  The  study  was   voluntary and the participants were made aware of their right to withdraw from participating in   the study when they felt like withdrawing. Privacy and confidentiality was maintained during the   data collection process. The interview data that was made during the interviews was kept strictly   confidential.          6                                                                      15282686244176     Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal                                                                                                    Volume 24  Issue 4  2018        DATA ANALYSIS     Data analysis involves summarising data using tables and graphs  inferential statistics and   interpreting data in simple language. In other words  it is a process of getting information from   data  that  the  researcher  converts  into  meaningful  information.  The  quantitative  data  collected   was organised  tabulated and analysed using descriptive and inferential statistics. Independent t  test  was  carried  out  to  compare  two  groups  of  means.  Reliability  of  the  tool  was  tested  using   Cronbach’s  alpha  and  construct  validity  was  tested  using  factor  analysis.  Statistical  Package   STATA/MP 13 version was used to assist in data analysis.      Results and Interpretations     The present study was carried out on 50 entrepreneurs from Rajkot city  Gujarat State in   India.  Demographic  details  of  selected  respondents  are  given  in  Table  1.  Out  of  the  50   12   percent had a matric certificate  22 percent were graduates  4 percent were diploma holders and   62  percent  were  postgraduates  or  had  higher  education.  This  study  focused  on  small  and   medium  scale  industries.  There  were  31  (62%)  small  scale  and  remaining  38  percent  medium   scale  industries  in  the  selected  sample.  The  nature  of  the  organisation  was  divided  into  two   groups.  The  first  group  consists  of  sole  proprietors;  whereas   second  group  consists  of   partnership   family  businesses  and  businesses  of  another  nature.  Out  of  total  50  industries   56   percent belonged to first group and remaining 44 percent to the second group.

The  alpha  value  is  0.78   which  shows  good  reliability  of  the   scale.     Factor Analysis for Construct Validity     Factor  analysis  was  carried  out  to  check  construct  validity  of  the  tool.  For  this  study    factor  analysis  was  performed  on  16  statements  related  to  challenges  experienced  in  running  a   business  for  young  enerpreneors.  KMO  measures  of  sampling  adequacy  were  used  to  examine   appropriateness of factor analysis. In this study  it was 0.593  which was acceptable and justified   the  appropriateness  of  the  analysis.  Bartlett’s  test  of  sphericity  shows  significance  (pvalue   <0.001). Out of 16 statements  four factors were extracted and together contributed 57.87 percent   of the total variance  which proved the validation of the factor analysis.           7                                                                      15282686244176     Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal                                                                                                    Volume 24  Issue 4  2018           With the use of rotated matrix  four groups (factors) were formed  Startup and Financing (SF);   Business  Registration  and  Regulatory  (RR);  Running  Business  (RB);  and  Business  Support   Services (BSS).     A  fivepoint  Likert  scale   1)  Strongly  disagree   2)  Disagree   3)  Neutral   4)  Agree   5)   Strongly agree was used to get perceptions of entrepreneurs on challenges experienced by them.   For each group mentioned above  responses were totalled for each entrepreneur. Thus  the sum   of responses in SF  RR  RB and BSS were obtained for each respondent. A higher value of the   sum shows agreement on experience challenges.     Challenges Experienced by Young Entrepreneurs     During  primary  data  collection   the  researcher  attempted  to  discover  challenges   experienced  by  the  respondents  through  an  openended  question.  As  per  the  responses   the   biggest challenge for young entrepreneurs to run a startup company was the unknown market.      Limited or no knowledge of customers and market requirement is a primary problem of   the  young  entrepreneurs.  Interest/choice  of  customers  is  an  important  thing  which  an   entrepreneur  should  know  for  their  business.  Majority  of  the  entrepreneurs  found  difficulty  in   understanding  customers’  choice  or  test  about  the  product/service.  Demand  and  supply  plays   most  important  role  in  running  any  business.  Entrepreneurs  are  feeling  difficult  to  understand   market  requirement  and  source  of  supply  of  raw/other  materials  of  the  product.  Young   entrepreneurs  are  unable  to  understand  market  pattern.  Struggle  for  supply  chain   raw  material   and literacy in latest technology are challenges for the young entrepreneurs.     Another challenge was clarity in the cycle of taxation and other government laws to run   businesses. For any newcomer in the business  it is very difficult to emerge from these problems.   Recently  the  Indian  government  changed  the  format  of  taxation.  Instead  of  sales  tax   central   excise and other taxes  central government has implemented a new tax formula  which is known   as  CST/GST.  During  2017   many  of  modifications  and  changes  in  rules  were  made  and  hence   entrepreneurs  experienced  problems  in  understanding  and  implementing  legislation  for  their   business.  Entrepreneurs  are  being  assisted  by  tax  experts   lawyers  or  Chartered  Accountants   (CAs) for this purpose.      H01  There is no significant difference in mean perception of challenges experienced by     Sole Proprietor and Partnership business.     Table  2  shows  the  comparison  of  mean  perception  on  challenges  faced  by  sole   proprietors and partnership business entrepreneurs to run a new business. Mean score of startup   and financing is 14.79 among sole proprietors whereas it is 15.23 for those having partnership or   family business. Mean perception score for business regulation and registration is 15.54 for sole   proprietors  and  16.00  for  partnership/family  business  persons.  Perception  score  for  running   business  is  16.11  for  sole  proprietors  whereas  13.59  for  partnership/family  business  persons.   Similarly   for  business  support  services  it  is  8.86  and  9.05  for  sole  proprietor  and  partnership   businessman respectively.      Both groups of entrepreneurs had the same perception regarding challenges faced in SF    RR  and  BSS  (pvalue>0.05)  but  in  RB  sole  proprietor  firms  were  facing  more  problems/   challenges as compared to partnership business (pvalue=0.005). Compared to BSS  respondents   had more challenges in  SF  RR and RB. SF and registration of business  in regulatory body are          8                                                                      15282686244176     Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal                                                                                                    Volume 24  Issue 4  2018        the  biggest  challenges  for  all  new  entrepreneurs.  Lack  of  business  experience   limited  savings    family  commitment   skill  and  training  were  major  obstructions  in  the  success  of  young   entrepreneurs. The process of registering a new business is very long and complicated. Business   rules such as taxation are not easy to understand. Moreover  they do not have much knowledge   about the importance of patent  proprietary rights and trademark of their products and name. RB   is  more  challenging  for  sole  proprietors  as  compared  to  those  having  partnerships  or  family   businesses.  Lack  of  contracts   suppliers   suitable  partners  and  network  for  business  are  major   problems  for  young  entrepreneurs.  Human  resource  management  and  dealing  with  government   officials are not easy for the sole proprietor.

H02  There is no significant  difference in mean perception of  challenges experienced by     Graduate/Lower and Post Graduate entrepreneurs.     Table  3  shows  the  influence  of  education  of  entrepreneurs’  perception  regarding   challenges faced to run business. Mean score of startup and financing is 14.74 among graduates   whereas  it  is  15.13  for  those  who  have  higher  level  of  education.  Mean  perception  score  for   business  regulation  and  registration  is  13.63  for  graduates  and  17.03  for  post  graduates.   Perception  score  for  running  business  is  15.05  for  graduates  (or  lower)  whereas  14.97  for  post   graduate  business  persons.  Similarly   for  business  support  services  it  is  9.68  and  8.48  for   graduate and postgraduate businessmen respectively.     Perception in SF  RB and BSS was almost equal between two groups (pvalue>0.05). In   RR   postgraduate  entrepreneurs  were  facing  more  problems/challenges  compared  to  others  (p  value<0.001). Respondents who had lower educational qualifications understand that it is hard to   digest  complicated  rules  of  government  on  registration  and  regulation.  Hence   they  directly   approached  experts  of  this  field  like  lawyers   tax  experts  or  CAs  to  get  this  job  done.  On  the   other  hand   respondents  who  had  higher  qualifications  wanted  to  do  this  on  their  own.  Hence    they had more experience of challenges compared to other entrepreneurs.                    9                                                                      15282686244176     Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal                                                                                                    Volume 24  Issue 4  2018        COMPARISON OF PERCEPTIONS REGARDING CHALLENGES BETWEEN EDUCATIONAL     QUALIFICATION OF RESPONDENTS          Education     N     Mean     Std.

H03  There is no significant difference in mean perception of challenges experienced by     entrepreneurs from small and medium scale firms.     Table  4  shows  mean  perception  of  selected  small  and  medium  scale  entrepreneurs   regarding  challenges  faced  in  running  a  new  business.  Mean  score  of  startup  and  financing  is   14.87 for small scale whereas it is 15.16 for medium scale entrepreneurs.

To  overcome  this  problem    entrepreneurs should know the market  inter alia who wants the product  their need and reaction   to  the  product.  Swanson  and  Baird  2003  state  that  to  establish  a  niche  market  where  your   technology  and  product  could  be  profitable   you  need  to  know  your  customers  and  markets  a   market  where  there  is  a  commercial  value  for  products  or  services  being  offered  and  there  are   customers who are interested in your product or services. These events of buying and selling are   formally  dependent  on  demand  and  supply   which  is  a  golden  rule  of  any  business.  Thus    identifying the market and its requirement is a challenge experienced by young entrepreneurs. To   overcome this problem  they have to understand the requirements and interest of customers in the   product or service.     Challenges  like  the  struggle  for  supply  chains   raw  material  and  computer/technology   literacy are also experienced by young entrepreneurs in Rajkot city. Park (2005) suggests that the   start  of  the  designing  and  starting  a  new  business  requires  improvement  in  changes  as  per   expectations  of  customers.  New  business   regardless  of  the  size   faces  problems  to  implement   new/ innovative ideas (Schlesinger et al.  2012).     Financial challenges are a lot different in India especially for online entrepreneurs. When   a person starting new business  he/she don’t opt  for venture funding but  try to  go with funding   from small to medium business people or relatives/friends. Such nontechnical business persons   do  not  understand  the  business  model  as  a  whole  and  hence  getting  funding  for  them  became   very challenging (Santhi and Rajesh  2011).     There  are  lots  of  changes/reforms  in  the  policies  of  government  from  1990s  to  current   time.  Rules  and  regulations  of  central/state  governments  has  modified  over  the  period  of  time.   Before  the  current  government   in  India  sales  and  service  taxes  were  collected  whereas  it  was   totally converted in form of CST/GST format to get equalization in whole country. Modification   in  income  tax  rules  are  also  made  time  to  time  which  is  another  headache  for  the  young   entrepreneurs.       Table 2 depicts that there is no significant difference in perception of sole proprietor and   joint  business  persons  regarding  challenges  experienced  in  their  startups.  Compared  to  joint   businesses   the  sole  proprietor  has  individual  liability  for  the  debts  incurred  by  their  business.   They are personally liable for the legal issues of their business  whereas in joint businesses  all   partners are liable (Beyers & Maswanganyi  2016). The sole proprietors are at high risk of losing   their personal assets whenever the business fails (Dorathy  2015).     Table 3 shows no significant difference in running business and understanding regulation   between  entrepreneurs  having  lower  and  higher  educational  qualifications.  Entrepreneurship   education  is  essential  in  the  successful  running  of  the  small  and  medium  business  enterprises   (Fayolle  &  Gailly   2015).  Education  on  the  entrepreneurship  prepares  the  entrepreneurs  on  the   management   financing  and  the  marketing  elements   which  are  essential  in  the  running  of  the   business  operations.  According  to  Bae  (2014)   there  is  a  correlation  between  entrepreneurial   education  and  the  entrepreneurial  intentions.  The  human  capital  and  selfefficacy  theories   support this ideology. Educated entrepreneurs address the problems in critical and creative ways   compared  to  those  entrepreneurs  with  limited  education  (Nabi   2017).  Education  is  essential  in   analysing the competitors  advertising  current trends and the target market.          11                                                                      15282686244176     Academy of Entrepreneurship Journal                                                                                                    Volume 24  Issue 4  2018        Table  4  infers  there  is  no  significant  influence  of  business  size  on  perception  of   entrepreneurs regarding challenges experience during running new business. Najim et al. (2013)   concluded that entrepreneur’s properties like size of business does affect new projects’ chances   of  survival  by  twelve  percent.  Hamzah  (2009)  also  gave  similar  findings.  It  is  also  consistent   with  importance  of  leadership  in  a  business  which  is  highly  subjective  and  required  high   commitment.     CONCLUSION     The  study  established  that  the  young  entrepreneurs  in  Surashtra  Region  (Rajkot)  of   Gujarat  State   India  are  faced  with  financing  difficulties.  The  lack  of  support  to  young   entrepreneurs  from  financial  institutions  had  an  extraction  of  0.642   which  indicates  that  it  is   difficult  for  the  young  entrepreneurs  to  get  funding  for  their  ventures.  According  to  Hampel  Milagrosa  et  al.  (2015)   funds  are  critical  for  the  organisation  operations.  Most  young   entrepreneur’s stated that it was difficult for their business to attract funding. Additionally  lack   of  personal  savings  had  a  high  extraction  of  0.683   therefore   most  young  entrepreneurs  have   limited  funds  for  the  operation  of  their  enterprises.  Lack  of  business  experience  and  family   commitment   which  obstruct  the  success  of  young  entrepreneurs   was  another  prominent   challenge facing the young entrepreneurs. It had a high extraction value of 0.816. According to   Sarkar (2016)  most of the family’s challenges obstruct the young entrepreneurs from attending   to  their  business  effectively.  Another  challenge  with  a  high  extraction  value  of  0.637  was   business  regulations  (such  as  tax  rules)  that  govern  a  business  and  are  not  easy  to  understand.   According to Abraham et al. (2017)  government policies such as taxation and registration affect   the  operation  of  the  small  business.  Education  of  the  entrepreneur  affected  their  perception   towards challenges. For instance  the perception in SF  RB and BSS was almost equal between   the  graduates  and  the  postgraduate  entrepreneurs.  The  postgraduate  entrepreneurs  reported   experiencing  adverse  challenges  compared  to  graduates  concerning  the  registration  of  their   business. The smallscale entrepreneurs experienced many challenges in BSS compared to the to   medium  scale  entrepreneurs.  According  to  Burns  (2016)   smallscale  has  less  employees  and   specialists   therefore   many  support  services  challenges.  Lastly   both  the  sole  proprietors  and   partnership  business  had  an  almost  equal  perception  of  SF   RR  and  BSS challenges.  However    the sole proprietors were facing more problems in running their business. According to Dorathy   (2015)   they  are  faced  with  governancerelated  challenges.  Most  of  these  businesses  face   challenges  of  recruiting  the  employees  who  possess  the  required  experience  and  right  skills  to   enhance operation efficiency within the business.
