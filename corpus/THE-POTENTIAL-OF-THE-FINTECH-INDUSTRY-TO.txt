MASAAKI HIRANO     Summary     Small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  are  an  important  driver  of  economic  activity  in     most  developing  and  developed  economies.  In  developing  countries   SMEs’  role  become  more     crucial since SMEs can in fact become the engines that sustain growth for longterm development in     developing  countries.  SMEs  in  Indonesia  are  representing  one  of  model  of  SME  in  developing     countries. Criteria of SMEs in Indonesia is defined under the Law No. 20 year 2008 on Micro  Small      and Medium Enterprises based on the total net assets (excluding land and building) and annual sales     of the firms.          According to the data provided by the Indonesia Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs  as of     2013   there  are  around  57million  of  SMEs  in  total  operated  actively in  Indonesia  with  more  than     99%  of  SMEs  in  Indonesian  market  are  consisting  of  micro  enterprises  located  in  rural/backward     areas  and had little knowledge of financial issues. In 2012  SMEs in Indonesia contribute to 59% of     the total GDP in the country  97% of the total workers  and 15.7% of total export values. Similar to     SMEs  in  other  developing  countries   SMEs  in  Indonesia  experience  difficulties  to  access  the     financing  due  to  collateral/  guarantee  requirement  and  the  high  lending  rate.  As  a  result   it  is     negatively  affected  SME  survival  and  growth  rates  in  general.  Commercial  banks  and  traditional     financial institutions consider SME as risky and costly to serve  thus  SMEs are largely underserved     1          when it comes to basic financial services and tend to use the internal fund as source of financing.          The “FinTech” – short for “Financial Technology is a dynamic intersection of the financial     services  and  technology  sectors   where  technologyfocused  startups  and  new  market  entrants     innovate the products and services currently provided by the traditional financial service industry.     There are three periods of FinTech evolution based on the period of development  namely FinTech     1.0  FinTech 2.0  and recently FinTech 3.0. The FinTech 3.0  born during 2008 in the market  as the     main focus of this study has been driven by the needs of development and the inefficiencies in the     existing  financial  system   combined  with  the  rapid  introduction  and  reach  of  new  technology      particularly mobile communications. One of its product  namely peertopeer (P2P) lending platform      provides  market  place  of  unsecured  lending  service  which  could  benefit  the  most  for  SMEs  who     seek alternative financing.            The study is set out to explore whether FinTech industry have potential in Indonesia and     also to understand the main factor  in order for the FinTech services  could give utmost support for     the growth of SMEs’ business in Indonesia. A case comparison study of China’s FinTech industry is     carried in this study to examine how the FinTech industry successfully gain high traction in China’s     market and satisfy the financial needs of SMEs in China. China’s case is selected for the purpose of     this  study  because  both  China  and  Indonesia  as  developing  countries  have  some  common     environment  in  terms  of   (1)  population  density   (2)  number  of  unbanked  population;  (3)  the     importance  of  the  SMEs  in  economic  growth;  and  (4)  the  financial  constraint  by  SMEs  in  each     country.            The  P2P  lending  platform   creates  an  important  allocation  role   and  become  solution     especially  for  SMEs  in  China  that  have  constrained  the  credit  access.  It has gained traction and     market acceptance from SMEs seeking credit  mainly because  (1) no collateral is required to obtain     required amount of working capital; (2) the simplicity of application of lending process on paperless     basis; (3) faster lending approval and cash disbursement; (4) competitive lending rate; and (5) no     penalty is given in general from early repayment.            By  learning  from  China’s  FinTech  industry   there  are  three  conditions  are  observed  to  be     2          important as key success factors for the FinTech industry to support the growth of the SMEs  (1) the     digital technology adoption level of the SMEs  (2) the financial literacy skills of SMEs as user of     FinTech service  and (3) the regulatory frameworks.                      3     <Inside Cover>                  THE POTENTIAL OF THE FINTECH INDUSTRY       TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF SMES IN INDONESIA     351423388 RARAS MINERVA     MANAGEMENT STRATEGY AND       INDUSTRY EVOLUTION     C.E.

IMPORTANCE OF SMES FOR ECONOMIC GROWTH     Small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  are  a  major  driver  of  economic  activity  in  most     developing and developed economies. They account for more than half of the world’s gross domestic     product  (GDP)  and  employ  almost  twothirds  of  the  global  work  force  (World  Economic  Forum      2015).       The total number of SMEs is hard to estimate. More than 95% of enterprises across the world are     SMEs  accounting for approximately 60% of private sector employment (Edinburgh Group  2012).   As cited in the report from World Economic Forum (2015)  in emerging markets alone  there are   365 million to 445 million micro  small and mediumsized enterprises exist  out of which 25 million   to 30 million are formal SMEs and 55 million to 70 million are formal microenterprises  while the     rest  (285  million  to  345  million)  are  informal  enterprises  and  nonemployer  firms.  In  developed     markets  approximately 100 million formal SMEs exist. From the study  it shown that the formally     registered SMEs account for more than half of the GDP of highincome countries  the impact is even     higher if also taking into account “informal” small business.       Report from the Edinburgh Group (2012) also shown that the contribution made by SMEs     does vary widely between countries and regions. Nevertheless  although they play particularly key     roles  in  highincome  countries   SMEs  are  also  important  to  lowincome  countries   making     significant  contributions  to  both  GDP  and  employment.  Previous  study  on  SMEs  by  Viral  (2012)     also  mentioned  that  SMEs  play  important  role  in  promoting  grassroots  economic  growth  and     equitable sustainable development. The high rates of economic growth will contribute to economic     and social development and poverty reduction. However  it also depends on the quality of growth.     Quality  of  growth  includes  the  composition  of  growth   its  spread   and  distribution  and  most     importantly the degree of sustainability (Viral  2012).     7          Section 2.     SMES IN DEVELOPING COUNTRY     In developing countries  the roles of SMEs become more crucial because  other than SMEs     have  potential  to  support  the  improvement  of  income  distribution   employment  creation   poverty     reduction  and  national  export  growth   SMEs  also  leads  to  the  development  of  entrepreneurship      industry  and  the  rural  economy  (Viral   2012).  SMEs  can  in  fact  become  the  engines  that  sustain     growth for longterm development in developing countries. When growth becomes stronger  SMEs     gradually  assume  a  key  role  in  industrial  development  and  restructuring.  They  can  satisfy  the     increasing  local  demand  for  services   which  allows  increasing  specialization   and  furthermore     support larger enterprises with services and inputs (Edinburgh Group  2012).     SMEs in many developing countries had been strongly restricted in accessing the capital that     they needed to grow and expand  including SMEs in Indonesia. Banks do not provide SMEs with     adequate capital in many of developing countries (Edinburgh Group  2012). Due to high costs for     transactions  and  information  collection   as  well  as  immeasurable  risks   financial  institutions   generally hesitate to finance the SMEs. However  since SMEs are a critical component of economic   and  social  stability  in  a  country   improving  financial  access  for  SMEs  is  actually  important  to   enhancing production quality  increasing new business opportunities and as final result  stimulating   investment and consumption at the national level (Shinozaki  2012).       Section 3.     FINTECH TREND IN ASIA     The  advance  of  technology  integration  has  revolutionized  the  various  industries   and     financial industry is no exception. The approach of financial services from technology background      which currently popular with the term “FinTech”  is rising huge interest all over the world and also     in  Asian’s  market.  KPMG  (2015)  reported  that  in  2015   investment  in  Asia’s  FinTech  firm  rising     from $1.1 billion to $4.5 billion yearoveryear. During 2015  China’s FinTech investment growing     significantly  from just above $600 million in investment in 2014 to almost $2.7 billion in 2015 from     significant deals (KPMG  2015).       8               The local regulators in China were investigating FinTech’s opportunities at the first place in     order to see how they can use FinTech to accelerate innovation as financial solution for SMEs that     has been underserved by the large banks in past. There exists no regulation for FinTech’s industry at     first  in  China  for  several  years  and  the  FinTech’s  market  growth  exponentially  without  heavily     regulated  (Chen  and  Ernie   2015).  It  is  also  important  to  highlight  that  China  is  the  country  with     most  mobile  phone  users  in  the  world  (Statista   2016)  and  high  internet  penetration   reaching  the     rural area which enable the rapid adoption of new technologies  such as FinTech services.     Section 4.     SIGNIFICANCE OF THE STUDY       Considering  the  importance  of  SMEs  to  support  the  economic  growth  in  Indonesia  as     developing country  the financial constraint facing by the SMEs need to be addressed. This study     will focus on the potential of FinTech industry in Indonesia to support the growth of SMEs’ business     by  providing  alternative  financing  support  for  the  SMEs  in  Indonesia  which  currently  have  low     access to bank credit and obtain sufficient work capital. The case of China’s FinTech industry will be     selected as case comparison study along with literature review on general FinTech industry.     Section 5.     OUTLINE OF THE STUDY     Following  this  introduction  chapter   the  remaining  of  this  paper  is  organized  as  follows.     Chapter  2  describes  the  overview  of  SMEs  in  Indonesia   which  elaborates  on  the  SMEs’     characteristic and major challenge for SMEs in Indonesia. Next in Chapter 3 elaborates on invasion     of FinTech which consist of explanation of the FinTech evolution  the products of Fintech  the role     of  FinTech  to  support  the  growth  of  SMEs  by  learning  from  China’s  FinTech  industry.  Chapter  4     describes the FinTech for SMEs in Indonesia  including the SMEs adoption to IT and the potential of     FinTech  industry  in  Indonesia   together  with  analysis  in  comparison  to  China’s  FinTech  industry     case study. Lastly Chapter 5 presents the final conclusion and some recommendations.       9          CHAPTER 2.  OVERVIEW OF SMES IN INDONESIA     Section 1.     SMES CHARACTERISTIC IN INDONESIA       SME play a major role in economic and social development of countries in world  both in     developing and developed countries. As explained earlier  SMEs in Indonesia is representing one of     model of SME in  developing countries. According to Tambunan (2008)  SMEs in Indonesia have     historically  been  the  main  player  in  domestic  economic  activities  and  an  engine  for  economic     development. Although the growth of the Indonesian economy has been slowing since 2011 due to     the result of the global financial crisis  the growth of SMEs in Indonesia has remain increased from     time to time. It appears that the SMEs operation is not severely damaged from such crisis and could     survive  from  the  crisis.  (Asia  Development  Bank   2015).  Moreover   it  is  also  a  large  provider  of     employment  opportunities   and  hence  a  generator  of  primary  or  secondary  source  of  income  for     many households. The term of SMEs mention going forward in this study is also going to include the     micro enterprises in Indonesia.     2.1.1.  Definition of SMEs in Indonesia       For firms to be considered as SME may different from one and another country. As for     Indonesian  SMEs   definition  is  provided  under  the  Law  No.  20  year  2008  on  Micro   Small   and     Medium Enterprises (“SMEs Law 2008”). Definition for micro enterprises in Indonesia just recently     introduced under this SMEs Law 2008. Previously under the SMEs law issued on 1995  there is no     definition provided explicitly for micro enterprises.         SMEs is productive entity owned by an individual or individual business unit with certain     amount of net assets and sales. The foreignowned entity is not included by SMEs definition. The     criteria  of  SMEs  in  Indonesia  basically  divided  based  on  the  total  net  assets  (excluding  land  and     building) and annual sales of the firms.               10          Table 1  SMEs Criteria in Indonesia based on SMES Law 2008     No.     Enterprise     1     2     3     MICRO     SMALL     MEDIUM     Criteria     Net Assets       Annual Sales     Maximum Rp50million   (around US$3 800)   > Rp50million – Rp500million   (around US$3 800 – US$37 800)   > Rp500million – Rp10billion   (around US$37 800 – US$756 000)     Maximum Rp300million   (around US$22 700)   > Rp300million– Rp2.5billion   (around US$22 700 – US$187 700)   > Rp2.5billion – Rp50 billion   (around US$187 700  US$ 3 780 000 )     Note  US$1 equivalent to Rp13 230 based on rate from Central Bank of Indonesia     as of 26 June 2016)     2.1.2.  Growth of SMEs and Contribution of SMEs in Indonesia     According to the data provided by the Indonesia Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs  as of     2013  there are around 57million of SMEs in total operated actively in Indonesia. As can be seen in     Table 2 below  more than 99% of SMEs in Indonesian market are consisting of micro enterprises.     Deloitte (2015a) further stated in its study that the average years of operation of Indonesian SMEs at     approximately 16 years  which considerably high.

According to report by Deloitte (2015a)  in 2012  SMEs contributes to 59% of the total GDP in the     country  the highest among others three developing countries such as Thailand (37%)  Philippines     (34%)   and  Malaysia  (33%).  SMEs  in  Indonesia  also  noted  to  have  important  role  as  source  of     employment  which  stands  to  contribute  at  the  highest  (97%)   followed  by  Thailand  (81%)      Philippine (63%)  and Malaysia (58%).

This     composition claim has not been changed for long time (Asian Development Bank  2015).               12          Figure 2  Employment of SMEs in Indonesia  20072013               Source  Indonesian Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs     cited by Asian Development Bank  2015            Most  of  the  SMEs  in  Indonesia  familyowned  or  selfemployed  microenterprises  with     smallscale  routine  operations  within  a  limited  area.  Some  business  especially  in  traditional     handicrafts and wooden furniture industries  traditional fashion industries and food industries  have     developed their business models toward global marketplaces. As provided in Figure 3  Indonesian     SMEs has accounted for 15.7% of total export values or Rp182 trillion  with 9.3% annual growth in     2013.  However   the  SMEs  export  industry  remains  volatile   affected  by  demands  from  foreign     countries. SMEs exporters experienced sharply negative growth of –8.9% and –11.1% in 2009 and     2012  respectively  caused by the global financial crisis and the slow recovery of demand from trade     partners  such  as  the  People’s  Republic  of  China   Japan   and  Europe  (Asian  Development  Bank      2015).                         13          Figure 3  SMEs Export Activities  20072013          Source  Indonesian Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs     cited by Asian Development Bank  2015            Section 2.     MAJOR CHALLENGES FOR SMES IN INDONESIA         SMEs in Indonesia face numerous issues in order for them to grow and expand. Indrayani     et  al.  (n.d.)  stated  in  their  research  that  the  common  problem  is   among  others   (1)  lack  of  good     quality  of  human  resources;  (2)  high  price  of  raw  material  cost;  (3)  cash  flow  problem;  (4)  lack     technical skills to promote the product in market; (5) insufficient government support; (6) still using     traditional  technology;  and  (7)  difficulties  in  accessing  bank  facility   especially  in  rural  areas.  In     brief  the SMEs problem in Indonesia can be divided into two major categories  the nonfinancial     issues and financial issues.                      14          2.2.1.  SMEs NonFinancial Issues          Figure 4  Non Financing Challenges of SMEs (in%)          Source  Machmud and Huda  2011            According  to  research  by  Machmud  and  Huda  (2011)   both  SMEs  with  and  without     sufficient access to finance surprisingly have similar main issues as their obstacle to growth. More     than 50% express that the rising of business cost as their biggest problem to growth. The remaining     obstacle as reflected in Figure 5  are similar varying only in sequence between the SMEs with and     without access to finance; (1) the instability of consumer demand  (2) the increasing competition      and (3) difficulties in finding qualified labors.         Due to high competition in market  SMEs should be able to promote their product well in     market. However  SMEs in general do not have the resources to explore their own markets. Instead      they  depend  heavily  on  their  trading  partners  for  marketing  of  their  products   either  within  the     framework of local production networks and subcontracting relationships or orders from customers     (Tambunan  2006).       Although 97% of the Indonesian workforce employed by SMEs  the labor productivity is     still 10 times lower than that of large enterprises. Further  in context of of regulations  a complicated     and costly licensing process and excessive tax compliance costs are the main challenges faced by     15          SMEs.  These  cumbersome  and  onerous  business  regulations  and  restrictions  hamper  an  SME’s     business activities. (Deloitte  2015a). In this context  SMEs are looking for a less regulated business     environment  and are high concerned to lowering business costs and improving overall their labor     productivity.     2.2.2.  SMEs Financial Issues            In  terms  of  financial  source   it  is  reported  that  the  majority  of  SME  investments  were     financed by internal funds and only 6% of SMEs using bank loan as source of financing (Deloitte      2015a). Since SMEs in Indonesia are mostly microenterprises that located in rural/backward areas      they had little knowledge of financial issues (Shinozaki  2012).    They depend on their own savings      money from relatives  and credit from informal lenders for financing their daily business operations     (Tambunan  2006). Since they relying on their internal fund  SMEs are in better positioned to avoid     the serious shocks from the financial and banking crisis than large firms. However  low access to     finance negatively affected SME survival and growth rates in general. (Shinozaki  2012).       One of the challenges in SME financing is that their financial requirements are too large for     microfinance  but are too small to be effectively served by corporate banking models. According to     survey conducted in 2010 with 622i  microenterprises in Indonesia by Shinozaki (2012)  more than     60% of respondents implied that the collateral/ guarantee requirement and the high lending rate are     the biggest barriers for SMEs to access the financing. SMEs still considered by commercial banks     and financial institutions as risky and costly to serve  as a result SMEs are largely underserved when     it comes to basic financial services. SMEs therefore require some form of external financing to cover     financing needs.                                       16     Figure 5  Barriers to Financial Access               Source  Shinozaki  2012                    Information asymmetry is often quoted as a critical factor in SMEs’ funding difficulties.     Due  to  high  costs  for  transactions  and  information  collection   as  well  as  immeasurable  risks      financial institutions generally hesitate to finance SMEs. To mitigate such risks and reduce the cost     burden  financial institutions oblige SMEs to fulfill steep collateral and guarantee requirements  and     apply  high  interest  rates.  Not  surprisingly   SMEs  tend  to  regard  these  measures  as  serious     supplyside barriers.       Shinozaki  (2012)  further  emphasized  that  SMEs  comprise  a  variety  of  firms  in  terms  of     sector  scale  and management style. Therefore  a onesizefitsall approach to SME financing would     be useless. The appropriate financing scheme differs by growth stage of the SME and by level of     economic development of the host country. Since SMEs are a critical component of economic and     social stability in a country  improving financial access for SMEs is expected to bring many benefits      including  enhancing  production  quality   increasing  new  business  opportunities   stimulating     investment and consumption at the national level  and mobilizing excess corporate savings.     17          Section 3.     INDONESIAN SMES FINANCIAL SUPPORT SCHEME FROM GOVERNMENT            In  order  to  address  problems  of  accessing  the  financial  support   Indonesian  government     created  some  credit  programs  which  mainly  focus  on  loan  to  SMEs  which  namely  the  Small     Enterprises  Development  Program  (KIKKredit  Investasi  Kecil/  KMKPKredit  Modal  Kerja     Permanen)  the Small Enterprises Credit Program (KUKKredit Usaha Kecil)  and the Micro Credit     Loan Program (KUR – Kredit Usaha Rakyat).          2.3.1  The Small Enterprises Development Program (KIK/KMKP)       This program was established in 1973 where government provide the loan interest subsidy     for small enterprises owned by the local Indonesian people (called pribumi)  including the cottage     enterprises. The loan mainly purpose for the investment and working capital. The program managed     by  five  stateowned  commercial  banks   the  Indonesian  Development  Bank  (Bapindo  –  Bank     Pembangunan Indonesia)  all regional development banks (BPD Bank Pembangunan Daerah) and     other  14  private  banks.  However   due  to  high  default  rate  reaching  of  more  than  27%   this  credit     programs were stopped in 1990.          2.3.2  The Small Enterprises Credit Program (KUK)       After  failure  in  the  first  program  (KIK/KMKP)   in  1990  the  government  initiated  new     credit program called KUK. This program require all commercial banks in Indonesia to allocate 20%     of  their  loans  to  SMEs  for  helping  their  investment  and  working  capital.  Unlike  the  KIK/KMKP     program  previously   the  KUK  was  created  to  to  assign  interest  at  market  rate  rather  than  at  a     subsidized rate. However  repeating experience in KIK/KMKP program  KUK also did not perform     successfully. The banks were having difficulties in satisfy the requirement of 20% loans to SME. It     appeared that the banks tend to allocate more of their loans to consumption rather than the business     purposes.                 18               2.3.3     The Micro Credit Loan Program (KUR)       Under the Presidential Instruction Number 6 of 2007  the government then introduce the     government guaranteed loan for micro and small enterprises called KUR. This program established     to  mitigate  risks  associated  with  SME  finance  and  to  enhance  the  bankability  of  SMEs  that  lack     collateral. This scheme requires project or business activity as the principal collateral for the loan     and is intended to provide working capital and investment credit of up to Rp500 million. The loan     providers are commercial banks appointed by the government and there is no interest subsidy in this     scheme.         Based  on  a  report  from  the  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  (CMEA)   it  is     claimed  that  during  the  period  JanuaryDecember  2010   six  Indonesian  banks  (BRI   BNI   BTN      Bank 267 Mandiri  Bank Syariah Mandiri  and Bank Bukopin) and 13 regional development banks     (BPD)  disbursed  approximately  Rp17.23trillion  to  1.437.650  debtors  so  it  appears  that  the  KUR     program has sharply boosted microenterprises’ access to banks. However  some banks are still facing     several constraints in distributing the loans under the KUR scheme.         For  instance   the  first  and  second  screening  of  guaranteed  credits  for  SMEs  may  not  be     well organized due to the banks’ expectation of credit risk mitigation through the guarantee  and the     guarantee institution’s insufficient human resources for screening loans. Other than that  the banks     are  often  still  demand  additional  collateral  from  prospective  customers  (i.e.   30%  of  total  loan).     Some applicants also found out to request loan for consumption purpose instead of financing their     business.  Therefore   in  general   credit  guarantees  are  considered  a  difficult  business  to  operate     profitably.       19          CHAPTER 3.  INVASION OF FINTECH     SECTION 1.     FINTECH EVOLUTION          In  this  present  world  of  21st  century   technology  has  reached  to  each  and  every  segment  of     people  lives.  As  technology  integration  advances   the  various  working  industries  also  has  been     revolutionized  by  it   and  financial  industry  is  no  exception.  The  technology  which  enable  financial     solution  is  known  as  “FinTech”  –  short  for  “Financial  Technology”.  FinTech   according  to  the  global     report of PWC (2016)  is a dynamic intersection of the financial services and technology sectors  where     technologyfocused  startups  and  new  market  entrants  innovate  the  products  and  services  currently     provided by the traditional financial service industry. In recent years  FinTech is gaining its momentum in     all over the world. 2015 is considered as year of FinTech entered the mainstream when venture capital     firm making enormous number of investment in FinTech.            Although most people just recently heard and get into deep discussion about FinTech  in fact      FinTech is not a new story in financial industry  since financial and technology have been connected one     another over long time ago. There are three main eras of FinTech according to the study of FinTech by     Douglas  Janos  and Ross (2015). Firstly  it is started with a period which characterize as the FinTech 1.0.     during year 1866 to 1967 then followed by the FinTech 2.0 which started around year 1987 until 2008      and lastly counted since 2008  the FinTech 3.0.       3.1.1  FinTech 1.0 (18661967)                 In  this  period  of  time   the  development  of  digital  technology  for  communications  and     processing of transactions increasingly transformed finance from an analogue to a digital industry.     The concrete historical example for such correlation are divided further below.       1.     Before 19th Century – the earliest example is in the context of Mesopotamia where written                    records evidence for financial transaction  followed by double entry accounting which also     another technology basis to a modern economy emerged from the intertwined evolution of     finance and trade in the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance.       20          2.       Late 19th Century – the first age of financial globalization has started until the First World War      where the telegraph  railroads  canals and steamships underpinned financial interlinkages across     borders  allowing rapid transmission of financial information  transactions and payments around     the world.       3.       Early postwar period – the innovation of the codebreaking tools were developed commercially     into early computers by firms such as International Business Machines (IBM)  and the handheld     financial  calculator  was  first  produced  by  Texas  Instruments  in  1967.  One  of  important     development  in  financial  industry  is  occurred  during  this  time   known  as  credit  cards   which     initiated by the Americans.       3.1.2  FinTech 2.0 (19672008)               The beginning of FinTech 2.0 is marked by the launch of the first ATM by Barclays in UK on     1967. Followed by the establishment of NASDAQ in US on 1971 which transform the physical trading     to fully electronic trading of securities. In consumer area  online banking was firstly introduced in the     UK in 1983 by the Bank of Scotland which connecting between the television set and telephone to send     transfers and pay billsii. By the end of 1980s  financial services had become largely a digital industry      based  on  electronic  transactions  between  financial  institutions   financial  market  participants  and     customers around the world.            Another  important  momentum  of  FinTech  2.0  was  the  application  for  the  Internet  of  Things     (IoT)iii. The emergence of the internet in financial industry is started in the beginning of 1995 when Wells     Fargo used the World Wide Web (WWW) to provide the online account checking and then followed in     another decade later  the first direct banks without physical branches begin to offer their online services     (ie.  ING Direct  HSBC Direct)  PC Financial  eTrade Bank) (Yodlee  2012).          As can be seen from the historical event mentioned earlier  financial institution have increased     their  usage  of  technology  in  their  operations  significantly  from  time  to  time.  Another  example  which     evidence  the  urge  of  utilizing  technology  in  financial  institution  is  a  fact  that  huge  number  of  people     hired as technology specialist in mega bank’s workforce such as  Goldmann Sachs  Morgan Stanley  JP     Morgan   Citigroup  and  Bank  of  America.  It  is  even  reported  by  Business  Insideriv  that  around  9 000     21          workers  in  Goldmann  Sachs  are  engineers  and  programmers  which  number  counted  more  than     programmers  and  engineers  working  on  Facebook   Twitter   or  LinkedIn.    Bank  has  apparently  made     numerous investments in technology and financial services in the post crisis years. In short  it appears     that  the  era  of  FinTech  2.0  is  limited  by  the  usage  of  technology  innovation  by  the  licensed  financial     institutions     3.1.3  FinTech 3.0 (2008  present)            The  transition  of  FinTech  2.0  to  FinTech  3.0  happen  during  2008   when  new  startups  and     established technology firms (categorized as nonbanking firms) start to deliver financial products and     services directly to consumer in public. There are different backgrounds as to what trigger the FinTech     3.0 to be born in economic category wise. In developed countries where countries are more industrialized     and have higher per capita income levels  the FinTech 3.0 is driven by public expectations and demands      the  movement  of  technology  firms  into  the  financial  industry  and  also  political  demands  for  a  more     diversified banking system. However  in developing countries  particularly in Asia  Fintech 3.0 has been     driven by the needs of development and the inefficiencies in the existing financial system  combined with     the rapid introduction and reach of new technology  particularly mobile communications.            In 2015   innovations  in  banking  took  center  stage  in  the  FinTech  space.  Across  the  world      investors were drawn to the potential of FinTech firms  not only as a disruptor to big banks  but as an     enabler for big banks to kickstart their own innovation instead (KPMG  2016). The funding of FinTech     startups according to PWC (2016)  has reached US$12.2bn in 2015.       Section 2.     PRODUCTS OF FINTECH          The term of “FinTech” that referred to  and elaborated further  in this research is limited for     the FinTech 3.0  which innovated by non traditional financial institution. Many financial experts     predict that the explosion in the number of FinTech companies might affect some parts of existing     traditional  financial  sector   mainly  in  consumer  banking   fund  transfer   and  payments.  It  remains     under  debate  as  to  whether  or  not  the  FinTech  will  disrupt  most  of  sector  in  traditional  financial     22          services.          In  order  to  see  the  potential  of  disruptor  by  the  FinTechs   firstly  it  is  important  to  have     understanding on what kind of financial services mainly offered by the the FinTechs. Based on the     surveyv  conducted by Gulamhuseinwala  Thomas  and Steven (2015)  it is discovered that there are     approximately  10  most  used  FinTechs  services  currently  available  in  the  industry  which  can  be     categorized further into four major categories as set out below.

Crowdfunding             Crowdfunding is one of new model of investment which potentially the most disruptive for     traditional  financial  industry  (Terry   Debra  and  Tina   2015).  According  to  Gaskell  from  Forbes      crowdfunding  generated  an  estimated  $2.1  billion  in  investment  for  startups  in  2015   and  that  is     expected to grow considerably in 2016.     23               Crowdfunding is an emerging trend where entrepreneurs raise capitals from the community     to contribute in completing their project. There are mainly two types of crowdfunding  known as     rewardsbased  crowdfunding  and  equitybased  crowdfunding.  Rewardsbased  crowdfunding     platforms allow entrepreneurs to raise funds from the community as investor in exchange for their     tangible products or service  without incurring debt or sacrificing equity (Johnston  2015). Therefore      any investment in a rewardsbased crowdfunding project even the project turns into a huge financial     success   the  investor  will  not  receive  any  of  the  profits.  Two  of  the  most  popular  rewardsbased     crowdfunding sites are KickStarter and IndieGogo (Crowdability  2016).            Meanwhile  in equitybased crowdfunding  the company issues equity – shares of company     stock – to participating investors on a proportional basis. Therefore  when a successful company is     sold  to  another  firm  or  launches  an  IPO   the  investor  may  receive  a  substantial  return  on  their     investment. On the other hand  in unsuccessful case  the investor may stand to lose part or all of     their  investment.  AngeList  is  one  example  of  the  most  established  equitybased  crowdfunding     platform (Brian  n.d ).     4.2.4.2.  PP2P L2P Lending Platform             According  to  World  Economic  Forum  (2015)   since  the  first  platform  launched   the  P2P     lending  has  become  a  global  market  with  a  multitude  of  different  business  models  and  high     projected  future  growth  rates.  The  peertopeer  (P2P)  platform  generate  revenue  from  interest     management  in  addition  to  the  loan  management.  However   the  loan  management  is  considered     most attractive service and therefore generate revenue the most from this financing business model.            Generally   marketplace  lending  refers  to  the  practice  of  lending  money  to  borrowers     without going through a traditional financial intermediary such as a bank. These marketplaces have     benefitted from low interest rates and low default rates during the economic recovery along with the     relatively less availability of consumer credit. Their efficient cost structure and regulatory advantage     allow  for  interest  rate  arbitrage  while  they  have  also  improved  on  the  frictions  in  the  existing     lending processes (Terry  Debra and Tina  2015).       24               In addition  Terry  Debra and Tina (2015) also point out some factors which have enabled     the growth of P2P lending in FinTech industry  among others        1.     Favorable macro environment. The marketplace lending model was born as a direct result     of  tightened  regulation  stemming  from  the  financial  crisis.  Since  then   a  low  interest  rate     environment and historically low delinquencies for consumer loans have attracted inventors     searching  for  yield   therefore  amassing  years  of  data  supporting  credit  models.  However      this environment has also avoided any real stress testing of the model.       2.     Changing  demographics  and  consumer  behavior.  Millennials  are  reaching  the  age  of     financial independence and are increasingly in need of financial services such as lending.     14% of Millennial small business owners are already using alternative  nonbank financing      according to a Bank of America survey.       3.     Data   technology   and  automation  driving  cost  advantage  and  ease  of  use.  The     availability of data on an individual loan basis and the technology platform of many of these     lenders give them the ability to create a robust credit model  offer a quick loan application      and   relative  to  traditional  lending   approve  or  reject  applications  nearly  instantaneously.     The data advantage of the marketplace lenders stems from three sources  (1) the onlineonly     data such as IP address and current and historical browsing patterns on the website  (2) real     time credit monitoring through the use of social platforms  and (3) tens of thousands of loan     performance data at the individual loans level  instead of by tranche. Individual loanlevel     performance  data  allows  the  marketplace  lenders  to  build  credit  models  across  a  much     greater variety of factors that cannot be done with tranchelevel performance data alone.       4.     Strong network effects and cost advantage drive attractive unit economics. As a result     of the strong network effects and technologyenabled cost advantage  these online lenders     can  target  smaller  loans  in  an  economically  favorable  way   enabling  them  to  serve  a     generally underbanked segment of the market.       5.     Regulatory  advantage.  Because  the  majority  of  these  lenders  operate  on  a  marketplace     model and do not take traditional credit risk  they can operate with capital efficiency with no     25          capital  requirements   automatically  matched  assets  and  liabilities   and  lower  regulatory     overhead  costs.  Further   they  are  not  currently  directly  regulated  by  the  financial  bureau      allowing greater flexibility in offering different rates to different types of borrowers  thereby     creating additional efficiencies in the marketplace.            Due  to  the  above  reason   P2P  lending  industry  has  attracted  investment  from  various     capital operators including microfinance  guarantee  venture capital and publicly listed companies      banks and even local governments. It could provide real finance solution for some sectors which     underserviced by the banks.            The unsecured lending is the most common form of marketplace lending to date. As such      no collateral is required. Thus  as reported by the World Economic Forum (2015)  small businesses     benefit the most from this  particularly in the service sector mainly because often such businesses     have  rather  stable  cash  flows  but  no  tangible  collateral  that  banks  could  lend  against.  The  P2P     lending  also  applies  innovative  credit  assessment  models  which  semiautomated  and  leverage     nontraditional data points which allows for assessing credit risk where banks have traditionally not     been  able  to  do  so   especially  in  markets  with  limited  credit  bureau  information.  However   this     situation  also  trigger  potential  risk  accumulated  in  P2P  industry  due  to  such  deficient  internal     management and loopholes in existing law and regulations (Lufax  n.d.)     There are two types of P2P lending namely P2P consumer lending and P2P business lending. Main     factor which distinguish between two is the funding mechanism and the financing purposes (Zhang      et al.  2015).         P2P  consumer  lending    In  this  model   individual  borrowers  acquire  mostly  unsecured  personal     loans  from  a  number  of  other  individual  lenders  (often  lending  a  small  amount  each)  through  an     online P2P “marketplace”. This model of alternative finance offers access to comparatively lowcost     consumer  credit  for  borrowers  (often  with  prime  credit  ratings)  and  competitive  interest  rates  (in     contrast to bank savings) to lenders and often has the benefit of combining efficiency  speed and a     relatively lowrisk problem.       P2P business lending – this model is a relatively new alternative finance model in Europe but is     26          developing rapidly in a number	of key markets. It allows predominately small and mediumsized     enterprises  (SMEs)  to  obtain  growth  and  working  capital  directly  from  a  pool  of  online  investors     (both  individual  and  institutional)   bypassing  a  sometimes  prolonged  and  uncertain  banklending     processes. For many SMEs  the speed with which they are able to obtain business loans  the often     more  flexible  and  attractive  terms  of  financing  (e.g.   no  penalty  for  early  repayments  on  many     platforms)  as well as transparency and ease of use  are determining factors that make P2P business     lending a viable business funding alternative.     Some example of success deal of P2P lending is the IPO of LendingClub and its notable     SME  financing  partnership  with  Google   Alibaba  and  a  growing  trend  of  institutional  lending.       Crowdfunding  and  P2P  lending  exist  as  wellknown  financial  alternatives  model  that  could  help     entrepreneurs  of  small  business  company  to  boost  up  and  expand  the  business.  In  practice   some     people  are  not  really  able  to  identify  the  basic  difference  between  crowdfunding  model  and  P2P     lending platform. This is very important  especially for entrepreneurs  to understand which financing     models fits better for the business. Both models are having similarities but also different implications     in terms of cash flows and profitability concern. Usually the brand new start up business will look     for crowdfunding because they do not need current business cash flow or profitability in order to     raise the fund. The fund raising will purely depends on the idea and business model  so as long as the     investor believe in it  the fund can be obtained. On the other hand  in P2P lending  investor really     concern to see the detailed plan  business history  financial statements (in average within the past 2     years)  profitability and any information related to the business. However  when the money has been     invested in  on crowdfunding model the regular reporting might require by the investors since they     want to keep track on how the business is being run  meanwhile in P2P lending  the investors will     not get involvement as long as the loan repaid on time (Lee  2015). As mentioned in Section 3.2.1.1     above  the investor in crowdfunding is offered with shares or position at the firm so that is the reason     why the investor will remain involve in day to day business.       27          Section 3.     ROLE OF FINTECH TO SUPPORT THE GROWTH OF SMES IN     DEVELOPING COUNTRIES (CASE STUDY OF FINTECH INDUSTRY IN CHINA)       3.3.1  History of Financial Market in China          Before  2000   the  Chinese  financial  industry  was  lagging  behind  those  of  many  other     countries   and  the  financial  infrastructure  was  insufficient   and  commercerelated  fraud  was     commonplace. In addition  China’s technical capability with regard to information technology (IT)     was  low   and  the  key  hardware  and  software  used  in  major  banking  systems  and  ecommerce     applications came mostly from foreign companies (Yongowoon & DongHee  2015).            Local internet companies just launched various ecommercerelated businesses in the end of     1990s.  Alibaba   now  the  biggest  ecommerce  company  in  China   was  established  in  1999.  Others     were  360Buy  (online  retailer   now  Jindong  Mall)   Dangdang  (online  book  store)   and  EachNet     (online auction platform). However  China’s ecommerce had been involving only information flow     and  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs)  could  get  hardly  access  to  the  bank  transaction     system.  Alibaba  then  started  to  turn  its  focus  to  the  business  area  of  small  and  mediumsized     enterprises (SMEs) in China (Yongowoon & DongHee  2015).            In  2003   Alibaba  decided  to  start  its  customertocustomer  (C2C)  marketplace  called     Taobao.  It  operated  under  the  same  business  model  as  eBay   providing  an  online  marketplace      payment solutions  and technological infrastructures to match buyers and sellers. However  unlike     eBay  Alibaba was merely an ecommerce site for SMEs conducting business online. Moreover in     2005   Alibaba  introduced  an  online  escrow  payment  system   Alipay   that  allowed  buyers  to  wire     money from their bank accounts to Alibaba. This method was perceived by many Chinese customers     to reduce the settlement risk; it ensured that goods were delivered and payments were made between     sellers and buyers. Acting like a temporary bank between buyers and sellers  Alipay was a key driver     for Taobao’s exponential growth.          Since  2007   the  barriers  to  entry  into  China’s  financial  system  have  been  bypassed  by     28          private individuals and internet finance companies delivering directly to the public and SMEs more     than RMB251billion of credit in 2014 with total 1 575 numbers of P2P platforms in the same year.        Figure 6  Volumes of P2P lending in China (in RMB billion)        Figure 7  Number of P2P Platforms in China by end of 2014                                 Source  E&Y Journal of Financial Perspectives  Fintech  2015               According  to  report  from  Accenture  (2014)   Alibaba  then  entered  into  a  partnership  with  the     Industrial and Commercial Bank of China and the China Construction Bank in 2009 to help facilitate     loans  to  domestic  small  business  customers  in  China.  Given  that  85%  of  all  loans  went  to  other     stateowned  enterprises  (SOEs)   leaving  little  for  private  companies  and  particularly  SMEs.     Alibaba’s strategy represented a potentially effective way of forming an actor network with SMEs.     SMEs  became  interested  in  the  solution  proposed  by  Alibaba  because  Alibaba's  interest  was  not     different from those of them. In 2010  Alibaba launched a specialized company serving the SMEs     lending  segment.  Alibaba  Alibaba  extended  its  finance  business  through  alliances  with  banks      insurance companies  funds  securities companies  and so forth. Through these alliances  it created     multiple  new  agreements  that  have  yielded  a  huge  market  impact.  Alibaba   which  started  as  an     ecommerce  company   is  now  one  of  the  biggest  FinTech  companies  in  the  world.  Alibaba  has     created 2.87 million direct and indirect job opportunities  and providing over 400 000 SMEs with     loans ranging from $3000 to $5000 (Arner  Janos  and Ross  2015).          Other than Alibaba  actually there are some companies which also focus on lending to small     business  in  China.  PPDAI  was  the  first  online  P2P  platform  in  China  established  by  former     Microsoft  Corp.’s  engineer.  PPDAI’s  primary  focus  is  to  lend  to  online  small  businesses  that  sell     29          through  Alibaba  with  over   80%  of  all  loans  going  to  small  businesses. PPDAI  uses  online  data     about  the  small  businesses  like  seller  ratings   user  ratings   and  social  networking  presence  to     determine the credit quality of their borrowers (Jason  2014). PPDAI is facing increased competition     from Alibaba which has created its own SME financing arm. There is also RenRenDai which one of     the largest and fastest growing P2P lending platforms in China. Similar to PPDAI  RenRenDai offers     loan to consumers and small businesses as well. The growth of the company is huge. They grew over     800% in 2012 and grew 342% in 2013.            In  2011   PBC  began  issuing  licenses  to  qualified  thirdparty  online  payment  platforms  to     conduct electronic payments  after announcing the program in 2010. The licenses covered Internet     payment   mobile  phone  payment   and  bank  card  acquiring  service.  In  due  course   TPP  services     shifted from a singleplatform to a cross platform service  in partnership with a variety of players      such as mobile platforms  SNSs  and prepaid cards both online and offline. TPP companies were     well  qualified  to  develop  various  types  of  innovative  business  models  and  services  with  other     industry players.            In 2014  following the government’s approval  a total of 250 companies in China received a     payment license  including 90 for online payment and 37 for mobile phone payment with Alibaba as     the frontrunner. During this time  more and more Chinese companies inspired by Alibaba’s success     established the investment platform and the pace of FinTech innovation has been wildly increasing.            In July 2015  China’s peertopeer (P2P) lending platforms counted 2 136  with settlements     of about RMB82.5 billion transactions in that single month  making it the country with the most P2P     platforms  in  the  world.  As  the  sector  went  from  one  platform  in  2007  to  more  than  an  estimated   2 000  platforms  currently It is also reported the platform has  delivered  directly  to  the  public  and     SMEs more than RMB251 billion of credit in 2014. (Douglas and Janos  2015).     3.3.2  Growth Factor of China P2P Lending Industry            The high usage of P2P lending services in China is driven by the rapid Chinese adoption of     new  technologies  which  already  reaching  through  the  rural  areas.  As  cited  by  Emarketer  (2015)      China Internet Network Information Center (CNNIC) reported that  internet penetration in China’s     30          rural areas nearly quadrupled between 2007 and 2014. It also rose dramatically in urban areas during     the same time period  though the rate of penetration in cities less than tripled.       Table   4  Internet  User  Penetration  in  China   by  Geographic  Locale   20072014  (%  of   population)          Source  China Internet Network Information Center cited by Emarketer  2015          As  stated  by  Shrader  and  Eric  (2014)   there  are  more  than  1.15  billion  mobile  phones  in     China   which  has  also  become  the  largest  global  market  for  smartphones.  It  is  estimated  that  in     China’s biggest cities  smartphone penetration is approaching 50 percent and nearly half of China’s     mobile subscribers live in rural areas. As of 2013  there are 624 million internet users (45% of the     total population) and 28.9% of China’s population had 3G and 4G connections. However  despite of     enormous  number  of  population  who  acquire  mobile  technology  in  China   there  are  432  million     population  in  China  who  do  not  have  any  bank  account   which  represent  36%  of  population     (Douglas   et.al.   2015).  The  total  of  physical  bank  also  relatively  low  compare  to  the  number  of     population in China itself  unlike in the western country such as USA and UK. Chinese unbanked     populations  may  have  a  comparative  advantage  over  many  unbanked  in  the  world  in  its  ease  of     access to and rapid adoption of technology.            This mismatch situation between the technology readiness and the number of physical bank     in china provides the high opportunity of penetration in FinTech industry in China. China’s credit     market  also  has  suffered  from  allocation  inefficiencies  that  affect  its  SMEs.  Meanwhile   SMEs     represent 80% of the economic output in China (Douglas and Janos  2015). The penetration of P2P     lending  platform  in  China  therefore  is  considered  as  one  perfect  solution  to  address  the  issue  of     31          credit facility in China.            According  to  white  paper  issued  by  Lufaxvi  (n.d.)   the  P2P  platforms  in  China  generate     most  revenues  through  loan  management   interest  management  and  other  valueadded  services.     However  the loan management charges account for the largest proportion of total platform revenues     (over 70%). Not factoring in expenses they incurred in compensating bad debts  gross margin in the     P2P lending business is pretty high and may even exceed 20% in some cases This is also why the     P2P  industry  has  attracted  investment  from  various  capital  operators  including  microfinance      guarantee   venture  capital  and  publicly  listed  companies   banks  and  even  local  governments   and     why the number of P2P platforms in China has gone through explosive increases in recent years.       3.3.2.1. Characteristic of P2P Lending Platforms Users in China          In October 2015  the Association of Chartered Certified Accountants (ACCA)  conducting     survey on the China’s P2P lending market which surveyed over 935 borrowers and lenders as user of     one  of  leading  P2P  platform  in  China   PPDAIvii.  The  findings  are  divided  into  four  categories  of     users      (1)  The individual borrowers (342 respondents)     52%  of  the  individual  borrowers  reported  a  lowincome  range  and  63%  worked  in  private     business  (but  does  not  reveal  how  many  of  these  respondents  were  employees  or  business     owners). 51% purpose of the loan made by the individual borrowers is to accumulate their credit     worthinessviii  and only 7% utilize the loan for working capital.     (2)  The individual lenders (515 respondents)     Lenders  reported  to  be  more  highly  educated  than  borrowers.  56%  having  completed  the     universitylevel  degrees.  Most  of  lenders  stated  that  they  were  carrying  out  investment  on     their own behalf. As for the reason for investing through PPDAI  65% claim they want to get     higher returns of investment compare to the bank interest rate. About 10% of lenders make     investment to support the SME financing.         32          (3)  The business borrowers (35 respondents)     The  findings  showed  that  business  borrowers  tend  to  have  higher  incomes  than  the     individual  borrowers  and  have  no  previous  experience  of  borrowing  from  other  financial     institution but they had some trade credit lineix  with  for instance  AliFinancex. The largest     proportion  (40%)  of  the  business  borrowers  are  small  and  micro  business.  74%  of  the     business borrowers are tertiary educated  of these  52% had completed college and 22% had     universitylevel qualifications.       Their loan purpose is mainly for daily shortterm cash flow and as for the common reason     choosing the P2P platform for financing 87% responded because it has the low threshold     and simple borrower audit process. Most of them also had a formal written business plan     and most had financially trained or qualified person in charge of business finances.     (4)         The dual borrower and lender (43 respondents)          Most dual borrowers and lenders had their own business enterprises. 27% reported that their     business had been operating for between 5 and 10 years. Most reported a very low business     sales  revenue.  The  main  reason  for  borrowing  is  similar  as  individual  borrower   77%     responded to accumulated credit worthiness  and followed by meeting daily shortterm cash     flows needs.        They pick P2P platform because bank loan usually has strict loan qualifications and shallow     relationship with the banks.                     3.3.1  FinTech Regulatory Framework in China for P2P Lending Platform     Regulators face a dilemma since SMEs are the main engine of economic growth in China     today  and it seems that P2P lenders are almost the only financial institutions still willing to make     loans to SMEs in China in the current economic climate. Therefore  the growth rate of P2P lending     industry  in  China  is  unavoidably  overwhelming.  However   these  recent  years   there  are  also     numerous cases of illegal financing  illegal fundraising  and fake investment occurred through P2P     33          lending  platform  in  China.  Since  the  existence  of  first  P2P  lending  platform  in  2007   until  it  has     reached more than 1 500 platforms in 2014  there is no regulation directly govern this industry in     China. The absence of formal regulation in P2P lending industry in China had the effect of removing     any barriers to entry which allowed that platform operators  lenders  borrowers quickly to enter the     market  and as a result  the P2P lending industry has grown significantly in China. However  it leads     to  increase  the  number  of  fraud  and  default  P2P  lending  firms  operated  in  China  as  the  negative     implication of the absence of regulation.            Figure 8  P2P lending platforms with reported problems (as percentage of total 1 575   platforms)                    Source  E&Y Journal of Financial Perspectives  Fintech  2015                         Starting in mid2014  Chinese regulators has increased the consultation activity to gradually     consider the imposition of rules for P2P platforms in China  which will cover on regulatory capital      licensing obligations as well as better loan origination and credit scoring mechanisms so as to avoid     excessive problems in P2P platform industry in China (Douglas and Janos  2015). In 2015  the China     Banking  Regulatory  Commission  (CBRC)  finally  released  the  P2P  lending  regulations.  However      whether or not the regulation is actually effective to address the issues on P2P platform  it is essential     to know the problem related to the P2P platform before the issuance of the regulation.     34                 Based on report by Lufax (n.d.)  risks related to P2P lending platform in China are mainly      among others      1.  Risk  related  to  the  fund  management.  There  is  no  escrow  account  set  up  in  most  P2P     platform business. So basically funds of lenders and borrowers are directly credited from the     account of P2P platform company which trigger higher risk of funds being abused  as well     as risk of “selffinancing” and “false financing”. Only some P2P platforms engage certain     banks to open the escrow account.       2.  Risk related to credit checks. Many P2P platforms do not have specialized risk controls and     credit check team. Therefore  there is a potential risk of bad debt prevention failures. The     majority  of  them  still  have  not  set  up  standards  for  regularly  assessing   tracking  and     disclosing the sources of funds for loan repayment on the part of fundraisers (borrowers).     Hence  the investors do not have direct access or tools to judge and track the reliability of     loan repayments they receive.       3.  Operational  risks.  In  a  bid  to  increase  liquidity  for  lenders  by  matching  yields  with  loan     maturities   many  platforms  develop  capital  pooling  so  impossible  to  track  capital     movements.       4.     Information  safety  risk.  Some  P2P  platforms  –  particularly  those  “missing”  platforms  –     bought “semifinished” websites directly from thirdparty companies developed with open     source codes  and even outsourced website backend operations to third parties  resulting in     exposure of company and user information. In the case of a website access technical issue      the  resulting  psychological  impact  on  investors  may  spark  a  run  on  the  platform  due  to     information asymmetry.            China’s  government  introduced  the  nonbank  providers  of  online  payments  services     regulation to address problems occurred in P2P lending industry in China on December 2015. The     regulation will become effective as of 1 July 2016 (Jingui  2016). However  China’s government has     previously released the first regulation in July 2015 regarding the guidelines on the promotion of the     healthy  development  of  internet  finance  (Internet  Finance  Guidelines)  which  also  govern  the  P2P     35          lending therein.              As  reported  by  ACCA  (2015)   some  important  highlight  of  the  regulations  are   among     others      1.  minimum registered capital requirements will be imposed for internet finance companies;       2.  capital pooling will not be allowed	(only direct onetoone lending allowed  no fund pools);       3.     loan guarantees will not be allowed (on principle or interest); and       4.  providers must have experienced management and creditrisk management teams.       In  addition  to  the  above  highlights   Li  (2016)  also  added  some  requirements  for  P2P  platform     providers  among others      1.  platform  should  register  with  local  financial  regulators  and  local  regulators  will  rate  and     categorize platforms after displaying the information publicly;     2.  platforms should report loan data to an online lending central database established by the     central government;       3.  platform  should  disclose  the  basic  borrower  information   loan  information   and  platform     loan statistic publicly;     4.  platforms  should  use  fund  custodianship  services  offered  by  qualified  banking  financial     institutions; and     5.  platforms  should  conduct  annual  thirdparty  audits  and  submit  the  audit  report  to  local     regulators within four months of their fiscal yearends      and as for some restricted activities are among others      1.  conducting  business  offline  at  physical  locations   with  the  exception  collecting  loan     information   loan  review   debt  collections   and  management  of  loan  collateral  as  well  as     other risk management activities;     2.  making  investment  decisions  for  investors   so  any  automated  investing  will  be  forbidden     even if the investor grants permission to the platform;     3.  using the platform for selffinancing or financing of relatedparties;   4.  selling  bank  wealth  management  products   mutual  funds   insurance  annuities  and  other     36          financial products;     5.  collaborating  with  other  investment  or  brokerage  businesses  to  bundle   sell  or  broker   investment  products   or  directly  making  loans  to  borrowers   unless  stated  otherwise  by   applicable laws and regulations     6.  Providing false loan information or create unrealistic return expectation; and   7.  Facilitating loans for the purpose of making investments in the stock market.          From the above brief summary on the regulation  it seems to sufficiently address the recent     problems occurred through the various illegal activity of P2P platform in China. The regulation most     likely to promote risk management and establish muchneeded ground rules to limit the prevalence     of  unsound  practices  and  illegal  activity  which  keep  happening  recently  in  the  industry.  China’s     regulators are more interested in controlling undesired activities rather than setting legal barriers to     entry.  Any  violations  on  the  platform  activities  will  likely  result  in  a  complete  shutdown  of     operations and possible prosecution by law enforcement. (Li  Spencer  2016).                                                                         37          CHAPTER 4.  FINTECH FOR SMES IN INDONESIA     Section 1.     SMES ADOPTION OF DIGITAL TECHNOLOGY IN INDONESIA            Internet  technology  has  changed  the  supply  chain  by  improving  collaboration  and     efficiency   and  adding  value  to  products  and  firms.  The  rapid  adoption  of  the  internet  as  a     commercial  medium  has  motivated  firms  to  experiment  with  innovative  ways  of  marketing  in     cyberspace (Astuti and Reza  2014). Technology can provide significant innovation opportunities for     SMEs’  businesses.  Innovation  is  the  process  of  developing  and  implementing  new  or  improved     products   services   processes   business  models  or  organizational  practices.  Indonesian  SMEs  that     seize the opportunity to innovate are likely to grow  those that do not will remain behind. The growth     opportunities  associated  with  SMEs’  innovation  are  likely  to  be  important  in  facilitating  broader     economic growth and poverty reduction across Indonesia in future years (Deloitte  2015c).         Deloitte (2015b) claimed that the greater use of digital technologies such as social media      broadband  and  ecommerce  can  deliver  significant  benefits  for  SMEs   among  others   up  to  80%     higher growth in business revenue since there would be high access to new consumers through the     technology   being  oneandahalf  times  more  likely  to  increase  employment   being  17  times  more     likely to be innovative  and more competitive internationally. SMEs with basic online capabilities     derived 6% more of their revenue from international customers than offline SMEs. Therefore  there     are indeed significant benefit for SMEs if they went digital. For the Indonesian economy  boosting     digital  technology  engagement  among  Indonesia’s  SMEs  could  increase  the  country’s  annual     economic  growth  by  2%.  By  such  growth   Indonesia  would  be  on  track  to  becoming  a     middleincome country by 2025.       According to the research by Deloitte (2015b)  only minority of Indonesian SMEs (18%)     have  intermediate  engagement  in  digital  technologies  by  using  websites  and  social  media  and     another 9% having advanced engagement with ecommerce capabilities. 36% still doing offline with     no broadband access  not owing computer or smartphone  and another 37% have only basic online     38          capabilities  such  as  computer/smart  phone  or  broadband  access  but  no  involvement  in  any  social     media or ecommerce.     Figure 9  Indonesian SMEs Digital Technology Involvement     Source  Stancombe Research and Planning  Deloitte Access Economics      Cited by Deloitte 2015b                 The  majority  of  SMEs  with  lowest  participation  in  technology  is  the  microenterprises     (58%)  which  located  at  rural  areas   followed  by  some  small  enterprises  (27%)  and  medium     enterprises (14%). The SMEs in primary industry (agriculture  forestry  and fisheries) which consist     of the highest number of SMEs in Indonesia appear to be the least involved in digital technology      with  two  third  of  them  are  still  offline  and  less  than  6%  have  the  intermediate  engagement  in     technology.         Although the usage of broadband by SMEs have increasing  the ecommerce capabilities     and social media integration still very low. There are only 12% of SMEs that have basic ecommerce     capability (online order processing)  and only another 10% owing online payment system. Most of     the spending of SMEs in Indonesia go to digital marketing to promote their product. They would     spend around 42%47% from their marketing budget in digital marketing  no matter the size of the     firm.            39               Figure 10  Marketing Digital Expense of Indonesian SMEs in 2015 vs. 2018     Source  Stancombe Research and Planning  Deloitte Access Economics      Cited by Deloitte 2015b                 The main issues that faced by Indonesian SMEs to participate in digital technology is the     minimum accessibility of finance and less option of the financing for SMEs. According to Machmud      Z. and A. Huda (2011)  the demand for SMEs credit in Indonesia presents an increasing trend from     time  to  time  and  in  2010  these  represented  about  20  percent  of  total  demand  for  credit.  Some     commercial  banks  in  Indonesia  have  entered  the  SME  segment  in  order  to  enlarge  their  business.     This  recent  development  in  the  banking  industry  illustrates  the  efforts  of  commercial  banks  to     improve  their  function  as  Indonesian  SMEs  credit  suppliers.  However   the  development  of  credit     demand  from  nonbank  financial  institutions  in  Indonesia  is  not  well  recorded  and  governed.  In     order to achieve the digital SMEs  it is important to expand the access to finance for SMEs  both     from domestic and international source.         There  has  to  be  efforts  and  incentives  from  policy  makers  to  assist  SMEs  to  adopt  new     technology and cope up with market demand. In addition to the extension of access to finance  SMEs     in in Indonesia also require real support from government such as          40          1) Increasing  broadband  access.  Existing  internet  access  in  Indonesia  remains  relatively     expensive and slow. Increasing broadband access and the quality of service will encourage digital     technology adoption by SMEs and improve performance of existing technologies.     2) Assisting  all  SMEs  to  be  digital  businesses.  Many  government  agencies  provide  SME     support programs  including those targeted at increasing SME digital engagement. But they are often     overlapping and limited in scale.     3) Expanding  epayments.  Improving  trust  in  ecommerce  payment  platforms   increasing     bankability of Indonesian consumers and businesses and expanding alternative payment systems will     increase the volume of digital transactions.     4) Expanding  egovernment  services.  Government  services  delivered     through  online     platforms  are  more  cost  effective  and  efficient.  More  online  government  services  would  build     consumer confidence in online activities and services over time.     Section 2.     FINTECH INDUSTRY IN INDONESIA         Considering financial sector undeniably has an important role for the country’s economic     growth  the Indonesian government is taking a particular interest in driving the FinTech industry in a     responsible  manner.  As  revealed  by  current  Indonesian  president   Mr.  Joko  Widodo   during  the     Indonesia  ECommerce  Summit  &  Expo  2016   the  government  would  give  more  attention  and     support  to  stimulate  the  development  of  FinTech  startup  ecosystem  in  Indonesia.  Moreover   it  is     also  predicted  that  the  market  of  FinTech  in  Indonesia  is  huge  and  will  grow  significantly  during     2016 (Febriana  2016).              The  FinTech  business  that  referred  to  hereinafter  is  the  FinTech  3.0   which  business  is     established  by  technology  firms  (nonbanking  financial  institution)  who  deliver  financial  product     and services directly to consumer in public.            4.2.1     Indonesia as Potential Market of FinTech Industry          41            Deloitte (2015d) reported that as of 2013  nearly 60% of the entire bankable population in     Indonesia  did  not  have  a  bank  account.  It  is  also  projected  that  the  total  population  of  bankable     unbanked will continue to grow and reach 113 million by 2020 and the mobile penetration will reach     100% by 2020. The entire market segment of over 113 million bankable unbanked empowered with     mobile phones represents an untapped opportunity for FinTech industry.     Figure 11  Total bankable unbanked population and projected mobile penetration growth from   2013 to 2020          Source  Deloitte  2015d            However   as  the  most  populous  country  in  south  east  Asia  region   unlike  the  mobile     penetration  the penetration of internet usage is considerably low  only 15.8% of the total population     as of 2013. Meanwhile  the average of internet penetration in ASEAN countries is 35% (Deloitte      2015c). The internet penetration also still heavily concentrated only in the larger cities where users     are more likely to afford smartphones  whilst the remaining (approximately 85%) in the unbanked     population in rural areas the internet users remains relatively low (Deloitte  2015d).         Commercial  banks  dominate  the  Indonesian  financial  sector  but  they  serve  a  relatively     small proportion of households and their financial services are heavily skewed towards urban areas.     According to the World Bank  about 40% of the unbanked poor are creditworthy by microfinance     institutions’ standards. Of the unbanked poor who seek credit  about half are deemed to be too small     42          to  be  commercially  viable   given  that  bank‘s  current  commercial  standards.  The  Indonesian     commercial banks       have  quite  a  wide  regional  reach   but  they  do  not  reach  deeply  into  the  poorer  strata  of     Indonesian society (IFC  n.d.). The high unbanked population in Indonesia with minimum access to     financial  services   such  population  will  require  the  alternative  financial  services  to  fulfil  their     financial needs.         Moreover  as explained in Chapter 2 about the SMEs financial issues in Indonesia  the loan     market have suffered from allocation credit inefficiencies to the SMEs in Indonesia which mostly     consist of microenterprises that located in rural/backward. Deloitte (2015a) reported that only 6% of     SMEs  using  bank  loan  as  source  of  financing.  This  misallocation  of  capital  has  important     implications  since SMEs contributes to 59% of the total GDP of Indonesia while bank loans only     make up of 6% of SME funding sources. The integration of FinTech ecosystem to Indonesian SMEs     may  become  one  of  the  most  powerful  tools  to  stimulate  the  sustainable  economic  growth  in  the     future in Indonesia.       Considering on the above facts  FinTech industry will gain traction in Indonesian mainly     due  to  the  fact  that  the  current  financial  institution  in  Indonesia  have  not  been  able  to  solve  the     existing financial problems through the traditional banking solutions  particularly for SMEs that has     been  underserviced  by  the  large  banks.  Other  than  that   the  high  penetration  of  mobile  users  and     large  unbanked  population  in  Indonesia  seems  to  interest  the  Indonesian  entrepreneurs  as  they     believe Indonesia could be a potential FinTech market where they could offer alternative financial     services beyond traditional banks to such marketplace.         4.2.1.  Current Situation of the FinTech Industry in Indonesia     4.2.4.3.  About the Regulation of the Indonesian FinTech Firms             In  this  fastpaced  technological  innovation  environment  world   the  financial  evolution     seems to run ahead of the regulation. By looking at the high potential growth of FinTech industry in     Indonesia  the effective financial regulation is essential for the future success of the FinTech business     in  Indonesia.  At  this  early  stage   there  exist  no  specific  regulation  that  directly  made  for  FinTech     43          business industry and as a result of the absence of the regulation FinTech business player has less     barrier to quickly enter the market.         The  business  scope  of  FinTech  firms  appear  to  overlap  between  technology  business      which govern under the supervision of the Minister of Communications and Information (Menteri     Komunikasi dan Informasi  Kominfo)  and financial services which govern by the Financial Service     Agency (Otoritas Jasa Keuangan  OJK) . Therefore  FinTech business does not clearly fall under     purview of any single authority and thus  need new regulation that work out in between those two     authorities. Both Kominfo and OJK  are still working on draft regulation for FinTech firms and the     new regulation are expected to be issued by end of 2016 at the latest. For such preparation  they start     actively consult with authorities from other countries  in China  Australia  Singapore  and Malaysia     to get an idea of the industry ecosystem in regional level (CNN Indonesia  2016).         As of today  the FinTech companies should get endorsement from Bank of Indonesia and     get  license  to  enter  into  settlement  services  .  According  to  Deumoly  F  Pardede  as  Deputy     Commissioner of NonBank Financial Institutions of OJK  the FinTech firms still able to run their     business  in  Indonesia  and  they  could  later  adjust  the  business  after  the  new  regulation  has  been     enacted (Dealstreetasia  2016).         Active support from the regulators and government is critically important for the growth of     the  FinTech  industry  in  Indonesia.  Regulating  bodies  can  create  a  positive  and  cooperative     environment that promotes innovative solutions. However  at the same time  they should ensure the     protection of individuals and systemic viability by installing appropriate regulatory frameworks in     the existing financial system. It is also important necessity to have a point of contact at regulatory     bodies so every FinTech players know they have a person to talk to and align with  especially after     the FinTech regulatory framework has been issued and require adjustment to their business model.     4.2.4.4.  About the Organization of the Indonesian FinTech Firms            Other than supportive action from regulators and governments  FinTech firms must also     contribute their role to create a cooperative environment. Regulators often criticize the fragmentation     44          of the FinTech landscape  for example  as to whom should they make contact with to discuss about     specific FinTech sector. In the UK  the UK P2P Finance Association (P2PFA) has become a credible     player  and  conversation  partner  for  public  officials.  The  P2PFA  represents  over  90%  of  the     peertopeer lending market in the UK  including consumer lending  business lending and invoice     finance (World Economic Forum  2015).       On  September  17   2015  in  Jakarta   during  the  InvestDay  2015  event   which  was  also     attended  by  the  Minister  of  Coordinating  Economics   Dr.  Darmin  Nasution  and  the  Regional     Director  of  IFCWorld  Bank   Mr.  Ivan  MortimerSchutts   the  Association  of  Indonesian  FinTech     (Asosiasi Fintech Indonesia  FTI) was established. FTI is initiated by several major FinTech firms     and  banking  corporations  namely   Bareksa   Kejora   CekAja   Doku   Bank  Mandiri   Veritrans  and     Kartuku.       Any  FinTech  companies  and  financial  institution  that  have  expertise  and  interest  in  the     field  of  financial  technology  may  join  as  members  of  the  FTI.  However   as  of  now   there  is  no     information  publicly  provided  as  to  how  many  FinTech  firms  are  currently  exist  in  Indonesia      including the information of all members who join the FTI other than mentioned earlier.           According to the Article of Association of FTI which legally made before Aryanti Artisari      SH  Mkn  Indonesian Notary  FTI is created to support the FinTech industry in Indonesia by building     a positive business environment and promoting FinTech industry as catalyst for the application of     technology   improved  access  to  finance   economic  growth  and  wealth  generation.  FTI  works  to     advance  a  technologycentric  financial  services  ecosystem  for  Indonesian  by  Indonesian  firms.     Moreoever  FTI is invited regularly by the regulator to provide some input and advice on industrial     policy  related  to  FinTech.  It  will  serve  as  forum  for  the  FinTech  startups   banks   insurance     companies   venture  capitalists   as  well  as  stakeholders  from  both     the  government  and     nongovernment side.       More  alignment  and  cooperation  is  required  to  facilitate  effective  dialogue  between  the     FinTech  market  players  and  the  authorities  in  order  to  develop  best  practice   and  as  such   it  is     arguably a right step to establish FTI as credible FinTech industry organization in Indonesia.     45          Section 3.     FINTECH AS SOLUTIONS OF INDONESIAN SMES ALTERNATIVE   LENDING  LEARNING FROM CHINA’S P2P LENDING MARKET ENVIRONMENT     4.3.1  The Needs of Alternative Financing for SMEs in China and Indonesia          It is undeniable that finance is major component of every firm’s business activity. Study     from World Economic Forum (2015) reveals that limited access to finance is one of the most cited     issues  for  businesses  in  developing  countries   including  in  Indonesia.  As  already  described      Indonesian market has extremely high number of microenterprises  accounted 90% of total SMEs in     Indonesia located in rural/backward areas which also have high limitation on financial access. From     survey towards SMEs in Indonesia  Shinozaki (2012) found out that the collateral requirement and     the high lending rate are the biggest barriers for SMEs in Indonesia to obtain financing  as a result      SMEs in Indonesia largely underserved when it comes to financial services. Deloitte (2015a) also     emphasize from its report that majority of Indonesian SMEs require financing from combination on     of formal and informal channels.          In credit market  China also have suffered from allocation inefficiencies that particularly     affect its SMEs. It has a number of structural imbalances created huge gap in SMEs credit (estimated     to be more than US$700 billion)  and surplus demand for returnseeking investable assets (estimated     to be more than US$2 trillion) (Ekberg  et.al.  2016). The misallocation of capital for SMEs appears     to  serious  implication  on  China’s  economic  growth  considering  the  SMEs  represent  80%  of     economic  output  of  the  country  (Arner  and  Janos.  2015)   in  which   this  situation  similarly     experienced by SMEs in Indonesia. However  since the first appearance of P2P lending platform in     year 2007 until 2015  P2P lending platform has performed an important allocation role  especially     for  SMEs  that  facing  constrain  of  credit  access  in  China  (Douglas  and  Janos   2015).  Considering     there are about 60 million microentrepreneurs in China  with 200 million rural poor and remains     unbanked (Renton  2013  Douglas et.al.  2015)  it is indeed huge market opportunity for P2P lending     business. Alibaba Group  one of famous private Chinese internet companies  starting this business     model to focus on serving SMEs in China by alternative financing through the P2P lending platform     and another P2P platform companies in China such as Lufax  Dianrong  RenRenDai  also similarly     46          focus on lending to SMEs in China and reported to have huge growth.         P2P lending model has attracted SMEs since no collateral is required in order for them to     obtain  required  amount  of  working  capital.  SMEs  benefit  the  most  from  this  unsecured  lending     model  since  collateral  is  mainly  implied  by  SMEs  as  one  of  the  biggest  barrier  to  access  the     financing from the traditional bank. Moreover  another attractive point for SMEs are the simplicity     of  lending  process  through  the  P2P  lending  platform.  Unlike  lending  process  with  banks  which     require lots of paperwork documentation and long screening process resulting high interest rate  P2P     lending  platform  offers  easier  application  process  on  paperless  basis   faster  approval  and  cash     disbursement.  This  is  due  to  innovating  credit  scoring  models  used  by  the  P2P  lending   which     models  are  easily  datadriven   employ  semiautomated  risk  assessment  methods  and  leverage     nontraditional data points (World Economic Forum  2015). Lastly  P2P lending could provide more     competitive rate and give no penalty for early repayment.       The FinTech’s industry in Indonesia is indeed still in early stage  and although there is no     particular report on the total current P2P lending platform in Indonesia  there are some P2P lending     already  exist   such  as   Modalku   Amartha   Crowdo   InvesTree   Mekar   and  KoinWorks   which     aiming to serve the SMEs in Indonesia. The number of P2P firms are predicted to keep growing      since  there  is  huge  potential  of  market  opportunity  in  demand  of  Indonesian  SMEs  alternative     lending through FinTech company amounted up to US$54 billion by 2020 (Ekberg  et.al.  2016).          4.3.1.  Digital Technology Adaption of SMEs in China vs. Indonesia              Considering both China and Indonesia are highly populated countries (China listed as No.1     and  Indonesia  listed  as  No.4  of  most  populous  countries  in  the  world)   the  mobile  phone  are     expectedly also high demand in both market. However  although mobile phone penetration in both     countries reaching more than 30%  the internet penetration rate is not occurring in the same manner.     The  internet  penetration  in  Indonesia  is  still  way  below  the  global  average   only  15%  of  total     population  and  it  is  also  concentrated  mainly  in  urban  area   meanwhile   in  China   the  internet     penetration  is  reaching  nearly  half  of  its  population  and  the  penetration  in  the  rural  areas  rose     47          dramatically.         The adoption level of digital technology is highly  related on the success rate of making     FinTech services (P2P lending platform) a solution for alternative financing of SMEs. Current issue     to deal with on limited access to internet in rural areas in Indonesia should immediately address in     order for SMEs could having benefit of FinTech services for their business. Government should also     provide  support  to  enable  SMEs  go  digital  by  providing  sufficient  technology  infrastructure   for     example   increasing  the  broadband  access  and  quality  of  service   particularly  in  rural  areas  of     Indonesia.         4.3.3  Knowledge of SMEs on Financial Literacy and FinTech Industry in China vs. Indonesia           Research  study  conducted  by  ACCA  (2015)  on  the  borrower  of  China’s  P2P  lending     market  reveals  that  most  of  them;  (1)  consist  of  small  and  micro  business  company;  (2)  highly     educated  of these  52% had completed college and 22% had universitylevel qualifications; and (3)     had  a  formal  written  business  plan   financially  trained  or  qualified  person  in  charge  of  business     finances   and  reported  that  the  produced  regular  management  accounts.  It  appears  that  the  SMEs     borrower group that using P2P lending in China have sufficient financial literacy in general  and able     to do basic accounting.         One of important characteristics in Indonesian SMEs is  the owner is also the manager and     the employee (Anton  et.al.  2015). Therefore  in other words  to develop SME human resource skill     means  also  to  develop  the  owner’s  educational  skills  (financial   technological  and  management     skills). Most microenterprises in Indonesia at this stage still having troubled in understanding basic     finance literacy (Shinozaki  2012). Meanwhile  in order to be able to use the lending service from     FinTech  basic financial skill would be necessary  since the application process for obtaining the loan     would require the applicant’s financial track record at the very least.          In order to increase human resource competence  training development in SMEs should be     enhanced  by  all  private  and  public  sector.  Not  only  government  support  is  necessary  but  the     educational  institution   financial  institution  (bank  or  nonbank   including  the  FinTech  firms  itself)     may need to align and work together to support the financial literacy of SMEs in Indonesia. Regular     48          workshop and training in certain areas where SMEs still lack of financial education can maximize     the potential of Indonesian SMEs to help them understand the benefit of using the FinTech services.            4.3.4  Regulatory Frameworks for FinTech in China vs. Indonesia       As of 2015  China is considered as the country with the most P2P platforms in the world     with the settlement of about RMB82.5 billion transactions in single month in July 2015 (Douglas     and Janos  2015). Such high growth in P2P lending industry is mainly caused due to the absence of     regulation in the industry for several years  which removing the entry barriers and attracting more     players to the market. The FinTech company  including P2P providers are refused to be claimed as     financial company  and as such they did not fall under the financial regulation in China.           Chinese  government  put  less  intervention  in  the  FinTech  industry  in  the  early  stage     because  while  they  observe  how  the  business  going   they  realize  the  benefit  from  it   which  has     improved the lives of many in China. As the Chinese economy grew  the gap of the rich and poor     also get widened  which encourage the financial inclusion (Chen and Ernie  2015). The innovative     business model offered through FinTech industry provide many goods and services available to the     rural regions in China and therefore light regulation is important to success the industry in market.         However  as the industry mature  the government start to impose heavier regulation and     more  strictly  to  regulate  the  industry  considering  more  and  more  problematic  case  arise  from  the     FinTech industry in China. As can be seen in Section 3.3.3 earlier  the P2P lending platform in China     with  reported  problems  are  significantly  increase  through  the  years.  After  observing  the  market     industry  for  several  years  and  less  intervene  in  the  industry   Chinese  government  then  issued  the     regulation directly for P2P lending platform in 2015. The contents of the regulations appear to highly     promote risk management and establish muchneeded ground rules to limit the illegal activity in P2P     lending  industry  (Li   2016)   which  exactly  address  the  problem  that  face  in  China’s  P2P  lending     industry  (see  section  3.3.3).  The  regulators  are  more  interested  in  controlling  undesired  activities     rather than setting legal barriers to entry (Li  2016).           Unlike  in  China  where  government  impose  the  regulation  after  long  market  observation     49          and the P2P platform industry is more mature  the Indonesian regulators already started to prepare     the regulation although the FinTech industry in Indonesia is still in early stage. As reported by CNN     Indonesia  the financial authority will issue new regulation on FinTech by end of 2016 meanwhile      the  FinTech  business   especially  the  P2P  lending  platform  industry  just  started  to  available  in     Indonesia around 2015. If the issuance of regulation eventually happens in 2016  it is arguably the     P2P lending industry in Indonesia is still way far from mature stage. Any high barrier to entry the     market  due  to  regulatory  issues  and  heavy  intervention  form  the  government   may  kill  the  grow     potential  of  the  industry.  One  of  suitable  approach  to  have  P2P  lending  industry  in  Indonesia     potentially grow and help the economy is using approach as has been done by Chinese government.     The  light  government  regulation  in  the  initial  stage  of  the  P2P  lending  industry  in  Indonesia  and     observing the market in Indonesia would be important element for the industry to success.                        50          CHAPTER 5.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS     Section 1.     CONCLUSIONS          The study is set out to explore the potential of FinTech industry in Indonesia and also to     understand  the  main  factor  in  order  for  the  FinTech  services  could  give  utmost  support  for  the     growth  of  SMEs’  business  in  Indonesia.  A  case  comparison  study  of  China’s  FinTech  industry  is     carried in this study to examine how the FinTech industry successfully gain high traction in China’s     market and satisfy the financial needs of SMEs in China. It is important to highlight that the FinTech     service  as  the  object  of  study  is  limited  to  the  FinTech  3.0   which  business  is  derived  from     technology  firms  (nonbanking  financial  institution)  who  deliver  financial  services  to  public      particularly an alternative lending service through peer to peer (P2P) lending platform.            Both  China  and  Indonesia  as  developing  countries  have  some  common  environment  in     terms of  (1) population density  (2) number of unbanked population; (3) the importance of the SMEs     in economic growth; and (4) the financial constraint by SMEs in each country.

China’s SMEs contributed to   58.5% of GDP  75% of   employment opportunities    and 68% of export activities.   SMEs in China only receive   20% of the credit originated   by the banks     Indonesia is the most populated   country in South East Asia and   ranked four in the world.   106 million people (or around   60% of the bankable population)   did not have the bank account.   Indonesia’s SMEs contributed to   59% of GDP  97% of   employment opportunities  and   15% of export activities.   Only 6% of SMEs in Indonesia   using bank loan as source of   financing     51               The  FinTech  services  providing  alternative  lending  platform   called  P2P  (peertopeer)     lending platform  creates an important allocation role  and become solution especially for SMEs in     China that have constrained the credit access. Since firstly available in Chinese market in 2007 until     by 2014  the platforms have delivered directly to the public and SMEs more than RMB251 billion of     credit (Douglas and Janos 2015). It has gained traction and market acceptance from SMEs seeking     credit  mainly due to the following reasons      1.  no collateral is required to obtain required amount of working capital;     2.     3.     the simplicity of application of lending process on paperless basis;     faster lending approval and cash disbursement;     4.  competitive lending rate; and     5.  no penalty is given in general from early repayment.            Previous study conducted by Shinozaki from Asia Development Bank (2012) showed the     biggest barriers of Indonesian SMEs to obtain financing from the financial institution is due to the     collateral requirement and high lending rate  and further  it reveals that the lack of access to finance     negatively  affected  SME  survival  and  growth  rates  in  general.  Therefore   the  SMEs  in  Indonesia     require some form of alternative financing to cover their financing needs.          The Indonesian government currently foresee the potential of FinTech market in Indonesia     to  support  the  SMEs  that  has  been  underserviced  by  the  large  banks   particularly  for  the     microenterprises which accounted for more than 90% of the total SMEs in Indonesia. By learning     from  China’s  FinTech  industry   there  are  three  conditions  are  observed  to  be  important  as  key     success factors for the FinTech industry to support the growth of the SMEs  the digital technology     adoption level of the SMEs  the financial literacy skills  and the regulatory frameworks.          52     No.     Key Indicators     China     Indonesia     a)  The country with the most     a)  84% of the total population          use the mobile phone and it     is predicted to reach 100%     of population by 2020   b)  the internet users only     reached 15.8% of     population  which still half     below average in ASEAN     countries (35%)     Most  microenterprises     in     Indonesia  at  this  stage  still     having     troubled     in     understanding  basic  finance     literacy.     •  The government will issue   the regulation although the     FinTech’s industry in     Indonesia is still in early     growth stage.       1.

RECOMMENDATION          Since SMEs in Indonesia are dominated by the microenterprises with financial constrain  it     is really important to build the financial infrastructure to support the growth of SMEs  particularly in     micro  business  level.  The  integration  of  FinTech  ecosystem  by  creating  an  innovative  financial     solution  for  SMEs  in  Indonesia  may  become  one  of  the  most  powerful  tools  to  stimulate  the     sustainable economic growth in the future in Indonesia. However  in order to succeed in manifesting     such integration  some vigorous efforts need to be accomplished by the stakeholders.     1.            Improving the IT infrastructure.       At this moment  the internet penetration in Indonesia still considerably below the average     global standard  meanwhile the adoption level of digital technology is highly related on the success     rate of making FinTech services benefits the SMEs. Therefore  the support from government to build     sufficient  IT  infrastructure   and  improving  the  quality  service  of  existing  internet  service  is  really     crucial  especially in rural area in Indonesia.       2.     Providing  regular  training  and  workshops  to  improve  financial  knowledge  of  the     SMEs’ human resources.          It  is  important  to  increase  human  resource  competence  of  SMEs   especially  in  finance     literacy. Regular training and workshop can be held by public and private sector. Government may     create  program  to  educate  SMEs  in  financial  subject   but  any  educational  institution  or  financial     service institution (bank or nonbank  including the FinTech players) also need to align and work     together help SMEs enhance the finance literacy and understand the advantage of FinTech.       3.     Impose heavier regulation after the industry become more mature.       Any  high  barrier  to  entry  market  due  to  excessive  regulation  in  early  growth  stage  of  FinTech     industry in Indonesia could restrain the ability of FinTech firms to compete and grow in the market.     It is important for the government to observe the business practice of FinTech firm in Indonesia and     just  lightly  regulated  it  at  this  early  growth  stage.  After  intensely  monitor  the  industry  and  the     industry  become  mature   then  the  government  may  impose  heavier  regulation  which  focus  on  the     54          risk  management  issue  to  prevent  any  illegal  activity  of  FinTech  firms  rather  than  adding  legal     barriers to entry. The supportive action from the government and regulators is pivotal to determine     the succeed of this industry.                 55     REFERENCES            at          of     [online]     [online]     [online]     FinTech.

A total of   346 MSMEs  or 55.6%  provided valid financial data. The average total asset value per head was   IDR2.13  billion  and  the  annual  net  sales  value  per  head  was  IDR1.66  billion.  Basically   these   MSMEs  belong  to  the  upper  layer  of  the  MSME  pyramid.  The  sampled  MSMEs  included  120   growing microenterprises  according to the category on Law No.20/2008  which provided financial   data (Shinozaki  2012).       ii  The  service  provided  by  the  Bank  of  Scotland  called  “Homelink”  which  offers  to   Nottingham Building Society (NBS) customers. This service form as the basis for online banking   known today (The Financial brand  2012).       iii  The  “Internet  of  Things”  (IoT)  describes  the  widespread  embedding  of  sensory  and   wireless technology within objects  giving them the ability to transmit data about themselves  their   identity  condition and environment.       iv  See further the article “Goldman Sachs is a tech company” by Jonathan Marino.     vThe  survey  is  conducted  in  September  and  October  2015  on  10 131  digitally  active   consumers  in  Australia   Canada   Hong  Kong   Singapore   the  U.K.  and  U.S.  There  are  2 592   respondents  of  the  survey  who  indicated  using  at  least  one  FinTech  products  according  to  EY   FinTech Adoption Index 2015     third     the  fastest   growing.

This suggests that  in the absence of widely accessible formal credit sources in China    individual borrowers are prepared to pay very high transaction costs to secure better financing terms     vi   Lufax is     ($1.5b     $2.6b)     Lufax     (more     2014     yuan     the     to     in     in     59                                                                                                                                                                                   in the future. The main way they could lower their interest rate for borrowing was by accumulating a   record of good loan transactions.       ix  Trade credit is as a form of shortterm debt  and yet it does not require any outright interest    is often in the form of an informal contract  and is not issued by any bank or financial institution. It   has been an essential way for businesses to finance shortterm growth. Trade credit is a useful option   for businesses to receive supplies crucial to growth without paying immediately. This way they can   sell their product before payment is due  or use the freed up cash flow for other business purposes.
