Innovations and   technology will always   break first and then the   regulation will come as a   response that will give   legal certainty to these   new technologies.    Countries should   continue to adopt and   promote mechanisms in   support of   entrepreneurship systems   and the Fintech sector   specifically.    Conclusions    Collaboration between the main actors of the ecosystem.

Not all enterprises are   technological  but given the   difficulties of growth and the   need for adequate support   mechanisms  government and   private sector must focus on the   development of technological   enterprises that allow the   evolution of the digital   ecosystem that we search.    References     ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    ●    Endeavor (2019)  “Termómetros Fintech  Los retos de la regulación”  Finnovista  Santander  Google and British Embassy Mexico City    http //contenido.endeavor.org.mx/descargareportefintech2019    InterAmerican Development Bank (2018)  “Fintech América Latina 2018  Crecimiento y Consolidación”  Washington  D.C.    https //www.nodoka.co/apcaafiles/319472351219cf3b9d1edf5344d3c7c8/fintechamricalatina2018crecimientoyconsolidacin1.pdf    García  A. and Iglesias E.
