And SMEs have become the important force of sustained  rapid and healthy development   of China's economy. Moreover  SMEs have played an irreplaceable role in promoting China’s eco   nomic development  absorbing labors and promoting market prosperity. But with the global eco   nomic  integration   the  domestic  small  and  mediumsized  enterprise’s  operating  environment  is   facing tremendous changes and more intense competition. This paper introduces the sources of   SMEs’ financing  analyzes its financing difficulties and causes from its sources  and aims to benefit   the development of SMEs in the near future.     Keywords   Financing  SME  Causes          1. Introduction   So far  there are more than 43 000 000 small and mediumsized enterprises  playing an important role in the   economy of China. Yet  they still face many difficulties to achieve further development  especially in financing   [1]. This paper mainly analyzes its financing difficulties from the aspect of financing channels  and mastering   applicability and feasibility of financing channels is of great significance to the development of SMEs  and even   the economy in China.     2. The Sources of Financing SMEs   Financing is one of the methods for enterprises to get capital [2]. According to different standards  financing can     How to cite this paper  Jiang  J.J.

Journal of Service Science and Management  7  196200. http //dx.doi.org/10.4236/jssm.2014.73016            be divide into many kinds  this paper divides financing according to its sources into two kinds  namely  internal   and external financing.     J. J. Jiang et al.     2.1. Internal Financing   Internal financing in fact means enterprises get capital from their own  mainly including retained profits and de   preciation  which is an essential part for the survival and development of the enterprises. Generally speaking    internal financing is the first choice  an important source to get capital.     2.1.1. Retained Profits Financing   Retained profits is an important channel of internal financing  and most enterprises prefer to choose this  as it is   actually an process that transform retained profits into investment  this method shows some advantages as fol   lows  first  no actual cash expenditure; second  keeping debt capacity; moreover  no effects on corporate control.   However  some limits are exposed  such as time limitation  retained profits need a long time to accumulate  be   sides  retained profits financing need to balance with dividend policy.     2.1.2. Depreciation Financing   Depreciation financing of fixed assets financing is a method that use the difference caused by opportunity cost   and  depreciation.  And  depreciation  tax  can  bring  internal  capital  to  some  extent   decreasing  the  pressure  of   SMEs  promoting the development of enterprises.     2.2. External Financing   External financing namely enterprises raise funds from other independent economical entities  including direct   financing  and indirect financing. Direct financing  mainly  involve bond  financing   stock  financing and public   funds. Indirect financing contains bank loads and the funds from nonbank institutions. Compared with internal   financing  external financing can raise funds in time  but with high cost.       2.2.1. Direct Financing     1) Bond financing   Bond financing required enterprises to issue bond to investors according to certain rules  pay certain interest   within certain period of time  and repay principal according to agreed conditions. Bond financing is relatively   flexible  interest and principal repayment can be formulated according to each corporate. However  in China    according to Securities Law of the People’s Republic of China  some conditions are required to meet to issue   bonds  namely  corporations’ net assets should be not less than 30 million Yuan  and net assets of a limited li   ability company should be more than 60 million Yuan  in addition to the average distributable profits in the last   three years is enough to pay a year interest of corporate bonds.     2) Equity financing   Equity financing means enterprises shareholder give up part of ownership and introduce new shareholders by   increasing capital of enterprises. This shows an advantage that enterprises don’t need to pay interest  but new   shareholders can share enterprises’ profits with old enterprises.     3) Public funds   Public funds mainly include commercial credit and private lending. Commercial credit means enterprises pro   vide credit with direct relation to commodity transaction each other  such as payment by installment or credit    and down payment  which can avoid lot of limits like bank loans and decrease the cost of raise funds. Private   lending is that the lending occurs between the citizens  citizens and legal persons  and  citizens and other orga   nizations  and is increasingly active with the advancement of the market economy of the society.     2.2.2. Indirect Financing     1) Bank financing   Bank financing is a method that enterprises take banks as an intermediary to raise funds. It is the usually me   thod for corporate to get capital  yet  bank loans has many limits  such as the scale of the corporate  credit degree.   Besides  the quantity and time of loans have been strictly formulated.     2) Nonbank institution financing          197     J. J. Jiang et al.        Financing from Other institution except bank has many methods  mainly includes finance leasing and Pawn   Loans. Finance leasing is a transfer of risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset to the lessee  but not   the actual ownership. And financial leasing has special advantages in solving the problem of corporate financing   compared with other tools. Compared with bank loans  pawn loans need to pay a higher overall cost included the   safekeeping fee  premium and pawn transaction costs. Therefore the cost of pawn loans is high and the scale is   relatively small. But its operation process is simple  so that it can quickly and timely solve the funding needs of   the enterprises.     3. Current Financing Situation of China’s SMEs   The  phenomenon  of  SME  financing  difficulty  exists  in  many  countries  in  the  world   even  in  the  developed   countries with relatively sound financial system  but this phenomenon in China is particularly prominent [3].   According to the survey of SME Bureau in 2008  85.6% of SME lack of liquidity  and 23% of the defunct and   discontinued SMEs are closely related to the leakage of capital. Although some policies carried on by the gov   ernment has gradually improved the situation of SME financing  the phenomenon of financing difficulty in SME   is still serious because the Credit capital failed to help the most in need of assistance enterprises in difficulty and   SMEs’ anemic symptoms remained unchanged. In 2009  a survey report from Tianjin shows  the financing cli   mate index in second quarter of enterprises is 88.6  0.7 points lower than the previous quarter  the only one that   rose in the last quarter but decrease in this quarter of the 8 enterprises climate indexes. In Sichuan province    corporate financing climate index in second quarter also edged down to 0.3  reached 80.2  and run down in the   mild recession interval. In Shandong province  with the input of capital  large enterprises financing climate in   dex was 118.6  17.3 points higher than the last quarter. Yet  SMEs is relatively low  only 76.2 and upgraded 0.5    42.4 points behind the large enterprises. In Liaoning province  corporate financing climate index is 76.4  still in   recession  SME was only 67.7  down 9.7 points. In Heilongjiang province  corporate liquidity climate index of   the whole province is 82.1  still remained to run in recession; corporate financing climate index was 74.4  re   mained  unchanged.  Wondrously   big  gap  existed  between  big  enterprises  and  SMEs   liquidity  and  financing   climate index in SMEs is respectively lower 74.3 and 79.0 than that in large enterprises. In Zhejiang province   which is relatively developed and has major of SMEs  the SMEs financing climate index is 105.8  17.7 lower   than large enterprises  industries with high proportion of SMEs like wholesale and retail trade  information IT    social services  accommodation and catering  and transportation  respectively decreased 2.8  3.1  8.1  1.4 and 9.2.   In all  the situation of SMEs financing is in difficulty.     4. The Causes of SMEs’ Financing Difficulties from Its Source   The phenomenon of SME financing difficulties is caused by many reasons  such as corporate itself problems    banks limits  and credit institutions. This paper focuses its financing sources namely financing method to ana   lyze financing difficulties of SME.     4.1. Indirect Financing as the Main External Sources Is in Difficulty   Negative Effects from the System of Commercial Banks and Difficulty of Bank Loans   Due to China’s commercial banking system  especially the major big four stateowned commercial banks are   experiencing a transition period and far from being truly marketoriented and commercialized [4]. In order to   guard against financial risks  stateowned commercial banks actually have transformed their development stra   tegy to large enterprises and cities in recent years. These changes caused SMEs located in the small cities have   difficulties in getting access to credit service. In addition  it’s still difficult for SME to get bank loans in terms of   bank loans structural  effectiveness and sustainability. On the supply structure  mortgage guarantee as the pri   mary condition of loans approval hinders the loans  besides  bank credit continue to prefer large enterprise or   SMEs that run well  moreover  longterm loans are extremely low. This unbalanced structure has hindered the   sustainability of SMEs with no doubt  consequently  lead to inefficient lending  lack credit monitoring and eval   uation system in SMEs. In terms of the current situation of financial institutions matched with SMES  small and   mediumsized financial institutions are small quantities  and face many problems and difficulties in its further   development  thus are not able to satisfy the SMEs. More importantly  it’s difficult for SMEs to obtain guaran   tees as the weak financing credit  no qualitative or mortgage assets acceptable by banks  and no thirdparty en            198          terprises with enough credit rating to offer guarantees  making it possible to raise funds from banks. Therefore    banks and other financial institutions still have great limits for SMEs to raise funds.     J. J. Jiang et al.     4.2. Direct Financing as the New External Sources Has Been Hindered   Direct financing mainly includes bond financing  stock financing and public funds. With the gradual improve   ment of economy market  direct financing has been a new method to raise funds.     4.2.1. The Marginalization of Bond and Stock Financing   The capital market as an emerging and immature stock market in China only includes shanghai stock exchange   and Shenzhen stock exchange  SME board market  and GEM  but no small enterprises regional markets. Thus   these can be hard to meet the demand of SMEs for its further development  making it difficult to raise funds re   lying on capital market [5]. According to related statistics  in 2012  SME board listed 683 companies  the first   financing amounted to 468.3 billion Yuan  the additional financing 127.7 billion Yuan  share allotment financ   ing 2.6 billion Yuan. And the total financing nearly amounted to 600 billion  with the average financing of each   enterprise reaching 900 million Yuan. Yet a large company listed in 2007 raised funds as high as 66.8 billion   Yuan  equivalent to 70 SMEs. In terms of shortterm bond financing  in 2008  Chinese banking market trader   association accepted 6 SMEs registration as the allowance of issuing shortterm bonds  pilot of SMEs shortterm   bond  financing  officially  launched   and  the  first  issue  totaled  160  million  Yuan   only  a  fraction  of  the  total   amount of shortterm financing bonds in 2008 namely 138.46 billion Yuan. What else  the entry of capital mar   ket is difficult for SMEs because of the limitation of scale  cost and other conditions  such as corporations’ net   assets should be not less than 30 million Yuan  and net assets of a limited liability company should be more than   60 million Yuan  in addition to the average distributable profits in the last three years is enough to pay a year in   terest of corporate bonds. All of these have prevented the success financing from capital market  thus hindering   the development of SMEs.     4.2.2. Credit Guarantee Institutions Are SmallScale   The current development of credit guarantee industry which specially served for SMEs is difficult to meet the   needs of improving the capacity of the credit for SMEs. The credit guarantee institutions built by government   usually can only get a oneoff financial support at the beginning of the preparation and lack of followup com   pensation mechanism. As for the credit guarantee institutions owned privately  they are limited by the system of   ownership and have to bear the risk of loans guaranteed alone. They are unable to form sharing and collabora   tion mechanism with bank. Raising money from the credit guarantee institutions is the most effective tool of fi   nancing SMEs.     4.2.3. Public Funds Need to Take Full Use of and Develop Normatively   With  the  development  of  economy  market   public  funds  increased  rapidly. Yet   private  finance  has  not  been   recognized by the government  existed as an illegal form. In fact  as the increasing financing demand of SMEs    public funds become  more and more important to solve the leakage of funds in SMEs as the little supply of   funds  of  formal  channels.  Still   SMEs  has  not  taken  full  use  of  public  funds   according  to  the  date  of  2011    SMEs inflow of public funds is between 500  600 billion Yuan  accounted for 30% of the total public funds.   Besides  public funds lack standardization and legalization  in recent years  scams in public funds financing oc   curred increasingly  hitting the financing from public funds. Therefore  to promote the stable development of   economy in China  the government should not guide the development of nonpublic economy  but also encour   age and guide public investment.     5. Conclusion   SMEs have become the important force of sustained  rapid and healthy development of China’s economy. There   are many kinds of financing sources that can be adopted for financing small and mediumsized enterprises. It is   important for SMEs to choose correct and appropriate financing sources to solve the company’s financial diffi   culties. This paper mainly analyzes the causes of financial difficulties from its sources  find that less bank loans    issue problems of bond and stock  and that lack of standardization in public funds have hindered the successful   financing of SMEs  offering help for other scholar to put forward solutions of financial difficulty in SMEs  such          199     J. J. Jiang et al.        as decreasing the limits of bank loans and reinforcing the standard of public fund market. Through improvement   of the financing sources  SMEs will become increasingly important and irreplaceable in promoting economic   development in China.
