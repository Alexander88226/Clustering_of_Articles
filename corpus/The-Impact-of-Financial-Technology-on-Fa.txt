Conclusionin  order for  organizations Financial  technology  is  a  recent  technology  and  become crucial to  seamless  and accelerates  business  process  and  transactions.  This  research aims  at  measuring implementation including  services  epayment  bills  epayment  ways  of payment  and  bank  accounts  with  egovernment  on  facilitating egovernment  services terms  of  availability accessibility  efficiency  and  responsiveness.the  effect  of  Fintech in  Egypt in In  conclusion  after  reviewing  related  literatures  designing data  collection  method  collecting  data  from  sample  units and  analyzing  data  to  test  the  research  hypotheses.  It  was found  thatThe  data  analysis  cleared that  only  71.25%  of respondents  transacted  with  egovernment  portal  and  were valid  for  analysis  61.75%  of  them  were  male  and  38.25% female.  As  well  as  most  of  them;  approximately  the  half  of valid  respondents  range  from  31  to  40  years  old  followed  by those  whom  ages  range  from  41  to  50  years  old  then  those whom  ages  range  from  20  to  30  years  old  then  whom  ages are  more  than  60  and  the  lowest  number  of  respondents range  from  51  to  60  years  old.  The  fintech  analysis  revealedFigure  3  The  structure  model  result\\x0c58Esam  El  GOHARY  /  Journal  of  Distribution  Science  175  (2019)  5159less followed  by that  most  of  respondents  possess  bank  accounts  and  bank cards  however than  50%  of  respondents  possess accounts  on  fintech  firms.  The  results  also  revealed  that  all respondents  pay  by  bank  cards  and/or fawry  while  a negligible  percent  pay  by  cryptocurrencies.  With  regard  to obstacles  it  cleared  that  about  70%  of  respondents  faced obstacles  and  the  most  popular  obstacles  represented  in  the internet  speed responsiveness  and difficulties then  services\\xe2\\x80\\x99  shortage these  results  demonstrate  the  weakness  in  internet  networks lack  in  efficient  employees  in  egovernment  portal  as  well  as lack  of  system  effectiveness terms  such  as shortage  of  services  and the results  about the  most  used  egovernment  services  are conflicted  with  egovernment  portal  as  it  reported  that  the most ID  Train  Tickets reservation  Real  Estate  Office  Service  Traffic  prosecution services  and  Complains  and  Inquires.important  services  are  National transactions.  Furthermore the  website in  several in  using low The  descriptive  statistics  illustrated  the  citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99  perception of  all  study  items  the  degree  of  each  item  come  above 60%  which  reflect  the  well  perception  of  all  items.  The reliability  values  of  studied  items  indicated  that  all  studied items  are  consistent  and  valid  to  use  in  another  time.  The correlations  demonstrated  that  all  independent  variables  have a  poor  positive  relationship  with  dependent  variables  except accessibility  has  a  poor  negative  relationship  with  bank accounts  with  egovernment  availability  has  moderate positive  relationship  with  services  epayment  and  ways  of payment  and responsiveness  has  moderate  positive relationship  with  services  epayment  and  bills  epayment. While  regarding  to  independent  variables  bank  accounts with  egovernment  has  poor  positive  relationship  with  all independent  items  however  ways  of  payment  has  moderate positive relationship  with  services  epayment  and  bills epayment  those  have  a  strong  positive  relationship  with each  other.From  the  hypotheses  testing  it  can  be  concluded  that bank  accounts  with  egovernment  doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  has  any relationship  or  effect  on  any  of  the  facilitating  egovernment services  dimensions.  However  services  epayment  has  a direct  effect  on  availability  efficiency  and  responsiveness  but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  affect  accessibility  similarly  bills  epayment  has  a direct  effect  on  efficiency  responsiveness  and  accessibility but  doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  affect  availability.  Also  ways  of  payment  has  a direct  effect  on  availability  and  efficiency  but  doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  affect accessibility  and  responsiveness.6.  RecommendationsBased  on the  conclusion  and findings the  researcher suggests  the  following  recommendations  to  government\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Government  has  to  conduct  awareness  campaigns  to raise  citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99  consciousness  and  trust  in  egovernment transactions  as  30%  of respondents  didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  use egovernment  portal.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Government  has  to  improve  internet  networks  through developing  ICT  infrastructures  to  eliminate  the  internet low  speed.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Government  is  recommended  to  enhance  the  efficiency transactions term  of in of  egovernment  portal completion.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Government is recommended training programs  in  IT  skills  and  customer  services  for  its employees  to  qualify  them  to  be  able  to  interact  with egovernment  portal  which  in  turn  improve  employees responsivenessto  provide \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Government  is  recommended  to  improve  its  website  to be  more  easy  to  use  from  all  population  segments.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Government  has  to  provide  more  services  in  its  website. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Government  and  banks  have to  collaborate  and increase  fintech  implementation  forms  in  egovernment and  add  more  facilitates  for  citizens  to  interact  with egovernment.7.  Limitations  and  Future  Research RecommendationThis  research  is  applied  on  egovernment  in  Egypt  so findings  can  be  applied  only  to  any  organization  implement fintech  systems.  This  paper  used  secondary  data from various  sources  to  develop  the  measurement  scale  of  fintech and  focused  on  determine  the  relationship  between  each fintech facilitation without  consider  any  obstacles face  using egovernment  portal  or  fintech  methods.item  and  each  dimension  of  services that  may Future  studies  could  examine  the  citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99  consciousness about  egovernment.  Also  they  could  study  the  obstacles  of fintech  implementation  and  measure  the  employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99  ability to  interact  with  this  new  technology  as  well  as  studying  the challenges  facing  egovernment.ReferencesAbdelkader  M.
