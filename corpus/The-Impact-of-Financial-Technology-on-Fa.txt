It  affects  financial  and  nonfinancial  institutions    customers   merchants  and  regulators  across  a  wide  range  of   industries  and   the  emergence  of  peertopeer   money  exchange  and  systems  of  nontraditional  payment   (Leong   Tan   Xiao   Tan   &  Sun   2017).    leads     to     So   most  of  governments  turn  to  utilize  the  advantages  of   information  systems  and  provide  their  services  in  a  digital   launching  egovernment  portals   which  represent   way  by   modern  services  channels   interact   online  with  government  entities  (Ebbers   Jansen   &  Van   Deursen   2016)   as  well  as    the   government  services  delivered  to  citizens  (Alderete   2018).   Thus   governments  have  to  implement  financial  technology  to   facilitate  citizens’  obtaining  services.    that  allow  citizens     improve  and     leverage     to     is     fintech     This  study     important  because  with  globalization    technological  evolution  and  the  emergence  of  ecommerce    the   facilitating   financial  transactions  and  makes  them  easier  in  all  fields.   in   However    egovernment  but   implementing     there  are  no  studies     fintech  and  others     there  are  studies     field  plays  an     important     role     in     in     in        52    Esam  El  GOHARY  /  Journal  of  Distribution  Science  175  (2019)  5159    fintech  in  egovernment.  Hence   this  study  aims  to  examine   the  impact  of  implementing  fintech  on  facilitating  Egyptian   egovernment   citizens’   perception  of  fintech  implementation  and  how  it  facilitates   egovernment  services  in  Egypt.    through  examine     services     the     2.

According     to  Almarabeh  and  AbuAli     (2010)  most  of   researchers  and  specialists  defined  Egovernment  as   “government  uses  of   communication   technologies   the   opportunity  to  interact  and  conduct  business  with  government   by  using  different  electronic  media  such  as  telephone  touch   pad   fax   smart  cards   selfservice  kiosks   email  /  Internet    and  (EDI)”.    for  citizens  and  businesses     information  and     to  offer     In  addition   United  Nation’s  defined  it  as  “The  use  of   information  and  communication  technologies  (ICT)    such  as   Wide  Area  Networks   the  Internet   and  mobile  computing     by  government  agencies”.    From  the  prior  definitions  it  clears  that  government  uses   and  keeps  up  with  the  modern  technologies  to  deliver  a   better  government  service  to  its  citizens.  As   it  can  achieve   accountability   transparency   and  citizens  participation  in  the   development  of  government  performance   (Mohammad    Almarabeh   &  Abu  Ali   2009)   as  well  as   raises  the  ease    efficient  and  accurate  of  services’  performance  provided  to   improves  performance    citizens.   speeds  delivery  and   the  effectiveness  of   implementation  (Almarabeh  &  AbuAli   2010).    reduces  costs    increases     It  also     One  of  these  technologies  is  fintech   which  is  used  to     facilitate  the  service  obtaining  process.    Fintech  is  defined  as  "any  innovative  ideas  that  improve   financial  service  processes  by  proposing  technology  solutions   according  to  different  business  situations   while  the  ideas   could  also  lead   to  new  business  models  or  even  new   businesses"  (Leong  &  Sung   2018).

As   the  shared   electronic   of   governments   simplify  access  to  information   and  achieve   greater  transparency  to  stimulate  the  business  environment    accountability  and  collaboration   as  well  as  foster  a  culture   of   In  addition    egovernment  seeks  to  provide  better  public  service  delivery    better  governance  and  participation   better  public  resources   management  and  increase  citizens’  trust  and  confidence  in   the  government  (Heeks   2002;  Bertot   Jaeger   &  Grimes    2010)   so   it  comprises  three  main  doctrines   (Azab   Ali   &   Dafoulas   2006)     trust   knowledge   and  open  government.     1.  Publiccentric     service  delivery      the  government   developed  a  one  stopshop  eservices  approach  that   focuses  on  citizens'  expectations  and  needs.    2.  Community  participation      the  private/public  sector   organizations  are  active  participants  in  egovernment   implementation  and  management  as  well  as  citizens'   needs  must  be  analyzed  and  considered  continuously.  3.  Optimal  utilization  of  government  resources   i.e.  efficient   allocation  of  resources   cost  reduction   and  increasing   productivity.    Moreover   Egyptian  egovernment  portal  provides  about  20   government  services  such  as  telephone  ebilling  payment    electricity  ebilling  payment   birth  certificate    issuing   etc.   (Azab  et  al.   2006).  As  well  as   its  financial  transactions   occurs  in  two  groups  each  group  include  two  forms  as   follows      1.  Government  payments   divided     person  payment  and  government   payment     into   government     to   to  business           •  Government  to  person  payment  (G2P)   refers  to  the   disbursement  of  government  benefits  and  salary   payments.          •  Government  to  business  payment  (G2B)   refers  to   refunds   subsidies  and     include     payments   purchases  of  goods  and  services.     tax     2.

Based  on  the  previous  and  because  of  the  importance  of   fintech  in  facilitating    transactions   the  author  proposed  that   Egyptian  egovernment  portal  implements  fintech  including   (service  epayment   bills  epayment   ways  of  payment   and     bank  accounts  with  egovernment)  in  order  to  facilitate  its   services  in  forms  of  availability   accessibility   efficiency   and   responsiveness.  Each  variable  is  as  follows     Concerning  to  Fintech  model   Services  epayment   refers  to  the  possibility  of  paying     services  fees  through  electronic  payment  methods.    Bills  epayment      the  possibility  of  paying   government  bills  whether  telephone  or  electricity  bills  through   electronic  payment  methods.    refers     to     Ways  of  payment   refers  to  the  availability  of  several   fawry   and  other     epayment  ways  whether  bank  card    epayment  methods    Bank  accounts  with  egovernment      indicates     if  bank     accounts  are  connected  with  egovernment  portal.    With  regard  to  the  dimensions  of  egovernment  service     facilitation     Availability   refers     to  “provide  government  services     to   travelers     citizens   government  agencies   businesses  and   irrespective  of  location  or  time”  (Gebba  &  Zakaria   2015)     Accessibility      refers     to     “the     good     environment   services  and  information”  (Gebba  &  Zakaria   2015)    that  creating  easy  access     communication   to  egovernment     refers     Efficiency      to  produce   particular  outputs   with  lower  costs  and  thus   the  optimal   utilization  of  government  resources”     “using     inputs     fewer     to     Responsiveness   refers  to  “the  providers'  willingness  to   (Parolini      help  customers  and  provide  prompt  service”   Patterson   &  Winston   2009).    Accordingly  the  researcher  hypothesizes  that     H1   There  is  a  significant  effect  of  Fintech  on  services     availability    H2   There  is  a  significant  effect  of  Fintech  on  services     accessibility    H3   There  is  a  significant  effect  of  Fintech  on  services     efficiency    H4   There  is  a  significant  effect  of  Fintech  on  services     responsiveness    Services   epayment    Bills     epayment    Ways  of   payment    Fintech    Availability    Accessibility    Efficiency    Bank  accounts    with  egovernment    Responsiveness    Figure  1   The  proposed  research  model    54    Esam  El  GOHARY  /  Journal  of  Distribution  Science  175  (2019)  5159    3.

The  correlations  demonstrate  the  relationship  between  the   dependent  and  independent  variables.  The  results  reveal  that   regarding  to  dependent  variables  accessibility  and  efficiency   have  poor  positive  correlations  with  all  Fintech  model   (services  epayment   bills  epayment   and  ways  of  payment)   except  bank  accounts  with  egovernment  has  a  poor  positive   correlation  with  efficiency  and  a  poor  negative  correlation   with  accessibility   as  their  values  are  above  0.01  and  less   than  0.49  regardless  to  the  sign.    .511     .592      Availability  has  moderate  positive  correlations  with   services  epayment  and  ways  of  payment  as  their  values   are   respectively   and  has  poor  positive   correlations  with  bills  epayment  and  bank  accounts  with   egovernment  as  their  values  (.480   .014)  respectively  are   above  0.01  and  less  than  0.49.  as  well  as  responsiveness   has  moderate  positive  correlations  with  services  epayment   and  bills  epayment  as  their  values  .534   .612  respectively   are  above  0.50  and  less  than  0.70   and  has  poor  positive   correlation  with  ways  of  payment  and  bank  accounts  with   egovernment  as  their  values  .432   .038  respectively  are   above  0.01  and  less  than  0.49.

Testing  Hypotheses    Data  was  analyzed  using     the  computer  program    Statistical  Package  for  Social  Science  (SPSS  V23.0).  The   Multiple  Linear  Regression  Model  was  used  in  order  to   perform  the  (T  test)  to  measure  the  significance  efficiency   extent  of  each  independent  variable   i.e.;  service  epayment    bills  epayment   ways  of  payment  and  bank  account  with   egovernment  on  affecting  each  dependent   variable   (Availability   Accessibility   Efficiency  and  Responsiveness).    Table  5  demonstrates  the  results  of  the  multiple  linear   the   in     test   and   independent  variables     including  R2   ANOVA     regression  analysis    significance  of  each   affecting  dependent  variables.    item  of     Testing  Hypothesis  one   ANOVA  test  results  (F=45.715   p≤.05)  reveal  that  Fintech     factors.  T     test  results  clear     in  services  epayment  cause  changes     implementation  affect  services  availability  significantly   as  well   as  it  clears  that  (39.5%)  of  changes  in  services  availability   are  affected  by  Fintech   while  more  than  (60%)  of  changes   are  affected  by  other   that   services  epayment  and  ways  of  payment  have  a  significant   impact  on  availability  as  their  (sig.≤p=0.05)   while  services   epayment  has  the  bigger  effect  on  availability  as  each  one   value  change   in   availability  by  .500  as  β=.500  and  each  one  value  change  in   ways  of  payment  cause  changes  in  availability  by  .285  as  β  =.285.  Bills  epayment  and  bank  accounts  with  egovernment   don’t  have  don’t  have  any  significant  effect  on  availability  as   their  (sig.≥p=0.05).  Therefore   hypothesis  one  “There  is  a   significant  effect  of  Fintech  on  availability”   is  accepted  in   terms  of  services  epayment  and  ways  of  payment  and   refused  in  terms  of  bills  epayment  and  bank  accounts  with   egovernment.    Testing  Hypothesis  two   ANOVA  test  results  (F=20.292   p≤.05)  reveal  that  there  is   a  main  significant  effect  of  Fintech  on  services  accessibility    as  well  as  R2=.225   namely  (22.5%)  of  changes  in  services   accessibility  are  affected  by  Fintech   while  more  than  (77%)   are  affected  by  other  factors.  T  test  results  clear  that  only   bills  epayment  has  a  significant  effect  on  accessibility  with   (β=.424)  which  clears  that  each  one  value  change  in  bills   epayment  cause  changes  in  accessibility  by  .424.     Esam  El  GOHARY  /  Journal  of  Distribution  Science  175  (2019)  5159    57    On  the  other  side  the  results  demonstrate  that  there  is  no   significant  effect  of  services  epayment     ways  of  payment   and  bank  accounts  with  egovernment  on   services   accessibility.  Therefore   hypothesis  two  “There  is  a  significant   effect  of  Fintech  on  accessibility”   is  refused  in  all  its  terms   except  bills  epayment.    Testing  Hypothesis  three   The  result  of  ANOVA  test  (F=25.699   p≤.05)  demonstrates   that  Fintech  model  has  a  main  significant  effect  on   efficiency   as  well  as  R2=.269  indicates  that  about  (27%)  of   changes  in  efficiency  are  affected  by  Fintech  model   while   (73%)  of  changes  are  affected  by  other  factors.  T  test   results  clear  that  services  epayment   bills  epayment  and     ways  of  payment  have  significant  impact  on  efficiency   while   bills  epayment  has  the  biggest  effect  on  efficiency  as  each   one  value  change  in  bills  epayment  changes  β=.495  of   efficiency     following  by  ways  of  payment  (β=  .203)  then   services  epayment  (β=.163).    Regarding  to   bank  accounts  with  egovernment  results   reflect  that  it  doesn’t  has  any  significant  effect  on  efficiency.   Therefore   hypothesis  three  “There  is  a  significant  effect  of   Fintech  on  efficiency”   is  accepted  in  all  its  terms  except   bank  accounts  with  egovernment.    has     a  main     significant     Testing  Hypothesis  four  From  ANOVA  test  result  (F=43.823   p≤.05)  it  clears  that   Fintech  model   on   responsiveness   as  well  as  it  contributes  by  (37.6%)  in   changes  in  responsiveness  as  R2=.376   while  (62.4%)  of   changes  are  affected  by  other  factors.  T  test  results  reveal   that  services  epayment  and  bills  epayment  have  significant   impact  on  responsiveness   while  bills  epayment  has  the   biggest  effect  as   followed  by  services   epayment  (β=.154)  .    (β=.488)      effect     its     that     reveal     results     Concerning  to  ways  of  payment  and  bank  accounts  with   egovernment    they  don’t  have  any   significant  effect  on  responsiveness.  Therefore   hypothesis   four   is  a  significant  effect  of  Fintech  on   responsiveness”   is  accepted  in  terms  of  services  epayment   and  bills  epayment  and  refused  in  terms  of    ways  of   payment  and  bank  accounts  with  egovernment.    “There     5.  Conclusion     in  order     for  organizations     Financial  technology  is  a  recent  technology  and  become   crucial   to  seamless  and   accelerates  business  process  and  transactions.  This  research   aims  at  measuring   implementation   including   services  epayment   bills  epayment   ways  of   payment  and  bank  accounts  with  egovernment  on  facilitating   egovernment  services   terms  of  availability    accessibility   efficiency  and  responsiveness.    the  effect  of  Fintech     in  Egypt     in     In  conclusion   after  reviewing  related  literatures   designing   data  collection  method   collecting  data  from  sample  units   and  analyzing  data  to  test  the  research  hypotheses.  It  was   found  that     The  data  analysis  cleared     that  only  71.25%  of   respondents  transacted  with  egovernment  portal  and  were   valid  for  analysis  61.75%  of  them  were  male  and  38.25%   female.  As  well  as  most  of  them;  approximately  the  half  of   valid  respondents  range  from  31  to  40  years  old  followed  by   those  whom  ages  range  from  41  to  50  years  old  then  those   whom  ages  range  from  20  to  30  years  old  then  whom  ages   are  more  than  60   and  the  lowest  number  of  respondents   range  from  51  to  60  years  old.  The  fintech  analysis  revealed    Figure  3   The  structure  model  result    58    Esam  El  GOHARY  /  Journal  of  Distribution  Science  175  (2019)  5159    less     followed  by     that  most  of  respondents  possess  bank  accounts  and  bank   cards   however   than  50%  of  respondents  possess   accounts  on  fintech  firms.  The  results  also  revealed  that  all   respondents  pay  by  bank  cards  and/or   fawry   while  a   negligible  percent  pay  by  cryptocurrencies.  With  regard  to   obstacles  it  cleared  that  about  70%  of  respondents  faced   obstacles  and  the  most  popular  obstacles  represented  in  the   internet  speed   responsiveness  and   difficulties   then  services’  shortage    these  results  demonstrate  the  weakness  in  internet  networks    lack  in  efficient  employees  in  egovernment  portal  as  well  as   lack  of  system  effectiveness   terms  such  as   shortage  of  services  and   the   results  about   the  most  used  egovernment  services  are   conflicted  with  egovernment  portal  as  it  reported  that  the   most   ID   Train  Tickets   reservation   Real  Estate  Office  Service   Traffic  prosecution   services  and  Complains  and  Inquires.    important  services  are  National     transactions.  Furthermore      the  website     in  several     in  using     low     The  descriptive  statistics  illustrated  the  citizens’  perception   of  all  study  items   the  degree  of  each  item  come  above   60%   which  reflect  the  well  perception  of  all  items.  The   reliability  values  of  studied  items  indicated  that  all  studied   items  are  consistent  and  valid  to  use  in  another  time.  The   correlations  demonstrated  that  all  independent  variables  have   a  poor  positive  relationship  with  dependent  variables  except   accessibility  has  a  poor  negative  relationship  with  bank   accounts  with  egovernment   availability  has  moderate   positive  relationship  with  services  epayment  and  ways  of   payment   and   responsiveness  has  moderate  positive   relationship  with  services  epayment  and  bills  epayment.   While   regarding  to  independent  variables  bank  accounts   with  egovernment  has  poor  positive  relationship  with  all   independent  items   however  ways  of  payment  has  moderate   positive   relationship  with  services  epayment  and  bills   epayment  those  have  a  strong  positive  relationship  with   each  other.    From  the  hypotheses  testing   it  can  be  concluded  that   bank  accounts  with  egovernment  doesn’t  has  any   relationship  or  effect  on  any  of  the  facilitating  egovernment   services  dimensions.  However  services  epayment  has  a   direct  effect  on  availability   efficiency  and  responsiveness  but   doesn’t  affect  accessibility   similarly  bills  epayment  has  a   direct  effect  on  efficiency   responsiveness  and  accessibility   but  doesn’t  affect  availability.  Also  ways  of  payment  has  a   direct  effect  on  availability  and  efficiency  but  doesn’t  affect   accessibility  and  responsiveness.    6.  Recommendations    Based  on     the  conclusion  and     findings     the  researcher     suggests  the  following  recommendations  to  government     •  Government  has  to  conduct  awareness  campaigns  to   raise  citizens’  consciousness  and  trust  in  egovernment   transactions  as  30%  of   respondents  didn’t  use     egovernment  portal.    •  Government  has  to  improve  internet  networks  through   developing  ICT  infrastructures  to  eliminate  the  internet   low  speed.    •  Government  is  recommended  to  enhance  the  efficiency   transactions     term  of     in     of  egovernment  portal   completion.    •  Government     is     recommended     training   programs  in  IT  skills  and  customer  services  for  its   employees  to  qualify  them  to  be  able  to  interact  with   egovernment  portal   which  in  turn  improve  employees   responsiveness    to  provide     •  Government  is  recommended  to  improve  its  website  to     be  more  easy  to  use  from  all  population  segments.    •  Government  has  to  provide  more  services  in  its  website.   •  Government  and  banks  have   to  collaborate  and   increase  fintech  implementation  forms  in  egovernment   and  add  more  facilitates  for  citizens  to  interact  with   egovernment.    7.  Limitations  and  Future  Research     Recommendation    This  research  is  applied  on  egovernment  in  Egypt   so   findings  can  be  applied  only  to  any  organization  implement   fintech  systems.  This  paper  used  secondary  data   from   various  sources  to  develop  the  measurement  scale  of  fintech   and  focused  on  determine  the  relationship  between  each   fintech   facilitation   without  consider  any  obstacles   face  using   egovernment  portal  or  fintech  methods.    item  and  each  dimension  of  services     that  may     Future  studies  could  examine  the  citizens’  consciousness   about  egovernment.  Also  they  could  study  the  obstacles  of   fintech  implementation   and  measure  the  employees’  ability   to  interact  with  this  new  technology   as  well  as  studying  the   challenges  facing  egovernment.
