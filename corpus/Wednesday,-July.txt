In 2015 and 2016 the Russian Ministry of Education  and  Science  and  the  Bank  of  Russia  introduced  financial  literacy  to the basic primary and secondary curricula. In early 2017 the two bodies signed a  joint  action  plan  stipulating  the  inclusion  of  financial  literacy  components  at every  level  of  the  educational  system  as  well  as  the  organization  of  events devoted to raising financial awareness among the general public. The  determination  of  a  consistent  approach  and  establishment  of  cooperation between  federal  and  regional  state  authorities  the  Bank  of  Russia  and  social and  commercial  organizations  are vital steps  towards  the  successful  realization of  these  goals.

In recent years this subject  has  also  been  widely  discussed  in  the  context  of  growing  trade  and investment cooperation between Russia and nonCIS countries. Traditionally the focus has been on the macroeconomic conditions and barriers that currently limit the  proportion  of  payments  made  using  national  currencies  including  existing national currency regulation legislation. The Bank of Russia also considers these issues in connection with the implementation of monetary policy and the impact on financial stability. The following issues are planned for the discussion What  is  the  development  potential  for  payments  made  between  the  Russian Federation and its main trade and economic partners using national currencies? What are the main risks to the implementation of monetary policy and ensuring financial  stability  in  Russia  associated  with  the  internationalization  of  the Russian rouble? What are the limits to the internationalization of the Russian rouble now and in the long term (until 2035) in light of growing regionalization? Which barriers most hinder current development of crossborder transactions in national currencies?

Panel session IV Global economic challenges for central banks The  problem  of  permeability  in  the  economy  capable  of  destabilizing  national financial  systems  is  particularly  critical  for  emerging  markets.  As  the  global recession  has  shown  maintaining  low  inflation  should  go  hand  in  hand  with financial stability.  The  experiences  of  emerging  economies in implementing low inflation  and  financial  stability  policies  are  all  unique  but  they  nonetheless exhibit  patterns  which  warrant  interpretation.  The  deepening  of  financial integration  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  the  path  chosen  by  advanced  economies  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  increases  the  level  of mutual influence among the financial systems of all states. How exactly will this impact  financial  stability  and  sustainable  growth  in  countries  with  emerging economies? RT 3.1 A new role for accounting bodies in corporate relations A full year has passed since legislative amendments allowing corporations to use the cascade method went into effect. Accounting infrastructure has become a key element  in  corporate  events  and  the  transport  system  for  information  and monetary  exchange  between  the  issuer  of  stocks  or  bonds  and  the  investor. Holders of securities no longer need to interact directly with the issuer in order to exercise their rights. Both information and declarations of intent can now be transferred  electronically.  Voting  at  general  shareholder  meetings  can  also  be done online. Have the expectations of shareholders and bond holders been met? Have the lives of issuers been made easier? Has the new system provided an incentive for investors including foreign investors to participate more actively in corporate events? What problems has the market faced? Can a boom in electronic voting be \\x0c expected? What are the paths for further development? 7  RT 3.2 The role of selfregulation in the financial market This  roundtable  will  explore  approaches  to  implementing  financial  monitoring and  oversight  of  the  activities  of  market  participants  from  the  perspectives  of both  the  regulator  and  the  market  with  the  goal  of  creating  a  comprehensive regulatory  system  that  meets  the  needs  of  professionals  working  in  various segments of the financial market. It will also focus on standardizing the activity of selfregulatory organizations and of their members in the financial market in an attempt to generate a set of transparent rules governing market behaviour that financial organizations and their customers can easily understand.

RT 3.3 Financial inclusion strategy reaching a new level Financial  inclusion  is  currently  a  highpriority  topic  not  just  for  national regulators but also for the majority of ISSBs. In light of this the Bank of Russia is  moving  towards  systemic  measures;  more  specifically  it  is  developing  a strategy to enhance financial inclusion in the medium term (2017\\xe2\\x80\\x932019). The following priority and longterm development focus areas have been set out in the strategy \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Development of financing for small and mediumsized enterprises \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Improvement  of  protection  mechanisms  for  financial  services  consumers and development of financial literacy among the population and SMEs \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Development of digital financial services channels \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Expansion of access to financial services in remote and rural regions \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Improvement  of  financial  inclusion  for  sections  of  the  population  and SMEs that have limited access to financial services The discussion will be dedicated to the strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main priorities as well as to an analysis of the goals to be reached via these priorities which include \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Improvement  of  infrastructure  through  the  development  of  mutually profitable  collaboration  between  banks  and  other  nonbank  financial institutions \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Development  of  programmes to  provide financing  (including in alternative  forms)  to  SMEs  including  the  creation  of  a  system  of incentives for those who offer credit/loans to said enterprises \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Refinement  of  the  existing  set  of  digital  financial  services  to  incorporate those business models and products that would meet the needs of financial services consumers who fall into categories of citizens not included in the financial system \\xef\\x82\\xb7  The  Bank  of  Russia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  understanding  of  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x98target  audiences\\xe2\\x80\\x99  of  various financial services Improvement by the Bank of Russia of the financial services consumer protection system  RT 3.4 Professional judgement process justification procedure and transparency \\x0c For discussion 8 \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Area of application for professional judgement during decisionmaking \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Professional  judgement  from  the  perspectives  of  both  the  regulator  and participants in the financial market Procedures for incorporating and approving professional judgement  RT 3.5 2017 Innotribe Startup Challenge Russia Presentation of the first SWIFT Innotribe Startup Challenge Russia (Innotribe is one of the most famous international fintech startup competitions held regularly by the SWIFT cooperative).

RT 4.6 Corporate information management Information  management  as  value  management  is  becoming  more  and  more relevant  given the increasing  scale  of  activity  performed  by financial organizations.  Despite  the  exponential  growth  in  the  volume  of  data  being collected  and  stored  it  is  increasingly  difficult  to  use  traditional  descriptive analytics and reporting to find the required information and extract details which are  useful  in  making  precise  and  timely  management  decisions. Meanwhile  the digitalization  of  society  and  the  development  of  information  technology  are opening  up  opportunities  to  make  use  of  new  sources  of  information  (big  data) and  enabling  the  effective  and  timely  analysis  of  these  sources.  Under  these conditions  financial  organizations  are  increasingly  coming  to  understand  the necessity  of  using  more  mature  solutions  when  working  with  data  first  and foremost  as  pertains  to  the  implementation  of  centralized  data  management \\x0c 10 systems.  This  implies  the  formation  of  a  single  integrated  approach  to  data  as the  foundation  of  decisionmaking  as  well  as  the  development  of  organizationwide  standards  and  policies  for  working  with  data  and  standards  for guaranteeing quality  a  task  which  categorically  requires  the  engagement of all structural units within an organization.
