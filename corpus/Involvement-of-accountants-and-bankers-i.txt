here  in file  Involvement of Accountants and Bankers in SME Transfers      Perspectives and Witnessed Difficulties     Lex van Teeffelen (Hogeschool Utrecht  The Netherlands)                    Summary   Experts and researcher stress the importance of preparation and planning in SME transfers. Stevenson &   Lundström (2002) identify other factors of importance and Le BretonMiller et al. (2004) find that theory and   research tend to overlook contextual and process variables. To extend an earlier study (Van Teeffelen et al    2005) 25 accountants and 14 bankers were interviewed to identify the main issues  problems in SME transfers.    Accountants and bankers have different roles and involvements in SME business transfers. Despite their   different roles accountants and bankers seem to have a shared vision. Both of them see opportunity or   contextual factors as most important (withholding vital business and financial information  finding buyers    financing  involvement of banks). Bankers also mention motivational or process factors (letting go  postponing   the transfer). Planning and preparation is considered less important.     Although this study confirms previous results  it is too early to generalize our findings. The sample was   relatively small and only taken in The Netherlands. For future research we recommend to take into account   opportunity (amount of buyers available  withholding information and possibilities to attain credit facilities)    motivational (the emotional aspects of letting go and postponement) alongside ability factors like planning and   preparation to study SME transfers.       Keywords  SME business transfers  bankers  accountants  family business           1. Introduction     The EU (EU Commission  2002) and research stress the importance of a long preparation of     35 years and succession planning (Morris et al  1997; Kommers & van Engelenburg  2003;     Sharma et al  2003; Le BretonMiller et al 2004  Meijaard & Uhlaner  2005). In doing so  they     focus on the preparation and planning abilities of the owner or selling party.           According to Stevenson & Lundström’s (2002) framework  entrepreneurship is not only     shaped by ability. Also the perceived opportunity and the motivation of the entrepreneur are     important. Le BretonMiller et al (2004) note in their review on succession in family business     that theory and research tend to overlook contextual and process variables  contrary to     consultants/practioners. Van Teeffelen et al (2005) confirm Le BretonMiller et al findings. But     contrary to Le BretonMiller’s  Van Teeffelen et al. report that consultants don’t mention long     term planning and preparation as a key factor.          The market for buying and selling small businesses seems vital as opportunity factor in terms     of Stevenson & Lundström (2002) and contextual variable in terms of Le BretonMiller et al     (2004). The market is imperfect (EU Commission 2002). On the supply side many small     business owners postponed their decision to sell their business. On the demand side  most entry          1     into small business ownership occurs through new business startups (Meijaard  2005).     Retirement is the main reason for business transfers in the many EU countries and Canada     (Floren  2002; Geerts  2004; Meijaard  2004; Bruce & Picard 2005). Now the economy is     flourishing the expected retirement of the baby boom generation could become reality and     disrupt the marketplace. Finding buyers seems relevant since the majority of the transfers in The     Netherlands are nonfamily transfers (Meijaard  2005). Research among several EU regions     indicates that nonfamily succession have more problems in acquiring credit facilities than     family transfers in transfer situations (Geerts et al  2004). Contact with buyers  bankers and     access to credit facilities to finance transfers seem vital marketplace variables.           As motivational factor in terms of  Stevenson & Landström (2002) and process variables in     terms of Le BretonMiller et al (2004) the the readiness for the concumbent to let go of the     business seems an important predictor a successful transfer (Venter  2003; Sharma et al  2001)     indicate that the business owner inability of letting go is the single most cited obstacle to     effective succession. Kommers & van Engelenburg (2003) also mention the psychological aspect     as the most decisive. During the transfer process the actual business owner could obstruct a     successful transfer  showing indecisiveness and delaying the transfer (Landsberg  1999; Flören      2002).          This paper likes to extend the preliminary study of Van Teeffelen et al. (2005)  introducing     accountants and bankers as vital advisers and assessors in SME business transfers (De Waard      2002; Geerts et al.  2004; Bruce & Picard  2005). Four questions are leading        What is the role and involvement of accountants and bankers in the SME transfers?        Do accountants and bankers have a shared vision on problems in SME transfers?       Do they have a shared vision in their suggestions to overcome these problems?       How important are planning and preparation in comparison to others factors?          2. Method     Two qualitative studies were conducted between December 2005 and February 2006.     Accountants of 25 firms (n=25) and senior bankers (n=14) of the five main banks were     interviewed with a set of open questions. All accountants and bankers work mainly or     exclusively for the SME segment.                              2          Table 1  Set of open questions     1.  In which phases of the transfer are you most active?   2.  In which phase of the transfer are you least active?   3.  Are there other experts you involve in the transfer?    4.  What are the major issues in a SME transfer?   5.  Which factors do account for difficulties regarding business succession?   6.  Do you have suggestions or solutions to overcome these difficulties?   7.  A business transfers may result in loosing your client? How do you deal with that?   8.  How do you deal with the emotional aspects of the transfer?   9.  Suppose a buying party introduces himself to you. How do you assess this person?          The accountants (n=25) work for very small (15)  medium (5) or large firms (5) specialized     in the SME segment. Dependant on firm size the accountants handle on average 2  6 or 10     transfers per year. On the selected items we didn’t find differences between small firms and     medium/large firms in frequencies.     Of the 14 interviewed bankers 12 operate in special transfer/succession teams. Among them     there are two national coordinators  four regional senior managers and 8 senior financers      advisors or account managers. SME Business transfers are daily business for most bankers.           We didn’t statistically test for differences between small firm and medium/large firm     accountants or accountants and bankers on the items. The required minimum amount of five     observations per cell for Chisquare testing was frequently not met. Moreover statistical testing     wouldn’t add to this descriptive study since Chisquare testing of differences is known to be very     conservative for small samples.           To prevent bias of the interviewers  the interviewers were unaware of the transfer models or     theory and were trained in general interview and research skills only. The answers of accountants     and bankers were processed and categorized independently by two student teams. Subjects gave     frequently more than one answer. If so the percentage of given answers and the average number     of answers per subject are reported.          We divide the transfer process in five phases       1.  Orientation (transfer strategy  how  when  what  who and transfer planning)     2.  Preparation (preparing the business for sale  valuation  asked price  bid book and business          information for buyers  long list of potential buyers)     3.  Matching and Negotiation (actively contacting buyers  first meetings  initial negotiations)     4.  Contracting (letter of intent  due diligence  final negotiations)     5.  Closing and transfer (final contract  legal transfer of shares or property)          3     3. Results     3.1 Main results accountants study     The accountants are involved in all phases of the transfer. They coordinate 75% of the     transfers they handle. As coordinator they work both in their controller capacities as well as     advisor. They are least active in the matchmaking phase and the negotiations (only 56%).                                                                           Nearly all of them (88%) involve tax advisers and lawyers in the transfer process. Not a     single accountant involves bankers and only a small minority (22%) involves venture capitalists.                                                                                4          Table 2  Parties involved by accountants0%20%40%60%80%100%Tax specialistsLawyersVenture capitalistColleague accountantsBusiness brookersReal estate agentsTable 3  Accountants on main issues0%5%10%15%20%25%30%35%Continuity/FutureDue Dilligence TransparancyValuationEntrepreneurial qualitiesAllAccountants predominately take the perspective of the buying party  even if they work for     the selling party  giving priority to the future and continuity of the business and a transparent     transfer process. Most accountants gave just one answer (n=25  number of answers given = 32).           The two most mentioned causes for transfer problems are concealing financial and business     information (debts  liabilities  tax claims) and getting credit facilities for the transfer (see plotted     in Table 9). Both could be categorized as opportunity or contextual factors. Each accountant     gave on average 1.7 answers (n=25  number of answers = 42). Working together closely and     coaching the client through the process  is the single most mentioned solution  mentioned by 48     % of the accountants. Only 17% see no solution to these problems (n=25  number of     answers=29)          80% deal with conflicts and emotional problems themselves. They take a lot of time for     talking and listening (organize family sessions  coach business owners) to overcome emotional     issues. 96% of the accountants take the loss of their clients due to new ownership for granted.          3.2 Main results bankers study     Bankers participate only in the contract phase of the transfer  where credit facilities are     needed to finance the transfer. Contrary to accountants all the bankers fight to maintain their     customers. Business transfers become more and more important to banks  due to the expected     increase of transfers and the possibilities of cross selling services. Shifting from credit assessors     into advisors  these specialized bankers inform  talk through scenarios and look for alternatives.     70% of the bankers involve affiliated financial specialist or business brokers. 30% of the bankers     look for participating in SME transfers themselves.                                                                  5          Table 4  Bankers on main issues0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%Emotional issuesAttainabilty credit Mismatch marketLate bank involvement Bankers see the motivational factors or process variables (postponing succession  letting go     of the business) in the transfer and the opportunity or contextual factors (the attainability of     credit facilities  the late involvement of the bank and mismatches in the market) as the  main     issues. Each banker gave 2.4 answers (n=13  number of answers = 31).          The main problems that arise with SMEtransfer are due to emotional problems  late bank     involvement  no credit facilities and the problem of finding buyers (see plotted Table 6).     Bankers gave an average of 1.7 answers (n=14  number of answers = 24)                                                                                                         Bankers have no clear solution for this problem. Earlier involvement in the transfer process     and bankers informing their clients more actively are the two most mentioned. Better credit     applications and a better transfer preparation are also frequently mentioned. Each banker gave     1.7 answers (n=13  number of answers=22).                                     6     Table 5  Solutions by bankers0%5%10%15%20%25%Active informing of banksEarly involvement bankImproving credit appl.Better preparation transferDealing with emotionsEntrepeneurship3.3 Plotted results     Accountants guide their client through the whole transfer process. Bankers are only involved     at the contract phase but would like to move in earlier in the transfer process. In being so     involved the accountant is closer to motivational of process factors than the banker.           Accountants and bankers have a common perspective. They both look at opportunity or     contextual factors. Accountants call it continuity and the future of the business  bankers look at     marketplace conditions. Bankers also mention motivational or process factors  which are     normally dealt with by accountants.                                                                                            The plotted results of the main problems in transfers indicate a shared vision. They both gave     1.7 answers per individual. Both bankers and accountants mention emotional aspects and finding     credit facilities among the three most important problems. Accountants point out that number     one problem is the withholding of vital financial or business information. Bankers point at the     emotional aspect of a transfer and also mention the late involvement of the bank and the problem     with finding buyers. Dealing more with the emotional aspect of transfers and for a longer period      accountants rate the emotional aspects lower. Although transfer preparation is mentioned by both     parties it is clearly among the lower end frequencies.                    7     Table 6  Main problems in SMEtransfers0%10%20%30%40%50%60%Withholding vital infoNot letting go/postponingFinancingFinding buyersStaff/CultureLack of preparationValuation/pricingWrong expectations Bank too late involvedAccountantsBankiers                                                                      In assessing a fruitful relationship with the buyer or successor  both bankers and accountants     mainly look at the same aspects  personal qualities of the entrepreneur and the financial health of     the business.          4. Conclusions and recommendations     Accountants and bankers have different roles and involvements in SME business transfers.     Accountants guide their client through the whole transfer process. Bankers are only involved at     the contract phase but would like to move in earlier in the transfer process. Accountants tend to     underrate the emotional aspects (motivational or process factors) which are emphasized by     bankers. Bankers are much more commercial driven and competitive.          Accountants look with buyers’ eyes at transfers mentioning continuity and future of the     business and a transparent transfer as the most important aspects. Bankers look at the market     place and emotional issues.           Though their different roles and involvement the results indicate they have a shared vision on     the main problems arising with SME transfers and assessing a fruitful relationship with a buying     party. Both of them see opportunity or contextual factors as most important (withholding vital     business and financial information  finding buyers  financing  involvement of banks). Bankers     also mention motivational or process factors (letting go  postponing the transfer). Planning and     preparation as an ability factor is considered less important. Their criteria to assess potential     buyers as clients are very much alike  personal qualities and the financial health of the business.           8     Table 7  Asessing buyers0%20%40%60%80%100%Personal qualities Companiesfinancial healthTypecompany/marketPricing/attainabilityAccountantBankerAccountants and bankers see different solutions to these problems. Where accountants     clearly see coaching as the way  which is clearly shared by many consultants/practioners      (Landsberg  1999; Miller et al  2003; Reece  2003) bankers seem to hesitate about the best     approach. Partly they blame their clients (and indirectly their accountants) in the late     involvement in the transfer process  substandard credit applications and preparations. Partly they     see that they might take a more active role by informing their clients better.            We may conclude that the findings of the preliminary study (Van Teeffelen et al.  2005) are     confirmed  Dutch consultants/practioners take into account contextual and process variables  but     fail to see long term planning and preparation as key issues.           It is too early to generalize our findings. First of all our results have limited external validity.     We used a small sample of accountants and bankers and our sample was taken only in The     Netherlands. We can’t generalize for Europe or Canada. Replication in other EU countries and     Canada is needed to generalize these findings.          Le BretonMiller’s et al. (2004) literature study also is likely to have a bias  which might     account for the emphasis on preparation and planning. Publishing consultants/practisioners are     mostly USA citizens. The USA is known to have a lower threshold for venture and private     capital. External parties participating in business transfer may demand better planning and     preparation abilities.           Our findings suggest that the relatively easy surveyed planning and preparation of transfers     could be of very limited value. For future research we recommend to take into account     opportunity  motivational and ability factors of entrepreneurs. Alongside abilities the emotional     aspects of letting go and postponement and the market situation (amount of buyers available and     possibilities to attain credit facilities) might be important to predict failure or success of SME     transfers          5.
