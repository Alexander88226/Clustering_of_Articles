here  in file  Emergence of Fintech Companies in Southeast Asia   ―Rising Hopes of a Solution to Financial Issues―    By Kaori Iwasaki  Senior Economist  Economics Department  Japan Research Institute    Summary    1.  A growing number of fintechrelated businesses are emerging in Southeast Asia  reflecting   increased interest as part of the global fintech (financial technology) boom. The Internet and   smartphones are spreading rapidly in Southeast Asia  and many of these new businesses are uti  lizing these technologies to find solutions to the region’s financial problems.   2.  Many of the technologies and business models adopted by fintech businesses in South  east Asia were not developed in the region  but instead imported from developed countries and   China. While using these technologies and business models  Southeast Asian fintech companies   are also retaining some traditional methods to create hybrid business models that combine both   hightech and lowtech approaches  which from the perspective of developed countries seem un  suited to the digital age. This situation reflects the fact that digital and nondigital fields have not   developed side by side in Southeast Asia  as they have in many developed countries.    3.  These characteristics are seen in the following examples of typical fintech businesses in   Southeast Asia.    (1)  Mobile payment services  These can be used even by people who have no bank accounts.   Money can be loaded into accounts in mobile devices by paying cash to affiliated retailers   and other outlets in the local community.    (2)  Services that allow cash transfers using only mobile phone numbers  Singapore and Thai  land are both engaged in national initiatives in this area as part of their efforts to create   domestic infrastructure for electronic payments.     (3)  Mobile overseas money transfer services  These services evolved to meet the needs of a   region in which large numbers of people travel overseas to work. They are promoted as   being easier  cheaper  and faster than conventional systems.     (4)  Lending services based on the use of alternative data  These businesses collect and ana  lyze digital footprints and use this information to compensate for or provide an alternative   to underdeveloped credit information systems.    4.  One area which is leading the fintech boom in Southeast Asia is mobile payments. Compe  tition has intensified in this area due to a large influx of companies into the market. The Chinese   companies Alibaba and Tencent are expected to step up their presence in the market sooner or   later. Local companies  such as the powerful ridehailing startups GoJek and Grab  are mean  while positioning themselves strategically to take leading positions across the entire electronic   payment service sector in Southeast Asia.      5.  Fintech businesses are also attracting attention from Southeast Asian governments  which   want to ensure the sound development of fintech as a way to develop and enhance the finan  cial systems of their countries. There are especially high hopes toward the role of fintech in the   achievement of financial inclusiveness and the creation of a cashless society.  6.  Many hurdles will need to be overcome before fintech businesses can become firmly estab  lished in Southeast Asia and contribute to the solution of the region’s financial problems. What   is most important is to ensure the reliability of fintech businesses. That will require both public   and private initiatives  including the creation of mechanisms and rules  the establishment of se  curity measures  and awarenessraising activities for users.    2    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68Introduction    In recent years there has been a global trend   toward the convergence of finance and IT in the   form of fintech  leading to the emergence of vari  ous financial services. In Southeast Asia  this has   led to the rise of various fintech businesses  espe  cially problemsolving businesses that approach   financial  sector  problems  in  Southeast Asia  as   business opportunities. These businesses are using   technologies and business models that originated   in  developed  countries  and  China  as  problem  solving tools. Another feature of these businesses   is  their  ability  to  combine  hightech  and  low  tech approaches according to local conditions  by   introducing cuttingedge technology while also   keeping traditional methods.     In this article we will examine these character  istics of Southeast Asian fintech and the compa  nies that use fintech. Part 1 will provide an outline   of fintech businesses in Southeast Asia. Part 2 will   examine the various financerelated problems in   Southeast Asia that have led to the rise of fintech   businesses in the region  and show how fintech   can be used to resolve these issues. Part 3 will   look at some typical examples of fintech business  es in Southeast Asia  and Part 4 will focus on mo    bile payments  which is leading the fintech boom   in Southeast Asia  focusing in particular inroads   by Chinese companies and trends in the ridehail  ing business. Part 5 will show how governments   are looking at fintech businesses in terms of their   potential to contribute to the solution of policy is  sues in each country.    1.  Recent Developments of Fin    tech in Southeast Asia    (1)  Upsurge in Fintech Businesses    An overview of fintech businesses in Southeast   Asia can be obtained by looking at the list com  piled by the Thai technology media firm Tech  sauce and market research and consultancy com  pany RUAMKID in Southeast Asia’s Top 75 Fin  tech Companies Report 2017(1). First  the top three   countries  in  terms  of  head  office  locations  for   these companies were Singapore (43%)  Thailand   (19%)  and Indonesia (12%) (Fig. 1). These fig  ures confirm that while many fintech companies   are concentrated in Singapore  which is the most     Fig. 1   Attributes of the Main Types of Fintech Companies in Southeast Asia     (Survey of 75 Companies)    By Country    (%)    Myanmar  4    Malaysia  5    Philippines  8    Vietnam  9    Indonesia  12    Thailand  19    Singapore  43    Personal asset   management  4    Financial   business tools  5    Lending   8    Bitcoin/Blockchain  8    For personal  investors   11    Accounting   software  4    By Sector    Insurance   1    (%)    Investment  research  1    Electronic  settlements  43    Comparison of  financial products  15    Notes   The 75 fintech companies were selected on the basis of funds raised  crossborder business expansion  and other factors   (e.g.  market leadership  business model innovation  links with large corporations). They include both existing and emerging   companies.

Moreover  a significant number of compa  nies have located their headquarters in Singapore    which  although small  offers an attractive busi  ness environment  including its regulatory and tax   systems  while conducting their actual business   activities in other countries.    Second  if we categorize these companies in   terms of their field of business  nearly half (43%)   are involved in the electronic payment business    including mobile payment services(2). This is far   higher than the percentage engaged in the second   most common field of activity  financial product   comparison (15%)  and the thirdranked area  sup  port for individual investors (11%). When looking   at the global trend  less than 20% of companies   in the Fintech 250 list(3) compiled by CB Insights   (2017 edition) are engaged in the electronic pay  ment business(4)  reflecting the dispersal of compa  nies across a broader spectrum of fields. This sug  gests that the electronic payment business is lead  ing the growth of fintech in the Southeast Asian   market  which still lacks depth.     Crossaggregation  by  country  and  business   field confirms that while many electronic payment   companies are based in Singapore  such compa    nies are also scattered across other countries in the   region  indicating that companies are emerging   throughout Southeast Asia (Table 1). However    five out of the six companies engaged in bitcoin   or blockchainrelated activities are based in Sin  gapore  as are all four providers of financial and   business tools  which are primarily involved in   supporting financial institutions and professional   investors. This is because these companies must   satisfy relatively sophisticated financial needs or   require advanced financial technology. In contrast    only three fintech companies have their headquar  ters in Myanmar  and are involved in the elec  tronic payments business. This appears to reflect   the fact that diversified and sophisticated financial   needs have only just started to evolve in Myan  mar.     Key players in the fintech business in Southeast   Asia include existing financial institutions and   telecommunications companies  and also start  ups. Major financial institutions in each country   already provide mobile banking services  and tele  communications carriers as well as financial insti  tutions offer mobile payment services.     Fintech startups are becoming an increasingly   important presence. Although the aforementioned   list of Southeast Asia’s top 75 fintech companies     Table 1   Major Fintech Companies in Southeast Asia by Country and Field         Singapore  Thailand     Indonesia  Vietnam  Philippines  Malaysia  Myanmar     Total    (Companies)    Electronic settlements  (e.g.  mobile settlements)    Comparison of financial products    For personal investors    Bitcoin/Blockchain    Lending    Financial/business tools    Accounting software     Personal asset management    Insurance    Investment research    Total    12    2    4    5    3    4    1    0    0    1    5    2    3    0    1    0    1    1    1    0    32    14    3    2    1    0    2    0    1    0    0    0    9    4    1    0    0    0    0    0    2    0    0    7    3    2    0    1    0    0    0    0    0    0    6    2    2    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    4    3    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    0    3    32    11    8    6    6    4    3    3    1    1    75    Notes  The 75 fintech companies were selected on the basis of funds raised  crossborder business expansion  and other factors   (e.g.  market leadership  business model innovation  links with large corporations).

Examples include the Vietnambased company   M_Service  which provides mobile payment ser  vices under the “MoMo” brand (examined later in   this article)  Coins.ph  which has its headquarters   in the Philippines and provides payment services   using mobile devices and blockchain technology    and Funding Societies  a P2P lending company   based in Singapore. Some of these startups have   attracted  enough  interest  to  be  included  in  the   global Fintech 250 list.     According to statistics compiled by CB Insights   (Fig. 2)  Venture capital (VC) investment in fin  tech startups in Southeast Asia rose from $11   million in 2012 to $177 million in 2015  a 16fold   increase. The total dropped slightly to $158 mil  lion in 2016  but the growth trend has continued   in terms of the number of investments. The fact   that fintech has become a significant focus for   VC investment is confirmed by its share of total   technologyrelated investment over the past three   years (20142016)  which reached 9.2% in value   and 17.1% in volume. In 2016  VC investment in   fintech in Japan was similar to the level in South  east Asia at $154 million.     In addition to specialized fintech startups  a     Fig. 2   Fintech Investment by Venture     Capital in Southeast Asia    (US$ million)    (Volume)    180    160    140    120    100    80    60    40    20    0    80    70    60    50    40    30    20    10    0    2012    13    14    Value (left axis)    16    15  (Calendar years)  Volume (right axis)    Source  CB Insights  Southeast Asia Fintech Deals Hit a     New Record  March 17  2017    growing number of startups from other sectors   are also moving into the fintech business in South  east Asia. In the area of electronic payments  es  pecially mobile payments  startups from fields   ranging from ecommerce to online gaming and   ridehailing services have moved into the area. In   many countries  there is a now a proliferating ar  ray of schemes formed by startups in collabora  tion with existing financial institutions and tele  communications companies. Two companies that   are attracting attention in the area of electronic   payments are GoJek (head office  Indonesia) and   Grab (head office  Singapore)  both of which are   involved in the ridehailing business. We look at   their activities in greater detail later in this article.     (2)  The Significance of Fintech for     Southeast Asia    In  the  emerging  markets  of  Southeast Asia    there is ample scope for the development of fin  tech businesses. This is because of the big poten  tial of fintech to solve the many issues affecting   the financial environment in these countries.     In developed countries  the level of financial   services available is already relatively high  which   means that the improvements provided by fintech   solutions are generally only marginal(5). While fin  tech can enhance usability and yield cost savings   for financial institutions  so far it has not triggered   any dramatic changes to the financial industry.   Blockchain technology has that potential  but full  scale practical implementation is still some dis  tance in the future.     This contrasts with the situation in Southeast   Asia  where fintech has the potential to have a ma  jor impact on the financial sector. The region’s fi  nancial systems are underdeveloped  and in many   countries there is considerable room for improve  ment through the use of fintech. Various things   that were previously difficult can now be achieved   with fintech  and the benefits gained from these   new possibilities are substantial. Similar factors   explain the surge of fintech activity in China and   India.     5    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68Another  factor  that  affects  the  scope  for  the   emergence of fintech businesses is differences in   regulatory surroundings. In developed countries    financial activity is already subject to stringent   regulations  which tend to create barriers when   fintech startups try to introduce pioneering initia  tives. In contrast  many Southeast Asian countries   offer an environment in which fintech startups   can operate freely because their regulatory sys  tems are either relatively relaxed or have not yet   been established.     2.  The Role of Fintech in Finding     Solutions to Issues in South  east Asia     (1) Key Financial Issues    In this section  we will analyze problems affect  ing the financial environment in Southeast Asia.   Most of these issues are common to developing   and emerging countries.    First  there is a significant population of people   who have problems in terms of identify verifica  tion and credit checking  especially among low  income earners. From the perspective of banks    providing services to these people is both difficult   and expensive. A significant number of people   have no documents that can be used to verify their   identities   and  even  when  such  documents  are   available  their authenticity is questionable. For   example  in Indonesia all citizens over the age of   17 possess an ID card (Resident Identity Card)    but because of inadequacies in managing the sys  tem  fraud is not uncommon. For example  some   people possess multiple ID cards  while there are   occasional cases of forgeries(6). For this reason    banks need to ask for multiple identifying docu  ments and spend time verifying them.     In addition to the difficulty of identity verifica  tion  the challenge of assessing creditworthiness is   significant due to the inadequacies of credit infor  mation systems in Southeast Asia. Credit bureau   coverage (the larger of either public on private) is     6    50% in Thailand and Indonesia  40% in Vietnam    and only 10% in the Philippines (2016  Fig. 3).   Even in Singapore the coverage ratio is only 66%    reflecting the fact that its credit information agen  cy  Credit Bureau Singapore  was established rela  tively recently in 2002.     In addition  the financial needs of lowincome   earners  whether deposits or loans  tend to involve   small amounts  leading to higher operating costs   for the providers of these services. As a result    banks have been reluctant to offer financial ser  vices to lowincome individuals and have concen  trated their branch and ATM networks in urban ar  eas. They have also been charging account main  tenance fees  and have applied strict terms and   high interest rates to loans. Another factor is low   financial literacy among lowincome people. For   these reasons  formal financial services have not   been widely available to people in these countries.   In Southeast Asia  this situation has led to the fol  lowing problems.    (a)  Low Bank Account Holdings    The percentages of people with bank accounts   in Southeast Asian countries are just 31.8% in the   Philippines  and 30.0% in Vietnam. In other coun    Fig. 3   Credit Bureau Coverage Ratios     for Individuals in Southeast    Asia (2016)    (%)    100    80    60    40    20    0    Vietnam Philippines Indonesia Thailand Malaysia Singapore    Japan    (reference)    Public agencies    Private agencies    Notes   Percentages of adult population.  Source  World Bank  World Development Indicators    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68tries the ratios are below 30%  at 29.1% in Laos    25.6% in Myanmar  and 17.8% in Cambodia (all   figures from 2017  Table 2). There is also a dis  parity within the country  based on income level   and region. For example  in many countries the   percentages of lowincome and rural people with   bank accounts are lower than the national aver  ages.     There are various reasons for the low percent  age of people with bank accounts  including a lack   of nearby banks  the difficulty and bother of sub  mitting multiple identity verification documents    application procedure taking several weeks before   a bank account can be opened  and the cost of   bank account maintenance fees. In addition  many   people basically have no reason to open a bank   account. On a global basis  the number of people   without bank accounts is about 2 billion  or almost   40% of the world’s adult population (5.5 billion)(7).   Almost 300 million of these people live in nine   Southeast Asian countries(8).     (b)   Limited Access to Bank Loans and Credit     Cards     Inadequate credit information systems make it   difficult for banks to assess creditworthiness. For     Table 2   Percentages of People with   Bank Accounts in Southeast   Asian Countries    Bank account holding ratio     (aged over 15  %)  Upper   Lower   60% by   40% by   income  income    96.1  80.2  76.9  36.0  20.3  17.5  17.4  22.1  10.3    97.5    99.0  88.4  83.6  56.6  36.5  41.2  36.8  28.0  22.8    98.7    Rural    —  80.8  80.2  46.7  24.6  26.1  22.4  24.8  15.6    97.3    Singapore  Malaysia   Thailand   Indonesia   Vietnam   Philippines   Laos  Myanmar   Cambodia   Japan   (reference)    97.8  85.1  81.0  48.4  30.0  31.8  29.1  25.6  17.8    98.2    Number   of ATMs     per     100 000   adults    57.7  48.1  113.1  54.7  24.5  27.1  24.3  2.7  6.7    127.8    Notes  2017 figures. ATMs for Cambodia are 2014 figures.  Source  World Bank Global Findex Database  World De    velopment Indicators    this reason  banks find it difficult to provide loans   and credit cards not only to people who have no   bank accounts  but even to those who hold ac  counts. In Thailand  for instance  access to loans   is limited due to underdeveloped credit informa  tion systems  despite the fact that a relatively high   percentage (81.0%) of people have bank accounts.  The percentages of people with credit cards are   generally low in Southeast Asian countries. The   ratio is 48.9% in Singapore and 21.3% in Malay  sia  and below 10% in other key Southeast Asian   countries (Fig. 4). Since credit cards are issued   by banks  the low percentage of people with bank   accounts is responsible for the low percentage of   credit card holders. This situation has been aggra  vated by inadequacies in credit information sys  tems.     The inability to obtain financing from banks   when  needed  has  an  even  greater  impact  on   SMEs  microenterprises  and individual business   operators than on individuals  including missed   growth opportunities  and insufficient resilience to   overcome emergency situations. In a survey con  ducted by the International Finance Corporation   (IFC)(9)  as many as 40% of informal enterprises   (enterprises not registered with a local govern    Fig. 4   Percentages of People with     Credit Cards in Southeast Asia    (%)    70    60    50    40    30    20    10    0    Myanmar    Cambodia    Laos    Philippines    Indonesia    Vietnam    Thailand Malaysia Singapore Japan  (reference)    Notes  2017 figures.

Given the high   percentages of informal enterprises in these coun  tries  the negative effects of this situation are sig  nificant. Furthermore  60% of Indonesian SMEs   (5250 employees) stated that they needed finance   but were unable to access it  indicating that formal   as well as informal companies struggle to secure   finance from banks.     (c)  Low Utilization of Banking Services    Usage  levels  are  low  not  only  for  loans  and   credit cards  but also for other banking services    such as deposits and money transfers. Reasons for   this include poor access to physical banking fa  cilities  such as branches and ATMs  long lines at   bank counters  a lack of spare money to deposit in   accounts because of low incomes  and failure to   think of using banking services due to low finan  cial literacy rates. Indonesia has 54.7 ATMs per   100 000 adults  which is about 40% of Japan’s fig  ure (127.8). The totals for Vietnam (24.5) and the   Philippines (27.1) are just 20% of the figure for   Japan (see Table 2 above).     In the Philippines  for example  it takes an av  erage of 25.9 minutes to reach a bank  and the   waiting time after arrival averages 32.9 minutes.   Even with ATMs  the situation is similar. It takes   an average of 21.9 minutes to reach an ATM  and   the average time waiting in line is 16.5 minutes(10).   Of course  these times are averages. The Philip  pines has over 2 000 inhabited islands  and there   are many places where the nearest ATM is several   hours away by sea and overland. As the world’s   largest archipelago nation with over 8 000 inhabit  ed islands  Indonesia faces similar problems. Even   when an ATM is installed on an island  the cash   is replenished only on a weekly basis  resulting in   situations where the machines run out of money   less than three days after being refilled(11).     Many people from the Philippines  Indonesia    Vietnam  and other countries work overseas  cre  ating a need for workers to send money home to   their families  and for families to access that mon  ey. Despite these needs  the systems are incon  venient and costly for both senders and receivers   of these funds  either because people do not have   bank accounts  or because of the poor accessibility   of realworld facilities  and the problems involved   are  even  greater  than  those  affecting  domestic     Fig. 5   Fulfillment of Financing Needs of SMEs in Four Southeast Asian Countries    Malaysia    Indonesia    Philippines    Vietnam    (%)    100    (%)    100    (%)    100    (%)    100    80    60    40    20    0    80    60    40    20    0    80    60    40    20    0    80    60    40    20    0    Informal    SMEs    Informal    SMEs    Informal    SMEs    Informal    SMEs    Finance not needed    Finance needed but not accessible    Finance obtained but insufficient    Financing needs met    Notes  Informal enterprise  An enterprise not registered with a local government or tax department  or a selfemployed person.

Moreover  because of the high demand   for money transfers  these services are generally   provided by money transfer operators  who gener  ally charge high commissions.     (d)  CashBased Societies    People who do not have bank accounts or credit   cards must carry out money transactions in cash.   As discussed later in this article  cash transac  tions involve high handling costs and are an im  pediment to economic efficiency. In addition  the   difficulty of tracking cash transactions in cash  centered societies encourages the formation of un  derground economies and tends to have a negative   impact on economic monitoring and tax collec  tion.     In  Indonesia   the  Philippines  Vietnam  and   Thailand   over  60%  of  wages  are  paid  only  in   cash (Fig. 6). Concerning social security benefits    34.5% paid in cash in Indonesia  and 57.2% in the   Philippines (Fig. 7). Cash is the main medium for   facetoface payments  and even in ecommerce   there is limited use of credit cards  which are by   far the dominant payment method in Japan. Many   people do not have credit cards  and even those   that do refrain from using them because of secu    rity concerns. Cashondelivery is used for around   80% of ecommerce payments in Thailand and   almost 70% in Indonesia (Fig. 8)(12). In this way    cash is used to receive and pay money in everyday   life. According to one survey  over 70% of con  sumers in the Philippines and Indonesia frequently   use cash as a payment medium in their daily lives   (Fig. 9).    The Southeast Asian country that is making the   greatest progress toward a cashless society is Sin  gapore. For example  few people receive wages   or social security benefits in cash  and credit card   usage is relatively high. Even so  cash is still com  monly used in some places  such as hawker cen  ters and small retail outlets(13). That is partly why   Singapore’s ratio of cash flow balance to nominal   GDP is above the 9.03% average for countries in  cluded in the statistics(14) at 10.36% (2016)  indi  cating that its progress toward a cashless society   is not great from a global perspective(15).

An analysis of issues in   Southeast Asia’s financial environment provides   the following answers to this question.     First  fintech has transformed mobile devices    such as smartphones  into portable ATMs  allow  ing users to access basic financial services without   needing to go to bank branches or ATMs. In ad  dition  it is now possible to use mobile devices to   make payments  both online and facetoface. The   funds that can be used for these mobile payments   is no longer limited to money tied up in bank ac  counts and credit cards  thanks to the emergence   of electronic money  which can be used even by   people who have no bank accounts or credit cards.   With QR code payments(16)  accepting electronic   payments has become possible at low costs  mak  ing this method attractive to retailers that handle   smallticket items  such as street vendors.     At the same time  fintech has made it possible     RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68for financial service providers to acquire customer   information more easily and at a lower cost than   in the past. Identity verification processes can be   completed more quickly and no longer need to   be carried out at specific locations  thanks to new   methods such as image capturing of documents.   The use of biometrics is also leading to faster pro  cessing and cost reduction.    In  addition   financial  service  providers  have   greatly expanded the range of information that   they can acquire about both individuals and busi  nesses by tracing their digital footprints. For in  dividuals  the content of a person’s social media   posts   the  types  of  goods  they  buy  through  e  commerce  and the sites that they access can to   some extent be used to gauge their incomes and   personal characters  such as whether they are re  sponsible enough to repay loans punctiliously.   Digital footprints can also be used to assess the   credit worthiness of SMEs  which is usually diffi  cult if you rely on conventional means. The finan  cial position of an SME that has opened a store   on an ecommerce site can be ascertained from   various data such as sales figures and deposits to   and withdrawals from payment accounts. Meth  ods have been developed to allow rapid  lowcost   credit checking by automatically collecting and   analyzing vast amounts of data without human in  tervention.     One factor that has enabled Southeast Asia to   benefit from fintech in these ways has been the     growing availability of the Internet and smart  phones in the region. The Internet and social me  dia penetration rates have reached 53% and 47%   respectively  (Fig.  10)(17)   while  40%  of  people   have bank accounts and over 3.5% are credit card   holders(18). This situation is driving the continual   emergence of fintech businesses based on the use   of the Internet and smartphones in Southeast Asia.     (3)  Characteristics of Southeast Asian     Fintech Businesses    Some  of  the  fintech  companies  that  have   emerged in Southeast Asia are not much different   from their counterparts in developed countries.   However   there  are  also  many  businesses  with   characteristics that are unique to Southeast Asia   and emerging countries. Overall  the following   three characteristics can be observed.     First  many of these businesses are being estab  lished to solve problems. This reflects the numer  ous issues that the Southeast Asian financial sec  tor faces. Founders of fintech startups in this area   begin not by thinking about what they can achieve   with  fintech   but  by  identifying  problems  and   considering whether they can use fintech to solve   them.     Second  the underlying technologies and busi  ness  models  utilized  by  fintech  businesses  in     Fig. 10   Access to Digital Systems in Southeast Asia    Internet penetration rate    Social media penetration rate    Social media penetration rate     (via mobile devices)    53%    47%    42%    Source  We are Social Singapore  Digital in 2017  Global Overview  2017 (https //wearesocial.com/sg/)    11    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68Southeast Asia were generally not developed in   the region but were instead imported from devel  oped countries and China. Southeast Asian entre  preneurs and business owners identify financial   issues in the region and scour the world for fin  tech technologies and business models with the   potential to solve those issues. They then integrate   these technologies and business models into their   own business operations. From another point of   view  which relates back to the first characteris  tic of these businesses  fintech is fundamentally a   tool for solving problems and little importance is   attached to where the technology was originally   developed or whether it is simply a rehash of an  other technology.     Third  the fintech businesses in Southeast Asia   employ business models that combine both high  tech and lowtech methods. Countries normally   make progress gradually by introducing technol  ogy in stages  but because emerging and devel  oping  countries  have  fallen  behind  developed   countries  they are generally able to “leapfrog”   intermediate stages and achieve rapid evolution by   introducing the latest technology. While Southeast   Asian fintech companies adopt cuttingedge tech  nologies and business models  they also retain tra  ditional methods that seem unsuited to the digital   age from the perspective of developed countries.   For example  even in situations where mobile pay  ment services are available  those services cannot   be accessed fully from mobile devices and must   be complemented by ancillary services provided   by partners  such as small retailers in local com  munities. One reason for this is the fact digital   businesses and other types of businesses have not   evolved at the same pace in Southeast Asia  result  ing in gaps that do not exist in developed coun  tries. A good example is that many people have   smartphones but not bank accounts  a basic neces  sity from a developed country’s point of view.    In the following section we will look at fintech     businesses that illustrate these characteristics.     12    3.  Typical Fintech Businesses in     Southeast Asia    (1)  Mobile Payment Services    (a)  Typical Scheme     Mobile  payment  services  that  have  emerged   in Southeast Asia are basically the same as those   in  developed  countries.  However   one  feature   that is not common in developed countries is the   availability of measures that can be used by peo  ple who do not have bank accounts. As in other   emerging and developing countries  most mobile   phones are prepaid types  for which call charges   must be paid in advance. Users top up from bank   accounts  or in cash through local retail outlets   and convenience stores. Many of the mobile pay  ments have features that you can load electronic   money in the same way.     (b)  Case Study  MoMo(19)     MoMo is a  payment service in Vietnam oper  ated  by  the  startup  M_Service. The  company   launched the service in 2009 after perceiving a   business opportunity resulting from two factors.   First  most lowincome people were unable to ac  cess financial services. Second  smartphones were   rapidly becoming common in Vietnam  including   rural areas. Initially M_Service provided payment   services using SIM cards  but in 2014 it switched   to its own mobile payment app called “MoMo”(20).   The app can be used to load electronic money and   carry out various transactions relating to electron  ic payments  including money transfers between   individuals  utility charge payments  online shop  ping payments  and airline ticket reservations.     In response to the current environment in Viet  nam  M_Service’s target user base includes not   only people with bank accounts  but also people   with bank accounts but no local access to bank   branches or ATMs  people without bank accounts    and even people who do not own smartphones. To   meet the needs of this broad customer base  M_  Service has established a network of around 4 000   agents throughout Vietnam. These agents enable     RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68people who cannot go to bank branches or ATMs   as well as people without bank accounts to load   prepaid electronic money for use in mobile pay  ments  and to receive cash transferred to them.   Those who do not own smartphones can have the   agents use their mobile payment facilities to trans  fer funds or pay utility charges on their behalf.     Currently about onehalf of MoMo customers   are users of mobile payment services  while the   other half use agent services(21). The company’s   approach reflects the situation in Vietnam  where   customer needs for financial services cannot be   met  solely  through  mobile  devices. They  even   offer a feature that allows users to find the near  est agent using the GPS function on their smart  phones.     In rural areas of Vietnam  post offices play an   important  role  in  providing  financial  services    such as remittances and payments  for people who   do not have bank accounts. However  these servic  es are not entirely customerfriendly. For example     counters normally close at 5 p.m.  and remittances   take 34 days(22)(23). MoMo agents have longer op  erating hours than post offices  and remittances   reach recipients instantly.     In November 2017  M_Service entered into a   partnership with Vietnam Sun Corporation (Vina  sun)  a major local taxi operator(24) and announced   several new services. One of them is that  when   boarding a Vinasun taxi  the user will be able to   pay with electronic money through the MoMo app   by using the smartphone to scan the QR code pro  vided by the driver. Another is  passengers who   book Vinasun taxis using the Vinasun app will be   able to link with the MoMo app so that they can   pay automatically.     In  addition  to  service  content   M_Service   claims that it has made security a priority with   the MoMo system. It meets the PCI DSS(25) stan  dard and has also adopted layered security mea  sures  such as onetime password verification and   SSL(26).     (2)  Money Transfers Using Just a Mo    bile Phone Number     (a)  Typical Scheme     This service allows a recipient to link a bank ac  count number to his or her mobile phone number.   Thereafter money can be transferred to that per  son simply by entering the mobile phone number.   Services of this type are already being introduced   worldwide by telecommunications companies and   banks. What is unique about this kind of service in   Southeast Asia is the fact it is being promoted by   the governments of both Singapore and Thailand.   Their aim is to improve the convenience of credit   transfers and payments as part of efforts by gov  ernments  private sector financial institutions  and   other organizations to develop electronic payment   infrastructure in these countries.     (b)  Case Study  PayNow (Singapore)      PromptPay (Thailand)    Established under an initiative led by the Asso  ciation of Banks in Singapore and the Monetary   Authority of Singapore (MAS)  the PayNow bank   account  transfer  service  has  been  available  in   Singapore since July 2017. Using a smartphone    funds can be transferred almost instantly and with   no transfer fees by entering the mobile number or   national ID number that the recipient has linked   to his or her bank account. Currently the system   is limited to person to person (P2P) payments  but   there are plans to extend it to accommodate per  son to business (P2B) payments  including pay  ments to taxi operators  hawkers (street vendors)    and selfemployed people  and B2P payments    such as wages and insurance payments(27).     Thailand’s equivalent service  PromptPay  was   introduced even earlier  in January 2017  under   an initiative led by the Thai Banking Association   and Bank of Thailand  Thailand’s central bank.   Funds can be transferred via a smartphone  Inter  net banking  or an ATM by entering one of five   types of numbers  such as a mobile phone number   or national ID number(28). Transfers are free for   amounts up to 5 000 baht (about ¥17 000). Charg  es apply for larger amounts  but overall costs are     13    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68low(29). PromptPay was initially available for P2P   transfers   but  it  now  also  accommodates  B2B   transfers based on taxpayer (company) IDs. Fu  ture plans call for further expansion of the system   to include other types of payments  such as utility   charges.     By the end of August 2017  a month after the   launch of the service  the number of registered   PayNow users had exceeded 500 000(30). Given   Singapore’s population of 5.5 million  this figure   is indicative of steady growth. By October 2017    the number of registered PromptPay users had   reached  24  million   or  onethird  of Thailand’s   population (68 million)(31).     In  July  2017   MAS  and  Bank  of  Thailand   agreed to cooperate in the fintech area and are   now working toward the interlinkage of PayNow   and PromptPay. Once this is achieved  it will be   possible to transfer money between Singapore and   Thailand instantly and safely simply by entering   the other party’s mobile phone number(32).     (3)  Mobile International Remittance     Services    (a)  Typical Scheme    Many people in Southeast Asian countries  es  pecially the Philippines  work overseas. These   people  generally  remit  funds  each  month  to   their families in their home countries  primarily   through specialist money transfer operators such   as MoneyGram and Western Union. Many expatri  ate workers do not have bank accounts  and even   those that do are eager to avoid the high transfer   charges levied by banks(33). With money transfer   operators  transfers commonly involve timecon  suming manual processes  and it takes time for the   money to reach the recipients.  This situation has   recently led to the emergence of services that al  low people to remit money overseas easily and at   low prices using mobile devices.     (b)  Case Study  Toast (1)(34)    Toast (head office  Singapore) provides inter  national remittance services that allow Philippine     14    people working in other countries to send money   back home using mobile devices. The service is   currently available in Hong Kong and Singapore    but the company aims to increase the range of   countries in the future. The cofounder and CEO   is Aaron Siwoku from the United Kingdom. He   had the idea for the service after seeing Philippine   women waiting in long lines to send money home   and noticing that they all had smartphones in their   hands(35).     The person making the remittance loads funds   though a smartphone app and then completes the   transfer process. There are multiple ways to load   funds  including transfers from a bank account.   Users can also load cash at affiliated stores. To use   this method  the person wishing to make a remit  tance first scans identification documents into his   or her mobile phone and then goes to an affiliated   store to hand over the cash. This saves time  since   confirmation of identity  which previously had to   be carried out in the store  can now be completed   in advance on a smartphone. Another advantage of   this system is that it is based on a familiar remit  tance method and is therefore easy for users to ac  cept(36). A method that would allow the entire pro  cess to be completed on a mobile device would be   more convenient  but there is a risk that existing   customers would not use such a service because   of the psychological resistance to new ways of do  ing things.     Recipients in the Phlippines can choose from   three  methods  for  receiving  remittances. They   can have the money sent to the Toast app or their   bank account  or obtain cash at an affiliated retail   outlet. This means that the service can be used   even if neither the remitter nor recipient has a   bank account. The service fee is set low. There is   no charge for remittances from Hong Kong to the   Philippines using the Toast App  while a charge   of HKD15 (about USD2) is levied when funds   are transferred to a bank account  and there is a   HKD19 (about USD2.4) charge for transfers to an   affiliated retail outlet.     Toast plans to use data accumulated through its   remittance services to start a lending business for   overseas workers. By monitoring monthly remit  tance amounts  the company can estimate the in    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68comes of overseas workers to some extent as the   basis for determining their creditworthiness(37).     (4)  Lending Services Based on the     Use of Alternative Data    (a)  Typical Scheme     Credit screening schemes based on the use of   digital footprints as alternative data have emerged   in Southeast Asia. Credit providers have devel  oped these schemes themselves or purchased them   from  other  sources. The  fact  that  credit  is  not   widely available in Southeast Asia is attributable   in large part to the inadequacy of credit informa  tion systems  which makes it difficult to assess the   creditworthiness of potential borrowers. By us  ing alternative data as the basis for credit checks    lenders are able to target new borrowers who were   previously overlooked due to the lack of credit   histories. In addition to the benefits for borrowers    this approach is also expected to allow credit pro  viders to expand their customer bases.     (b)  Case Study  LenddoScore(38)    Lenddo (head office  Singapore) provides per  sonal credit scores (“LenddoScore”) and identity   verification (“Lenndo Verification”) services to or  ganizations such as banks  microfinance provid  ers  and credit card companies. The credit score   service is based on the perception that there are   a certain number of people who are creditwor  thy despite having no data registered with credit   information agencies  and that the repayment ca  pacity and commitment of such people can be as  certained to some extent by analyzing their digital   footprints  since they generally own smartphones.   Lenddo launched a lending business in the Phil  ippines in 2011 and subsequently expanded into   other countries  including Colombia and Mexico.   However  it sold the lending business in 2015 and   has since specialized in providing services to third   parties. It currently offers its services in over 15   countries.     In addition to data provided by credit bureaus    Lenndo also collects and analyses alternative data     with the consent of loan applicants. Using this   data  it calculates a credit score (11 000  where a   higher score indicates a higher credit rating) us  ing its own proprietary method  and supplies this   information to banks and other organizations. The   types of data gathered include smartphone usage   data  social media data  and psychometric data   (Fig. 11). For example  social media data gath  ered include pages accessed on Facebook  Linke  dIn  Twitter  and the like  access frequencies  the   number of friends  and the content of messages.   If credit bureaus have data  those are also incor  porated.  Based  on  12 000  data  items  per  case    Lenddo calculates a score using an AI prediction   algorithm. The process takes just three minutes.     Digital footprints are also used for the identify   verification service  which can be completed in   three seconds. Lenddo boasts that the system is   highly accurate. Other advertised benefits include   the  fact  that  lenders  can  reduce  the  amount  of   documentation collected from customers  and the   number of credit checks that need to be carried   out by human staff.

Mobile Payment Trends in     Southeast Asia    (1)  Chinese Companies Making In    roads    As described earlier in this article  mobile pay  ment services are leading the fintech sector in   Southeast Asia. Many companies have already   moved into this area. In Vietnam  for example    by the start of 2017  the number of nonbanks li  censed  to  provide  payment  services   including   mobile payment services  had reached 16(39). The   result is a freeforall battle for business in which   financial institutions are also involved. Similar   situations  are  emerging  in  other  countries   al  beit with some variation. No clear winners have   so far emerged. The Chinese companies Alibaba   and Tencent are sooner or later expected to step   up their efforts to establish inroads into this area.   GoJek and Grab  which are powerful ridehailing   startups  are meanwhile moving to take control of   general electronic payment services in Southeast   Asia. This section will analyze developments sur  rounding the mobile payment business.     Both Alibaba and Tencent are starting to make   significant  inroads  into  the  Internet  sector  in     Southeast Asia. Alibaba  has  acquired  Lazada    the region’s biggest ecommerce site  and Red  Mart  a major Lazadabased online seller of food   and household goods in Singapore. Alibaba has   also invested in Tokopedia  Indonesia’s biggest e  commerce site. Through moves such as these  it   has established a major presence in the Southeast   Asian ecommerce market (Table 4).     Tencent has invested in Southeast Asia’s biggest   Internet company Sea (formerly Garena)  which   operates online games and other services  VNG    which is Vietnam’s biggest Internet company  and   GoJek. Other moves include the acquisition of   Sanook Online  the biggest online portal in Thai  land  and investment in Ookbee  a major Thai dig  ital content platform provider.     Both Alibaba  and Tencent  are  also  steadily   building a presence in the payment area in South  east Asia. Both companies in China enhanced their   understanding of consumers by collecting and an  alyzing their customers’ payment data. They then   used this knowledge not only to strengthen their   existing  businesses   but  also  to  create  founda  tions for the development of new businesses. The   natural approach for them would be to attempt to   replicate this approach in Southeast Asia. Alibaba   has taken the lead and is working to make use of   Alipay  an ecommerce site that it has acquired  in     16    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68Table 4   Main Activities of Alibaba in Southeast Asia    May 2014    Alibaba agrees to buy 10.35% of postal giant Singapore Post and enter into a strategic partnership to improve   delivery networks for items sold on its platform.

In addition to this transition     from online payments to facetoface payments    electronic  payment  services  in  Southeast Asia   could also expand into mobile payment services   through a transition from facetoface payments to   online payments. As noted earlier in this article    this is because the scale of online payments is still   small  and services that allow mobile payments to   be used in facetoface transactions are being in  troduced one after another.     There has been particular interest in the mobile   payment services provided by the ridehailing ser  vice companies GoJek and Grab. GoJek is based   in  Indonesia   Southeast Asia’s  biggest  country   in terms of population  while Grab has its head  quarters in Malaysia and is expanding its business     17    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68operations throughout Southeast Asia. Both have   grown to the extent that they now rank among the   few “unicorns” (unlisted companies with market   valuations over $1 billion) in Southeast Asia. Both   companies provide taxi and biketaxi services    and it is not surprising that facetoface payments   for these services would lead to the use of mobile   payments by consumers. Developments surround  ing these two companies are outlined below.     (a)  GoJek    Founded in Indonesia in 2010  GoJek began   to provide the biketaxi ridehailing app GoJek   in Jakarta in 2015. GoJek’s services have be  come extremely popular  in part because people   in Jakarta use biketaxis frequently because of the   city’s underdeveloped public transport systems   and congested streets. Since then the company has   extended its service areas and expanded its range   of services  initially as a way of providing a useful   way for drivers to use their free time. Currently it   offers a wide variety of services  including food   deliveries from restaurants (GoFood)  food deliv  eries from stores (GoMart)  home cleaning (Go  Clean)  and masseur services at the customer’s lo  cation (GoMassage). One of those services is the   GoPay electronic payment system.    By  downloading  the  GoPay  app  onto  their   smartphones  users can pay for GoJek services   with  credit  loaded  into  the  app.  Credit  can  be   loaded through transfers from bank accounts  or   deposits at ATMs. To allow people who do not   have bank accounts to use the services  cash can   also be paid to GoJek drivers. In addition to the   convenience  of  not  needing  to  engage  in  cash   transactions by the side of road after using a bike  taxi  the system also matches conditions in Indo  nesia  where only a small percentage of people   have bank accounts. Usage has expanded rapidly   since it first became available in 2016  and cur  rently 5060% of GoJek rides are paid for using   GoPay(40). Moreover  GoPay is now the fourth   most commonly used form of electronic money in   Indonesia(41).     GoJek aims to promote the use of  GoPay not   only for payments for its own services  but also   for electronic payments in general in Indonesia.     18    Users can already use GoPay credit to make pay  ments in affiliated stores  and they can transfer   money to other users free of charge simply by en  tering a telephone number. In addition  credit can   be cashed at affiliated banks. In December 2017    GoJek acquired three fintech companies(42) with   the aim of expanding the areas in which GoPay   can be used(43).     According to figures released by the company    GoJek has 900 000 contracted drivers. This num  ber is far larger than the number of bank branches   (25 000) and ATMs (103 000) in Indonesia. The   company’s founder and CEO  Nadiem Makarim    recently said that GoJek will use its drivers as   financial access points to reach a wide range of   consumers  including people who have previously   not been able to use financial services(44). GoJek   aims to become a leading player in electronic pay  ments in Indonesia and across Southeast Asia.   During an interview  GoJek’s President Andre   Soelistyo  said  that  his  company’s  goal  was  to   build GoPay’s presence in Southeast Asia to the   same level as Alipay and WeChatPay in China(45).     (b)  Grab     Grab was established in Malaysia in 2012 as a   startup providing the GrabTaxi taxi hailing ser  vice. It has since relocated its headquarters to Sin  gapore. While GoJek has specialized in Indone  sia  Grab provides its services not only Singapore   and Malaysia  but also in Indonesia  Thailand    Vietnam  the Philippines  Myanmar  and Cam  bodia. It has gradually expanded the scope of its   services  which include “GrabCar ” a ridesharing   system for private cars  and “GrabHitch ” a system   that allows people to hitch rides with people going   in the same direction. Like GoJek  its services   also include an electronic payment system called   “Grabpay.”     GrabPay  is  used  in  basically  the  same  way   as GoPay. Initially it was necessary to link the   GrabPay smartphone app to a credit card in order   to load credit  but other methods have since been   added  including deposits through bank ATMs  In  ternet banking  and affiliated convenience stores.   As a result  the system can now be used by people   who do not have credit cards or bank accounts. In     RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68Singapore  over 75% of Grab service users pay   through GrabPay(46).     Like GoJek  Grab wants its GrabPay system be   used not only to pay for its own services  but for   a wide range of other purposes throughout South  east Asia. In a press release  the company’s co  founder  Tan Hooi Ling said that Grab wants to   be the region’s leading payments platform(47). The   company plans to focus initially on expanding the   use of GrabPay in small retail outlets  which cur  rently operate primarily on a cash basis  followed   by expansion into the online payment area(48). As   part of this strategy  it has been working since No  vember 2017 to promote GrabPay to restaurants   and hawkers (street vendors) in Singapore.     In 2017  Grab acquired Kudo  an Indonesian   startup established in 2014 to operate an online  tooffline  (O2O)  platform.  Kudo  provides  ser  vices that allow people without bank accounts to   make online purchases or buy mobile phone credit   through  the  company’s  agents(49).  By  purchas  ing Kudo  Grab has acquired a network of over   500 000 agents in 500 cities and towns in Indo  nesia. It plans to use this network to enhance the   convenience of GrabPay  including the expansion   of locations where credit can be loaded  and to   capture ecommerce payment business in Indone  sia. Longerterm  it also aims to handle insurance   and consumer loans through Kudo(50)(51).    (3)  Expanding Use through Multiple     Channels    Why are providers of ridehailing apps play  ing such a prominent role in the mobile payment   business in Southeast Asia? Possible reasons in  clude the fact that taxis and biketaxis are familiar   modes of transport for the public  and both GoJek   and Grab have high overall shares of the markets   in which they have rolled out their services. An   incentive for frequent users is the availability of a   simple way to make cashless payments instead of   muddling with cash.     The mobile payment systems provided by Go  Jek and Grab began for use with their own servic    es  but the range in which the systems can be used   has gradually expanded. The companies hope that   people who get used to paying for taxi or biketaxi   rides with GoPay or GrabPay will also use the   systems for other payments  including online pay  ments. Going forward  they want to play a leading   role in the development of cashless payments and   financial inclusiveness in Southeast Asia.     From these perspectives  we can probably ex  pect to see a gradual increase in the use of mobile   payments in Southeast Asia  both through the use   of  mobile  payments  for  ecommerce   and  also   through use of mobile payments for facetoface   payments when using ridehailing services.     5.  Southeast Asian Governments’     Expectations toward Fintech    (1)  Fintech Promotion Measures (Fo    cused on Singapore)    Southeast Asian governments have taken a keen   interest in the emergence of various fintech busi  nesses in the region. Recognizing the potential of   fintech to change the face of finance  governments   are eager to ensure its sound development  so that   it leads to the improvement and advancement of   their countries’ finance systems. Governments in   each country are implementing a range of mea  sures  including the formulation of policies  the   establishment of specialist fintech units within   financial  regulatory  and  supervisory  agencies    and the introduction of regulatory sandboxes(52)   (Table 5).     Singapore has shown the greatest enthusiasm   for the promotion of fintech. It hopes that fintech   will (1) solve issues  (2) provide indirect support   for Singapore’s evolution as a smart nation  and (3)   maintain and strengthen Singapore’s status as an   international financial center.     Concerning the first of these goals  while Sin  gapore already has a fully developed financial sys  tem  there are still issues that need to be solved.   The government is exploring the potential to use     19    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68Table 5   FintechRelated Measures in Key Southeast Asian Countries    Malaysia     Dec. 2011    Formulation of the Financial Sector Blueprint 2020 as a vision for financial sector in 2020  •     Increase in the number of electronic payments per person from 44 in 2010 to 200    Feb. 2015    Announcement of regulations for investmenttype crowd funding by Securities Commission Malaysia    April 2016    Announcement of regulations for P2P lending by Securities Commission Malaysia    June 2016    Establishment of the Financial Technology Enabler Group (FTEG) within the Malaysian central bank  •   •  Formulation and strengthening of regulatory policies to promote innovation in the financial sector     Support for innovation that contributes to improvement in the quality  efficiency  and accessibility of financial services    Oct. 2016    Introduction of a regulatory sandbox by FTEG    Thailand     May 2015    Announcement of regulations relating to crowd funding by the Securities and Exchange Commission of Thailand    Dec. 2015    Approval of an epayment master plan by the Thai cabinet and Ministry of Finance     2016     Progressive introduction of regulatory sandboxes for securities  derivatives  KYC  etc.  by the Securities and Exchange   Commission of Thailand    Dec. 2016    Introduction of regulatory sandboxes by Bank of Thailand    Jan. 2017    Launch of the PromptPay C2C electronic money transfer service     May 2017    Introduction of regulatory sandboxes by the Thai Insurance Commission    Indonesia     Aug. 2014    Nov. 2016    Launch of the “National NonCash Movement” by Bank Negara Indonesia  •  An initiative to encourage people to use noncash payment methods    Establishment of a specialist unit (the Fintech Office) within Bank Negara Indonesia  •  Risk assessment and mitigation  fintechrelated surveys    Nov. 2016    Introduction of regulatory sandboxes by Bank Negara Indonesia    Dec. 2016    June 2017    Philippines    Dec. 2015    Jan. 2017    Feb. 2017    Announcement of P2P lending regulations by the Financial Services Authority  •     Introduction of registration system     Establishment of the FinTech Advisory Forum by the Financial Services Authority  •  Establishment of strategic direction for the development of the fintech industry     Announcement of a framework for a “National Retail Payment System” by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas  •  A framework of standards for retail payments in the Philippines  and management regulations and policies  •  Designed to promote a society that is less dependent on cash    Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas approval for banks to provide services to their customers through cash agencies (Circular   940)    Announcement by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas of regulations concerning money transfers by nonbanks  including   emoney issuers  and money transfer platform providers (Circular 942)    Feb. 2017    Announcement by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas of regulations concerning virtual currencies (Circular 944)    March 2017 Announcement by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas of regulations to allow the use of technology instead of facetoface     contacts for KYC processes when banks commence transactions with new customers (Circular 950)    March 2017 Announcement by Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas of guidelines concerning social media risk management (Circular 949)    Vietnam     Dec. 2014    Recognition of ewallets as payment services by the State Bank of Vietnam (Circular 39)    Jan. 2017    Installation of card readers in all supermarkets  shopping malls  and retail stores    Announcement by the Vietnamese government of a plan to make Vietnam cashless by 2020  •   •  70% of water  electric power and telecommunications utilities accepting card payments or online payments  •     Increase in the percentage of the 15andolder population with bank accounts to at least 70%    March 2017 Establishment of the SBV Steering Committee on FinTech by the State Bank of Vietnam  •  Acceleration of the development of fintech companies under government guidelines     Notes   See Table 6 and 7 for information about policies in Singapore.

For ex  ample  it aims to use blockchain technology to   improve crossborder payment mechanisms time  wise and costwise compared to the existing meth  ods  through correspondent banks. In addition    the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) and   the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) are   jointly implementing a blockchainbased digitali  zation project to improve the efficiency of trade fi  nance  which at present still involves the exchange   of large amounts of paper documents.     In relation to the second point  Singapore has   made the “Smart Nation” concept a national strat  egy for the realization of its goal of becoming a   knowledge and innovationintensive economy.   Singapore is already a highincome country. The   only  way  that  it  can  maintain  its  position  as  a   frontrunner in the world economy is to open up   paths to industrial advancement and economic de  velopment through its own innovation initiatives.   Obviously fintech is vital to this strategy  since   IT will play a vital role in both finance and finan  cial innovation in a knowledge and innovation  intensive economy. MAS believes that to become   a “Smart Nation” Singapore also needs to become   a “Smart Financial Centre.” It sees fintech as the   key to the realization of the “Smart Financial Cen  tre” concept  which it introduced in 2015.     Concerning the third point  the financial sector   is one of the most important industries. In 2016 it   accounted for 13.1% of Singapore’s GDP. Main  taining and improving the industry’s international   competitiveness and the ability as a financial cen  ter to attract business from financial institutions   around the world have consistently been national   priorities for Singapore. To achieve these goals    Singapore needs to stay at the cutting edge of fi  nance  and to reap the benefits of innovation as   quickly as possible.     These expectations are reflected in the Singa  porean government’s efforts to promote fintech    which are based on two approaches. First  the gov  ernment is striving to optimize fintechrelated reg  ulations. According to the MAS  the requirements   for fintech regulation are to maintain the stability   of the financial system and the soundness of key   players  and to protect consumer interests  while     also helping to accelerate financial innovation(53).   Table 6 summarizes the main fintech regulations   that have been introduced from these perspectives.   MAS has placed particular emphasis on cyber se  curity  and it has introduced a variety of measures   based on its view that to promote fintech  it will   be necessary to build reliability by ensuring secu  rity. In 2017  MAS established the Cyber Security   Advisory Panel and created the post of Chief Cy  ber Security Officer within its organization.     Second  Singapore is developing infrastructure   to encourage the use of fintech. It is creating soil   for an ecosystem that will continually create fin  tech innovations and allow them to grow bigger.   To ensure that the full benefit of these products   can be realized  the government is also creating   common fintech business standards and support  ing fintech interoperability. The main infrastruc  ture elements created so far are listed in Table 7.     Just as Singapore is enthusiastically promoting   fintech  other countries are also showing strong   interest. They have particularly strong expecta  tions toward the potential of fintech to improve fi  nancial inclusion and create a cashless society. We   will now look at these two aspects.    (2)  Improving Financial Inclusion     Lowincome and lowermiddleincome coun  tries in Southeast Asia have problems relating to   financial inclusion(54)  specifically the fact that a   significant number of people are unable to access   financial services. Financial inclusion is a key pol  icy priority in these countries because of its poten  tial to contribute to poverty eradication and eco  nomic development. A variety of initiatives have   been implemented over many years. Even in Thai  land  a middleincome country where a relatively   high percentage of its people have bank accounts    bank loans and insurance are not widely available.   Because of this the government is taking a keen   interest in financial inclusion(55). While Singapore   has largely achieved financial inclusion  its gov  ernment sees this as a problem for Southeast Asia   as a whole.     21    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68Table 6   Main Fintech Regulations Introduced by the Monetary Authority of      Singapore (MAS)    Payments     •   Payment  regulations   which  were  previously  divided  into  two  categories  according  to  the  type  of  payment     business (Note) have been integrated into activitybased regulations based on a single license.    •   This step was taken in response to fintechrelated ambiguities and complexities concerning payment business     categories.

In  donesia and the Philippines have adopted national   strategies for financial inclusion  while Myanmar   has drawn up a financial inclusion roadmap. In  donesia’s strategy highlights the use of ICT  while   the Philippines is focusing on the power of tech  nology. Myanmar’s roadmap points to the poten  tial of mobile devices (Table 8).     While Vietnam has not formulated a national   strategy  the Deputy Governor of its central bank   has acknowledged the role of fintech  saying that   “digital technology will help banks accelerate fi  nancial inclusion (56).”     In fact  many of the fintech services that have   emerged in Southeast Asia can lead to greater fi  nancial inclusion. As illustrated by the previously    mentioned examples  even people without credit   cards or bank accounts are able to benefit from   various financial services by using mobile devic  es. The use of mobile payments can also encour  age people to set up bank accounts. This expecta  tion has been heightened by the success of the M  Pesa mobile money transfer service in Kenya. The   spread of that system has led to a major improve  ment in financial inclusion in Kenya(57).     Mobile overseas money transfer services offer   a way to send money abroad at lower costs than     traditional methods. This reduces the financial   burden on people working overseas and their fam  ilies. Also the increase in lending based on alter  native data is improving access to loans for certain   segments that were previously unable to obtain   finance. This means  for example  that SMEs will   be able to free themselves from a handtomouth   existence  by  obtaining  loans  to  buy  the  latest   equipment so that they can increase their earnings.   Awareness of these benefits is prompting gov  ernments  to  promote  fintech  while  also  taking   steps to ensure that fintech contributes to financial   inclusion. In addition to initiatives to improve the   usability of services  such as encouraging service   providers to achieve interoperability between dif  ferent mobile payment platforms  governments are   also ensuring that users can access financial ser  vices safely through supervision  regulation  and   the prosecution of fraud. Other government initia  tives include educational activities to enable users   to make the best use of financial services.     Southeast Asian countries are looking closely   at financial inclusion policies in India. The Sin  gapore FinTech Festival hosted by the MAS in   November 2017 included a session on India  and   the  Indian  Minister  of  Finance  was  one  of  the   speakers.

This   must remain a priority for the government.”    “Mobile devices are expected to play a greater role in providing financial services to the people.”    Source  Compiled by JRI from government releases in each country    23    RIM   Pacific Business and Industries Vol. XVIII  2018 No. 68national ID system called “Aadhaar”(58). India has   also launched the Pradhan Mantri Jan Dhan Yoja  na (PMJDY)  a project to ensure that every citizen   has a bank account(59). Under this project  banks   have agreed to provide savings accounts without   charging account maintenance fees. By the end   of 2017  just over three years since the launch of   the project in 2014  300 million new accounts had   been created(60).     (3)  Creating a Cashless Environment     In  addition  to  financial  inclusion   Southeast   Asian governments also see fintech as a way to   create a cashless environment (specifically  the   reduction of the percentage of payments made in   cash). What are the advantages of cashless pay  ments? The Japanese government  which is also   working  to  create  a  cashless  environment   has   highlighted  the  following  advantages(61).  First    business operators spend less time handling cash.   Second  there are convenience and safety benefits    including a reduced need for consumers and for  eign tourists to withdraw cash. Third  government   administration processes involving the receipt of   levies or the payment of benefits can be more ef  ficient(62). Many Southeast Asian countries have   greater expectations toward these advantages than   Japan.  Because  crime  rates  are  higher  than  in   Japan  the handling or transportation of cash in  volves greater risks for financial institutions  busi  nesses  and consumers  and the costs are substan  tial. Furthermore  bank branch and ATM networks   are less extensive than in Japan  with the result   that the withdrawal of cash from a bank account   is more troublesome. Another problem with cash   is the difficulty of tracing flows of money and   income. This encourages the formation of an un  derground economy with adverse effects in such   areas as economic monitoring and tax collection.     The creation of a cashless environment is also   highly significant from the viewpoint of financial   inclusion. If money is paid and received in cash    individuals will feel little need to have bank ac  counts  with the result that the percentage of peo    24    ple with bank accounts will remain low. This cre  ates a vicious circle  since it becomes impossible   to move away from a situation in which all trans  actions are handled in cash  which also hinders   progress toward financial inclusion.     For this reason  the Malaysian government  for   example  is promoting electronic payments as a   method that is safe and more costefficient than   money transfers based on paper (cash)  and as an   important tool for improving Malaysia’s economic   efficiency and productivity and accelerating eco  nomic growth(63). The Thai government similarly   believes that electronic payments will bring wide  ranging benefits to the people  businesses  and the   government (Fig. 12) and is implementing five   projects  including the aforementioned PromptPay   system (Fig. 13).     Some recent developments relating to fintech   businesses in Southeast Asia are contributing to   the creation of a cashless environment. Mobile   payments in particular have the potential to en  courage the use of cashless payments in both face  toface transactions and ecommerce  while also   reducing the need for exchanges of cash  which   occur frequently at present.     Conclusions    This article examined the developments of fin  tech in Southeast Asia. There are many issues re  lated to finance in Southeast Asia that are viewed   by the private sector as business opportunities.

Second  regulation should be applied   when risks emerge or exceed a certain level  but the   weight of the regulation must be proportionate to the   risk. Third  regulation must both mitigate risks and pre  vent the emergence of new risks.

World Bank website  http //www.worldbank.org/  en/topic/financialinclusion/overview  In  societies  where  financial  inclusion  has  not  been   achieved  individuals lack suitable means to build as  sets in the form of deposits. Because they are unable to   access financial products at reasonable prices  they are   forced to compromise by borrowing money from infor  mal sources at high interest rates  or by paying excessive   money transfer commissions. They lack deposits and   insurance to provide a buffer for unforeseen events  such   as illness  injury  or unemployment.
