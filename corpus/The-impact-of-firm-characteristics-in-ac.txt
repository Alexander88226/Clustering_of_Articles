However  these  contributions  are  not  effectively harnessed in Tanzania. The main challenge limiting the sector to contribute fully is a shortage of finance. This study examines the impact of firm characteristics in access to debt financing by Tanzanian SMEs. The equation specified  access  to  finance  as  dependent  variable  while  firm  characteristics  as  independent  variable.  Data collection  was  conducted  through  selfadministered  questionnaire  in  a  survey  of  163  Tanzanian  firms.  The statistical  analysis  of  data  involved  Pearson  correlation  and  logistic  regression  to  establish  the  association between dependent and independent variables. The results indicate that firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s location industry size business information  age  incorporation  and  collateral  influence  access  to  debt  finance.  The  study  recommends  that Tanzanian SME operators should maintain attractive firm attributes to stimulate lenders to extend debt financing to their investments.     Keywords firm characteristics debt financing small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) 1. Introduction   The Small and Mediumsized Enterprise (SME) sector performs a significant roles worldwide (Abor et al. 2008). SMEs have a potential contribution socially and economically by contributing noticeably in job creation revenue creation  innovations  as  well  as  a  catalyst  for  urban  and  rural  area\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  growth  (Hallberg  2000;  OECD  2004; Williams  2006;  Fatoki  &  Asah  2011).  Most  of  the  industrialized  countries  over  98%  of  all  manufacturing sector firms originate from the SMEs sector and they are main employment providers (Sanusi 2003). The SME sector employs more than 22% of the productive labor force in the developing countries (Kayanula et al. 2000).   In  Tanzania  the  government  has  been  attracted  by  SMEs  to  solve  unemployment  problem  which  recently  is spreading across the country. More than 700000 job seekers enter the Tanzanian labor market annually but only 40000 new jobs are created annually within formal sector therefore those who unable to find jobs in the formal sector end up in the informal sector whereby SMEs dominate (Olomi 2005). Despite of SMEs contributions in the  county\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  job  creation  their  continuing  growth  and  strengthens  has  been  compromised  by  the  persistent limitations on their access to financing from formalsector. The finance gap exists in the Tanzanian SME sector deteriorate SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 productivity performance and contributions to the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy.       Tanzania  government  by  recognizing  the  importance  of  SMEs  in  economic  development  has  set  up  various programs  (Note  1)  aimed  at  developing  the  SME  sector.  The  National  Strategy  for  Growth  and  Poverty Reduction  (NSGPR  I  &  II)  famous  known  as  MKUKUTA  I  &  II  in  Swahili  as  a  medium  plan  towards  the eradication of poverty in the country by the year 2025. The policy categorizes agricultural sector and informal business sectors as the main segments in which majority of disadvantaged people generates their income. The policy tempts to speed up growth in the economic activities in which the poor societies are dominant and those sectors  which  are  left  behind  economically  in  Tanzania.  In  tackling  the  issue  the  Property  and  Business Formalization  Program  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfamous  as  MKURABITA  in  Swahili\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  was  established  to  initiate  and  facilitate formalization of informal property and business entities in order to enhance their access to services enjoyed in the  formal  sector  and  thus  speed  up  their  growth  ability  to  compete  and  survive  within  Tanzanian  business environment. Practically the Formalization Program seeks to establish an integrated system of property rights and business  rules  as  a basis  of  transition of  the  urban periurban  and  rural  areas  into  a  market  that  enables  108 \\x0cwww.ccsenet.org/ijbm International Journal of Business and Management Vol. 7 No. 24; 2012 Tanzanians to have equal opportunities in using their assets to acquire credit services from lenders. Consequently the program intends to steadily transform informal sector to an acceptable national limit to which the informal sector can be able to enjoy the benefits that are enjoyed by formal sector including easy access to credit facilities. Studies of the informal sector in Tanzania indicate that more than 90% of properties and business activities in the country  operate  in  the  sector.  By  implication  policies  and  strategies  targeting  economic  growth  and  poverty reduction in Tanzania should fundamentally deal with activities in the informal sector (Note 2). However these strategies and programs still unattainable SME sector still vulnerable and very few manage to survive due to shortage of finance. Pretorius and Shaw (2004) observed that accessibility to external finance is essential to solve shortage of SMEs cash  flows.  Financing  is  required  for  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  to  set  up  and  enlarge  their  business  operations  new  product development research and development human resource development and acquirement of uptodate production equipments  and  technology.  Most  of  SMEs  rely  on  internal  finance  (Note  3)  since  they  can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  afford  external finance easily only prioritized source become internal finance but still internal finance is inadequate for SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 development  and  profitability.  Most  SMEs  failures  to  access  debt  financing  result  into  an  inadequate  capital structure.   DemirqucKunt et al. (2006) pointed out that the main source of external financing for SMEs is equity and debt. Shane (2008) observed that external equity from stock exchange (capital markets) usually never exists for SMEs. Majed et al. (2010) and Sorooshian et al. (2010) evidenced that firm characteristics (Note 4) have an impact on capital structure and performance of SMEs. Firm characteristics include attributes such as firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s location firm industry firm size firm age firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legal status and the availability of collateral and business information.   The initial capital and expansion capital fund for Tanzanian SMEs has been a perpetual problem in even though the  government  still  intending  to  empower  the  sector.  Lending  financial  institutions  have  the  capacity  to  pull their financial resources together to meet SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 credit needs but still they are unwilling to take part. Finance gap still exists between the supply capabilities of financing sources and the demanding needs for capital to SMEs. This study intends to create a bridge to impact accessibility of finance to Tanzanian SMEs.     2. Objective of the Study The SME sector is an engine of economic growth of many economies in developing and developed countries as it plays a major role in job creation competition economic enthusiasm and innovation. The sector stimulates the entrepreneurial fortitude and the dissemination of expertise. The main recognized achievement aspect for any SMEs is to gain adequate access to external sources of financing (Le Venkatesh & Nguyen 2006). The objective of this study is to examine empirically the impact firm characteristics on access to finance by Tanzanian SMEs. 3. Literature Review 3.1 Theoretical Framework The capital structure is described as the mix of debt and equity that a firm uses to finance its operations (Gitman 2003; Brealey el at. 2008). The original hypothesis of capital structure originated from the ModiglianiMiller theorem (MM theory) the study argued that the value of the firm is irrelevant in financing decisions in a perfect market  (Modigliani  and  Miller  1958 1963).  The  theory  lacks  applicability  in  the  real  world  since  the  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value is relevant in financing decisions because of agency costs bankruptcy costs information asymmetry and tax components that impact firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital structure. The benefit to employ debt in a firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital structure exists as the interest on debt is taxdeductible thus creating tax savings for the borrower (Modigliani & Miller 1963). Therefore it is possible to reduce firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s costs of capital and maximize shareholders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wealth by employing debt. Tax saving makes debt finance cheaper than equity finance whenever employed in a firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital structure. The combination of inexpensive debt with relatively expensive capital equity decreases a firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cost of capital which is the hurdle rate for investment acceptance or rejection decisions. For a project to be pursued must be viable to generate enough cash flows to cover the initial cost of that investment. MM theory stipulated that a firm should  have  100%  debt  in  its  capital  structure  in  order  for  a  firm  to  enjoy  the  tax  shield  benefit  (Miller  & Modigliani 1963). Scott (1972) and Kraus and Litzenberger (1973) point out that theoretically 100% tax shield does not exist because of the existence of financial distress costs (Note 5). The utilization of debt financing by a firm has a cost attached to a firm thereby to settle legal obligation including interest and principal. Failure to meet these legal obligations leads a firm to encounter liquidation and suffer the related settlement expenses.   Jensen and Mecling (1976) pioneered the concept of agency theory which explains the conflicts arise between the shareholders managers and lenders collectively known as principal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 agent problems. The conflict between stockholders  and  management  arise  when  managers  are  not  performing  to  attain  the  shareholders  value  109 \\x0cwww.ccsenet.org/ijbm International Journal of Business and Management Vol. 7 No. 24; 2012 maximization goal literally shareholders incur costs to monitor managers and influence their action in which managers have to make viable decisions for the prosperity of the firm. In contrast lenders are united with the shareholders  in  requesting  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  performance  but  when  firm  face  difficulties  this  unity  of  the  purpose  can collapse. The common goal of the union between lenders and shareholders is to take several necessary measures to rescue the firm. These conflicts will never exist if all stakeholders have the same information which is rarely to exist in finance. The presence of information asymmetries could lead managers shareholders and lenders have different information about the value of a firm and it might take several years before all information is revealed to impact their decisions.   Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) stipulated that presence of agency problems such as asymmetric information and moral hazards can impact the access to finance and thereby capital structure of SMEs. The pecking order theory states that the presence of asymmetries of information among the stakeholders; most firms utilize in optimal internal sources available to finance their investments before opting to use debt and equity (Donaldson 1961; Myers & Majluf 1984; Myers 1984). SMEs face challenges in making decision on financing choices because of adverse selection problem which hinder their access to credit and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s expensive to solve the problem. SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 costs to finance  their  investment  opportunities  by  issuing  stock  (stock  market)  are  higher  than  debt  financing.  SMEs operators  may  decide  to  finance  their  investment  by  using  either  internal  or  external  sources;  when  external source is priority the least risk should be selected.     Traditional tradeoff theories stipulate that firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s should decide optimal capital structure option by evaluating the tax saving available in debt; bankruptcy and agency costs of debt and equity basing on available information to maximize  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  value.  The  firm  that  maintains  optimal  debt  in  their  capital  structure  minimizes  the  cost  of capital therefore tends to maximize firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value. Despite of financial distress problem exists when firm imply debt financing in their capital structure; SMEs imply debt as the only choice available because of insufficiency of internal sources and unavailability of equity finance (Frelinghaus et al. 2005). 3.2 SMEs Perspectives in Debt Financing Obstacles  exist  on  access of  external financing  for  SMEs  led  the sector  to  experience  investment  fund hence impact  sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  growth  (Da  Silva  et  al.  2007).  Financing  from  internal  or  external  source  are  required  to stimulate firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s profitability which is the accelerator of the any business expansion and stability (Olutunla et al. 2008). Myers (1984) in pecking order theory states that during financing decision firms should prioritize internal sources of financing to external sources of financing in reference to availability of the source and cost involved. The internal sources of financing option are not preferred choice to be selected in financing profitable and viable projects by most firms because it is insufficient. The external financing is the only source to rescue the SME sector in Tanzania. The borrowed fund can be invested in profitable projects to generate additional assets that can be used as collateral in the future when firm is in need of external debt financing.   Refer  figure 1  which  represents  diagrammatically  how the  accessibility  to  finance by  SMEs  can  impact  their performance.   \\xc2\\xa0Production and Market EfficiencyFirm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s   PerformanceAccess to Finance Factors of Production\\xc2\\xa0Constraints \\xc2\\xa0Figure 1. Diagrammatic model representation on how access to finance impact firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance  Thus accessibility for finance (Note 6) to SMEs is predictable to positively influence the ownership and control of production factors i.e. land labor and capital; subject to the constraints (Note 7) of asymmetric information  110 \\x0cwww.ccsenet.org/ijbm International Journal of Business and Management Vol. 7 No. 24; 2012 and  high  cost  of  capital.  For  example  wages  or  salary  the  cost  to  hire  labor  is  inversely  related  to  the profitability  and  growth  of  the  firm.  Increase  in  wages  or  salary  tend  to  force  the  producers  incur  higher production cost and otherwise hold. Ceteris paribus (Note 8) development of factors of production in terms of quality and quantity (i.e. application of new technology and machinery; well trained and qualified personnel) available to SMEs increase productivity and through efficient and resourceful market strategies (Note 9) enhance SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance and growth. Access to finance enables the SMEs to acquire productive assets that can be used to increase productivity simultaneously reducing the unit cost of production resulting to economies of scale. Decrease in unit cost of production tends to generate an increase in profit. Olutunla and Obamuyi (2008) point out  that  the  improved  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  performance  ensures  higher  earnings  increment  in  sales  volume  creation  of employment and wealth maximization. However firm performances can be unattainable if SMEs fail to access debt financing to support their investment opportunities.   3.3 Empirical Review Firm Characteristics This  part  presents  the  empirical  review  of  the  firm  characteristics  to  be  used  in  this  study.  It  introduces  the variable  frameworks  arising  from  the  literature  and  discusses  how  it  impacts  debt  financing  by  SMEs.  It constructs relevant hypotheses to be tested in the study and other immediate literature of relevance to the study.   3.3.1 Location of the Firm Berger and Udell (2002) find out that the geographic closeness between lenders and customers has an association with a firm to access to credit. The lenders who are geographically proximity to their customers are capable to utilize  soft  available  qualitative  information  to  establish  the  credibility  of  their  customers  for  credit  quality. Gilbert (2008) spotted that the location of the firm has a noticeable relationship with access to the marketplace supplies and to other resources such as capital labor and land. Consequently firms sited in urban locations may have a higher possibility of success than firms located in rural locations with access to credit market and other resources. Fatoki and Asah (2011) find out that SMEs located in urban are successful in access to debt financing compared those located in rural areas. Physical closeness between lenders and borrowers produce an improved form of environmental scrutinize that aid SMEs to access credit from lenders. Consequently there is a positive relationship between firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s location and access to debt financing by SMEs.   3.3.2 Industry of the Firm The industry in which a firm operates does not influence the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital structure directly but might do so indirectly through the composition and nature of the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets (Hall et al. 2000). The association that exists between industrial classification and employment of debt in the capital structure originated from a theory which stated that industry classification is a substitute for business risk (Barbosa & Moraes 2004). The concept lay in this theory indicate the firms operating in the same business sector the environment and economic features tend to  suffer  the  same  impact  face  the  sector  which  might  influence  earnings  and  growth.  Hall  Hutchinson  and Michaelas  (2000)  advocated  that  even  though  particular  firm  features  are  sensitive  to  structural  features  of industry still financial strategy variables posse very important influence over industrial specific effects on the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  operations.  Abor  (2007)  evidenced  that  SMEs  operate  in  the  agricultural  industry  has  strongest  capital structure and asset structure whereby wholesale and retail industry demonstrated the weakest asset structure as well  as debt  ratio.  Consequently  it  is  hypothetically  exists  a positive  impact  between  the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  industry  and access to debt financing by SMEs. 3.3.3 Firm Size The firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s size has a crucial weight on the debt proportion in the capital structure of the firm since real assets tend to influence the accessibility to long debt whenever required (Burkart & Ellingsen 2004). Large firms tend to  be  well  diversified  in  their  operations  which  influence  their  stability;  thereby  size  can  be  substituted  for insolvency (Honhyan 2009). Cassar (2004) stipulated that small firms find more expensive in solving problems associated information asymmetry with lenders.    Most of firms in Tanzania operate in SME sector featured with difficulties in startup and growth barriers associated with a shortage of finance. Fatoki and Asah (2011) find out that firm size impacts SMEs access to debt finance from commercial banks whereby small enterprises are less favored to large firms. Consequently it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hypothetical existence of a positive association between the firm size and SMEs access to debt financing.   3.3.4 Firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Business Information The objective of financial information presented by firms to their users is to inform them on different status of the  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  operations.  Financial  information  issued  by  a  firm  state  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  performance  financial  position  at  a particular  point  and  changes  in  financial  position  in  the  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  operations  (Note  10).  The  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  business  111 \\x0cwww.ccsenet.org/ijbm International Journal of Business and Management Vol. 7 No. 24; 2012 information  is  useful  by  stakeholders  in  making  different  economic  and  social  decisions.  The  users  of  this information include employees lenders government and their agencies employees suppliers and other creditors customers  and  the  general  public.  This  study  evaluates  why  lenders  (banks  and  other  lending  agencies)  are interested  with  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  business  information.  Kitindi  et  al.  (2007)  point  out  that  lenders  use  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  business information to assess current and future performance of the firm. Lenders are interested to know the status of their loan interest and principal by evaluating the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capital structure. Furthermore lenders use the business information  to  decide  borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  credibility  whether  to  issue  or  extend  a  loan  or  not.  Absence  of  sufficient information leads to information asymmetry and may jeopardize access to credit finance (Sarapaivanich & Kotey 2006). Consequently it is the hypothetical existence of a positive association between business information and access to debt financing SMEs. 3.3.5 Age of the Firm Firms  at  the  early  stage  of  operation  used  to  experience  difficulties  in  access  to  debt  finance  because  of informational  disparities.  The  firm  starts  to  operate  and  grows  with  business  performances  on  a  trade  which create a reputation on credit history. Credit reputation reduces the moral hazard dilemma hence create a path to access debt finance. The longevity of the firm stays in operation the more persistence to unpleasant economic circumstances (Chandler 2009).    The study conducted by Klapper (2010) discovered that the firms with less than 5 years (younger firms) in operation are less likely to rely on debt financing from lenders. Ngoc Le and Nguyen (2009) supported the argument that younger firms face hardship and more costs in accessing external financing from lenders because information asymmetry. Consequently it is hypothetical existence of a positive relationship between firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age and access to debt finance by SMEs.   3.3.6 Legal Status of the Firm (Incorporation)     Dietmar et al. (1998) point out that firm with limited liability (incorporated) possess development attributes than firm  with  unlimited  liability.  There  are  numerous  aspects  that  clarify  the  relationship  that  exist  between incorporation and access of debt financing one the separation of owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s affairs and business affairs increase the commitment of managers to the firm goals. Two Publication of their financial statements as one of legal requirement  makes  corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  openness  for  users  to  know  the  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  status  including  their  debt  ratio  and firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  assets.  Cassar  (2004)  found  out  that  lenders  observe  incorporation  as  a  good  indicator  for  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trustworthiness and commitment to operational laws. Abor (2008) stated that the form of business organization has an effect on equity \\xe2\\x80\\x93 debt decisions on SMEs operations. The owners of limited firm have limitations to answer against losses generated by the corporation whereby the owners of unlimited forms of organization (sole proprietorship  and  partnership)  are  liable  up  to  their  personal  assets  to  cover  for  business  losses.  Therefore limited companies prefer to use the equity to finance their projects than debt financing while unlimited form of business organizations (sole proprietorship and partnership) the only option available to finance their projects is debt  financing.  The  study  conducted  by  Coleman  and  Cohn  (2000)  and  Fatoki  and  Asah  (2011)  evidenced presence  of  a  positive  association  between  debt  financing  and  legal  formation  of  business  organization. Consequently  we  proposed  the  existence  positive  relationship  between  incorporation  and  access  of  debt financing by SMEs.   3.3.7 Firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Collaterals SME sector faces difficulties to access external finances for their investment projects because of lack of assets to be  pledged  as  collateral.  In  that  perspective  SMEs  fail  to  grow  due  to  lack  of  collateral  to  pledge  to  access external sources of finance. Bougheas Mizen and Yalcin (2005) pointed out that the requirement of collateral is a crucial aspect for SMEs to succeed in accessibility of external financing from lenders. Coco (2000) suggested that the collateral is the lender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s protection incase default happened by a borrower in that perspective collateral is  the  insurance  that  lender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  contract  will  be  honored  and  respected.  Collateral  solves  the  information asymmetry problems in the evaluation of investment project the worthiness of the project and risk that might be involved by a borrower as well as the cost related to supervision of borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s characters. Barbosa and Moraes (2004) and Fatoki and Asah (2011) suggested that operators of SMEs have to own more tangible assets that can create higher value on their firm to accelerate borrowing security. Because the higher the value of assets the lower the interest rates of the debt to be secured by those assets. Consequently it is hypothetical existence of a strong positive relationship between collateral and access of debt financing by SMEs. 4. Research Methodology The empirical study focused on Coastal zone (Dar es Salaam) Northern zone (Arusha) Zanzibar (Unguja) and Southern and Highlanders zone (Mbeya) of United Republic of Tanzania. The study captured both qualitative and quantitative data. Data collection was conducted through a survey questionnaire comprising open and closed  112 \\x0cwww.ccsenet.org/ijbm International Journal of Business and Management Vol. 7 No. 24; 2012 questions. The questions were comprehensible and constructed easily for respondents to understand and reply the questions. The survey was conducted by a small team of 2 researchers and 4 research assistants who distributed questionnaires  and  conducted  interviews  with  owners  and  managers  from  surveys  SMEs.  This  study concentrated  on  SMEs  which  are  recognized  by  the  Ministry  of  Industry  Trade  and  Marketing;  Tanzania Chamber of Commerce and Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO). The population of SME was 300. To establish the sample size of this study we opted for Raosoft sample size calculator (Note 11) to calculate the sample size. The results provided by Raosoft was a minimum recommended sample size of 169 SMEs to be involved in our study but 200 were distributed because of data collection limitation such as non response. In data analysis we used the Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS). The questionnaire was tested as our research instrument through a pilot study covering 20 SMEs operators. The purpose of the pilot study was not only to identify  the  common  problems  within  the  designed  questionnaire  but  also  to  incorporate  the  respondent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s comments  that  enhanced  the  quality  of  the  questionnaire  that  met  the  purpose  of  study.  Statistical  analysis includes  Pearson  correlation  logistic  regression  and  descriptive  statistics.  Pearson  correlation  was  used  to analyze  the  relationships  exist  between  the  variables  and  access  to  debt  financing  as  well  as  establish  if  the multicollinearity between variables exist. Multiple Linear Regressions were used to measure the relationships between the independent and dependent variables. Validity and reliability were guaranteed by using a statistician and  a  panel  of  experts  to  weigh  up  the  research  instrument  for  theoretical  clarity  pretesting  the  research instrument  in  a  pilot  study  and  in  depth  reviewing  the  literature  for  theoretical  constructs  and  empirical conclusions relating to this study.   5. Results and Discussions Two  hundred  questionnaires  were  distributed  and  one  hundred  and  sixty  three  (81.5%)  was  returned.  The questionnaires  were  structured  to  catch  up  with  respondents  who  were  operating  in  SME  sectors  and  were potentially  in  need  of  debt  finance.  The  study  assesses  how  the  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  characteristics  impact  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  credit accessibility from lenders in Tanzania. 5.1 Correlation Analysis of Variables Correlation analysis was conducted to establish the degree of correlation on the variables intended for this study. The variables are Location of the firm; Industry of the firm; Business firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s information; Size of a firm; Age of a firm; Collateral; and Incorporation. To establish the relationship of these variables; we first run a correlation analysis  among  the  variables  to  find  out  the  association  exist  between  the  independent  variables  and  the dependent  variable  as  well  to  establish  whether  the  multicollinearity  problem  exists  among  the  independent variables.

The results of Correlation analysis show that Location (r = 0.236; p = 0.00) Industry of the firm (r = 0.238; p = 01) Size of firm (r = 0.481; p = 0.03) Business information (r = 0.481; p = 0.04); Age of the firm (r = 0.251; p = 0.03); Collateral (r = 0.632 p = 0.000) and Incorporation (r = 0.239; p = 0.01). All results indicate variables are positively correlated with access to debt finance. Results indicate that accessibility of debt finance from external sources  in  Tanzania  is  positively  impacted  by  the  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  location  industry  size  age  and  incorporation  the  113 \\x0cwww.ccsenet.org/ijbm International Journal of Business and Management Vol. 7 No. 24; 2012 availability of collateral and business information. Furthermore  the  correlation  coefficients  show  that  there  is  no  high  correlation  among  independent  variables used  in  this  analysis  and  thus  make  us  to  understand  that  no  multicollinearity  problem  exists  among  the variables. The study conducted Field (2005) hypothesize that multicollineality is likely to be a problem in a data set if the correlation coefficient between predictors is greater than 0.90 (r >0.90).   5.2 Logistic Regression Analysis Several  approaches  can  be  used  by  a  researcher  to  model  metric  or  dichotomous  variables;  include  probit logistic regression and discriminant function analysis. Conversely logistic regression is famous approach and mostly is used to analyze the relationship between dichotomous dependent variables or independent dichotomous variables because of its flexibility and strongly to violation of the normality assumption within a model (Agresti 1996). Logistic regression also authorizes forecast of a dependent variable from a set of predictors that may be discrete dichotomous and continuous or a combination of any of these (Fabowale et al. 1995). Alternatively while discriminant analysis can be used to model dichotomous dependent variables the analysis is only used with continuous predictors (Fabowale et al. 1995). The nature of data involved in this study we opted to analyze our data by using logistic regression to establish the extent to which each of the variables play a part in firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s access to debt financing.   5.3 Econometric Model Econometric model was used to hypothesize the influence of firm characteristics on access to debt financing by SMEs in Tanzania.

Theoretically  our  expectations  concerning  the  coefficients  of  the  variables  involved  in  this  study  Location (Locjt);  Industry  (Indjt);  Business  information  (Binfojt);  Size  (Sizejt);  Age  (Agejt);  Collateral  (Colltjt);  and Incorporation (Incopjt) of a firm is to carry positive signs. The data for the dependent and independent variables used in the regression analysis were collected from the primary data from field survey.   The coefficient of firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s location was positive and statistically significant and confirms our expectations of our hypothesis. The odd ratio for a firm situated in the urban location is 7.12 with a pvalue 0.010 while for a firm located  in  rural  areas  has  odd  ratio  of  1.01  with  pvalue  0.453;  This  implies  that  access  to  debt  financing  is positively related to firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s location; Firms located in urban areas have a higher possibility on access to loan or debt financing than firms located in the rural area.   The coefficient of industry of the firm was positive and statistically significant and confirms our hypothesis. The odd ratio for primary firm industry (Note 12) is 1.43 with a pvalue 0.250; odd ratio for secondary industry (Note 13) is 5.82 with a pvalue 0.038; odd ratio for tertiary industry (Note 14) is 2.85 with a pvalue of 0.210; while odd  ratio  for  quaternary  industry  (Note  15)  is  1.33  with  a  pvalue  of  0.450.  This  implies  that  access  to  debt financing is positively related to firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s industry whereby most of the sources of financing prefer lending more to the secondary sector while other sectors left unsupported by lenders.   The coefficient of size of business (measured by the number of employees) confirms to our hypothesis carrying a positive sign and is statistically significant. The odd ratio for small firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is 2.68 with a pvalue 0.325; odd ratio for medium firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is 5.35 with a pvalue 0.043; while the odd ratio for large firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is 6.33 with a pvalue of 0.012; results show that larger firms have higher access to debt financing than smaller and medium sized firms because  of  economies  of  scale.  Larger  firms  find  easier  to  borrow  money  from  banks  for  expansion  thereby enjoy the economies of scale. Large firms manage to purchase in large scale materials and factors of production such as capital equipment and machinery as well as employing qualified workers who will ultimately increase productivity and profitability while SMEs are referred as risk borrowers by lenders. Lenders (i.e. creditors banks and other sources of finance) tend to utilize financial information issued by firms to evaluate  and  forecast  the  future  performance  of  the  firm.  Information  acquired  from  the  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  financial statements  portrays  the  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  forecasted  financial  capability  and  indicate  whether  their  loan  interest  and principal could be settled when due. The odd ratio for firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that maintain financial information is 7.85 with a pvalue 0.005 while the odd ratio for the firms which do not maintain financial information is 2.85 with a pvalue 0.326. The result indicates that firms which maintain business information have higher possibility to access debt financing  than  those  never  maintain  financial  information.  Therefore  our  study  confirms  the  existence  of  a positive relationship between the availability of business information and access of debt financing by SMEs. The coefficient of the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s age indicates a positive association between access to credit loan and age of the firm as per our hypothesis. The odd ratio for firms less than 5 years (younger firms) is 1.12 with a pvalue of 0.532; the odd ratio for firms between 59 years is 4.58 with a pvalue of 0.032; the odd ratio for firms between 1014 years is 5.26 with a pvalue 0.024 while the odd ratio for aged firms (15 years and above) is 7.01 with a pvalue 0.042; The result indicates that older firms find easier to access debt financing than younger firms. Regarding the study results Tanzanian business environment demonstrates a positive relationship between access of loan and age of business which is a burden to young firms whereby SMEs are dominant.   The results supported Coleman and Cohn (2000) findings on the existence of a positive association between the firm employing debt with incorporation and as per our hypothesis. The odd ratio for limited firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is 4.53 with a pvalue 0.043; the odd ratio for the sole proprietorship and partnership (Note 16) is 3.01 with a pvalue 0.321. This study finds out most of the firms operating as a sole proprietorship or partnership face difficulties in access the  debt  finance  from  lenders  as  because  of  high  costs  and  lack  of  trust.  Openness  declared  in  the  financial statements  and  limited  liability  make  limited  companies  and  corporation  easy  to  access  debt  financing  than unlimited liability forms of organization (partnership and sole proprietorship).        115 \\x0cwww.ccsenet.org/ijbm International Journal of Business and Management Vol. 7 No. 24; 2012 The availability of collateral coefficient indicates a positive relationship with access to finance. Collateral is a decisive aspect for borrower to succeed in accessibility of debt financing from lenders. The odd ratio for firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with collateral is 8.75 with a pvalue 0.001 while the odd ratio for the firms which do not have collateral is 1.23 with a pvalue 0.322. The results indicate that lack of collateral by SMEs hinder their access to debt financing. Most  of  the  firms  rejected  were  those  lack  assets  to  be  pledged  as  collateral.  Therefore  our  results  support Bougheas et al. (2005) that collateral requirement is a key characteristic for SMEs to succeed to access debt finance.   6. Conclusion and Policy Implications The study has contributed to our knowledge on the series of factors associated with the firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 characteristics impacts  on  access  to  debt  financing  from  different  external  sources  of  financing  in  Tanzania.  The  results demonstrate that there is interdependence and significant relationship between the firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 characteristics (location industry size incorporation age size availability of business information and collateral) and access of debt to financing by SMEs. The study recommends the following One that government should formulate policies that will  make  sources  of  financing  (commercial  banks  finance  companies  micro  finance  institutions  and  other sources) to relax their restrictive regulations and operations which discourage borrowing and offer more credit facilities  for  firms  especially  SMEs. Two  government  should  support  the  SMEs  sector  by  guaranteeing  from financial  institutions  to  SMEs.  Third  government  through  central  bank  should  either  create  strategies  to stimulate commercial banks to increase their lending towards SMEs sector; or. Fourth the government has to authorize  special  capital  from  Central  Bank  to  Commercial  Banks purposely  to  lend SMEs  since  commercial banks are the giant player in the lending industry. Fifth the government should establish a bank to deal with debt financing for SMEs sector; Sixth SMEs operators have to start saving and invests more on tangible assets to be pledged as collateral to acquire external finance.   6.1 Limitation of This Study The study considers mainly internal factors and left behind other sensitive external factors which may also effect lending  to  SMEs.  The  study  conducted  by  Barbosa  and  Moraes  (2004)  revealed  that  external  factors  have contributed impact on the access to credit by firms. Moreover this study concentrated on the demand side of access to debt financing by Tanzanian SMEs while suppliers of debt finance (Lenders) were not involved more contributions could be discovered to create a bridge between Tanzanian SMEs and lenders if all parties were involved. If another study could be conducted to assess the credit gaps to SMEs in the supplier side (lenders) could provide additional results to assist policy makers in solving financing deficit to Tanzanian SMEs. Finally; the  data  did  not  permit  us  to  involve  other  the  noticeable  features  i.e.  political  and  socioeconomic  variables which possibly might impact SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to debt financing because these variables are difficult to be captured quantitatively in our study.
