here  in file  Sequential coherence as a determinant of open innovation      A case study on a Sri Lankan fintech solution    Shanta R Yapa & R Senathiraja    Faculty of Management & Finance  University of Colombo  Sri Lanka    Abstract     Open innovation is a popular strategy to accelerate innovations among business   firms. However  open innovation does not always increase innovation performance.   Arguments in extant literature in respect of the relationship between open innovation   practices  and  innovation  performance  are  inconsistent  and  inconclusive.  Most   existing theories have an internal focus and therefore fall short of explaining why   some  firms  succeed  in  open  innovation  initiatives  and  why  others  fail.  Open   innovation  is  about  knowledge  flows.  To  understand  how  boundary  conditions   influence knowledge flows we conducted a detailed qualitative inquiry on an open   innovation initiative of a software   firm where a leading university and a private   commercial  bank  participated  as  the  knowledge  partner  and  commercialization   partner respectively in developing an award winning fintech solution. Analysis of data   revealed that ability and willingness of teacher firm to share knowledge and also the   ability and preparedness of student firm to acquire knowledge facilitated knowledge   flows between the open innovation partner firms. We bundled those factors and named   as sequential coherence. We trust that our findings bridge a gap in open innovation   literature. These findings could be generalized through a large sample covering many   other industry sectors. Managerial implications of the finding is that ability to scan the   entire chain of knowledge flow across boundaries and taking corrective measures for   any bottlenecks or hindrances observed can bring better results from open innovation   initiatives. Further  sequential coherence leads to multiple research opportunities in   furthering our knowledge in open innovation.

Introduction    The  increasing  propensity  of  firms  to   work across their traditional boundaries   of operations has been captured as Open   innovation  (OI)  (Mina  et  al   2014).   Openness  is  a  strategy  (Chesbrough    2017)  and  a  trend  in  innovation   management (Lopez & Carvalho  2018).   OI has attracted wide academic attention   (Kim  et  al   2015).  OI  encourages   organizations to open up their processes   to  harness  external  knowledge  to   accelerate internal innovations and also   to  use  external  paths  in  early   c o m m e r c i a l i z a t i o n   o f   t h e m    (Chesbrough   2003).  Although  the   importance  of  acquiring  external   knowledge is widely accepted how the   knowledge  flow  happens  is  little   understood (Lakemond et al  2016). Far   less  is  known  about  with  whom  to   partner in acquiring external knowledge   (Lane & Lubatkin  1998). Why OI does   not  always  bring  higher  innovation   performance  is  not  adequately   addressed in existing literature (Yapa et   al   2018).  Many  firms  struggle  to   harness value from OI initiatives (Salter   et al  2015; Lee & Shin  2015) as they   fail to engage external actors (Dahlander   &  Piezunka   2014).  Challenges  firms   face involving external actors in OI have   become  a  popular  area  for  research   (Foss et al  2011; Afuah & Tucci  2012;   Felin  &  Zenger   2014;  Hossain  &   AneesurRehman  2016). The rationale     of  an  organization  to  select  the  best   partner  organization  among  multiple   candidates  possessing  the  required   knowledge  cannot  be  explained  by   existing  theories  (West  et  al   2006;   Rusanen  2013; Von Krogh et al  2018).    The objective of this paper is to present   our findings from a qualitative inquiry   we  undertook  to  understand  how   k n o w l e d g e   f l o w s   t h r o u g h    organizational  boundaries  in  open   innovation  initiatives.  Therefore   we   frame the research problem as “How do   boundary  conditions  influence   performance  of  OI  initiatives?”  This   addresses  a  gap  in  literature.  This   enables us to answer why OI initiatives   lead  to  varying  levels  of  innovation   performance. Open innovation demands   permeability  of  organizational   boundaries (Dahlander & Gann  2010).   Although  OI  is  conceptualized  as   knowledge inflows and outflows at the   level  of  organizational  boundary  most   research work lacks focus on individuals   involved  in  OI  (Bogers  et  al   2018).   Managers and academics lack a proper   understanding  of  the  mechanisms   involving  the  boundaries  of  the   innovation process (Enkel et al  2009).   Brunswicker  &  Vanhaverbeke  (2015)   suggest that research on open innovation   should  investigate  the  interrelation   between  boundary  conditions  and  a   firm’s nature of openness. The boundary   can be between partner firm and the lead     International Journal of Accounting & Business Finance      02     Vol.5 Issue 1 2019    firm or between internal departments of   any organization be it the lead firm or a   partner firm.   Our findings will further   enhance  the  understanding  of  factors   influencing  innovation  performance  in   OI.    2. Literature review     Despite its growing popularity research   is divided on whether organizations can   benefit from OI (Lauritzen & Karafyllia    2018).Inconsistent  arguments  and   inconclusive  results  appear  in  extant   literature in respect of the relationship   between OI and innovation performance   (Yapa et al  2017; Caputo et al  2016;   Cheng & Shiu  2015; Bengtsson et al    2015).  Open  innovation  is  a   multifaceted  phenomenon  (Randhawa    2016)  that  demands  understanding   across various perspectives and levels of   analysis (Bogers et al  2017). In respect   of  determinants   processes  and   outcomes  of  OI   the  multilevel   framework  introduced  by  Chesbrough   and Bogers (2014) suggests examining   the  emerging  perspectives  within  the   organization   outside  the  organization    between organizations or in the broader   context of industries.     Popular theories and variables used to   understand  OI  include  absorptive   capacity  (Cohen  &  Levinthal   1990;   Murovec & Prodan  2009; De Zubielqui   et al  2016 and Matusik & Heely  2005)      organizational  inertia  (Huang  et  al    2013; Godkin  2010; Chesbrough  2006;   Amabile et al  1996; Matthyssens et al    2006; Nijssen et al  2006)  search depth   and  breadth  (Laursen  &  Salter   2006;   CruzGonzález et al  2015; Garriga et al    2013;  Greco  et  al   2016)   cognitive   distance  (Inaun  &  SchenkerWicki    2011; Gulati  1995; Wuytz et al  2005;   Nooteboom   2000;  Nooteboom  et  al    2007)     ambidexterity  (March   1991;   Tu s h m a n   &   O ’ R e i l l y    1 9 9 6 ;    Andriopoulos  &  Lewis   2009;  Ferrari    2011) and inbound and outbound OI   practices (Enkel et al  2009; Bianchi et   al   2015;  West  &  Bogers   2014;   Fernandes et al  2017; Popa et al  2017).   However  these theories mainly focus on   internal  factors  and  they  do  not   adequately  explain  OI  practices  and   differences  in  innovation  performance   (Cheng & Huizing  2014; Bengtsson et   al  2015).     Harnessing value from OI initiatives has   become  a  challenge  for  many  firms   (Salter et al  2014; Lee & Shin  2015) as   they  fail  to  engage  external  actors   (Dahlander  &  Piezunka   2014).  The   i n t e r f a c e   b e t w e e n   r e s p e c t i v e    stakeholders  is  an  important  study   object in boundarycrossing innovation   activity (Hargrave & van de Van  2006;   Geels   2004;  Bogers  et  al  2017).   Challenges  firms  face  involving   external  actors  in  OI  have  become  a   popular  area  for  research  (Foss  et  al      International Journal of Accounting & Business Finance      03     Vol.5 Issue 1 2019    2011;  Afuah  &  Tucci   2012;  Felin  &   Zenger   2014;  Hossain  &  Aneesur  Rehman   2016).  Lane  &  Lubatkin   (1998)  emphasize  the  importance  of   examining  with  whom  a  firm  should   p a r t n e r   i n   a c q u i r i n g   n e w    knowledge.Open  innovation  goes   beyond the boundaries of the focal firm   (Munir et al  2018; Powell et al  1996)   and  recent  publications  have   persistently  stressed  the  necessity  of   understanding  the  organizational  and   contextual  factors  that  moderate  the   relationship between OI and innovation   performance  (Bengtsson     et  al    2015).Therefore  our study on boundary   conditions  and  knowledge  flow  is   justifiable.       3. Methodology     We  used  the  case  study  approach  in   looking  for  a  new  explanation  for  the   relationship  between  open  innovation   and  innovation  performance.  Merriam   (1988)  emphasized  that  there  is  no   standard format for reporting case study   research.  Some  case  studies  generate   theory  some describe cases and others   are  analytical  in  nature  (Creswell    1998). Yin (1989) suggests that a case   study can either be a single case study or   a multiple case. Similarly  a case study   can  either  be  a  holistic  (single  unit  of   analysis) or embedded (multiple units of   analysis).  Lincon  &  Guba  (1985)   suggest that a   substantive case report     should  include  the  explication  of  the   problem   a  comprehensive  description   of the context  detailed transactions or   processes  observed   salience  and   outcomes of the inquiry or the lessons   learned.  Stake  (1995)  outlines  case   study  steps  as  outlining  a  vignette    identification of the issue  purpose and   method of study  extensive description   of  case  and  context   presentation  of   issues   presenting  assertions  and  an   experiential note with a closing vignette.   OI practices are popular among business   organizations  in  Sri  Lanka  (Yapa  &   Senathiraja   2017).  However   OI   practices of the software industry in Sri   Lanka  show  varying  levels  of   innovation  performance  (Yapa  et  al    2018). We selected an OI initiative of a   Sri Lankan software firm in developing   an award winning fintech solution as a   case  study.  Extensive  discussions  and   interviews  were  conducted  with  key   employees of the selected firm and the   OI  partner  firms  to  understand  the   factors  and  circumstances  that   facilitated  innovation  performance  in   respect of knowledge flows across the   focal  firms  and  OI  partner  firms.   Readers should note that the real name   of the organization is not divulged.     Zenith is a renowned software firm with   a proven track record offering solutions   in  the  domains  of  document   management  and  digital  enterprise   automation. They were keen in entering     International Journal of Accounting & Business Finance      04     Vol.5 Issue 1 2019    the  banking  and  financial  software   solutions  sector  as  fintech  solutions   were gaining attention globally enabling   customers to engage in online real time   banking  transactions  easily.Zenith   decided  to  design  and  develop  an   innovative  fintech  solution  which  can   replace  the  traditional  wallet  with  a   digital  wallet.  Zenithalso  realized  the   importance  of  acquiring  external   knowledge  in  the  domain  of  secure   electronic payments and also a partner to   early commercialize the solution. They   partnered with a local university as their   inbound  OI  partner  in  acquiring  new   knowledge.     Zenithalso  selected  a   leading bank in the country and known   for innovative digital solutions  as their   outbound OI partner. The mobile wallet   they  jointly  developed  named   eWalletwas  adjudged  as  the  best   software  solutions  in  the  category  of   banking  &  financial  services  at  the   National Best Quality Software Awards.   The product also represented Sri Lanka   at the Asia Pacific ICT Alliance awards   2018  and  won  a  merit  award   outperforming  15  other  economies  in   the region. The founder CEO of Zenith   had  this  to  say  when  asked  about  the   secret of success.    options  in  selecting  a  bank  as  the   commercialization  partner.After  a   careful  evaluation  of  the  options   we   selected the best known local university   for  software  engineering  as  the   knowledge  partner.  Fortunately   there   were  several  academics  with  adequate   exposure  in  to  secure  payments    information  security  and  digital   forensics. Common interests we shared   pushed  the  project  forward  smoothly.   Similarly   we  partnered  with  the  right   bank which had the passion to innovate   with  a  dire  necessity  to  penetrate  the   market. When we described the digital   wallet they readily accepted to partner   with  us.  There  again  we  assigned  the   right people from our end to work with   the  employees  of  our  partner  firms.   Zenith  employees  were  aware  of  the   challenges in the project as they had to   learn  not  only  banking  but  also   accounting and regulatory frameworks.   Their  preparedness  to  learn  and  share   made  it  a  success.    We  successfully   concluded the open innovation initiative   by  introducing  the  best  banking   innovation  in  the  country  and  also   bringing glory and fame to the country   winning  an  international  award  at  the   Asia Pacific ICT Alliance awards.      Identifying the right partners is a very   important activity in open innovations.   We had many universities in the mind   among whom we had to select the most   appropriate one. Similarly  we had many     This is how the Chief Operating Officer   of the company explained the situation.   Acquiring the required knowledge from   another  organization  is  not  something   like  you  connect  a  pipe  and  open  the     International Journal of Accounting & Business Finance      05     Vol.5 Issue 1 2019    valve so that knowledge flows. People   who do belong to various ranks from the   organizations  take  part  in  the  process.   Their passion and motivation levels may   vary. Out of many potential employees   of the knowledge partner the employees   assigned from our end know the most   appropriate ones to interact with and get   the  project  going.  We  look  for   knowledge  that  is  not  easily  found  in   books  journals or in the web. More than   selecting  the  person  with  the  best   knowledge the one who has the desire to   share and the right capability can make a   big difference. This is very important as   knowledge  transfer  does  not  end  with   one  conversation.  You  got  to  interact   regularly  as  the  learner  absorbs  and   builds new knowledge gradually like the   way  a  wall  is  constructed  by  placing   bricks one on another.     We had extensive discussions with key   people  from  Zenith   their  partner   university and their partner bank. Zenith   had to play the role as a student firm in   acquiring new knowledge and also to act   as  the  teacher  firm  in  transferring   knowledge  to  their  commercialization   partner.  A  comprehensive  analysis  of   interview results revealed that the ability   and the willingness of the employees of   the teacher firm to share knowledge and   the  ability  and  preparedness  of  the   employees  of  the  student  firm  for   learning are the factors influencing the   knowledge  flow.  We  bundle  those     factors  together  and  describe  as   sequential coherence.     4. Findings and discussion    Wedefine  sequential  coherence  as  the   reciprocal  result  of  the  push  and  pull   effects by individuals of a teaching firm   and the learning firm respectively that   enables  knowledge  to  flow  across   boundary  of  firms.  We  argue  that   sequential  coherence  can  be  measured   through  the  ability  and  willingness  to   teach  by  the  teacher  firm  participants   and the ability and readiness to learn by   the participants of the student firm as we   observed through the qualitative study   done. Sequential coherence can explain   the  relationship  between  OI  initiatives   and  innovation  performance.  Much  of   the  interorganizational  learning   research use absorptive capacity which   assumes a firm can equally learn from   any other firm (Lane & Lubatkin  1998).    We  suggest  that  sequential  coherence   enables an organization to make use of   its absorptive capacity. The boundary of   firms  become  more  porous  with  OI   processes and increased interaction with   external  actors  (Litchtenthaler   2009).   Sequential  coherence  focuses  on  the   boundary  conditions  required  for   smooth cross border flow of knowledge   and  technology  in  both  inbound  and   outbound  OI  practices.  It  focuses  not   only the ability but also the willingness   of both the transferor and the recipient of     International Journal of Accounting & Business Finance      06     Vol.5 Issue 1 2019    knowledge.  More  than  a  measure  of   internal  abilities   sequential  coherence   focuses on boundary conditions.    hindrance  of  sequential  coherence   between  firms  may  affect  innovation   performance.     Purposive  management  of  knowledge   flows across boundaries is necessary in   OI  (Chesbrough  &  Bogers   2014;   Lakemond et al  2016) and we argue that   sequential  coherence  can  explain  and   ensure  a  smooth  knowledge  flow.   Managers  should  carefully  examine   sequential coherence between the lead   firm  of  OI  and  each  partner  firm  to   achieve  the  expected  innovation   performance. As the strength of a chain   is  defined  and  constrained  by  the   strength of its weakest link  sequential   coherence  of  each  boundary  in  the   knowledge  flow  matters  in  ensuring  a   smooth flow of knowledge. It is through   regular scans of the chain of knowledge   flow  managers  can  identify  any   drawbacks  bottlenecks and hindrances   to take corrective action.  Firm A being   the lead firm cooperates with firm B as   inbound  OI  partner  to  access   knowledge.  Sequential  coherence   between firm A and firm B matters in   ensuring the knowledge flow happens.   Similarly  firm A works with firm C as   the outbound OI partner where firm C   will assist firm A to early commercialize   their  innovations.  The  sequential   coherence between firm A and firm C is   important to ensure the knowledge flow   to  achieve  the  desired  innovation   performance.  We  argue  that  any     Absorptive capacity is considered as a   critical  resource  that  depends  on  the   prior  knowledge  of  a  firm  and   determines  the  firm’s  innovative   capabilities  (Dell’Anno  et  al   2015).   Nonaka  &  Takeuchi  (1995)  describe   knowledge  as  the  result  of  the   interaction  between  the  actors;  the   transferor  and  the  recipient.  We  argue   that in order to transfer knowledge both   the  ability  and  willingness  of  the   transferor and recipient will matter. In   this  context   sequential  coherence   compliments  absorptive  capacity  in   acquiring  knowledge.Internal  R&D   capabilities  are  indispensable  in   effectively  exploiting  external   knowledge  (Cohen  &  Levinthal    1989;Vanhaverbeke  &  Cloodt2014).  It   is important to understand the internal   organization of the innovation process   which  determines  diffusion  and   exploitation  of  technical  knowledge   within the organization (Noteboom et al    2007   Levinthal  &  March   1993;   Argyres & Silverman  2004). Lakemond   et al (2016) describe the importance of   firm’s choice of knowledge governance   in innovation performance. Bogers et al   (2017) emphasize the importance of the   roles  played  by  individuals  who  are   assigned  with  various  tasks  in  OI  in   ensuring  innovation  performance.     International Journal of Accounting & Business Finance      07     Vol.5 Issue 1 2019    Heath  and  Staudenmaier  (2000)   describe  that  in  accomplishing  work    organizations  should  motivate   employees so that their goals are aligned   (the  agency  problem)  and  should   organize  the  individuals  so  that  their   actions  are  aligned  (the  coordination   problem).     We argue that sequential coherence can   be considered as an addon to absorptive   capacity  to  better  understand  the   knowledge  flow  from  one  person  to   another  across  boundaries  in   organizations  in  OI  partner  firms    departments and work teams.   In each   point of knowledge transfer the push and   pull effect created by the willingness and   ability  of  the  participant  from  teacher   firm and the ability and preparedness of   the  participant  from  the  student  firm   impact  the  result.  By  examining  and   influencing  the  degree  of  sequential   coherence  practicing  managers  may   influence innovation performance in OI   initiatives.  Vanhaverbeke  &  Cloodt   (2014) explain that absorptive capacity   explains  only  the  inbound  OI  process   and it does not pay attention to outbound   OI. Sequential coherence can bridge this   gap as it addresses seamless knowledge   transfer  across  the  value  chain  from   inbound OI  internal knowledge transfer   and outbound OI. In this regard  the unit   of  analysis  in  using  sequential   coherence  may  be  the  organization  or   the entire network of OI relationships.     OI is an inherently dynamic process that   demands  research  to  incorporate   dynamic  elements  (Appleyard  &   Chesbrough   2017).  We  argue  that   sequential  coherence  is  a  dynamic   measure  capable  of  influencing   innovation  performance  in  OI   initiatives.  Why  do  some  open   innovation  initiatives  lead  to  higher   innovation  performance  and  some  fail   (Cheng & Huizing  2014; Bengtsson et   al  2015)? Firm A succeeds with firm B   in  an  OI  initiative  whereas  a  similar   initiative firm A undertakes with firm C   fails. If we examine only an ability that   is pertaining to firm A we cannot explain   why one initiative failed and the other   succeeded.  We  suggest  that  sequential   coherence can explain this and it is a pre  condition  for  absorptive  capacity  to   work in favor of   an organization.    Sequential  coherence  ensures  that   knowledge  will  flow  smoothly  from   teacher  firm  to  student  firm  in  an   unbroken  manner.  This  transmission   may  happen  through  people  via   discussions   presentations  and   interactive  learning  (Kogut  &  Zander    1996)  and  also  through  products  and   processes.  Higher  social  interaction   between  firms  facilitated  through   multiple  ties  enhances  knowledge   acquisition  (YliRenko  et  al   2001).   Naqshbandi  (2016)  emphasizes  the   importance of managers to keep in touch   with  people  from  different  firms  in   ensuring OI performance. If we compare     International Journal of Accounting & Business Finance      08     Vol.5 Issue 1 2019    knowledge  flow  across  partner  firms   with  the  current  flow  of  an  electric   circuit  where  components  are   considered as different firms  sequential   coherence describes the soldered joints   between various components. It is also   similar  to  the  cable  lugs  used  in   connecting  different  components.   C a p a c i t y    p e r f o r m a n c e   a n d    specifications of individual components   will be of no use if we fail to make the   proper  connections.    As  an  engineer   quickly  scans  all  the  soldered  joints   between  different  components  he   assembled  in  a  printed  circuit  board   when it is found not working properly  a   manager  can  examine  the  knowledge   flow at boundaries when things are not   moving in OI initiatives as expected. We   argue that sequential coherence enables   knowledge fusion.     There is growing interest on assessing   OI  at  a  more  micro  level  than  the   organization (Bogers et al  2018; Du et   al  2014; Salter et al  2015; Dahlander et   al   2016;  Ahn  et  al   2017).  However    individual  level  factors  remain   relatively  ill  understood  (Bogers  et  al    2017). Most research studies on OI have   neglected  the  human  aspect  of  it   (Gassman et al  2010; West et al  2014).   Salter  et  al  (2014)  emphasize  the   challenges  faced  by  employees  in  OI   initiatives.  R&D  employees  need  to   allocate time to innovate within and also   outside  the  firm  (Dahlander  et  al      2016).We  argue  that  higher  sequential   coherence leads to improved innovation   performance in OI initiatives. Practicing   managers may use sequential coherence   in  influencing  innovation  performance   in open innovation initiatives by taking   action  to  address  the  four  areas   highlighted  namely  willingness  and   ability of participants from teacher firm   and  the  preparedness  and  ability  of   student  firm  participants.  OI  research   studies  show  that  when  adopting  OI   strategies  organizations  benefit   differently  and  the  reasons  for  these   differences are not explained (Saebi et   al  2015). We believe that our findings   support  extant  literature  and  will   increase  the  understanding  on  OI.  We   propose to test the new determinant of   sequential  coherence  with  a  larger   sampleusing  quantitative  research   methodology for generalizing it.    Inbound OI   Practices     Outbound OI     Practices     Innovation  Performance     Sequential   Coherence       Figure 1 – Suggested conceptual model   for a quantitative study    Willingness  and  the  ability  of  teacher   firm employees to share knowledge and   the preparedness and the ability of the   student firm to acquire knowledge from     International Journal of Accounting & Business Finance      09     Vol.5 Issue 1 2019    the  teacher  firm  are  the  measurable   dimensions  we  can  identify  in   operationalizing  the  construct  of   sequential coherence.  Further   it  will  be  interesting  to   understand  how  sequential  coherence   can address issues of cognitive distance    search depth  organizational inertia and   ambidexteritythe  regularly  used   variables  in  explaining  innovation   performance  through further research.   For an example  we may test whether a   high  degree  of  sequential  coherence   influence search depth in OI initiatives.   Whether  attempting  to  engage  in  both   i n b o u n d   a n d   o u t b o u n d   O I    simultaneously  may  lead  to  waste  of   resources  and  efforts  will  be  another   area to be researched from a sequential   coherence perspective.  How sequential   coherence  can  address  stickiness  of   knowledge (Szulanski  1995; Szulanski    2002) will also be an interesting area for   further  research.  Further   we  may   examine  whether  the  opportunity  for   participants from teacher firms to learn   from  the  student  firm  enhances  the   knowledge  flow  from  teacher  firm  to   student firm. Finally  a major area future   researchers may explore is to study how   individual  factors  such  as  attitudes    personality   perception  and  motivation   of  participants  affect  sequential   coherence.
