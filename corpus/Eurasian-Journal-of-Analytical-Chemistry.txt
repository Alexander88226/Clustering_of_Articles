INTRODUCTION     Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play important roles in Thai economic growth and sustainable   development. Recently Thai government has improved operational efficiency in SMEs development as   sources of innovation and business evolutionsector that can solve high unemployment problems facing in   the country. Nowadays  there are approximately 40 000 entities in Thailand  and there are approximately   about170 SMEs in the financial sectors dominated all service in the economy including banking (The Bank   of Thailand  2019).    Related to operational efficiency in SMEs development  the accounting systems provide and support a   source of information to owners and managers of SMEs operating in any industry for use in the mea  surement of financial performance. It is importance to any business regardless entity  big or small that the   accounting practices of SMEs need to improve the accounting and relevant financial information by the   concepts and principles adopted digital financial technology to ensure reliability in business and financial   performance as measured. All the relevant accounting information are related by profitability  appropri  ate for a successful management of any business entity  whether large or small entrepreneurs (Fei and   Minqian  2019).   In cutting edge technology  blockchain has provided the stateoftheart solutions in a democratic vir  tual economic system that can verify payments  reach consensus  and store encrypted data in virtual eco    315     ChaisonRungkaputi    Literature Reviews     nomic systems which meets the requirements of speculators  profitdriven entrepreneurs  market  fundamentalist libertarians and technology fetishists (Yelowitz and Wilson 2015). Blockchain is defined   as a distributed ledger technology that can implement financial models (Fei and Minqian  2019). The   cryptocurrency is based on collaborative open source principles and peertopeer networks that suggest a   commitment to social solidarity and mutual aid.   The blockchain is a composite technology for trusted data flows in an untrusted environment. In   blockchain network tier  verification nodes legalize transactions on the longest hash chain. Each block   contains multiple legal transactions. Taking transactions and clearing business in the financial industry as   an example  the central database cannot solve the multiparty trust problem. Every participant has to   maintain a database for carrying their own business data that potentially increases the cost of labor. The   blockchain is a good solution for data transmission management in distributed networks. However  all   transaction verification nodes need to ensure the comprehensive backup of transaction history. There  fore  this matter is in concerned and inspected by untrusted parties (Fei and Minqian  2019).   This researchaimstodevelop the accounting verification process affecting digital currency transactions   recorded being kept and maintained by Thai SMEs’ entrepreneurs  their reliable and the confident of ac  counting information and privacy control to protect and process accounting information that can be   measured by using blockchain technology for small and medium business in Thailand. In this paper  we   organized as follows  Section 1  introduction. Section 2  literature review. Section 3  the proposed model.   Section 4  the findings and give recommendations for future development in the conclusion.   A blockchain is a shared  distributed ledger  that is  a log of transactions that provide for persistence   and verifiability of transactions (Hari and Lakshman  2016). A transaction is a cryptographically signed   instruction constructed by a user of the blockchain (Muzammal et al.  2019). For example  the transfer of   cryptocurrency from one account to another. Transactions are grouped into blocks  linked and secured   using cryptographic hashes. A consensus protocol enables the nodes of the blockchain network to create   trust in the state of the log and makes blockchains inherently resistant to tampering (Daniel and Guida    2019; Florian and Luca  2019). Therefore  blockchain technology is able toeliminate the need for a mid  dleman from the management of transactions  such as a bank in the transfer of money (Florian and Luca    2019). A blockchain is as a distributed database that built up by a network of participating parties who run   the same subjects  the constraints and rules set by the underlying  blocks of data gradually being   “chained” together. Unlike a centralized database held by a single entity  it creates an indelible record    resistant to tampering by any individual party. Furthermore  if any code of the underlying chains are   tweaked by participants  the nature of the resultant blockchain changes  opening the possibility of creat  ing blockchain databases storing all manner of diverse data  including  property titles  contracts  shares    voting decisions  or even reputation scores (Hasanova et al.  2019). Blockchain systems are most useful in   recording simpler data. Besides the type of cryptocurrency adopted as incentive mechanism  these plat  forms distinguish themselves by few key properties. The access policy tells who can participate in the   blockchain network. Public blockchains allow anyone to join and to access the information stored in the   blockchain via the Internet; private blockchains are restricted to private networks and selected nodes   only (Waltl  2019; Florian and Luca  2019).   In theory  neither party can completely control the process of the parent chain. Miners can only up  date status or verify the legality of the data on chains in strict accordance with rules. Unlike the concur  rency control in trusted distributed database blockchain1.0 consider the existence of Byzantine nodes in   the network may perform malicious behavior. Replicable state machine model between node A and B in   blockchain1.0 is generated with a full backup. Transaction verification nodes called miners always pur  suit the Unspent Transaction Output (UTXO) via massive calculation. The miners are willing to spend   electricity cost to pay for the record right of the next block. Competition for rights ensures blockchain1.0   are naturally able to resist double spend attack via the vulnerable (Fei and Minqian  2019).     316     Eurasian Journal of Analytical Chemistry                    In 2013  Ethereum application platform was developed to the builtin ether coin which implements   cryptocurrency (Fei and Minqian  2019). This system also provides a Turing complete engine which is   used on behalf of blockchain 2.0 (Lin  F. and Qiang  M.  2019). Later in 2015  the Linux Foundation   launched an open source blockchain project Hyperledger to develop the crossindustry commercial   blockchain platform (Ma  C. et al.  2019). Despite this  the question of whether Ethereum can be harnessed   to empower marginalized communities and build new means of solidaritybased finance remains unans  wered. Particularly  the regulation that must be rigorously considered in blockchain ledger applications in   banks is that of the provisioning accounting standard currently referred to as IFRS 9 Financial Instru  ments document  published in July 2014 by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) based    ledger for banking that it is recording and processing of losses in the ledger are compliant with the IFRS 9   standard classifications. These classifications determine how financial assets and financial liabilities are   accounted for in financial statements and significantly how they are measured on an inprogress basis.   Such buildingblock contracts could be woven together to form the basis for more complex multistage or   multifunction entities  referred to by some as decentralized autonomous organizations (DAOs) (Pang  burn 2015). DAOs are primarily advanced multistage algorithms held in the validation policy that in  forms who among the nodes can participate in consensus creation and deploy smart contracts.   The consensus protocol specifies how trust is created among participants  Proof of work (PoW) re  quires nodes  socalled miners  to invest significant hashing power to create trust. Proof of stake (PoS)   requires nodes to prove ownership of sufficient cryptocurrency to establish trust (Florian and Luca    2019).Other notable consensus protocols are proof of elapsed time (PoE)  proof of importance (PoI)    proof of state (Universa Blockchain Protocol)  Raftbased consensus (Quorum)  and stream processing   ordering services that all use replication to establish trust in the state of the network  even if faced with   failing network nodes. (Daniel and Guida  2019; Florian and Luca  2019).   However  some blockchain architectures in which unchangeability would not enable the reversal of   misclassifications (Lin  F. and Qiang  M.  2019). Under the IFRS 9 framework  there is a logical classifica  tion structure for all financial assets which is driven by cash flow characteristics and therefore the busi  ness model in which an asset is a settlement. Under IFRS 9  it standardizes the management and reporting   of such items in banking ledgers in a simplified fashion compared to those of the previous rulebased re  quirements that are complex and difficult to apply  and more importantly  complicated to automate into   smart contract transformations on a blockchain banking ledger (Rosati  P. and Čuk  T.  2019).   In this paper  we study some key issues that affect digital currency transactions in SMEs by developing   verifies accounting processes using blockchain technology as a tool to build new processes of property   rights in Thailand—based on explicitly cooperative and social trust principles. Cryptocurrencies are sub  ject to the concept of a decentralized public ledger  collectively maintained by a network of participants.   The use of a blockchain ledger to record log transactions (Allen  L. et al.  2019; Rosati and Čuk  2019) In   fact  it can expand the vision of trustenabling decentralized cooperatives  or distributed collaborative   organizations among Thai nation.   We design and build our model using cryptocurrency with blockchain 2.0 technology providing cus  tomized features such as deposit  withdrawal  financial contracts  and gas limits via .NET programming   language that can be created for any transaction type or application. The research population comprises   of 100 SMEs involve with digital currency exchanges and various services in Thailand. Our model consists   of followings (as shown in figure 1).    The integrity  sequence  and validity of block are checked by block header which includes the version   number  previous hash  timestamp  target difficulty  random nonce. All nodes run the blockchain applica  tion can generate a pseudo random private key by SHA256 (Fei and Minqian  2019) to encrypt payments.     THE PROPOSED MODEL     Data model          Network Tier     317     ChaisonRungkaputi      The consortium blockchain improves the speed of the verification and authentication by adjusting the   decentralization or vertical scalability. The architecture pays more attention to risk management for up  grading traditional enterprise application. In the public blockchain scenario (Fei and Minqian  2019)  the   network environment is fair although the types of nodes are different. It is unsecured for nodes that ex  posed network brings a multitude of security issues  including attack  statistics  and analysis.    The blockchain operation into two parts  leader election and transaction serialization. The algorithm   PoW (Fei and Minqian  2019) is reused  but PoW is only used to select the leaders. The leaders can write a   block containing the public key and multiple microblocks that they can prevent forking. These blocks are   generated and broadcasted after an intensely short interval. The public key of the miner is merely in  cluded in the key block. All subsequent micro blocks are signed with the corresponding private key to   prevent faking a micro block. The incentive mechanism is a hardcoded split incentive  which may have an   allocation vulnerability.    We employ MyEtherWallet (Maranhão et al.  2019) that has customized the underlying Ethereum vir  tual machine. We implement customized contract engines that extend the functions of blockchain 2.0 or   enrich user interfaces.     The Contract Engine (Fei and Minqian  2018)     The Consensus Algorithm     THE FINDINGS     Fig 1 The proposed model using with blockchain 2.0 technology     In the experiment  our model is based on the concept of consensus protocol and cryptocurrencies   isthe keysthat affect digital currency transactions.We implement MyEtherWallet  which is a distributed   ledger platform  leveraging private asymmetric key by SHA256 and various functions allowing data flow   between multiple parties can be tracked and managed in real time. It is one of distributed ledger platform   which provide the state of financial transactions’ scenarios.   In the scenario  it is a transaction (as shown in Figure 2) requested to transfer money $X from A to B    and the state transition function reduces the value in A's account by $X and increases the value in B's ac  count by $X. If A's account has less than $X in the first place  the state transition function returns an error.   Hence  one can formally define      318                    Examples   APPLY({ Somsri  $50  Somchai  $50 } "send $20 from Somsri to Somchai") = { Somsri  $30    Somchai  $70 }   But  APPLY({ Somsri  $50  Somchai  $50 } "send $70 from Somsri to Somchai") = ERROR        Eurasian Journal of Analytical Chemistry          CONCLUSION     Fig 2  The verification procedures based on the cryptographic blockchain 2.0           In Findings  we found that the consensus protocol in blockchain 2.0 affects accounting transaction.   The methods of consensus algorithm using Proof of work can provide formal verification based on asym  metric mathematical verification logic calculus  cryptography  security encryption. The advantages of   PoW can make the verification procedures based on the cryptographic blockchain 2.0are not only to stop   abusive people who control central institutions  but also to resolve the problem of how to establish trust   relationships amongSMEs’ financial transactions. Therefore  the security and reliability of the decentral  ize database can solve the multiparty trust problem in accounting verification process.   This research objective is to develop the accounting verification process affecting digital currency   transactions  included  SMEs’ cooperative financial structures and ecosystems in Thailand as a case. The   findings revealed that the consensus protocol using Proof of work in the model can provide effective re  sults. It is not only to record  monitor  and trace all of the transactions correctly  but also to establish trust   relationships to support sustainable cooperation and best practices for Thai SMEs. However  the decen  tralized ledger technology is still new in Thailand.It is the Fintech outlook of disruptive technology  espe  cially among Thai SMEs and startup entities that consider how blockchain technology could be benefits.   Therefore  it is recommended that the national regulators must develop specific accounting guidelines to   support sustainable cooperation and best practices for Thai SMEs. Finally  this research is ongoing devel  opment based ecosystems such as cryptoequity systems. In the future we will create online financial   applications to establish across SMEs and other financial entities via a crypto integration platform.   [1]. Achawakorn  K.  Raksa  K.  &Kongkalai  N.
