Abstract     Blockchain’s transformational potential has been heralded across  all industries    with some particularly enthusiastic voices even comparing its emergence to that of the   early  internet  protocols  communication  protocols 1.  Over  the  past  few  years   we  have   witnessed several enterprises start their distributed ledger technology (DLT) journey with   blockchain as the magic bullet for operational process efficiencies 2. However  companies   have often jumped into earlystage proof of concept (POC) projects without a clear ROI   goal or other KPIs defined. There have been no databased quantifications of impact in   terms of investment return or realized customer value  or largescale feasibility studies   focused on process efficiencies. Indeed  many companies continue to invest in their POC    there have been no reported realizations of efficiency claims or even lessons learned3.     This  paper  presents  a  databased  perspective  on  the  perceived  feasibility  of   blockchainbased innovation and value creation for supply chain operations and trade   finance. While expectations remain high across all regions and industries  none of the   study participants indicated a financial or customer value benefit realization to date. While   technical implementations were executed without major challenges  a key challenge has   been the simultaneous adoption of solutions by different ecosystem stakeholders to drive   actual value realization.     A qualitative review of the study results produced critical lessons summarizing the   current market perspective on blockchain benefits  key challenges  as well as realization   horizons.  These  results  have  resounding  implications  for  industries  with  a  vision  to   implementing  and  adopting  blockchain  technologies  and  can  define  the  nature  of  a   successful implementation of blockchain for supply chain operations and trade finance.                         3     2.  Introduction     Global trade is growing significantly  outpacing growth in nominal world GDP. In   2018  alone  the WTO anticipates  growth  of 4.4% of merchandise trade volume 4. The   Asian Development Bank (ADB) forecasts particularly strong growth in emerging markets    2018 growth for at 6.0% and 5.9% for 20195. Despite this  inefficiencies abound  ADB   estimates the unmet demand for trade finance at ~$1.5 trillion in 2016   with Asia and   Africa  accounting  for  40%  and  25%   respectively6.  Micro   small   and  mediumsized   enterprises (MSMEs) face the biggest difficulties in accessing trade finance  representing   74% of total rejections last year. 7 These are daunting numbers  especially considering   that  at  least  36%  of  rejected  trade  finance  transactions  had  been  considered  viable.   Therein   however   lies  the  promise   it  was  primarily  the  cost  and  complexity  of  anti  financial crimes due diligence that caused most rejections. To capture this immense value   going forward  firms must be willing to fundamentally shift from laborious and paperbased   processes to redefine the current global trade finance ecosystem.     Enter Blockchain.     Blockchain describes decentralized software platforms that enable a distributed   ledger system [citation]. It allows authorized participants to track and record transactions   and assets in the absence of a single central trust authority   e.g.  a bank. Blockchain   networks  have  the  capacity  to  create  proof of  ownership  across  the  endtoend  trade   finance process through digital signatures that rely on both public and private encryption   keys  only  known  to  authorized  members   thereby  curtailing  fraud  and  collusion.  In   addition   these  networks  also  enable  peertopeer  exchange  of  data   assets   and   currencies through rulesbased smart contracts  a set of promises  agreed on between   parties and encoded in software  which are performed automatically when agreedupon   criteria are met8. These "smart contract" are run on blockchain in the sense of general  purpose computation that takes place on or distributed ledger 9. As a result  payment flows   are  more  efficient   transparent  and  costeffective   while  also  providing  temperproof   record keeping10.     Benton et al. (2018) describe the general benefits that blockchain can bring with   regards  to  provenance. 11  In  particular   they  describe  how  until  recently   creating  an          4     accessible and reliably auditable trail of information was cost prohibitive. In addition  they   point  to  the  competitive  advantages  that  emerge  from  the  efficiencies  blockchain   promises to bring. They note that particularly in the SCM space  blockchain promises to   streamline regulatory and documentary processes  and potentially even remove the need   for audits in many situations.      The implementation of such a nascent technology is not without its challenges.   Key issues include the general lack of familiarity among market participants  as well as   the need to integrate this technology with existing legacy systems. Critically  not all market   participants  are  incentivized  to  partake  in  this  revolution.  For  example   the  business   model of many midmarket trade credit funds relies on the very existence of information   asymmetry and the lack of market transparency.     Supply  chain  and  trade  finance  however  stand  to  benefit  handsomely.  Clark   Thomson from Consensus hypothesized that within the financial services realm  trade   finance stands to benefit significantly  especially given its mostly paperbased processes.   He  points  to  the  vast  potential  for  the  automation  and  streamlining   enablement  of   consistent  insurance vehicles  and  risk modeling  and the  ability to make capital flows   cycle  independent.  However   to  enable  the  seamless  and  fullyintegrated  adoption  of   blockchain within the broader trade finance ecosystem  the industry must be called upon   to take concrete  global steps that facilitate and accelerate sustainable digitization.      When  speaking  with  Alisa  DiCaprio   the  head  of  research  at  R3   Ms.  DiCaprio   pointed out that small and mediumsize enterprises (SMEs) are the group most interested   in  new  solutions.  Currently   SMEs  are  at  the  mercy  of  banks.  Oftentimes   these   organizations  avoid  trade  finance  products  not  because  they  are  too  expensive   but   because they cannot get them at all. Here  blockchain could render SMEs operations   more transparent  thereby assisting in credit checks and KYC processes  as SMEs are   often times too immature to properly signal their fitness to be financers. However  SMEs   will not be the ones driving the adoption process. A feasible approach will heavily rely on   market  leadership  by  key  buyers  to  ensure  the  establishment  blockchain  technology   standards. Banks  will  at least initially   operate  nodes  on  behalf of SMEs. In addition           5     particularly for the participation of smaller suppliers  infrastructure and subsidies for the   operation of blockchain nodes are a realistic prospect.      However  while many initial efforts have been undertaken across the industry  few   studies  addressing  tangible  benefits  have  been  published.  Furthermore   there  are  no   studies that provide a databased industry perspective on the perceived feasibility of using   blockchain from the trade finance space.     This paper thus aims to quantify the market perspective with regards to the potential and   limitations that DLT has visavis the operational processes underlying the existing trade   finance business model. We analyzed the perceived applicability to supply chain financing   and trade finance processes. Specifically  we investigated how industry experts assess   to  what  extent  industry  participants  expect  blockchainbased  solutions  to  impact   traditional  instruments  such  as  letters  of  credit  and  trade  credit  insurance   as  well  as   operational  process.  To  that  end   we conducted  SME  interview  with  a  series  of  trade   finance and insurance experts to assess existing projects as well as to analyze inflight   blockchain POCs. In addition  we implemented a comprehensive field study to assess the   current pulse of the trade finance industry  and to quantify the perceived feasibility among   ecosystem representatives.      By addressing these questions  we provide a first  databased  indepth analysis   of  the current  market  perspective  when  it  comes  to  the adoption  of  blockchainbased   technology for SCF processes. Practitioners can therefore gain a perspective how the   industry  perceives  current  developments   and  where  others  stand  in  the  blockchain   adoption journey. In addition  we provide an overview of perceived hindrances to xx  and   put  these  in  perspective  for  each  of  the  industry  branches  covered  (i.e.   finance    insurance  technology  and government).     The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  structured  in  six  sections.  First   we  present  the   literature review on benefit and feasibility assessment for supply chain finance and trade   finance.  Subsequently   we  describe  our  study  method   both  for  the  deepdive  expert   interview and the comprehensive market pulse survey. Next  we present the results of   pulse survey  which we conducted amongst trade finance industry experts – along with a   discussion  of  the  results.  We  conclude  the  article  by  discussing  its  theoretical  and          6     practical implications  pointing to its limitations and suggesting paths for further research   and exploration.     3.  Literature Review     A  systematic  literature  review  was  undertaken  to  estimate  the  breadth  of  the   literature  search  space.  Because  blockchain  remains  a  new  technology   the  search   horizon was limited to five years. Given the large number of articles discussing the general   features of blockchain  to ensure quality in blockchain discussion and credibility in the   selected  resources   only  peerreviewed  scholarly  articles  were  captured  [] 12.The  term   blockchain is commonly used but other terms such as a digital ledger  distributed ledger    shared ledger are common. To ensure comprehensiveness  the keyword string to collect   articles related to blockchain technology is determined as  (blockchain OR “distributed   ledger”  OR  “distributed  ledger  technology”  OR  “DLT”).  To  narrow  down  the  research   scope to trade finance and supply chains finance  only articles including ‘trade finance*’    ‘supply chain*’  and ‘value chain*’ were selected.     Several  articles  analyzed  pointed  to  the  various  potential  and  benefits  that   blockchain can contribute to supply chain management and trade finance. However  none   of  the  publications  analyzed  provided  databased  figures  or  were  based  on  a   representative study of industry experts. The assessments therefore remained opinion  based. Indeed   Judith  and Martin (2018)  point out that existing data on  suppliers and   FSPs  are  scarce   and  that  the  moderating  effects  of  SCF  market  adoption  and   technological processes  such as blockchainbased SCF  require additional research13.      As part of the IBM / Maersk case study  van Kralingen (2018) quantifies potential   benefits as part of the IBM / Maersk case study  estimating that supplychain operations   that  could  reduce  costs  by  approximately  10  percent   and  increase  total  global  trade   volume by approximately 5 percent. 14 Similarly  Nash (2016) describes how a blockchain  based pilot at Walmart led to Walmart reports that a more transparent and accurate record   of  transactions  on  a  blockchain  could  lead  to  benefits  including  safer  food  products    enhanced flow to provide fresher products to customers  and boosted consumer trust    albeit without citing specific improvement metrics. 15          7     “The challenge with trade finance and supply chain today is that participants are   forced to use disparate digital systems bridged by paperbased processes  with little or   no common standards. These digital ‘islands’ work well when everyone is on the same   network  but as soon as there is a lack of connectivity with certain participants using   different solutions  things quickly revert to paper and manual processing.16     In their 2018 paper  Mao et Al go beyond the mere traceability of goods alone. The   authors  describe  a  system  to  strengthen  the  effectiveness  of  supervision  and   management in the food supply chain. The system gathers credit evaluation text from   traders by smart contracts on the blockchain and uses machine learning for semantic   analysis. 17     In their  2018 literature review   Tribis et  al.  point  out that among the 40  papers   reviewed   a  key  gap  appeared  to  be  the  absence  of  any  databased  performance   evaluation within an industrial context 18.     Hofmann et al (year) report findings  which suggest that the blockchain and DLT   could deliver substantial benefits for all parties involved in an SCF transaction  promising   to expedite the processes and lower the overall costs of financing programs. 19     Given  the  lack  of  primary  researchbased  assessment   a  comprehensive  study   among trade finance professionals was sorely needed to quantitatively shed light on the   perceived feasibility and expectations of blockchain technology adoption in the market.          8     4.  Methods     Data for this empirical assessment was collected via (1) longform interviews with   industry experts within the trade finance ecosystem  and (2) through the execution of a   research study with 191 industry participants familiar with DLT technology.     Expert Interviews     Expert interviews  were conducted  with representatives from  traditional financial   service firms  Fintech startups  DLT technology leaders  trade insurance and logistics   providers  as well as government entities in both the United States and Europe with the   goal of painting a comprehensive picture of the current status of the DLT adoption journey   with  a  focus  on  trade  finance.  While  the  adoption  maturity  varies   both  traditional   companies  like  Wells  Fargo  and  startups  like  Skuchain  unequivocally  recognize  the   disruptive potential that DLT technology can bring to the existing marketplace. The road   to unlocking this potential   while paved  may nonetheless require several years. Even   established  technology  leaders  like  ConsenSys  and  R3  reckon  that  the  true  value   realization  enabled  by  blockchain  technology  will  ensue  only  once  all  ecosystem   stakeholders have taken the plunge together.                    Type     Companies     Financial Services  Wells Fargo  American Express     Insurance     Technology     Logistics     FinTech     Chubb  Stenn International     R3  Consensys     Euler Hermes     Skuchain          Table 1  A list of companies interviewed as part of the expert interviews          9     Research Study     The initial list of prospective participants for the quantitative research study were   sourced from bases on their affiliation with global trade. The group that was surveyed   included representation from finance and insurance industries  as well as DLT technology   provides and government / regulatory entities. The regional representation included the   United States  Europe  Africa  South America  and Asia. All participants were informed   that they would receive a copy of the final report if they participated.      The survey consisted of a total of 25 multiple choice and freetext questions  aimed   at  probing  into  different  topics  with  regards  to  the  current  adoption  of   as  well  as  the   outlook with regards to future applicability of DLT for the respective organization. The   topics analyzed included (1) the individual’s expectation of benefits from DLT solutions    (2)  the  perceived  challenges  as  part  of  this  implementation   (3)  operationsrelated   considerations  and (4) a summary of trade financerelated considerations. All questions   asked within the research study are included as part of the appendix.     Of the 1 429 that received the survey  191 individuals completed the questionnaire.   Given the “cold” nature of this survey approach  a response rate of 13.4% was considered   high.  Of  all  the  survey  participants   48%  represented  Finance   29%  Insurance   12%   technology providers   and  10% regulatory  and  legal professions.  Representation from   Europe was strongest with 47%  followed by North America (21%)  Asia (10%)  the Middle   East (9%)  Africa (8%)  and Latin America (7%).                       10     5.  Results     Half of all the survey respondents indicated that their own organization had direct   experience with regards to implementing blockchain technology. Among the participants   that indicated direct experience  we inquired where they are in the blockchain adoption   journey.  Here   results  appeared  mostly  aligned.  The  only  outlier  was  amongst  the   insurance  representatives.  Here   75%  indicated  that  they  were  currently  conducting   market collaboration activities.      Figure 1  Does your organization have experience with blockchain technology?               Figure 2  Where are you in the blockchain adoption journey?     We  structured  the  review  of  the  study  results  in  four  distinct  buckets   benefits    challenges  operations  and trade finance. Analyzing the results in the groups allows us   to point out interesting trends and contrasts (e.g.  high benefits expectations without any   realizations). This approach also helps the reader absorb the information provided.               11     Benefits Realization      A key area of interest is the ability of blockchain technology to deliver value for   adopting  organizations.  We  thus  included  a  series  of  questions  aimed  at  the  value   generation potential  financial or otherwise  that blockchain technology can bring.     When  inquired  after  the  overall  benefit  potential  from  blockchain  for  their   organization in general  the vast majority (82.7%) of participants indicated that they do   expect  benefits  to  be  realized  (i.e.   strongly  agree   agree   or  somewhat  agree).   Approximately  12%  indicated  that  they  were  undecided   and  only  4.5%  voiced  their   skepticism.          Figure 3  My organization will benefit from implementing blockchain technology.          We subsequently asked all participants which areas within their organization that   believed would stand to benefit the most from the introduction of blockchain technology.   We setup answer possibilities between business  technology  and operational benefits in   order to measure the type of benefit that the individual groups would expect.          12     While  finance   technology   and  governmental  institutions  appear  to  see  the   potential  for  benefits  across  the  board  (i.e.   business   technology   and  operations)    representatives  from  the  insurance  space  indicated  that  they  do  not  expect  any   operational  benefits  within  their  space  whatsoever.  Interestingly   participants  also   indicated  that  they  look  to  blockchain  technology  to  help  establish  interoperability   standards.                    Figure 4  Which areas within your organization could benefit the most from blockchain?           A second set of questions aimed at the benefit horizon with regards to time. We   wanted to know (1) how quickly participants expect to see a tangible benefit in general   and (2) when they expect to see any return on investments from blockchain technology.   For  both   we  provided  mutually  exclusive  answer  choices  grouped  into  five  distinct   buckets  i.e.  (1) already  (2) in 13 years  (3) in 35 years  (4) in 510 years)  and (5)   never.      When it comes to the general impact of blockchain technology  we different horizon   expectation  by  industry.  The  majority  (42%)  of  Finance  respondents  indicated  an   expectation of a fundamental impact within 13 years (Figure 3)  while expecting tangible   returns only later  i.e.  in 35 years. Among the technology and governance respondents    the majority (44%) expected an impact in 35 years. Technology respondents also expect          13     benefits  within  the  same  time  frame   while  the  expectation  amongst  the  governance   participants is equally distributed across all the horizon buckets. Representatives from   the insurance industry had the longest expectation horizon for both impact and benefits    for  both  categories   the  largest  group  of  respondents  (42%)  expects  an  impact  and   benefits only within a 510year horizon.      When asked if they expect a true moment of disruption  the vast majority (70%) of   affirming respondents originated within the Finance group. Perhaps interestingly  though   not surprisingly for people familiar with the latest rounds of blockchain POCs  not a single   participant indicated having realized any benefits (financial or otherwise) now      Figure 5  The spread of blockchain will fundamentally impact the operations of my     industry…             Challenges     In addition to the benefits of blockchain  we also asked all participants about their   perspective on the key hindrances and bottlenecks when it comes to the implementation   of blockchain.      First  we asked participants about (1) the key hindrances that they see when it   comes  to  the  adoption  of  blockchain  in  the  first  place   and  (2)  specifically  about  the   challenges that blockchain might bring when integrated into existing systems.          14        Figure 6  Investments in blockchain will produce tangible returns (i.e.  cost reductions     or customer value creation) ...     As depicted in Figure 5 below  the three key concerns  consistent across the board    are (1) a perceived lack of subject matter expertise  (2) regulatory & legal uncertainty    and  (3)  the  perceived  risk  of  low  adoption  overall.  The  concern  of  low  adoption  was   particularly  strongly  expressed  by  representatives  within  the  realm  of  insurance  and   government.     Surprisingly  for insurance respondents  the lack or absence of industry standards   do not seem to be a point of concern. In addition  all groups do not see to be particularly   concerned with regards to the availability of talent in the marketplace.     Figure 7  Which of the following may hinder the implementation of blockchain?               15     When asked specifically about potential integration challenges  the key concern   for respondents across the board was the current absence of industry standards (Figure   6).  In  addition   all  groups  cited  the  general  lack  of  experience  when  it  comes  to  the   implementation of DLT.          Figure 8  What are key challenges for integrating blockchain into existing (legacy)     systems?               When asked about the overall talent availability for blockchain implementation in   general   respondents’  opinions  were  consistent  across  all  inscope  industry  group.   Overall   respondents  acknowledged  a  lack  of  available  talent  today.  From  an  outlook   perspective  participants were divided as to whether the talent will be available eventually   (40%)  or whether it will not (46%).     When asked about potential operational risks  with regards to blockchainbased   operations  the key areas of concern included the absence of legal authorities (21.7%)    the  risk  of  hacking  (18.3%)   and  the  possibility  of  fraud  (16.3%)  in  general.  When   separately  asked  about  relevant  legal  considerations   the  notion  of  jurisdictional   uncertainties  especially with regards to smart contract laws  was consider the biggest   concern by far (32%).               16     Operations     In the next section  we asked all participants about their concrete experience  as   well  as  their  expectations   when  it  comes  to  the  implementation  of  blockchainbased   products and services. We were interested in their preferred mode of implementation  as   well as in the type of blockchain they were looking to deploy.     Overall  respondents indicated a strong preference for blockchain implementation   using packagedtype products (e.g.  SAP). When asked explicitly  61.3% indicated that   they  would  prefer  using  a  nonproprietary  product   while  only  14.4%  stated  that  they   would prefer to build a solution inhouse.     When asked about their preferred blockchain flavor for implementation  all industry   groups  indicated  a  strong  preference  for  consortiumowed  blockchain  deployments.   Effectively  none  of  the  participating  respondents  indicated  a  preference  for  public   blockchain technology.        Figure 9  What kind of blockchain do you think will be the key for largescale adoption?        Also   in  accordance  with  the  selected  blockchain  approach   most  participants   (52%)  indicated  the  same  preferences  when  it  comes  to  the  question  of  network   interoperability. for a multilateral approach (i.e.  a blockchain that is run and maintained   by  an  industry  consortium).  In  addition   32%  of  participants  indicated  to  lack  the   knowledge to make an informed decision when it comes to interoperability.               17     Trade Finance     When ask about the potential and specific applicability of blockchain technology   for  end  endtoend  process  of  trade  finance  transactions   the  fast  majority  of  survey   responders  expressed  great  optimism.  In  total   71%  of  all  participants  either  strongly   agreed or agreed that blockchain will streamline the trade finance process. In contrast    only 6% of participants indicated that they do not expect the process to be streamlined   as a result of DLT adoption by their organization.     Figure 10  Blockchain can streamline the endtoend process of trade finance     transactions.               Similarly  most survey participants also indicated that in addition to the adoption of   blockchain technology itself  the simultaneous modernization of existing legacy system   modernization is a key consideration for the enablement trade finance efficiencies.      When it comes to tangible trade finance process benefits  the survey participants   responses were once again streamlined  the vast majority expects benefits from process   time  reductions  (41.8%)   process  transparency  enhancements  (26.3%)   and  overall   process risk reduction (16.2%).                       18     6.  Discussion     In  the  previous  analysis  we  analyzed  four  domains  to  assess  the  feasibility  of   leveraging blockchain technology from the perspective of professionals within the trade   finance space.     Starting  with  benefits realization   we  observe several surprising trends. From  a   balance sheet perspective  trade finance is still the bread and butter of lucrative business.   Revenues have increased overall  with BCG predicting revenue growth of roughly 4.7%   a year for trade finance 20. This sort of revenue is in a firm’s best interest  as it is recurrent   and  independent  of  interest  rates   thereby  providing  a  steady  income  stream.  Trade   finance provides corporations with complete and integrated transaction banking offerings    presenting an invaluable crossselling potential. A 2014 East & Partners Trade Finance   Report  projects  that  $1  in  trade  finance  fees  can  bring  $1.70  in  FX  and  crossborder   payment fees  and $2.25 in other revenue21. The fact that most study participants foresaw   strong potential for the adoption of blockchain technology can be linked to the intricacy of   integrating the abovedescribed processes. We hypothesize that blockchain technology   can therefore significantly simplify integration and transactions  especially by leveraging   smart contracts.      Another interesting trend  was the value expectation by industry. While Finance   representatives  see  value  opportunities  across  the  entire  spectrum  of  activities  (i.e.    business   operations   and  technology)   representatives  from  insurance  see  business   opportunities only  and no operational gains  whatsoever. One the one  hand  one  can   assume that the very nature of insurance contracts lends itself well for automation  which   would fall into the realm of business applications; on the other  the notion of disruption for   insurance in general  given the significant simplification of the entire industry that smart   contractbased  policies  could  bring  about   is  not  being  considered  here.  Accordingly    when asked about the disruptive potential of blockchain  the majority (67%) indicated they   were unsure as to whether there would be such a moment of disruption.     When speaking with Pierre Sin from the Euler Hermes Digital Lab  we gleaned   further indicators for the long adoption times for blockchain. Euler had initially started to          19     research and build solutions independently  primarily to get initial exposure. However    since 2017  the company has focused on collaborating with the main consortiums  as   blockchain development is intrinsically a networkbased endeavor. The key bottleneck is   the  establishment  of  standards.  Naturally   with  many  ecosystem  participants   the   agreement on shared standards will take time.     Enhancing Transparency     The risk resulting from the lack of visibility in the conventional trade finance model   is the primary catalyst for the increasing cost of capital. Using a technology like blockchain   is expected to minimize risk and to reduce the cost of capital to shareholders. Essentially    blockchain stands to significantly improve the value chain by integrating the movement of   goods   transaction  processing   and  payments.  The  technology  bridges  the  chasm   between buyer and seller in two ways      (1)     (2)     Reducing  the  prevalence  of  manual  processes   as  well  as  automating  and   digitizing paper documentation   Unifying  the  wide  array  of  disparate  parties  involved  in  the  supply  chain  by   establishing shared standards                    20     Streamlining Data     In the current endtoend trade finance process  a single transaction may exact up   to  5 000  data  field  to  document  interactions22.  As  data  flows  through  this  process   a   decreasing share of these fields (~1%) create valueadding data with roughly 8590%   registered as ‘ignore/transmit to the next party23. Realistically  there are only 6080 unique   relevant data fields  such as reference numbers  dates  suppliers  and amounts. In the   current model  these unique data fields are reused 810 times24. This complicates the   transaction  process   increases  the  risk  of  discrepancies  and  expands  the  extent  of   redundant  activities   ultimately  threatening  to  significantly  delay  an  already  lengthy   process and to increase fraud and error exposure. Fraudulent activities in the recent years   have been in the billions of dollars25. However  they still only account for a small fraction   of the overall trade finance volume  potentially explaining why fraud was only considered   a key application case for a mere ~16% of respondents.     BCG estimates that blockchain technology can streamline this endtoend trade   finance  process   while  enhancing   transparency  and  reducing  overlap/error   by   simplifying   or  potentially  eliminating  altogether   more  than  90%  of  data  field   interactions 26.  In  addition  to  its  intricate  nature   the  process  behind  trade  finance   transaction also creates a long paper trail and it may take between 510 days to exchange   all relevant documentation.     Lastly  blockchain entries are updated by each participant on the network to reflect   the most recent transaction  thereby obviating the need for multiple physical copies of the   same  document  information.  The  information  is  stored  on  numerous  ledgers  across   various  entities  on  the  network.  All  necessary  information  can  be  stored  in  a  single   blockchain  which saves time and improves data transparency and accuracy                              21     Challenges     The  key  adoption  challenges  pointed  out  by  the  survey  participants  included  a   perceived lack of subject matter expertise  legal and jurisdictional uncertainty  and overall   low adoption.     The notion of jurisdictional uncertainties was also highlighted by Mr. Maloney from   Stenn International  a trade finance investment fund. It was pointed out that for reliable   operations   Stenn  only  deals  with  jurisdictions  with  more  predictable  common  law   situations in place. Another key aspect in addition to  legislation is the  implementation   ability. While India  for example  has strong laws in place  any jurisdictional processes   tend to be prohibitively slow  especially when dealing with smaller entities. Indeed  45%   of manufacturing contribution in India comes from SMEs  defined as USD 1m or less27.   In today’s market environment  the provision of financing for this market is limited and   requires  technology.  If  automation  were  possible   and  trades  could  be  aggregated  to   larger volumes  this would result in an attractive return on capital invested  both for banks   and specialty finance companies.     The concern of low adoption was a concern expressed by representatives within   the realm of insurance and government. This notion was also echoed by Euler Hermes.   While  the  company  has  on  multiple  occasions  witnessed  consortiums  bring  together   multiple  ecosystem  participants  for  test  transactions  (e.g.   banks   insurers   and   enterprises)  little  progress  has materialized or  operationalized. For once a product  is   deployed at a larger scale  you find that systems are not uptodate anymore  and that   people lose interest. When EH launched one of their earliest DLT prototypes  significant   amounts  of  internal  infrastructure  had  to  be  upgraded   due  to  the  required  realtime   capabilities. Often times  when people describe the advantages of DLT  they are really   describing the benefits of the internet – and not DLTspecific aspects.     Another key consideration was the absence of standards  which appeared to be   relevant for all participants  except for insurance representatives. Without coherency and   unification  crossing  the  two  different  supply  chains  (buyers   sellers)   the  market  is   vulnerable  to  fragmentation   a  circumstance  under  which  the  promised  omnichannel   consistency of blockchain technology will fail. Hence  the implementation and adoption of          22     a data standard and protocol is imperative for any blockchain based trade finance service.    There has been some progress in this regard in the form of the Bank Payment Obligation   (BPO) initiative. Additionally  UCP 600  the latest version of the rules that govern letters   of  credit  transactions  worldwide   solves  this  for  letters  of  credit.  DLTenabled  smart   contracts need an equivalent set of standards and procedures.     From a business perspective  the biggest operational problem when it comes to   servicing  trade  finance  products  are  paperbased  processes.  Christopher  Lewis   the   global head of trade services at Wells Fargo  made this very clear. Ever since the early   90s  when there was a massive push for retailers to source good oversees  the biggest   customer complaint has been to reduce the paper from the system. The initial solution for   this was the rollout of big IT systems  mainly Oracle and SAP; the banks had to build   interfaces  to  “tie  in”.  Going  forward   Mr.  Lewis  sees  the  potential  for  blockchain   technology. The biggest advantages from his point of view is the standardization that the   adoption process will drive.     In addition  Mr. Lewis sees big potential for the “handling” process of transactions   once a blockchainbased solution finds mainstream adoption. He imagines more efficient   processes  with local banks (e.g.  HSBC) providing financing in Asia  and then “handing   over” this transaction to different institutions in different regions. Key hindrances for such   a solution today (e.g.  transfer of physical shipping documents) would largely vanish  as   all information would be available within the decentralized ledger system.     Finally  Mr. Lewis expects a shift of product focus. As of today  USbased SMEs   would like to do more business overseas. However  currently  this is only possible via   letter  of  credit   with  the  supporting  bank  enabling  nonrecourse  discounting  once  the   goods are shipped and documents provided. The ability of using open account process    however  is limited  these would always require near total insurance coverage to meet   regulatory  requirements.  With  a  blockchainbased  solution   this  limitation  would  not   change  but a much more streamlined process could be enabled where financial service    insurance  logistics  and other stakeholders can interact more efficiently.                    23     Integration     One of the most surprising outcomes of the survey was a voicing of strong interest   in packaged solution products for blockchain. This trend was notable across all industry   representation as part of the survey. This response patters is also congruent with the   respondents’ indication of a preference for  a consortiumoperated blockchain – rather   than any shared model. This applies both for the preferred model overall  as well as for   the interaction of different blockchain.     The interest in blockchainasaservice offerings (whether as a packaged software   product  or  consortiumprovided  use  model)  could  be  the  result  of  the  overall  lack  of   knowledge when it comes to blockchain implementations  as well as the notion around a   lack of industry standards in general.     The  lack  of  standards  within  the  industry  has  made  integrating  the  disparate   sources  of  data  necessary  to  grant  buyers   sellers   and  any  required  intermediaries’   interface to the network has hindered previous initiatives from successfully automating   the global trade finance industry. Without having to entirely overthrow legacy systems   and introducing a disconnected technology infrastructure  the parties involved in the trade   finance process will need flexible tools to map the process documents and payments.   The big question is therefore  how can companies best integrate this technology with their   existing operating model?      In this context  Euler  Hermes  explained that clients are very much behind  with   regards to technology. As a result  readymade solutions (e.g.  R3 Corda) are easier to   adopt   since  they  are  significantly  more  similar  to  what  companies  already  know  and   understand.  It  is  because  of  this  that  Euler  Hermes  expects  Corda  to  become  the   technology of choice with regards to blockchain implementations.     While  there  are  genuine  promises  of  the  longterm  benefits  of  blockchain   technology  its implementation is costly as it must often be developed for the specific firm   in question (did you get estimates for this from any of the interviews?).  Additionally  skill   sets  and human capital are required to maintain the technology efficiently; hence  firms   must train or find qualified personnel. A platform like Corda  for example  only provides a          24     solution that works like the internet was originally supposed to  an easy way to share   information  in  a  standardized   confidential   controlled  fashion  amongst  multiple   applications. For Euler Hermes  it appears logical that controlled platforms are only an   interim  step;  once  all  problems  pertaining  to  security  and  confidentiality  have  been   resolved  the company expect the emergence and wide adoption of a public platform ala   Hyperledger.     A final interesting outcome was the significant number of respondents  across the   board   who  indicated  their  concern  with  regards  to  high  energy  needs  for  blockchain   maintenance  (13.2%).  Given  the  near  complete  selection  of  consortiumoperated   blockchain ledgers  energy consumption is not a technical concern. This outcome is in   line with the beforementioned notion of nascent knowledge  which was amply expressed   by the participants themselves.        Trade Finance     The  participants’  opinions  with  regards  to  the  potential  of  blockchain  for  trade   finance  operations  were  in  line  with  the  overall  market  excitement.  In  total   93.8%  of   participants indicated that they believe blockchain will streamline the endtoend trade   finance  process.  This  is  amusing   especially  since  approximately  half  of  these   respondents  had  indicated  earlier  that  they  had  no  experience  with  blockchain   whatsoever.     The benefits most prevalently expected by the participants  such as process time   reductions (41.8%)  process transparency enhancements (26.3%)  and overall process   risk reduction (16.2%)  is notable. An increase in trade finance accessibility  one of the   key advantages from our perspective  and one of the biggest challenges in today’s world    was  in contrast  only pointed out by 4% of the participants. This finding is critical  as it   reaffirms  the  strong  focus  of  the  industry  on  blockchain  technology  for  operational   efficiencies  and not for the enabling of new products. This is however unsurprising  as   earlier estimation has focused on the operationsrelated cost savings. As the dependence   on redundant manual processes and paper declines  blockchain trade finance can cut          25     costs  by  between  $2.5  billion  and  $6  billion  (35%)  over  35  years28   driven  primarily   through the following       (1)   (2)   (3)     Collaborative digitization    Intelligent automation    Smart contract usage     The benefits case for blockchainbased innovation applies primarily to operational   efficiencies.  These   however   will  inturn  enable  new  products   as  well  as  market   expansions  as transaction costs will be cheaper. It will be crucial for the industry to look   beyond the operational efficiencies of blockchain alone  and consider other  new products   that are enabled by this technology.     DLT has the potential to significantly change the trade finance aspect of supply   chain management as it is a natural fit. Blockchain technology will help drive efficiencies   through  the  ecosystem  to  improve  the  endtoend  process  for  all  players  while   significantly lowering its cost.     In the short term  firms are encouraged to champion immediate initiatives to reduce   risk  improve service  and reduce the costtoserve in documentary trade. As the marginal   cost and effort required to serve clients continues to drop  firms should look to small and   mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs)  to  build  scale.  Lower  trade  finance  costs  are   simultaneously expected to increase demand.     Realizing  the  benefits  of  DLT  technology   requires  the  successful  aggregation  of  the   following initiatives      •  Facilitating the flow of trade receivables    •  Enabling transparency of trade asset movement    •  Reducing disputes and fraud to provide delivery and payment certainty.      Understanding  the  underlying  information  fabric   i.e.  data  points  that  support   transactions  of  a  players’  supply  chain   will  help  with  more  accurate  risk  pricing   and   ultimately  the  creation  of  new  products  and  services.  Data  flows  must  have  a  unique          26     purpose  and  path  in  their  logistic  interaction  with  other  entities  involved  to  avoid   redundancies and duplications.      Additionally  firms must shift to digitizing documents in order to navigate the ever  evolving  landscape  of  trade  finance.  Achieving  scale  and  a  lower  unit  cost  will  be   imperative as trade becomes more commoditized and the customer increasingly focused   on cost. Currently  it is estimated that the cost of processing physical trade paperwork is   $420  billion;  this  compliance  cost  is  510%  of  transaction  value. 29  Under  the  right   circumstance   digitizing  the  paperdominated  industry  and  implementing  blockchain   technology has the capacity to substantially reduce and eliminate this cost altogether.      In  this  line  of  thought   smart  contracts  are  expected  to  streamline  the  trade   financing process by hardwiring the various elements of an agreement between parties   into  automatically  executing  code.  For  example   imported  goods  may  be  scanned   immediately upon arrival at the destination  prompting an automatic signal to the smart   contract  which  would  then authorize the  release  of funds to the  exporter. In the case   where parties require further assurance of delivery  the goods could also be geotagged   so that the smart contracts would only trigger the release of the funds upon receipt of two   confirmations   (a)  the  scan  of  the  goods  upon  arrival   and  (b)  the  GPSbased  signal   confirming that its delivery location is correct. 30      The adoption of blockchain technology in trade finance does not necessarily entail   a complete overhaul of legacy systems. Banks  for example  should focus on creating a   digital ringfence with internal systems digitized and built around the flow of data. As paper   use declines  banks could rework the interfaces  rather than creating entire new business   processes  systems  and data flows from scratch. Banks should see startup technology   firms and FinTechs as potential partners rather than as threats.                     27     7.  Limitations     Despite being a first of its kind (or something like that)  our study also has several   limitations. As we limited our study to the speciﬁc impact of blockchainbased technology   to supply chain and trade finance  an exciting avenue for future research would be to   investigate the projects that the survey participants have already worked on and the result   that they have obtained. In addition  when considering the overall ecosystem  it would be   informative   the  participants  have  already  worked   collaboratively  with  other  ecosystem  participants.  However   having  derived  testable   propositions  future research might test them in largescale studies in related domains.      to  determine  how  many  of     A further limitation is the large number of participants from European ﬁrms. It is   plausible  to  assume  that  distinct  banking  and  industrial  contexts  might  alter  the   perspective on the blockchain adoption process as well as benefits expectations (e.g.    limited use of electronic banking and strong use of checks in India). However  it is unclear   how  these  contextual  changes  would  impact  the  results.  For  example   particularly  in   regions where suppliers’ access to ﬁnancial markets is more restricted  they might be   demanding innovations such as blockchainbased SCF  even stronger than European or   American suppliers do.      Finally  our study captures a snapshot of the feasibility perspective across multiple   firms and roles. It would be interesting to study ﬁrms longitudinally as this would reveal if   each ﬁrm follows the innovation adoption process detected in this research.     Our  study  also  reveals  further  adjacent  research  topics  which  might  guide   researchers  interested  in  the  domain  of  blockchainbased  SCF.  It  would  therefore  be   interesting to broaden the research on upstream innovations to more than one type of   innovation (e.g.  combination of blockchain and AIbased automation). Second  readers   will benefit from an analysis of the SCF innovation from the viewpoint specifically of the   supplier to further complement our understanding of upstream innovations. This approach   might also reveal further success factors for the implementation of SCF.          28     8.  Conclusion     Blockchain technology has the potential to revolutionize the trade finance process   by  reducing  operational  complexity  and  transaction  costs   while  also  redefining  value   chain interactions. At its core  blockchain is a decentralized software platform that enables   a distribution ledger system (DLT). It allows authorized participants to track and record   transactions and assets in the absence of a single central trust authority  such as a bank.   Blockchain networks have the capacity to create proof of ownership across the endto  end trade finance process by using digital signatures that rely on both public and private   encryption keys only known to authorized members  thus curtailing fraud.      In addition  these networks also enable peertopeer exchange of data  assets and   currencies  through  rulesbased  smart  contracts    a  set  of  promises   agreed  between   parties and encoded in software  which are performed automatically  when criteria are   met. As a result  payment flows become more efficient  transparent and costeffective    while also providing temperproof record keeping 31.       Across  the  board   market  participants  see  the  potential  for  the  adoption  of   blockchain technology for both operational elements as well as new business products.   In addition  there is overall acknowledgement and awareness of the limiting factors and   hindrances that have yet to be considered. An additional key observation was that none   of  the  study  participants  have  realized  any  blockchain  delivered  benefit   financial  or   otherwise.     A key challenge to the success of blockchain technology in trade finance is the   threat of market fragmentation; there must be a unified series of players consolidated   under one seamless technology initiative so that clients may use it. Naturally  given the   strong  element  of  network  effects  in  financial  services   this  has  championed  a  strong   focus on the establishment of banking consortiums around the development and adoption   of blockchainbased solutions for trade finance and supply chain management.     While significant progress has been made in this space  blockchain technology is   still in its infancy; a true set of standards has not been defined yet. As the momentum          29     progresses  key players will face significant challenges before reaching a seamless and   revolutionary integration of blockchain. However  if made aware of such challenges  and   with  the  appropriate  knowledge  and  guidance   firms  will  undoubtedly  be  able  to  take   rewarding strides towards integrating blockchain to their current trade finance process.      By  analyzing  and  interpreting  directly  collect  study  responses  from  150+  trade   finance industry leaders  our study marks a ﬁrst cornerstone in the exploration of this   important  and  fast  evolving  ﬁeld  of  blockchainbased  innovation  for  supply  chain   operations  and  trade  finance.  It  furthermore  paves  the  way  for  future  research  into   ecosystem stakeholder expectations (i.e.  expected blockchain adoption timeframes and   underlying  rationale  by  different  industry  branches)   as  well  as  the  behavior  and   investment patters that can be expected as a result.     9.
