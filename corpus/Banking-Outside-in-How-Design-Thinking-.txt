Chia Alvin Jia Hao*a; Lee JungJooa a National University of Singapore Singapore * e0235473@u.nus.edu  The banking industry is facing unprecedented changes. From the assault launched by various Financial Technology companies (FinTechs) to the shifting customer needs and expectations banks need to transform itself to remain relevant in the digital age. In this paper we seek to explore the relevance of design thinking as a method to help banks cope with the disruptive changes. We review the biggest drivers of disruption in the banking industry the suitability of design  thinking  for  the  banking  industry  and  banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99  current  approaches  to  design  thinking. Lastly  a  case  study  on  a  Bank  in  Singapore  is  introduced  to  illustrate  the  example  of application  of design  thinking for a new product design in banking and discuss opportunities and challenges.  Keywords Design Thinking; Bank; FinTech; Innovation; Design  Introduction  1 The  rise  of  FinTechs  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  new  players  or  startups  that  specialise  in  financial  services  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  is disrupting dominant players in the banking market. The popularity of new payment systems like PayPal Apple Pay Alipay Android Pay Venmo Samsung Pay and MPesa indicate a decreasing customer satisfaction and trust advantage on banks (Winch 2014). In the United Kingdom  (UK)  it  is  estimated  that  one  in  four  bank  branches  will  vanish  in  the  next  five years while in the United States over 1700 banks closed in just 12 months as customers needing overthecounter transactions declined (Louise Rexrode & Jones 2018).  The  decline  of  banking  implies  a  failure  to  innovate  amid  a  tide  of  digital  disruption.  The traditional banking model is being contested as customers grow disillusioned and form new expectations. In fact a survey suggested that 7 out of 10 millennials in the UK would use a financial service mobile app offered by tech giant (Eurobank 2018). Innovative approaches in business strategy and development are therefore imperative.  One  of  the  most  important  concepts  that  have  driven  successful  innovation  in  several industries is the concept of design thinking (Jamain 2014; Beckman & Barry 2007). Design thinking is defined by IDEO CEO and President Tim Brown as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9chumancentered approach to  innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  which  takes  into  consideration  people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  needs  technology  and  the requirements  for  business  success  (Brown  2008).  Despite  its  popularity  and  success design thinking is still significantly underresearched (Clark & Smith 2008; Suciu & Baughn 2016) in the business context.

In  this  paper  we  aim  to  explore  the  opportunities  of  adopting  design  thinking  in  banking focusing on the following questions What are the biggest drivers of disruption in the banking industry?; Why is design thinking suitable for the banking industry?; How can design thinking be used in banking? We explore these questions through literature reviews and a case study on one bank based in Singapore. Our aim from this study is to identify key research themes related to design adoption in banking and envision relevant strategies processes and tools.   2  Why banking is ripe for disruption  2.1 Where the banking industry is now  Without a doubt the financial services sector of which the banking industry is the largest is a  crucial  segment  of  the  contemporary  global  economy.  Over  the  past  decades  however the banking industry has experienced disruption that forces its players to revisit the way they do  business.  For  example  JP  Morgan  Chase  Chairman  and  CEO  Jamie  Dimon  famously remarked  in  a  letter  to  investors  about  Fintechs  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThey  all  want  to  eat  our  lunch.  I  mean every single one of them and they are going to try\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Shontell 2015).   The  digital  disruption  in  the  banking  industry  does  not  only  cover  mere  technological changes or the arrival of new players but an upheaval of the entire retail banking model due to  changes  in  the  market  structure  (Ferrari  2016).  FinTechs  pose  a  very  powerful competition through digitisation of financial services. On the other hand roboadvisory tools adopted  under  Industry  4.0  are  becoming  increasingly  popular  (Mla\\xc4\\x91enovi\\xc4\\x87  2018). Furthermore  Big  data  Internet  of  Things  Analytics  Machine  Learning  and  new  analytics capabilities  need  to  be  utilised  to  improve  work  process  and  customer  segmentation  (de Galhau  2016).  Already  many  banks  are  doing  business  by  going  cashless  (Tee  &  One 2016)  and  essentially  completely  disappearing  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  by  doing  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvisible  banking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Under  these current conditions  it  would  seem  that  the  digital  bank  is the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbank  of  the future\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Dermine 2016).  2.2 Disruption theory  Disruption refers to the theory pioneered by Christensen (1997) who traced the rise and fall of players in the diskdrive industry and how the industry changed hands from the dominant to  the  new  entrant.  Disruption  theory  hypothesises  that  where  incumbent  firms  possess values  that  stop  them  from  exploring  opportunities  despite  having  the  capacity  to  do  so thereby allowing other entrants known as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisruptors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to take advantage of this opening. In narrowing the focus on what currently works for the firm incumbents resist marketdriving value  innovation.  As  a  result  the  disruptor  becomes  the  player  exploiting  the  chance  to introduce  a  new  value  proposition  to  the  market  which  are  usually  attuned  to  mainstream customer needs and at a cheaper price. Thus any industry disruption may be considered as a development that could either marginalise the incumbent or altogether destroy it (Arnold & Jeffery  2016).  Disruption  theory  proposes  that  any  product  innovation  which  would otherwise be viewed as inferior by an incumbent firm may actually be regarded as superior by  a  sizable  market  segment.  Thus  disruption  theory  underscores  the  recognition  of  the importance of innovation as a solution (de Galhau 2016).  2.3 Drivers of disruption in the banking industry  2.3.1 Shift to customer focus  2 \\x0c Many studies posit that the financial crisis of 2008 has eroded consumer trust on the entire financial  services  sector  (J\\xc3\\xa4rvinen  2014;  Gillespie  2013).  A  consumer  survey  pointed  out customers perceived banks with descriptors such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreedy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunsafe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuntrustworthy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cputting profit before people\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while only 21 per cent believed that UK banks are learning from their  mistakes  and  changing  their  ethical  behaviours  for  the  better  (YouGovCambridge 2013 p. 8).   Other empirical research describes this weakness in traditional banking as a lack of empathy and customer focus (Culiberg & Rojsek 2010). Many studies support the need for banks to rate highly on empathy and reliability to boost customer satisfaction (Chu Lee & Yu 2012; Culiberg  &  Rojsek  2010).  Trust  empathy  and  engagement  are  some  characteristics  that modern customers now seek in their financial service supplier. This means coming up with mechanisms to allow customers to be open honest communicate about their problems and consequently build trust (Chu et al. 2012). Compared to incumbent firms making customer focus paramount is what differentiates FinTechs. FinTechs rely on a deep understanding of the customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s needs and wants by continually offering upgrades on services and offerings find solutions to challenges and fuel innovation (EY 2017a).   2.3.2 Digital revolution  Rapid  advances  in  information  technology  and  mobile  devices  have  already  undergirded some  of  the  most  groundbreaking  innovations  in  financial  services.  For  instance  the movement  towards  a  cashless  society  has  been  implemented  in  countries  like  Nigeria (EzuworeObodoekwe et al. 2014). Technologies such as the radio frequency identification (RFID)  and  near  field  communication  (NFC)  have  gained  increasing  acceptance  and application.  Innovations  such  as  Lollapalooza\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Lolla  Cashless  which  allows  one  to  pay through a wristband are capturing the imagination of the millennial market. Hightech giants have  also  rolled  out  its  own  payment  systems  such  as  Apple  Pay  Google  Pay  and Samsung  Pay.  The  rise  of  Quick  Response  (QR)  codes  which  are  black  and  white  codes read  through  scanners  and  enable  payment  also  indicate  how  the  trend  is  veering  away from the  usual  brickandmortar  branch model  of  banking. QR  codes  are  popularly  used  in Japan and China facilitating $1.65 trillion of mobile payments in 2016 alone (The Economist 2017).  2.3.3 Changing customer expectations   Rapid  digitisation  in  commercial  services  has  bred  greater  expectations  of  convenience among customers. Such expectations are likely to intensify as technologies evolve rapidly to offer  voiceactivation  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  capability  and  realtime  transacting  (EY 2017b). Hence customer expectations with respect to payments and other financial services include speed convenience cost and userfriendliness (du Toit et al. 2018). Moreover  demographic  factors  are  driving  this  shift.  The  increasing  influence  of  socalled millennials  or  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdigital  natives\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  amplifies  the  preference  for  FinTech  and  the  drive  for customerdriven  design  (McCarthy  2015).  In  a  study  it  showed  that  this  market demographic trusts new FinTech entrants more than traditional banks in payments (Milne & Parboteeah 2016).   2.3.4 Changing market structure  As a result of changing customer expectations and rapid digitisation the market structure of the financial market has changed (Financial Stability Board [FSB] 2019). Increasingly digital disruptors are winning new clients and cannibalising the market shares of incumbent banks. Agile  and  innovative  new  entrants  provide  fresh  and  exciting  ideas  to  financial  services which existing universal banks are unable to.   3 \\x0c Consulting group Bain opined in a report that the future of the banking industry is hinged on the  ability  to  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleverage  the  power  of  customer  insight  advanced  analytics  and  digital technology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (as cited in Marous 2018). To stay relevant and competitive banks need to be able  to  improve  their  personalisation  of  the  banking  experience  and  offer  services  by responding  to  what  customers  need  and  want.  Thus  banking  is  right  for  disruption  and innovation  as  a  growing  movement  in  the  industry  is  calling  to  adopt  design  thinking  or humancentered design (Wylie 2017). 3  Design thinking applied in the banking industry  The  application  of  design  thinking  in the  banking  industry  is  a  relatively  new  phenomenon. While  there  have  been  case  studies  written  on  the  potential  that  implementing  design thinking  can  contribute  to  business  success  on  health  education  engineering  and technology  sectors (Patel  &  Khanjan  2017)  there  is  sparse  literature  on  the  application  of design  thinking  or  humancentered  design  on  the  banking  industry.  In  this  section  we unpack what elements of design thinking the banking industry finds relevant for its innovation and review existing cases around the world.    3.1 Suitability of design thinking for banking industry  Until  now  there  is  no  consensus  on  a  standard  definition  of  design  thinking.  One  of  its foremost champions Tim Brown CEO and president of IDEO suggested that design thinking refers to a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmethodology that imbues the full spectrum of innovation activities with a humancentered design ethos\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Brown 2008). David Kelley defines it as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca method for how to come up with [\\xe2\\x80\\xa6] breakthrough ideas that are new to the world especially with respect to complex projects complex problems\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Camacho 2016 p. 88).   What  Brown  and  Kelley  identified  (i)  the  humancenteredness  of  innovation  and  (ii) identification  of  breakthrough  ideas  were  seen  as  the  most  important  factors  in  helping banks assess the suitability of design thinking. In a small market like Singapore there were already  119  banks  competiting  for  a  same  set  of  clients  based  on  very  similar  product offerings.   The hyper competitive banking industry is  hard pressed for change and combined with the above mentioned drivers of shifting to customer focus and digital revolution have contributed to  banking  industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  adaptation  of  design  thinking.  Banks  needed  to  move  from  business and technology driven decision making and embrace cusomter\\xe2\\x80\\x99s insights. They also needed to  digitize  their  offering  but  not  without  capturing  the  inputs  from  their  customers.  In  the below industry analysis we saw that early adopter banks have started to use design thinking as an unique differentiator in the way their products are designed.        3.2 Review of the precedent cases   3.2.1 Hungarian banking industry   Feher and Varga (2017) undertook an exploratory applied research to surface the customercentric challenges faced by seven Hungarian banks using the design thinking approach. The research  was  premised  on  the  need  for  banks  to  gain  deeper  insight  into  what  customers want  identify  these  problems  evaluate  the  challenges  faced  and  ideate  solutions.  The authors  modified  IDEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  fivestep  approach  and  came  up  with  their  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne  Week  Sprint\\xe2\\x80\\x9d methodology which consisted of the following steps   4 \\x0c1.  Preparation problem mapping based on stories 2.  Discovery learning from industry experts 3.  Interpretation  documentation  of  experiences  such  as  stories  postit  notes  visual reminders to identify the need and problems needed to be solved 4.  Ideation brainstorming of ideas 5.  Experimentation presenting the idea through a storyboard PowerPoint or onepage business model canvas and get feedback 6.  Evolution pitching the concept risk analysis tracking progress and learnings  The  results  of  the  study  indicated  problems  in  the  role  of  the  bank  branches  online  and mobile  phone  services  and  products  and  services  as  well  as  several  digital  solutions ideated. For one young customers viewed going to the branch as an annoyance and when customers need to personally appear the waiting time was long and dull. During the ideation phase  the  group  came  up  with  ideas  such  as  providing  tablet  games  to  know  customer intentions  while  waiting  providing  multifunctionality  in  mobile  banking  services  such  as augmented reality and visioning of an online bank where important personal data is readily available.   3.2.2 National Australian Bank   The  National  Australian  Bank  (NAB)  partnered  with  consulting  group  Oliver  Wyman  to provide  customercentric  solutions  for  their  small  and  medium  enterprise  (SMEs)  clients (Oliver Wyman & IESE 2017). Using the fivestep IDEO design thinking methodology NAB utilised  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cday  in  the  life  of\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  tool  to  relive  how  clients  experience  the  lending  process leading  them  to  define  that  the  process  was  complex  timeconsuming  preference  of unsecured  products  and  preference  for  mobile  services.  From  the  ideation  process  an online application called the NAB Quickbiz Loan was formulated. This app consisted only of three steps and tied to a cashflow credit model that allowed SMEs to secure up to $50000 in  business  loans  with  a  decisionmaking  time  of  60  seconds  and  three  days  funds disbursement (Oliver Wyman & IESE 2017).   3.2.3 Deutsche Bank   Germany\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Deutsche  Bank  endeavoured  to  promote  design  thinking  organisationally  by starting with their IT department first rather than imposing it on the entire organisation. It first partnered  with  design  thinking  experts  as  well  as  a  small  design  thinking  team  in  the department  that  focused  solely  on  completing  successful  projects.  The  design  thinking transformation at Deutsche Bank went in three phases  Learning (P1)  Adapting (P2) and Diffusing  (P3)  (Vetterli  Uebernickel  Brenner  &  Petrie  2016).  Once  the  IT  community started  observing  results  from  this  design  thinking  team  the  adaptation  of  design  thinking proceeded  step  by  step.  Soon  the  design  thinking  community  in  the  bank  grew  to  150 members  in  IT  who  shared  and  exchanged  knowledge  with  others.    This  effort  led  to  the completion of the first prototype in less than a year and the second prototype in less than 18 months. In five years eight customercentric projects were completed. After this \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubversion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was considered adequate design thinking was embedded in the company with the hiring of a Vice President for Design Thinking (Vetterli et. al. 2016)   3.2.4 Singapore Banks   In  Singapore  the  pioneers  of  design  thinking  in  the  financial  services  are  DBS  Bank  and OCBC  Bank  both  awardees  in  design  and  service  excellence.  DBS  Bank  acclaimed  by Euromoney  as  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cworld\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  best  digital  bank\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (Groenfeldt  2018)  rolled  out  their  first successful design thinking project \\xe2\\x80\\x98DBS Home Connect\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in 2013. Fueled by a leadership that is  passionate  and  serious  about  entrenching  design  thinking  DBS  transformed  its technology infrastructure to accommodate Big Data AI and biometrics (DBS Bank 2016).   5 \\x0c Figure 1. DBS Home Connect. (Source DBS Bank)    DBS Home Connect was the result of several customer consultations and ideation that led to a  smartphone  app  which  allows  users  to  calculate  mortgage  payments for  home  buys  and check information on previous transactions including rental information (Tan 2013).  OCBC  Bank  implemented  design  principles  in  its  innovation  efforts.  In  coming  up  with solutions  OCBC  used  customer  insight  cocreation  community  engagement  stakeholder involvement  and  experimentation  adapting  from  IDEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  fivestep  design  thinking  method. For example OCBC Bank developed a family and kidfriendly bank policy called OCBC FullService Sunday Banking using design thinking. The bank used the diary research technique to  produce  an  \\xe2\\x80\\x9coutside  in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  perspective  focus  group  discussions  moment  mapping  for prototype and testing and learning labs for learning (Wah 2013).    The abovereview of the precedent cases leads us to identify a few common patterns on the adoption  of  design  thinking  in  the  banking  industry.  Firstly  the  initial  adoption  of  design thinking  is  typically  influenced  by  the framework  and  processes  of IDEO. The  popularity  of IDEO\\xe2\\x80\\x99s framework could be attributed to the many successful case studies they have under their belt that covers a broad spectrum of industries (see Brown 2008). Secondly after the initial usage of design thinking the broad sentiment is to localize the design thinking process to  suit  the  bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  own  process  and  type  of  customers  engagement  they  are  involved  in. Thirdly design thinking projects are first used on retail/mass customer segment rather than corporate  or  High  Nett  Worth  (HNW)  customers  as  retail  customers  are  easier  to  engage and to apply design thinking on. Corporate or HNW customers are typically harder to engage to demostrate the value of design thinking.   4  Case study   The previous section gave us a broad base understanding of how design thinking has been used  in  the  banking  industries  around  the  world.  In  this  section  we  will  introduce  a  case study  so  as  to  examine  in  more  detail  firstly  in  what  kind  of  formats  or  processes  design thinking  is  adopted  in  the  actual  innovation  project  in  the  bank  secondly  what  kind  of benefits design thinking brings to the bank and lastly what are the limitations in its current adoption.  The  case  chosen  is  the  Smart  Senior  pilot  program  (DBS  Bank  2018)  by  DBS Bank in Singapore launched in May 2018. Smart Senior is an initiative launched by POSB (a fully  owned  subsidiary  of  DBS  Bank)  to  help  the  senior  citizen  embrace  digitization  and cashless  payments.  Singapore  defines  elderly  residents  as  those  65  years  old  and  above and in year 2018 that accounts for 13.7% of its total population of 5.638 million (Department  6 \\x0cof  Statistics  Singapore  2019).  This  is  in  alignment  of  the  broader  Smart  Nation  agenda pursued  by  the  Singapore\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  government  and  also  by  the  bank  (Smart  Nation  and  Digital Government Office  2018). This program was launched by DBS Bank/POSB in partnership with the Yishun Riverwalk Resident Committee (RC) and Republic Polytechnic (RP).   In this project DBS Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Innovation Management team played the coaching role guiding the  students  from  RP  instead  of  conducting  the  indepth  interviews  and  observations  for design thinking due to the two reasons of (i) shortage of manpower as the project required large  number  of  interviews  within  a  short  span of  time.  The  RC  advised  that  the team  had two halfday sessions to engage sixty senior citizens and (ii) as part of DBS\\xe2\\x80\\x99 commitment to industry projects to upskill the students to RP and provide actual use cases for the students to experience the tools and theories learnt in classroom.

The process and tools used by DBS Bank is largely aligned to the fivestep methodology of  design thinking mentioned above.  Design  7 \\x0cthinking was chosen as the issue is one that is rooted in the human\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behaviours habits and preferences.  As  DBS  have  also  seen  limited  success  with  previous  senior  engagement projects the iterative approach allows the project team to iterate and test before deciding on a firm outcome for implementation.    Figure 2. DBS Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 4D framework. (Source DBS Bank)   In  Discover  phase  the  DBS  team  collaborated  with  the  students  from  RP  to  discover  the needs pain points and problems of sixty selected senior citizens. To enable the students to conduct  the  focus  groups  effectively  a  training  and  demonstration  was  conducted  by  the Innovation Management team of DBS bank to help them understand indepth interviews and observation techniques. The key findings from the user research by the students focused on day  to  day  lifestyle  and  habits  of  the  elderly  their  social  relationships  and  networks  their financial attitudes and lastly their experiences on digital platforms and cashless payment.   In the Define phase DBS Bank and People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Association gathered together for an ideation workshop  to  identify  the  opportunity  areas.  At  the  end  of  the  workshop  the  participants identified  four  smart  value  propositions  of  smart  payments  smart  transport  smart communication  and  smart  fitness.  These  four  smart  features  will  be  designed  into  a  card sleeve worn around the neck as they observed elderly wearing similar lanyards in the past and  would  face  less  implementation  barrier  as  compared  to  a  format  they  are  less  familiar with.   In  the  Develop  phase  user  testing  was  conducted  to  understand  if  the  four  key  features were aligned to what they wanted. They were presented with a concept board with writeups of  the  features  in  different  languages  (Chinese  Malay  Tamil  and  English)  and  different versions of how the wearable devices could look like (see Figure 3).   8 \\x0cFigure 3. Different versions of the proposed wearable device for experimentation. (Source DBS Bank)    Based on the inputs captured during the user testing sessions the elderly wanted to have a more  flexible  format  that  could  be  worn  in  different  ways.  Apart  from  form  factor  the respondents  also  gave  various  inputs  on the  effectiveness  of  the  pedometer  use  cases  of cashless payment which were all captured for subsequent considerations.   Taking all the feedback into considerations DBS moved into Deliver phase by issuing a RFP (Request  for  Proposal)  and  identified  a  partner  to  help  manufacture  the  devices.  62 participants were selected from the Yishun Riverwalk district to take part in the threemonths pilot. The selection criteria include being a resident of the Yishun Riverwalk community that is launching the program being cash dependent. The program would allow DBS and PA to understand if elderly would switch to cashless payment methods and if the behaviour would remain after the program concludes.          Figure 4. The Smart Senior Package (Source DBS Bank)   9 \\x0c The  eventual  package  produced  by  the  vendor  is  one  that  is  flexible  and  convenient  with various ways of attaching the card sleeve (see Figure 4).    4.2 Outcomes   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI was very excited when I first heard of the POSB Smart Senior Program as I can do so many things with just one device! Now I can try using contactless payments when paying for my morning cup of coffee!\\xe2\\x80\\x9d   Mdm  Morie  Lim  Teck  Cheo  60  years  old  Yishun  Riverwalk  resident  (DBS  Bank 2018)   The  Smart  Senior  pilot  was  officially  launched  on  5th  May  2018  by  Education  Minister  Ong Ye  Kung.  The  threemonths  pilot  concluded  in  August  2018  and  provided  the  bank  with  a rich opportunity to understand and observe the cashless usage of the elderly. The outcome of  the  pilot  was  encouraging.  The  active  engagement  was  observed  from  all  62  elderly participants and cashless numbers went up. Some highlights of pilot outcome include  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  40% of elderly converted to cashless methods over the course of three months \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Step tracking is a popular feature that was heavily utilized \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Smart  communication  feature  proves  to  be  unpopular  as  many  elderly  were  opting out of it \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Many  elderly  reverted  to  carrying  the  elderly  concession  card  instead  of  using  the wearable device as it offered them a cheaper fare \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The wearable format did not reduce the fear of elderly losing their card  4.3 The Role of Design Thinking  After the conclusion of the Smart Senior Program the Innovation Management team of DBS Bank conducted a series of indepth interviews with key stakeholders who participated in the pilot  to  discuss  the  learnings  and  takeaways  from  this  pilot  and  the  process  of  Journey Thinking was mentioned in several instances   4.3.1 Strong focus on customers  As  compared  to  the  usual  problem  solving  framework  of  the  bank  where  customers  were rarely  consulted  and  decisions  were  driven  by  business  profitability  and  technology feasibility design thinking provided two opportunities where all the stakeholders would have to engage the customers in an indepth way.   First  of  all  while  the  Product  Managers from  POSB  had  years  of  experience  engaging the senior citizens and the RC volunteers work with their residents on a daily basis there were blind spots in their understanding and assumptions that they have formed up over the years. The  focus  groups  and  test  gave  them  an  opportunity  to  clarify  their  doubts  and  most importantly  listen  to  the  senior  citizens  instead  of  coming  in  as  an  expert  to  solve  their problems.  Secondly  the  experiments  also gave  the  team added  confidence  on the  robustness  of the insights and helped the Product Managers adjust the value propositions before launching it  10 \\x0cinto the market. This gave the team assurance on the desirability of the product which was absent in traditional decision making process.  4.3.2 Rigorous process for analysing and communicating insights   While surveys were conducted in the past the product team in DBS bank often did not have the  tools  to  conduct  more  indepth  analysis  of  the  data  captured.  The  channels  of engagement also did not afford the team such an opportunity to dig deeper. By embracing the approaches of design thinking the team felt that the postinterviewing process of writing verbatims  clustering  them  according  to  themes  identified  and  the  writing  of  insights statement  is  a  much  more  rigorous  process  as  compared  to  relying  on  superficial  survey data.  The  team  knew  exactly  which  verbatim  and  thematic  clusters  contributed  to  the insights.  This  not  only  gave  the  sponsors  greater  confidence  that  the  insights  were  sound but  also  helped  the  subsequent  ideation  process  where  the  team  had much more  indepth context around the insights to ideate on.   Before  embracing  this  new  way  of  working  insights  were  largely  used  as  a  loose  term anything and everything could be an insight and the experience of the person identifying the insights  then  became  paramount  in  ensuring  good  outcome.  The  person  collating  the  data and writing up insights also needs to be present during ideation otherwise we run the risk of losing precious context. Design thinking brought replicability of  the insight process which is well appreciated by the team and also their sponsors.  4.3.3 Experiments and iterations   The running of experiments to test value proposition is a completely new way of working for most  stakeholders  on  the  project.  Prior  to  Smart  Senior  the  Product  Managers  in POSB/DBS Bank were exposed to the concept of running User Acceptance Testing (UAT) which centered around user interface experience (UI/UX) and less of the core product value proposition  itself.  Those  tests  were  built  on  the  assumption  that  the  product  was  what  the customers wanted which is a huge risk the Product Mangers had to bear. The rapid iteration model introduced by design thinking required the Product Mangers to make quick decisions or  tweaks  for  the  next  round  helping  them  see  a  difference  in  desirability  within  a  short turnaround time with no additional investment.   In a postinterview conducted with the POSB Product Manager they mentioned that even if they  do  not  adopt  the  whole  process  in  their  next  project  they  will  ensure  that  they experiment and test before launching any products into the market in the future.       4.4 Limitations   In the case study of Smart Senior Program it was initiated by the management of DBS Bank and the Yishun Riverwalk RC. With a top down mandate the team was given the required resource and time to cocreate a desired outcome.   The  conducting  of  interviews  running  of  ideation  session  and  conducting  of  experiments take time causing many to revert back to the usual way of working by jumping straight to a potential solution based on their experiences. The unrealistic expectations of sponsors very often get into the way of conducting rigorous research as they would try to compress certain stages of the process from weeks to days.  Another common pain point was the lack of trained personal to lead the teams through the design  thinking  process.  Only  high  prioritized  projects  such  as  Smart  Senior  got  the  help required  and  others  would  have  to  wait  or  selfserve  using  the tools  and framework  of the  11 \\x0cbank. In addition to the leadership support a more robust training and support model would also help operationalize design thinking in a better way. improving 5  Discussion and Conclusion   By the  entire  customer  experience  design  thinking  enhances  customer relationships  and  adds  value  to  the  value  proposition  of  a  banks  business  model.  As illustrated in the reviewed case studies establishing design thinking as a pivotal element in business  strategy  can  strengthen  the  bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  position  as  it  ensures  that  customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  needs and  expectations  are  addressed.  Nevertheless  embedding  design  thinking  is  a  complex endeavour. By following the insights captured and experimenting not all results are going to be positive in the first instance as demostrated by the Smart Senior Program.   A strong leadership committed to change as exemplified in the experiences of DBS Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Smart  Senior  Program  would  be  key  to  enable  teams  to  learn  and  get  better  at  each iteration. Design thinking can also pave the way for innovation not only of standalone banks but of the entire industry as illustrated in the Hungarian experience (Feher & Varga 2017). While  the  reviewed  case  studies  of  design  thinking  application  in  banks  paint  a  promising picture  of  how  design  methods  can  fuel  innovation  the  field  still  requires  more  rigorous holistic  and  systematic  methods  to  address  complex  stakeholder  relationships  and incorporate very recent approaches like data analytics.  Many  products  and  services  rolled  out  using  design  thinking  methods  also  need  time  to prove the value it brings to help ensure continued usage and commitment. More studies in the  Asian  context  also  needs  to  be  pursued  as  the  Asian  financial  industry  has  evolved rapidly and has seen less dependencies on western markets. With Asia looking increasingly different  it  will  be  hard  to  generalize  the  western  trends  in  Asia.  Moreover  further  studies investigating  the  relationship  of  design  thinking  to  metrics  of  business  success  such  as profitability should also be further explored.  6  References Arnold D. & Jeffery P.
