Abstract.  Supply chain finance is a useful and important way for relieving the financial difficulties of smalltomedium sized enterprises (hereafter referred to as SMEs) since it takes inventory or some flow capital of the financing enterprises as pledge breaks through the  traditional  mortgage  model  and  relieves  the  urgent  need  of  cash  flow  for  loan enterprises. The modes of supply chain finance increase the option of financing methods and  opportunities  for  SMEs  and  greatly  reduce  the  risk  of  participants  in  the  business. Along with the participation of more commercial banks as well as the appearance of more businesses  supply  chain  finance  will  get  a  broader  development  to  meet  the  needs  of SMEs and thus promote economic development in China.

Introduction One  of  the  main  reasons  of  SMEs  financing  problems  is  that  the  loan  conditions  of commercial  banks  are  too  strict.  In  order  to  reduce  the  credit  risk  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  commercial banks have established credit rating system and only the customers of A AA level and above  can  have  access  to  obtain  new  loans.  The  banks  have  also  generally  raised  the minimum  capital  conditions  and  loan  conditions  for  their  customers.  However  the                                                  \\xef\\x80\\xab  Corresponding author.    Email address davidliu@hkuspace.edu.cn  015 \\x0c                                                                                                                                                          majority of SMEs is difficult to meet such high requirements and thus excluded from the banking  credit  system.  In  addition  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  stateowned  commercial  banks  have  been operated  as  administrative  organization  in  a  long  run  focusing  on  the  state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s macroeconomic  objectives  providing  loans  for  the  stateowned  enterprises  and  are reluctant  to  grant  loans  for  nonstateowned  enterprises.  This  situation  has  changed  in recent years but still universal. According to the traditional practice of bank credit SMEs are considered as highrisk borrowers who need to pay higher costs. SMEs often obtained funds from the banks only through  secured  loans  or  mortgages  which  have  more  complicated  procedures  shorter terms  and  higher  fees.  Some  guarantee  institutions  have  tougher  conditions  than  that  of bank  loans  and  even  demand  the  counterguarantees.  It  is  estimated  that  the  fees  of handling a mortgage are generally around 0.5%1% and the average guarantee rates are around 1%2%. These factors greatly increase the costs of funds and restrain the financing capacity of SMEs. Seen from a deep insight the problems of financing difficulties of SMEs not only affect themselves but also impose a limitation on the entire economic development. Due to large appearance  of  SMEs  China  is  gradually  shaping  a  new  organizational  system  of production based on the precise division of labor within industries which have improved the production efficiency and reduced the cost of manufacturing. However if the financial costs  become  too  high  the  competitive  advantages  of  the  new  system  compared  to  the traditional mode will be weakened and even lose. Therefore how to change the modes of financing  and  reduce  the  financial  cost  of  entire  supply  chain  has  become  an  important challenge to the new organizational system of production and thus we can seek a solution for SMEs financing from the perspective of the entire supply chain.  2.  Financing Difficulties of SMEs SMEs  as  a  high  efficiency  economic  group  plays  an  important  role  in  promoting economic  growth technologies  and  culturing entrepreneurial  spirit  and  they  are  also  the  best  active  part  for  improving  market competition & rational resource distribution. In China SMEs perform a great function for increasing  employment innovating  016 \\x0c                                                                                                                                                          national economy & social development. Information shows that the quantity of SMEs in our country is about 43000000 99% of total enterprises and they create 60% of national economy  and  50%  of  fiscal  &  tax  revenue  and  provide  80%  of  employment  posts. Therefore accelerating healthy development of SMEs is of great importance to promote economic growth increase fiscal & tax revenue expand urban & rural employment and maintain social stability. However SMEs face many difficulties during development and one of them is financing difficulty. According to one piece of information of National Development and Innovation Committee  only  10%  of  these  enterprises  obtained  bank  loans  5%  got  the  local  public subsidy  1%  was  the  targets  of  venture  investors  and  1%  was  listed  thus  so  many enterprises fall into the business difficulty and are even bankrupted due to lack of funds. There are a lot of reasons of financing difficulty. One important reason is that their credit is low  so  it  is  difficult  to  obtain  the  fiduciary  loans  of  commercial  banks.  Mortgaged immovable asset is commonly less so these enterprises cannot get the assurance of largescale enterprises. Therefore it is still very difficult for them to obtain financing services provided  by  banks  under  current  circumstances.  On  the  other  hand  they  have  much movable estate.  For SMEs real asset resource depletion and assurance with excess real asset dependence result  in  financing  difficulty  but  they have a  large  amount  of  idle  movable  estate.  This contradiction leads to the financing difficulty of SMEs and the supply chain finance is just the new solution. Supply  chain  finance  is  an  innovation  in  the  logistics  and  financial  infrastructure  it extend financing from merchandise sales to the procurement and production stage on the basis  of  financing  in  the  logistics.  Supply  chain  financing  models  help  to  alleviate financing  problem  of  SMEs  in  dealing  with  the  core  enterprise  to  a  certain  extent.  This financing  model  allows  the  core  enterprises  to  further  reduce  costs  improve  efficiency enhance  market  competitiveness  and  can  solve  the  cash  flow  problems  of  upstream  and downstream of SMEs allows thirdparty logistics enterprises to secure customer resources to  expand  the  range  of  services  ultimately  improve  service  quality  and  efficiency  of logistics  enterprises  at  the  same  time  it  also  allows  commercial  banks  to  expand  the  017 \\x0c                                                                                                                                                          intermediate business income source stable settlement deposits. Visibly it allows multiple parties to maximize the benefits and the formation of the credibility of the chain. 3.  Mode of Operation of Supply Chain Finance  Combined with the characteristics of the cycle of SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 operations management supply chain  finance  of  commercial  banks  has  the  corresponding  three  models  the  Chattel Mortgage modes accounts receivable financing mode confirmation warehouse financing model.  3.1. Accounts receivable financing model  In  the  accounts  receivable  financing  mode  documentary  evidence  of  the  receivables  of SMEs to the core large enterprises in the supply chain will be taken as pledge the SMEs apply for shortterm loans from commercial banks with a period not exceeding the aging of accounts receivable then the banks will provide financing for SMEs in the supply chain. Simply  put  it  is  behaviors  apply  for  loans  from  financial  institutions  with  unexpired receivables. In this mode the core large enterprises debt enterprises play a role in counterguarantee for SMEs financing as for its good credit strength as well as longterm stability of the credit relationship between banks. Once SMEs cannot repay the loan it must bear the corresponding repayment obligations.  3.2. Chattel Mortgage mode  Commercial  banks  take  the  borrower's  own  goods  as  pledge  to  issue  credit  loans  to  the borrower  in  the  mode.  SMEs  have  their  chattels  such  as  inventory  warehouse  receipts merchandise certificate and etc. pledged to banks to obtain loans. Chattel mortgage mode change \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdead\\xe2\\x80\\x9d certificate of goods or rights to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9clive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d assets accelerate the flow of real estate ease the pressure of cash flow shortage of SMEs address the lack of SME liquidity improve the operational capability of SMEs.  3.3. Confirmation warehouse financing model  Confirmation  warehouse  financing  model  a  supply  chain  finance  business  based  on  the downstream  and  Right  of  taking  delivery  of  goods  is  based  on  a  supply  chain  finance  018 \\x0c                                                                                                                                                          business  on  upstream  and  downstream  and  merchandise  delivery  rights.  The  business  is mainly carried out by the cooperation agreement signed by the manufacturers distributors warehouses and banks for particular business bankers' acceptances is the main product and financial instrument in this mode. This business model realize the leverage procurement and supplier of bulk sales of financing corporate provide financing for small and medium enterprises in the supply chain solute the financial predicament of its full purchases so that the risk of bank loans greatly reduced effectively.  Financing model is different from the traditional mode of financing is a notable feature of the financial supply chain. Supply chain finance is not isolated to assess the financial condition  and  credit  risk  of  individual  enterprises  but  focus  on  the  research  of  its importance to the entire supply chain and its status as well as past transactions with the core enterprise. It also different from the traditional supply chain finance mortgage of fixed assets it take full advantage of the chattel property or rights generated in the production process of the supply chain as a guarantee that is financing of inventories prepayments accounts  receivable  and  other  assets  based  on  commodity  trading  and  extend  the  good credit  capacity  of  core  enterprise  to  the  upstream  and  downstream  SMEs  in  the  supply chain. In addition it emphasizes on selfliquidating credit repayment sources that are using the  sales  revenue  directly  for  repayment  of  the  credit.  Supply  chain  finance  financing model  not  only  introduces  the  core  enterprise  of  credit  to  have  credit  bundled  but  also introduce the cooperation of the logistics enterprise to assume regulatory responsibility of goods.                                                                                                                             4.  The Realistic Significance of Carrying on supply chain finance Business on dealing with SMEs  Supply chain finance business has brought a new source of profit for commercial bank also promoted the development of warehousing logistics into a higher level. The important realistic significance of carrying on and popularizing logistics financing business for small and mediumsized enterprises that in the condition of financial dilemma is as follows  019 \\x0c                                                                                                                                                          4.1. Solve the problems of collateral deficit in SMEs finance and reduce the financing cost of small and mediumsized enterprises Due to low credit level and lack of mortgageable fixed assets it is difficult for SMEs to obtain the credit financing from banks. Through the logistics financial service inventory and other current assets are mortgaged by SMEs with financing. In this way the traditional fixed assets mortgage mode has been broken and at the same time the badly needed capital of the loan enterprises is relieved. Banks possess both the concrete guaranty and guarantee by logistics and warehouse enterprise with good reputation or goods management so the loan risk will reduce greatly. 4.2. Reduce the information asymmetry phenomenon between SMEs and banks and upgrade the credit level of SMEs In supply chain finance thirdparty logistics enterprise authorized by financial institutions should learn dynamically about logistics information of SMEs in detail so as to help the bank  to  get  precise  internal  information  of  SMEs  timely  and  judge  scientifically  the profitability  and  loan  repayment  capacity  of  SMEs  based  on  these  information  thus ensuring  the  security  and  profitability  of  capital  to  reduce  the  information  asymmetry phenomenon between SMEs and banks as well as be good to the establishment of credit system of SMEs to reduce the occurrence of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadverse selection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoral hazard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of SMEs during financing and enhance the enthusiasm of bank lending for SMEs. 4.3. Raise the fund utilization efficiency of the financial companies In  the  process  of  manufacture  and  operation  of  minor  enterprises  there  are  lots  of  raw materials  semifinished  products  and  finished  products  that  occupy  a  lot  of  funds  and increase capital cost of the enterprise. Supply chain finances allow the financial company to make a loan by mortgaging their raw materials and their products available at the market so as to solve the financing problems of the enterprise in realizing scale management and expansion  effectively  activate  the  sedimentary  money  raise  the  flow  efficiency  of  the funds as well as raise the utilization rate of the enterprise capital.  020 \\x0c                                                                                                                                                          5.  Risk Prevention  5.1.  To strengthen the financial risk management of the supply chain Hosting banks organized supply chain finance should always pay attention to the operation of  the  supply  chain  to  grasp  the  weak  point  of  the  enterprise's  internal  supply  chain observing  the  trends  of  the  external  environment.  Establish  a  set  of  early  warning evaluation  index  system.  Besides  the  banks  can  establish  credit  model  and  database change the static assessment for dynamic assessment according to their management needs.  Select corporate chain group with good basic conditions 5.2. Continuously select good supply chain enterprises mainly focus on the relatively complete industry  chain  in  the  steel  automobile  petrochemical  power  telecommunications industries with relatively complete industrial chain good order and the higher the level of cooperation with banks. To guide core enterprise to take the evaluation of the credit as an important  criterion  for  the  process  of  selecting  the  members  of  the  enterprise\\xef\\xbc\\x8crigorous screen all franchisee enterprises. Provide quality services mainly through core enterprises 5.3. Start with the core enterprises radiate outward throughout the supply chain upstream and downstream  enterprises  in  the  design  of  products  and  services.  To  combine  product innovation  to  provide  personalized  service  start  from  the  customer  needs  providing  a range  of  innovative  services  such  as  management  marketing  and  cash  management restructuring  enterprise  supply  chain  supply  chain  financing  to  the  maximum  extent possible to meet the individual needs of customers.  5.4.  Construct supply chain security mechanisms Closed operate among logistics information flow and capital flow. Supply chain finance should choose a powerful logistics company and cooperate with it to achieve the purpose of  controlling  the  goods  rights  with  information  for  the  supply  chain  warehousing  and logistics  services  provided  by  the  logistics  company.  Banks  can  master  operating information of the entire supply chain enterprises while financing and servicing the entire  021 \\x0c                                                                                                                                                          supply chain this will reduce the asymmetry of information between enterprises and banks. In  addition  by  making  various  contracts  to  maintain  cooperation  relationship  between equal stakeholders mandatory implementation of the rules can be provide for supply chain operation. Besides this measure can avoid friction as much as possible and improve the operational efficiency of the supply chain.   6.  Conclusion  Financing difficulty of SMEs has become a common predicament for the development of SMEs. In one of the industry supply chain SMEs always operate and cooperate around the core  business  its  cash  flow  gap  is  mainly  produced  in  the  accounts  receivable  pay prepayments  and  inventory  warehousing  period  most  of  which  are  the  liquidity  and intangible assets. Supply chain finance is the new financial instruments designed for the SMEs lacking of fixed assets and possessing more current assets which are very relevant in the context of the characteristics of SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financing this enhances the ability of SME credit and helps to resolve its financing difficulties. But supply chain finance is still in its infancy  domestically  theoretical  and  practical  research  should  be  strengthened  on  its product development organizational structure risk control and other respects. For China's commercial  banks  and  enterprises  supply  chain  finance  brings  a  new  business  growth point for the former while the latter can take full advantage of the financial innovation to better achieve their own financing needs.  7.
