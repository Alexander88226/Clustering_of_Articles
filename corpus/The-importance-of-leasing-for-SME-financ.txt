here  in file  THE IMPORTANCE OF LEASING FOR SME FINANCING    The importance of   leasing for SME   financing    By Helmut KraemerEis & Frank Lang 1 European Investment Fund    T    he  ability  of  SMEs  to  access  finance is important for funding  business  investment   ensuring  businesses  reach  their  growth  potential   and  for  facilitating  new  business  start  ups; a lack of finance can constrain cash  flow  and  hamper  businesses’  survival  prospects (BIS  2012).     Typically   SMEs  are  not  able  to  raise  money  directly  in  the  capital  markets  and are therefore – with regard to exter  nal sources – mainly dependent on tradi  tional  bank  financing   which  is  itself  limited by constraints due to banks’ refi  nancing capacity  their risk appetite and  capital  adequacy  (see  e.g.  KraemerEis   Lang  and Gvetadze  2013).    An important element of SME finance  is  not  directly  provided  by  banks  through  traditional  loans  but  rather  by  leasing  or  factoring  companies.  The  intention of this article is to enhance the  awareness of leasing and its importance  as  additional  financing  technique  for  SMEs  that  expands  the  access  to  short  and  mediumterm  financing  for  capital  equipment.     Leasing as integral part of the financing tool  set. To what extent do SMEs use leasing?  SMEs  finance  themselves  to  a  great  extent by internal sources  both from the  business  owner  and  through  retained  profit.  Many  SMEs  also  use  external  sources  of  finance   informal  sources  (such  as  family  and  friends   and  some  types  of  business  angel  investment)  and  formal sources  such as bank loans  leas  ing   trade  credits   factoring  and  more  “formal”  venture  capital.  Nevertheless   as mentioned above  SMEs have usually  more  difficulties  in  accessing  external  financing  than  large  enterprises.  We  could even simplify that  the smaller and  younger  a  company  is   the  bigger  its  financing  challenge  (Pelly  and  Kraemer  Eis  2012).    This  general  picture  is  confirmed  by  recent  empirical  evidence.  According  to  the  ECB’s  “survey  on  the  access  to  finance of SMEs in the Euro area”  cov  ering  April  to  September  2013  (ECB   2013)   access  to  finance  remained  the  second  most  pressing  problem  for  Euro  area SMEs  and it appears to be a more  severe  concern  for  SMEs  than  for  large  firms. However  the most pressing prob  lem  for  SMEs  was  still  “finding  cus  tomers”.     The  composition  of  external  sources  of finance has changed somewhat during  the  past  years  (see  Table  1).  While  the  ECB data does not isolate leasing prod  ucts  specifically   “leasing   hirepurchase  and  factoring”  taken  together2 has  always  ranked  either  second  or  third  among  the  categories  of  mostlyused    external financing sources  preceded only  by  “bank  overdrafts   credit  lines  and  credit card overdrafts” and several times  also  by  “bank  loans”.  Compared  to  2009   the  importance  of  “leasing   hire  purchase and factoring” even increased.  The  relatively  high  importance  of  leasing  for  the  external  financing  of  SMEs  is  confirmed  by  the  study  “The  Use  of  Leasing  Amongst  European  SMEs” (prepared by Oxford Economics  (2011)  on  behalf  of  Leaseurope).3 In  2010   according  to  the  survey   leasing  was the most popular source of external  financing  which was used by 40% of the  surveyed  SMEs.4 The  second  most  important external financing source was  bank loans of more than three years.     However   even  if  a  large  number  of  SMEs  use  leasing   the  share  of  invest    Table 1  Sources of external financing of Euro area SMEs    50    40    30    20    10    •    •    0    09/HY1    •    •    •    •    •    •    •    •    •    •    •    •    •    •    10/HY1    10/HY2    11/HY1    11/HY2    12/HY1    12/HY2    13/HY1    •    •    09/HY2    Bank overdafts  credit lines  credit card overdrafts       Bank loans   Trade credits       Leasing  hirepurchase and factoring  Grants or subsidised bank loan       Debt securities issued  Subordinated or participation loans or similar instrument  Equity investments in your firm       Other loan    •    •    Note  Over the preceding six months; percentage of respondents.

Bank  loans  (all  maturities  taken  together  plus  other  forms of bank loans) are used to finance  a  larger  part  of  SMEs’  investments  (31.2%).     However  when looking only at those  SMEs that actually used leasing in 2010   the share of investment financed by leas  ing  is  higher  (32.4%)  and  exceeds  the  shares  of  investment  financed  by  bank  loans (30.1%) or by any other financing  source. Thus  for SMEs which decide to  lease  an  asset   this  instrument  becomes  on  average  the  most  important  part  of  their financing tool set.    Scaling  up  the  figures  from  the  eight  country  sample   Oxford  Economics  (2011) estimates the SME leasing volume  for the whole EU to be e100bn for 2010  which corresponds to 52% of total leas  ing to businesses.

As depicted in Table 3  the estimated  total  new  SME  leasing  volumes  show  remarkable  differences  across  countries.  France held the leading position in 2010  with  an  estimated  new  SME  leasing  volume of e19bn. In contrast  SME leas  ing  plays  a   the  Netherlands.    smaller     role     in     What  kind  of  SMEs  use  leasing?  When looking at different enterprise size  classes in the EU  the use of most exter  nal   sources  on  average  increases  with  company  size  (see  Table  4); the same applies to leasing (including  hire purchase and factoring).    financing     According  to  the  2013  results  of  the  European  Commission’s  (2013a)  SMEs’  Access  to  Finance  Survey   only  19%  of  SMEs  with  one  to  nine  employees  used  leasing (including hire purchase and fac  toring) as a funding source  compared to  43% of business with 10 to 49 employ  ees   54%  of  businesses  with  50  to  249  employees and 60% of large enterprises  (with 250 or more employees).     to     the     According     European  Commission  (2013a)   there  was  also  a  difference  by  turnover   While  approxi  mately  half  of  the  companies  with  a  turnover  greater  than  e2m  made  use  of  leasing  hire purchase or factoring  only  24%  of  SMEs  with  a  smaller  turnover  used this type of financing. SMEs in the  industry  sector  were  more  likely  than  those  in  other  sectors  to  have  used  this  source – 42% had done so  while those  in  the  trade  sector  were  least  likely  (31%). These results are broadly in line  with  the  findings  of  Oxford  Economics  (2011).  2    While  it  is  generally  difficult  for  young firms to access external financing  sources  SMEs’ access to leasing seems to  develop quicker than the access to other  sources of external financing as depicted  in  Table  5.  According  to  the  Oxford  Economics  (2011)  survey   the  relative  importance of leasing was highest for rel  atively  young  enterprises  aged  between  two and five years.    The  advantage  of  leasing  for  young  SMEs and other enterprises that are con  sidered  to  bear  comparably  high  credit  risk is also shown by relatively low rejec  tion rates. Despite an increase from 2007    to  2010   leasing  remained  the  financing  source with the lowest rate of unsuccess  ful applications.     Moreover  the success rates in obtain  ing  leasing  finance  are  relatively  similar  between  the  so  called  gazelles   i.e.  the  young  highgrowth  enterprises   and  all  SMEs.  For  other  forms  of  finance  (e.g.  bank  overdrafts  or  credit  lines)  gazelles  show  considerably  lower  approval  rates  than other enterprises in most countries  (see  also  Table  6).  Thus   the  OECD  (2012)  concludes  that  “[l]easing  is  the  form  of  finance  that  appears  to  be  equally suitable for enterprises with dif    Table 3  Estimated new SME leasing volumes by country   in 2010    n  b  c    20     18     16     14     12     10     8     6     4     2     0     NL      PL      SE      ES      UK      IT      DE      FR      Source  Oxford Economics (2011).    THE IMPORTANCE OF LEASING FOR SME FINANCING    Table 4  EU enterprises having used different financing   sources (by enterprise size class)    60    50    40    30    20    10    0    1–9    employees    10–49    employees    50–249    employees    All    SMEs    250+    employees    Bank overdraft  credit line  credit cards overdraft        Bank loan  Trade credit        Leasing  hirepurchase  factoring    Note  Over the preceding six months; percentage of respondents; survey conducted from August to   October 2013.

When looking at country level  large  differences  in  the  use  of  leasing  appear  (see Table 7). In the latest period (August  to  October  2013)   the  European Commission (2013a b) survey  was  conducted   34.5%  of  SMEs  used  leasing  hire purchase or factoring in the  whole  EU.  However   while  approxi  mately  half  of  all  SMEs  made  use  of    for  which     instruments     these   in  Germany  and  Estonia   their  use  was  relatively  small  among  SMEs  in  Cyprus   but  also  in  Romania and Greece.     Why  and  how  do  SMEs  use  leasing?  According to Oxford Economics (2011)   SMEs  on  average  have  a  variety  of  rea  sons  for  their  decision  to  lease  an  asset  (see Table 8) – the main reason seems to  be  price  considerations  (price  of  leasing  relative to other financing forms).     The  importance  of  different  reasons  for  using  leasing  becomes  clearer  when    Table 5  Use of financing source by SME age class in 2010         70%     60%     50%     40%     30%     20%     10%     0%     Personal    funds    Leasing    Factoring    Loan <3    years    Overdraft Loan >3  years    Trade  credit    Retained  earnings    Private  equity    <2 years       2–5 years       5–10 years       >10 years    Source  Oxford Economics (2011).    looking at different SME size classes. For  example  mediumsized enterprises seem  to  lease  due  to  price  considerations   better  cash  flow  management  and  the  absence of the need to provide collateral.  In  contrast   microenterprises  stated  tax  benefits  next  to  price  considerations  as  main reasons to use leasing. Interestingly   the  absence  of  collateral  requirements  seems  to  be  less  important  for  micro  enterprises  than  for  small  or  medium  sized firms.    Reasons  for  leasing  vary  more  over  countries than over sectors; this could be  due to different tax and regulatory envi  ronments.  For  instance   collateral  con  siderations  were  most   in  France and Italy  while tax benefits were  mainly stated in the UK.     important     The  choice  of  a  particular  financing  source  can  also  depend  on  the  specific  investment type  e.g. on the asset which  is financed. SMEs typically lease a broad  range of assets; however  vehicles of var  ious types account by far for the biggest  share.     Support  measures  in  favour  of  leasing  for  SMEs. Leasing  is  an  important  financing  tool for SMEs which provides financing  close  to  the  investment  periods  of  the  leased  assets.  However   in  the  current  financial  and  regulatory  environment   also  the  leasing  companies  themselves  have  distorted  access  to  (re)financing.  Public  support  of  this  instrument  can  help to mitigate market weaknesses and  to  enhance  the  access  to  finance  for  SMEs.    The problems are different depending  on  the  ownership  model  of  the  leasing  companies. According to Leaseurope and  KPMG (2012)  50% of European leasing  companies were bank related  18% cap  tives   and  32%  independent  in  2010.5  However  in terms of shares of new vol  umes  “90%  of  the  European  leasing  market  is  in  the  hands  of  bankowned  leasing  companies”  (Mignerey   2012).  Moreover   “whether  bankowned   cap  tive  or  independent   European  leasing  companies  heavily  rely  on  the  banking  sector   fund   their  operations”  (Mignerey  2012).    to     The  financial  crisis  has  not  only  affected banks and their leasing affiliates   but the leasing market in general has been  particularly affected by the worsening of  refinancing  conditions.  According  to  a  survey among German leasing companies  (HartmannWendels  and  Pytlik   2010)   leasing companies which are independent  from  banks  and  manufacturers  were  hit  the  most.  Several  banks  have  reduced  or  fully abandoned the refinancing of leasing  3    THE IMPORTANCE OF LEASING FOR SME FINANCING    Table 6  Success rates in obtaining leasing in 2010              100          %    90     80     70     60     50     40     30     20     10     0     Belgium    Bulgaria    Denm ark    Germ any    Ireland    Greece    Spain    France    Italy    Latvia    Lithuania    Netherlands    Poland    Slovakia    Finland    Sweden    UK         Young highgrowth enterprises (gazelles)       Other highgrowth enterprises       Other enterprises    Source  OECD (2012) and Eurostat.    companies  due to scarcity of banks’ own  resources   regulatory  requirements   or  management  decisions  to  stronger  con  centrate on core business activities.    HartmannWendels  and  Pytlik  (2010)  state that a significant reduction of active  refinancing partners was reported by leas  ing  companies   in  particular  by  smaller  ones.  Moreover   collateral  requirements  have considerably increased.    According  to  Mignerey  (2012)   the  decision of some parent banks to down  grade  leasing  to  the  status  of  a  “non  core”   to  understand   leasing  did  not  bring  what  banks  needed    leasing  required  what  banks  were  lacking   i.e.  capital and liquidity”.    business  was     i.e.  deposits;     “simple     These  developments  are  different  from past recessions  when leasing com  panies were “only” hit by reduced over  all  investment  activities  which  could  often  be  compensated  by  an  increase  in  leasing  penetration  rates  (Hartmann  Wendels  and  Pytlik   2010).  This  time   the  deterioration  in  the  access  to  refi  nancing  came  on  top.  Moreover   many  independent  leasing  companies  are  also  hit by structural problems such as a low  equity  base  or  a  lack  of  specialisation  which often leads to relatively low resid  ual  values  of  the  leased  assets  in  their  balance sheets.     Support  by  the  European  Investment  Fund (EIF) can mitigate such market dis  tortions   thereby  enabling  the  financing  of new leases to SMEs and contributing  to  enhance  their  access  to  longterm  financing.6  4    The  following  section  describes  a  range of EIF guarantee products that are  available  to  help  the  leasing  industry  support European SMEs. The focus is on  those  products  where  the  EIF  uses  its  own resources (in full or in part) to fulfil  its  central  mission  to  support  Europe’s  SMEs (see Tables 9 and 10).    In addition to these products  the EIF  also  operates  mandates  (including  from  the  European  Commission)  to  channel  EU  and  governmental  funding  to  SMEs  through   instrument  pro  grammes  such  as  CIP   JEREMIE  and  Progress Microfinance.     financial     Further options for leasing companies  under  new  mandates  at  European   national  and  regional  levels  can  be  expected in the future.    Concluding remarks. The intention of this  paper  was  to  enhance  the  awareness  of  leasing (and its importance) as additional  financing   that  expands the access to short and medium  term financing for capital equipment.     for  SMEs     technique     Leasing is an alternative instrument to  facilitate  access  to  finance;  it  enables  in  particular new/young enterprises (includ  ing  the  so  called  “gazelles”  (OECD   2012  and  2014))  without  credit  track  record  and  limited  possibilities  to  pro  vide  collateral  the  use  of  capital  equip  ment.  As  such   it  also  mitigates  market  weaknesses of SME lending.    SMEs  expect  leasing  to  stay  of  high  relevance as integral part of their financ  ing tool set. However  the supply side has  come under extraordinary pressure in the    Table 7  SMEs having used leasing  hirepurchase or   factoring in different countries    EU 28    Germany  Estonia  Sweden  Finland  Luxembourg  Denmark  Lithiania    34.5    50.7  48.9  46.5  45.2  45.2  43.5  42.1    NonEU countries    Austria  UK  Poland  France  Netherlands  Czech Republic  Croatia    41.3  39.5  38.2  37.8  36.6  35.8  35.5    Slovakia  Lavia  Slovenia  Bulgaria  Malta  Ireland  Spain    Norway  Liechtenstein  Serbia    41.3  34.4  26.0    Iceland  Turkey  FYROM    21.3  18.0  17.6    Montenegro  Albania  Israel    Belgium  Hungary  Italy  Portugal  Greece  Romania  Cyprus    24.4  24.2  19.8  19.7  17.7  17.3  7.0    33.4  32.6  30.3  29.8  27.3  25.6  25.3    10.9  9.1  4.0    Note  Over the preceding six months; percentage of respondents  survey conducted from August to   October 2013.

This includes  leasing originators of all types and sizes  such as   • Banks’ leasing subsidiaries;  • Banks;   • Independent leasing companies  including smaller  unrated companies    typically funded through bank lending.     EIF typically guarantees senior debt sized between c50m and c100m.    EIF can help leasing companies find financing in challenging times. EIF has a pool of  investors keen to invest in products guaranteed by EIF with an attractive allin cost for the  originators.   The confidence given by EIF’s participation in a transaction as a guarantor could also make  it easier to find third party investors.  EIF will be involved in the early stages of any transaction and will help guide firsttime  issuers through the process.    Requirements    EIF has a flexible approach aimed at facilitating deal execution. The EIF Guarantee is charged at a market rate  dependent on the risk taken by EIF. EIF will also request a  letter from the leasing company committing to lend a certain amount to SMEs as a function of the Guarantee. EIF will always perform its own due diligence and require  certain data from leasing companies in order to assess the risk of the transaction.    5    THE IMPORTANCE OF LEASING FOR SME FINANCING    •    •    •    •    •    •    •    die     und     2012.     im  Leasing.

Leasing is based on physical assets while factoring is  based on receivables.     2    3    The report is based on a survey about the use of leas  ing  conducted  amongst  almost  3 000  SMEs  across  eight EU Member States and nine industrial sectors in  July 2011.

Table 10  The Risk Sharing Instrument (RSI)    RSI is a pilot guarantee scheme sponsored by the European Commission to support innovative SMEs and small midcaps. It enables leasing companies to share their   risk with EIF on their new leasing activity  in exchange for an attractive fixed fee. Under RSI  EIF provides uncapped guarantees to leasing companies (including those  mentioned under Structured Finance) on 50% of each eligible lease. The diagram below illustrates how the scheme operates.

Mechanics of the guarantee    RSI supports SMEs and small midcaps (companies with fewer than 500  employees) that have innovation potential or a focus on R&D. These are defined  as companies that meet one of the following criteria    • They invest in producing or developing innovative products  processes and/or    services that present a risk of technological or industrial failure; or     • They are innovationdriven “fast growing enterprises”  i.e. their workforce or    turnover has increased by at least 20% p.a. over the last three years; or  • They are “innovative” enterprises  i.e. satisfying at least one “innovation    criterion” out of a set of predefined eligibility criteria.    Benefits to leasing companies    The origination  credit analysis  decision process and servicing  are fully delegated to  the leasing company based eligibility criteria set ex ante.   The Guarantee is fully automated and as such  automatically covers leases for 50% of  any principal and interest loss. Payments under the Guarantee will be made upon  default  with a prorata sharing of recoveries.  EIF has developed a lean and pragmatic quarterly reporting system.    By reducing their risk  leasing companies can reduce their risk margins and increase both competitiveness and market share. Leasing companies not active or less active  in the innovative SMEs and small midcap space can venture into this area  with the knowledge that losses can be minimised with the help of RSI.    6
