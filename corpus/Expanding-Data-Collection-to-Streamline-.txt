b"herein file    INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE  FOR STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT/ CRYPTOASSETS AND FINTECH Expanding Data Collection to Streamline MSME (Micro Small and Medium Enterprise) Lending  Vivek Belgavi (PwC India) Avneesh Narang (PwC India) Arvind Raj (PwC India)  Submitted on May 22 2019  Abstract Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) are an integral cog of the growth  engine  of  different  global  economies.  In  India  in  2018  MSMEs employed  40%  of  the  workforce  contributed  37%  of  GDP  and  43%  of exports. [1] In spite of exclusive legislations and policies lack of access to formal credit has hampered MSMEs from realizing their full potential. For lenders  the fragmented  and  opaque  nature  of  available  MSME information  poses  serious  challenges  in  underwriting.  This  policy  brief proposes  a  policy  framework  for  establishing  databanks  intended  to further  facilitate  the  use  of  alternative  data  in  the  MSME  lending landscape.  \\x0cInternational Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech Challenge MSMEs  are  the  backbone  of  every  economy  and  contribute  heavily  towards employment  in  a  nation.  According  to  the  World  Bank  MSMEs  play  a  major role  in  most  economies  particularly  in  developing  countries.  [2]  Formal MSMEs contribute up to 60% of total employment and up to 40% of national income  (GDP)  in  emerging  economies.  [2]  However  across  both  emerging markets  as  well  as  developed  nations  many  MSMEs  are  excluded  from  the credit ecosystem due to various challenges \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the primary one being lack of easy access to reliable credit information to justify credit disbursal. The following table provides the definition of MSMEs as per the Micro Small and  Medium  Enterprises  Development  (MSMED)  Act  2006  by  the Government of India MSME Definition Enterprises  engaged in  the Enterprises engaged in manufacture or production \\xe2\\x80\\x93  providing  or rendering  of Investment in  Plant and services \\xe2\\x80\\x93  Machinery <= USD 35.7k <= USD 714k Investment in equipment <= USD 14k <= USD 285k Micro Small <= USD 1.4 mn Medium  As per the International Finance Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s MSME Gap Assessment report the  global  gap  in  MSME  funding  in  the  formal  sector  is  USD  5.2  trillion.  [3] Adding  the  USD  2.9  trillion  estimated  gap  in  funding  for  MSMEs  in  the informal sector the total funding gap is approximately USD 8 trillion.

Yet  the  long  turnaround  time  for  loans disincentivizes  enterprises  from  borrowing  in  the  formal  sector  to  address their credit needs. Further lending institutions consider MSME lending to be a highcost and highrisk venture primarily owing to the opaqueness of MSME credit information.   However with improvements in digital infrastructure and lower costs of data along  with  structural  reforms  such  as  the  implementation  of  the  Goods  and Services  Tax  (GST)  digital  lending  is  transforming  the  MSME  lending landscape. With the proliferation of new MSME digital data streams in recent years  digital  MSME  financing  using  alternative  data  provides  a  significant opportunity  to  address  the  most  crucial  bottlenecks  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  lack  of  reliable information for lenders and loan turnaround time for debtors.  The alternative data streams are providing lenders with greater flexibility and increased  opportunities  to  lend  to  traditionally  underbanked  customer segments. As our society considers how to bring about a systemic alignment of  economic  growth  and  social  progress  at  a  macro  level  new  technological advancements conceived and deployed to facilitate MSME lending will play an  3 \\x0cInternational Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech increasingly critical role in enabling more businesses to thrive where they are most needed.    Proposal  This proposal is laid out in two major sections  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Section  1  explores  the  opportunities  emerging  in  the  MSME  lending landscape  and  examines  the  alternative  data  used  and  frameworks developed to bridge the MSME financing gap.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Section 2 details the proposed initiative to establish a databank to enhance credit access for MSMEs.  1)   Opportunities in the MSME lending landscape  Over the last few years MSME lending has witnessed steady growth in India. From September 2016 through September 2018 MSME credit issuances in the formal  sector  increased  from  approximately  USD  224  billion  to  USD  346 billion.

Market share is gradually shifting from public sector banks (PSBs) to private  4 \\x0cInternational Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech banks  and  nonbanking  financial  companies  (NBFCs)  with  some  of  these entities increasingly adopting digital technologies and partnering with Fintech players for MSME lending.

In contrast  to  traditional  lenders  Fintech  lenders  study  both  conventional  and unconventional data points to build more robust customer financial identities. The  approach  of  harnessing  unconventional  data  sources  for  a  holistic assessment of customer creditworthiness has transformed the MSME lending space.  In  underwriting  loans  to  MSMEs  lenders  today  are  using  alternative data such as ecommerce data (e.g. borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s active online engagement with the  market)  psychometric  credit  information  digital  footprints  (e.g.  digital supplychain  data)  mobile  phone  usage  data  (via  call  detail  records)  social network  data  (via  social  media  platforms)  and  location  data  (via  the  Global Positioning System and the Geographic Information System). [6]  As set forth in a G20 2017 report lending models around alternative data can broadly  be  categorized  as  follows.  [6]  Together  they  highlight  the  growing trend  of  MSME  lending  based  on  decisions  that  are  informed  by  nontraditional data.   5 \\x0cInternational Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech Alternative lending models associated data streams and Indian regulations Model  Model definition and data streams  Regulations in India Marketplace lenders  Tech/Ecommerce giants  Supplychain financing They create a marketplace for investors to  lend  to  MSME  borrowers.

The  loan  tenure  varies  across  Fintech  players. While  working  capital  loans  typically  have  a  tenure  of  30120  days  certain loans can have a tenure of up to 24 months. [7]  One of the benefits of using alternative data is the potential reduction in the cost  of  credit.  Traditional  MSME  lending  through  supplychain  financing  for example  can  involve  various  acquisition  costs  from  physical  meeting  and document  collection  (USD  70  to  USD  200)  to  query  resolution  (USD  150  to USD  300)  to  manual  credit  underwriting  (upwards  of  USD  350).  The  use  of digitized  processes  and  alternative  data  streams  is  expected  to  result  in  a significant reduction in the costs associated with the acquisition. [7] Initiatives to utilize alternative data for MSME lending  Recognizing  the  benefits  of  using  alternative  data  in  determining  the creditworthiness of MSME borrowers governments are beginning to develop initiatives that incorporate alternative data into MSME lending platforms. In India the Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) the principal financial  institution  for  the  promotion  financing  and  development  of  the MSME  sector  established  in  2016  the  Udyami  Mitra  Platform  an  online marketplace lenders.  Currently approximately  125000  entities  (e.g.  PSBs  private  sector  banks  NBFCs Fintech  lenders)  are  connected  to  the  platform  and  can  provide  loans  to MSME borrowers. Ecosystem players that can provide alternative data such as marketplace  aggregators  and  credit  rating  agencies  are  also  expected  to connecting  MSME  borrowers  and  7 \\x0cInternational Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech become a part of this platform. [8]  Udyami  Mitra  represents  a  move  towards  a  digital  platform  that  will  use alternative  data  which  in turn  is  expected  to improve  accessibility  to credit streamline  data  and  result  in  more  robust  credit  decision  making.  The available data is however limited to data provided by the entities connected with  the  platform.  Moreover  under  its  present  form  the  platform  serves  a matchmaking function primarily and does not serve as a data repository.  Malaysia  has  also  launched  an  MSME  loan/financing  referral  platform  called imSME  in  2018  which  connects  MSMEs  with  lenders.  [9]  It  plans  to  embed alternative  databased  analytical  models  by  2020  to  widen  its  reach  across MSMEs that do not currently have access to credit. Public credit registries  In order to improve the quality of credit assessment by  financial institutions and to strengthen bank supervision public credit registries (PCR)1 have been established in  many  countries.  [10]  According  to  a  2012 World  Bank  report 87 out of the 195 countries surveyed had a public credit registry. [11] The G20 report  on  SME  financing  also  highlighted  the  importance  of  credit  reporting institutions for SMEs. [12]  The RBI has recently decided to establish a PCR as an extensive database that captures  granular  credit  information  for  all  credit  products  in  the  country from the point of origination to its termination eventually covering all lenderborrower accounts without a size threshold. [11] Apart from acting as a single point of reporting of data by all credit institutions the PCR will also facilitate linkages  with  external  information  systems  (e.g.  tax  utility  payments)  to capture  alternative  data  relating  to  credit  assessment.  The  PCR  would function on the principle of reciprocity and the credit institutions submitting data  would  in  turn  receive  regular  reports  at  fixed  intervals.  [13]  The  PCR\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability  to  track  all  borrowings  in  realtime  will  contribute  to  keeping                                                       1A  public  credit  registry  is  defined  as  a  database  managed  by  the  public  sector  that  collects  information  on  the creditworthiness of borrowers (individuals or firms) and facilitates exchange of credit information among financial institutions.    8 \\x0cInternational Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech aggregate risks at the economy level visible and in check. The PCR is expected to  assist  financial  institutions  in  identifying  creditworthy  borrowers  and monitoring  overborrowing  and  loan  stacking  effectively  thus  reducing  the cost of credit and resulting in higher credit growth. 2) Recommendations for establishing a databank to enhance MSME lending  With  rapid  technological  developments  previously  uncaptured  data  is increasingly  available  to  lenders  in  assessing  the  creditworthiness  of  MSME borrowers.  This  policy  brief  recommends  that  the  G20  define  a  common framework  for  establishing  a  new  type  of  digital  regulated  entity  called  a databank to facilitate sharing of alternative data to MSME lenders in a secure efficient  and  streamlined  fashion  to  promote  MSME  lending.  The  databank would be a domestic entity that draws upon data from the local jurisdiction. We  propose  a  databank  that  would  house  a  wideranging  set  of  data  points acting  as  a  custodian  of  data  for  its  customers  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  individuals  MSMEs  and corporates. Customers would have consent rights to their own data (e.g. data generated  on  their  mobile  devices)  to  be  shared  with  the  databank.  In addition  customers  would  have  the  right  to  determine  which  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdata  service providers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  the  databank  could  link  with  to  collate  data  attributed  to  them. Relevant  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdata  service  providers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  for  an  MSME  customer  would  be  the ecosystem stakeholders that the MSME transacts with as part of its operations (e.g.  government  entities  the  MSME  registers  with  and  reports  to  utility companies  the  MSME  transacts  with  suppliers  of  the  MSME  the  MSME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s downstream customers.) The  key  value  of  the  databank  from  a  lending  perspective  is  its  ability  to provide a broader range of data that may be relevant to lenders in making a robust  credit  decision.  To  this  end  the  databank  would  not  define  what constitutes  \\xe2\\x80\\x9crelevant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  data  so  as  not  to  exclude  other  data  that  might otherwise serve as a factor in a lender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit decision. Rather the databank should  have  the  capacity  to  store  as  much  data  as  possible  within  the boundaries  of  customer  consent  and  provide  lenders  with  the  flexibility  to choose which data can be used for the credit decision.   Thus  while  other  sources  including  a  PCR  could  be  an  important  input  to such  a  databank  the  databank  would  not  have  a  predefined  boundaries  or  9 \\x0cInternational Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech scope in terms of the data it would store unlike a PCR that by its structure predefines the scope of data it would store.  Key features of the envisioned databank are as follows  \\xe2\\x9a\\xab  Databank  entity  The  databank  would  be  a  repository  of  collected  data structured  in  a  systematic  way  for  easy  and  quick  retrieval  of  data whenever needed. This data repository could be accessed on both local and  remote  servers  and  could  store  information  on  a  single  dedicated subject or multiple subjects in a wellorganized manner. \\xe2\\x9a\\xab  Databank eligibility Any regulated entity managed by a public or private enterprise could be eligible to be a databank. The entity would need to enter  into  a  new  type  of  licensing  arrangement  and  operate  under  the ambit of data privacy norms applicable in that particular jurisdiction \\xe2\\x9a\\xab  Mode  of  operation  Any  MSME  could  enter  into  an  agreement  with  the databank by sharing their data in return for certain specialized services offered  by  the  databank  or  other  ecosystem  players  using  their  data. The  databank  would  in  turn  act  as  the  custodian  of  the  MSME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  data across private and public enterprises in the ecosystem. Upon obtaining upfront consent from the MSME the databank could monetize this data by sharing access to it with the other ecosystem players in exchange for data access/convenience fees. For  instance  an  MSME  can  share  its  know  your  customer2 (KYC) documents  (e.g.  relevant  address  document  proofs)  with  a  data  bank. The  MSME  can  then  authorize  the  data  bank  to  share  this  information with  any  external  service  provider  that  it  intends  to  use  and  which requires such documentation (e.g. KYC requirements of a lender). This would eliminate the need for the MSME to submit such documents each time it liaises with a service provider.  While address proof is not a typical data point that lenders may use for credit  underwriting  (and  may  therefore  not  necessarily  be  stored  in  a PCR)  the  databank  offers  the  lender  the  opportunity  to  decide  which                                                       2 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKnow your customer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d protocol refers to the process of verifying the identity of customers either before or during the time they start doing business with the respective organization.  10 \\x0cInternational Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech data it would use to make a credit decision (e.g. a lender may choose to use this data if location is a variable in its credit decision model). \\xe2\\x9a\\xab  Data privacy access control and data security Securing customer rights is  critical  to  ensuring  the  success  of  the  databank.  To  this  end  clear access rights and data handling policies should be established to ensure the  integrity  of  the  databank  ecosystem.  Upfront  consent  mechanisms should  be  implemented  so  that  customers  have  knowledge  of  the possible  uses  of  their  data.  Participants  should  conduct  regular  risk assessments  and  communicate  cyber  incidents  to  relevant  parties including consumers in a timely manner. As cyber threats continuously evolve  participants  should  create  adaptable  and  dynamic  processes  to ensure continuous monitoring.  For the databank to be sufficiently comprehensive it should allow customers to at minimum link to the following \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdata service providers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (i) lenders (ii) alternative data providers / private databases (iii) credit bureaus and credit registries (iv) government / public databases and (v) credit rating agencies. \\xe2\\x9a\\xab  Lenders  Lenders  would  primarily  include  banks  NBFCs  Fintechs  and alternative lenders. These financial institutions should provide granular credit  information  on  all  its  MSME  borrowers  to  the  databank.  They should also report all material events for each MSME loan without any threshold amount. \\xe2\\x9a\\xab  Alternative  data  providers  /  private  databases  They include organizations  that  provide  alternative  data  about  the  borrower  which can  aid  lenders  in  decision  making.  This  can  include  payment companies  mobile  operators  utilities  online  cloudbased  accounting systems etc.  \\xe2\\x9a\\xab  Credit  bureaus  and  credit  registries  Existing  credit  reporting institutions  like  credit  bureaus  and  credit  registries  will  play  a  crucial role  by  sharing  all  MSME  credit  information  to  the  databank.  These institutions  already  collect  a  significant  amount  of  credit  data  from lenders.  Hence  with  respect  to  each  local  jurisdiction  policies  need  to be  developed  to  ensure  that  there  is  minimal  overlap  in  the  data collection efforts between these institutions and the databank.  11 \\x0cInternational Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech \\xe2\\x9a\\xab  Government  /  public  databases  These  entities  control  access  to  key public  databases  including  litigation  cases  collateral  registries  unique identifiers federal and state tax information etc. It is proposed that the databank should have external linkages to these databases to give a full profile of the MSME borrower.  \\xe2\\x9a\\xab  Credit  rating  agency  This  refers  to  an  organization  that  assigns  MSME credit  ratings  by  assessing  borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  ability  and  willingness  to  repay the debt.  While  the  above  list  is  indicative  the  scope  of  data  service  providers  would constantly evolve and grow based on inputs and consent from the databank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customers thus ensuring comprehensiveness while balancing privacy needs. Through  this  construct  the  databank  would  evolve  into  a  comprehensive secure digital and regulated entity that would act as a custodian for customer data  and  facilitate  the  regulated  consented  sharing  of  data  for  various purposes  including  facilitating  the  sharing  of  relevant  traditional  and alternative data to lenders for MSME credit decisions.
