here  in file  Miklos Dietz     Vinayak HV     and Gillian Lee    Bracing for seven critical changes   as fintech matures    Financial Services November 2016  The fintech sector is being shaped by shifting market   conditions  new regulations  and changes in consumer   demands and behaviors.    For the past decade  fintech companies—technology firms that focus on financial products   and services—have moved quickly  forcing incumbents to rethink their core business models   and embrace digital innovations. But now  the fintech industry is itself maturing and entering   a period of rapid change. Companies wondering how they will fit into this new era must first   understand the forces that are pushing the changes.     While the industry will undoubtedly continue to expand as its customer base grows and investor   appetite remains unsated  changes are imminent. Indeed  the very concept of what comprises   fintech will shift. As the industry evolves  it will play a role well beyond financial products and   services  individual companies will vie to become undisputed leaders by size and breadth     and ecosystems will develop that have a tight grip on customer loyalty.     This new fintech era is being shaped by changes in market conditions  new regulations  and   shifts in consumer demands and behaviors. As a result  the industry  generally  is becoming   more cautious  even as it becomes more diverse across technologies and products. McKinsey   research and work with fintechs in many markets suggest seven critical aspects of this new   environment that must be understood to thrive in the shifting market.    Expanding scope  The scope of products and services offered by fintechs is expanding rapidly. Where    once companies focused on payment applications  lending  and money transfers     the industry’s reach has extended into more than 30 areas (exhibit). The shift brings    fintechs away from a focus on frontline activities to a broad engagement throughout    the value chain. The new offerings cut across a wide swath of financial services  retail    wealth management  small and midsize enterprises (SMEs)  corporate and investment   banking  and insurance.     Various fintechs using a variety of technologies are active in each of these areas. Some    for example roboadvisory systems that provide automated recommendations with little   human input  use tested technologies to meet customer needs  while others pursue more   experimental technologies  such as blockchain systems that track and store an expanding   series of transactions to help reduce infrastructure costs and improve efficiency.     Web 2016  Bracing for seven critical changes as fintech matures  Exhibit  Exhibit 1 of 1    We see more than 30 areas emerging as new norms in banking.    Key ﬁntech trends     • Nextgeneration personal     financial management  • Peertopeer lending     and investment    • New digital lending  • Aggregator comparison     engine    • Roboadvisory  • Social investing  • Crowdfunding  • Investment across     regions engine    Beyond banking    • Mobile payments  • International remittances  • Mobile pointofsale     devices    • Other payment     processing     Retail value   chain and   coupons    Retail    Wealth   management    Digital for   unbanked    • Blockchain  • Application program    ming interface ecosystem    • Payment infrastructure  • Big data base risk     assessment    • Antimoney laundering     and know your customer  • Artificial intelligence and     machine learning    • Cybersecurity    Payments    Operations and   infrastructure    Insurance    Digital   model   reinventors    • Onestop shop for     businesses    Virtual   market  place    Small   and midsize   enterprises    Capital markets   and investment   banking    • Peertopeer corporate   lending and investment    • Nextgeneration lending     to small and midsize   enterprises    • Digital cash management    Nextgeneration   digital marketing    Source  Panorama by McKinsey    • Telematics  • Social integration  • IoT and connected     devices    • Prevention    • Nextgeneration     trade finance    • Trading  • Nextgeneration     collateral management    • Trade analytics    In addition  fintechs are moving beyond addressing a customer’s financial needs to offering   a wider range of services  blurring the industry’s boundaries. For example  Social Finance    known generally as SoFi  began by offering financial products to students and young   professionals and has since expanded to provide career coaching and networking services.   Holvi Payment Services  a Finnish startup acquired by Spanish financial group Banco Bilbao   Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) in 2016  began by offering banking services to SMEs and expanded   to provide complementary offerings  such as an online sales platform  bookkeeping services    expenseclaims systems  and a cashflow tracker.     Increasing diversity  The fintech industry is also becoming more diversified  with a wide variety of business models   seen across geographies  segments  and technologies. One common model would be a start  up backed by venturecapital funding emerging to address a specific customer need.     2    For example  the USbased Stripe  one of the largest fintech players  was founded in 2011   to offer an improved online payment system and has attracted more than $300 million from   venturecapital funds  including Founders Fund  Khosla Ventures  and Sequoia Capital.1 Stripe   was one of the first fintechs to dramatically accelerate and improve the process merchants   followed to accept payments online. While legacy payments companies needed five to seven   days to set up a new merchant  Stripe gave merchants the chance to launch a website and   start accepting payments within minutes.2 Another model would be a large technology   company expanding into financial services. China’s Alibaba  one of the bestknown examples   of this model  started as a major ecommerce site and has moved into financial products  with   its Alipay subsidiary boasting more than 800 million registered users in 2016. Another emerging   model would be an established financial company creating its own fintech unit. For example    Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China  China’s largest insurer by assets  launched a   peertopeer service  Lufax  in 2012  and by 2016 the unit was valued at almost $19 billion.3    Fintech pioneers  such as PayPal  are also adjusting their business models to encompass a   wider range of services. PayPal  launched in the 1990s to provide a payment system for online   purchases  then a new phenomena  has since expanded to provide instant lines of credit and   mobile applications that locate nearby stores and restaurants that accept payment by PayPal.4    Along with diversified models  performance has also become highly variable among fintechs.   Certain players have seen share prices fall more than 50 percent. At the other extreme    fintechs that retain the confidence of investors and customers have continued to see strong   performance as reflected by share price and business growth. Among the examples  share   price for IHS Markit  a financial information and data provider  rose by more than 20 percent   over the 12 months ending October 2016. IHS Markit had shown consistently strong financial   performance  with  for instance  adjusted third quarter 2016 revenue up 5 percent from a year   earlier and its fullyear margin forecast at about 36 percent.5    Improving collaboration  Collaborative partnerships will become increasingly important as fintechs seek scale and   traditional financial institutions seek digital expertise. While fintechs have developed applications   that create improved customer experiences  many lack skills in customer acquisition and other   fields needed to grow quickly. Incumbent banks  on the other hand  already have hardwon   capabilities in these areas  but they will have to work harder to create a true digital enterprise.    Examples of such partnerships are already emerging. For example  in 2014 New York–based   Moven and Australia’s Westpac announced an agreement to integrate Moven’s mobile financial  management tools with Westpac’s Internetbanking platform in New Zealand. Westpac hoped to use   the tools to become the largest bank in the market  while Moven sought to expand into new markets.6    Spain’s BBVA offers an example of an incumbent bank moving aggressively across several   areas. BBVA joined dataanalytics startup Destacame to extend credit to the underbanked     3    1 Leena Rao  “Stripe’s new     funding makes it a $5 billion   company ” Fortune     July 28  2015  fortune.com.    2 TechCrunch blog  “The   story behind payment   disruptor Stripe.com and   its founder Patrick Collison ”   blog entry by Derek   Andersen  May 20  2012    techcrunch.com.    3 Gabriel Wildau  “Chinese   P2P lender Lufax valued   at $19bn in latest funding   round ” Financial Times    January 18  2016  ft.com.      4 Mashable business      blog  “PayPal mobile app   lets you order ahead at   restaurants ” blog entry   by Todd Wasserman    September 5  2013    mashable.com.     5 Q3 16 Earnings   Supplemental    Financials  IHS Markit    September 27  2016     phx.corporateir.net.     6 Westpac New Zealand   REDnews business    blog  “Westpac enters   exclusive New Zealand   partnership with financial   services startup Moven ”   August 25  2014     Westpac.co.nz.    using Destacame credit scores built from utilitybillpayment histories.7 It is also working   with FutureAdvisor  which focuses on roboadvisory services  to offer lowcost  enhanced   financialadvisory services to help customers with portfolio optimization.8 In addition  BBVA   and Dwolla  a payments company  have joined to offer BBVA customers accelerated payment   services with low fees.    Impending consolidation  As the industry continues to mature  fintechs will likely enter a period of consolidation  with   larger players turning to mergers and acquisitions to satisfy their expansion goals. For example    in 2015 PayPal announced the acquisition of Xoom  an international fundtransfer service  for   $890 million. The acquisition was expected to allow PayPal to broaden its services into digital   money transfer and management.9    In another recent example  in 2015 peertopeer lender Prosper Marketplace spent $30 million to   acquire BillGuard  later renamed Prosper Daily  an app that allows users to track their spending and   credit. The move added personalfinancialmanagement services to Prosper’s core refinancing   and creditrehabilitation offerings and provided a new channel for engaging with customers.10    Consolidation  which complements the collaboration trend  may force other changes in the   market as well. For instance  banks may have to move quickly to identify acquisition targets   before the most attractive are taken by competitors. They will also have to reconcile differences   in corporate culture that can limit the upside from such mergers. The trend also offers fintech   startups an alternative to initial public offerings for exit options.    Normalizing valuations  Valuations of fintechs are also normalizing as investors become more cautious and start   favoring companies with proven track records. Examining 44 fintechs with valuations of more   than $1 billion  McKinsey found that valuation growth has slowed considerably. Between 2014   and 2015  valuations for these companies grew on average by 77 percent  and then slowed to   9 percent from 2015 to 2016. Companies in the study cut across geographies and segments.    In the United States  where more than half the companies in the study were based  the shift   was even more dramatic. While valuations for large US fintechs grew on average by 54 percent   from 2014 to 2015  they not only did not grow but dropped by 7 percent from 2015 and 2016.     The shift toward normalized valuations was also noticeable in investment trends. One study   looked at the 30 largest fintech investments by venturecapital funds in 2016 through August   and found that more than half were laterstage funding deals.11 The data suggest investors are   more interested in companies with proven business models.    Shifting regulations  Not surprising for a new industry  the regulatory regimes affecting fintechs are also evolving   swiftly and will significantly influence how the industry develops. In many markets  regulators     4      7 Next billion blog  “The   Power of partnerships    Why they can be the key   to reaching the unbanked ”   blog entry by Hannah   Sherman  July 27  2016    nextbillion.net.       8 Forbes tech blog  “BBVA   Compass teams up with   Robo FutureAdvisor ” blog   entry by Tom Groenfeldt    January 12  2016     forbes.com.      9 Wall Street Journal     Moneybeat blog  “PayPal  Xoom deal shakes up the   payments world ” blog    entry by Maureen Farrell     July 6  2015  blogs.wsj.com.      10 TechCrunch blog  “Prosper     Marketplace relaunches   its BillGuard app under   the Prosper brand ”   blog entry by Jonathan   Shieber  March 10  2016    techcrunch.com.    11 The pulse of fintech       Q2 2016  Global analysis   of fintech venture funding    CB Insights and KPMG    August 17  2016     kpmg.com.    are playing a more proactive role in overseeing the industry  often encouraging its development    for instance by following a sandbox—or test and learn—approach that allows fintechs to   experiment without impacting the entire financial system.     In the United Kingdom  for example  the country’s Financial Conduct Authority has launched   Project Innovate  a program that guides technology startups through regulatory processes   and pushes for speedy responses to applications and questions. Regulators are also   increasingly involved in nurturing fintech clusters  organizing large educational and community  building events in many markets.     As regulators increasingly shape the evolution and growth of the fintech industry  it remains   unclear how the costs of regulations will impact players  particularly earlystage startups.   However  while regulators work toward balancing the risks to the financialservices sector     they are also eager to encourage innovation  and many have taken steps toward this goal.     Emerging ecosystems  As digital offerings become more mature and interconnected  vast ecosystems will develop   that span multiple industries. In many instances  fintechs will become submerged in these   ecosystems  representing  like many others  a component of a much broader digital network.    Ecosystems will likely develop to follow customer needs  rather than conform to traditional   industry lines. Leaders in these ecosystems will need strong dataanalytic capabilities to   develop useful insights from the torrent of customer information available  and they will   likely use fintechs and others to develop the system and extract maximum value. While   data and analytic capabilities are crucial to leading an ecosystem  companies will also need   demonstrated prowess in cybersecurity to credibly safeguard the huge amounts of potentially   sensitive client data available in the system.     Already  ecosystem orchestrators are building advantageous dataanalytic capabilities. For   example  China’s Ping An established a big data–analytics platform in 2013 to improve cross  selling and customer migration. The platform is a critical component in reaching the company’s   stated goal of “one customer  one account  multiple services  and multiple products.” Ping An   is already benefiting from the use of this platform  with more than half of Ping An’s 109 million   core finance customers successfully migrated and also using its online services as of 2016.   Across all its platforms  the company has an Internet user base of 298 million people as of    June 2016  presenting powerful opportunities for customer acquisition and channel migration.12    Other examples of early ecosystems include Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA)  which is   building relationships with a broad customer base across different channels  using technology   like MyWealth  a portfoliomanagement app; DailyIQ  a dataanalytic app for SMEs; and Albert    a pointofsale device for business owners.13 Combined  these efforts can provide CBA access   to rich data on customerspending patterns  allowing it to build an ecosystem around these   insights and customer relationships.     5    12 Interim report 2016  Ping     An Insurance (Group)   Company of China  June   2016  pingan.com.     13 Commonwealth Bank of     Australia blog  “Albert Our   next generation EFTPOS   tablet ” February 19  2016    commbank.com.au.    Outside the financial sector  China’s Tencent  a leader in gaming and social networking  has   launched WeChat  a messaging platform that  among other features  can provide instant loans   without collateral of up to $30 000. The service combines creditbureau data from the People’s   Bank of China with that gleaned from Tencent’s customer base of 800 million active users   to analyze and respond to credit applications.14 Fintech services have become an integral   component in the company’s ecosystem.     The development of ecosystems will differ broadly across markets for various reasons  such   as consumer behavior and competitive landscape. In the United States  for example  they   could be slower to develop because of market fragmentation  with strong companies already   providing compelling solutions backed by advanced technologies. Greater consolidation   and scale are likely needed to create conditions suitable for viable ecosystems. In emerging   markets  however  digital ecosystems could advance more quickly as companies bypass   intermediary technologies and go straight to the most advanced solutions. Platform players   that are already deeply entrenched in the lives of consumers  like Tencent  could leverage    their solid customer base to form the core needed for an ecosystem’s development.    Fintechs have matured rapidly in recent years  and the industry is entering a new phase of   development. With no signs of the industry’s growth abating  its reach is likely to broaden quickly   to embrace even newer technologies and offerings  blurring the boundaries now delineating   financial services. As the momentum continues  some aspects of fintech are likely to reach into a   broad swath of the global economy  much like how digital technologies have become a necessity    rather than an option  for every industry. Understanding the seven features that characterize this   new era will allow companies to stake out the most valuable plots in the new landscape.
