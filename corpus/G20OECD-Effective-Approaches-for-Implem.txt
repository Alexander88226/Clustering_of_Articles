This document contains the final report on Effective Approaches for Implementing the G20/OECD High Level Principles on SME Financing. It is transmitted to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. 2. In  November  2015  at  their  Summit  in  Antalya  G20  Leaders  welcomed  and agreed  on  the  G20/OECD  HighLevel  Principles  on  SME  Financing  which  were developed by the OECD together with other relevant international organisations (IOs) at the request of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors. In their 2015 Antalya Action Plan G20 Leaders called for work to identify effective approaches to facilitate the implementation  of  the  Principles  and  in  2016  they  reiterated  their  support  for  their effective  implementation.  The  latter  was  also  supported  by  G20  Finance  Ministers  and Central Bank Governors at their February April and July 2016 meetings.  3. Building on the experience from recent exercises carried out to develop effective approaches to support the implementation of other G20/OECD HighLevel Principles a surveybased  process  was  adopted.  Two  surveys  were  conducted  through  the  OECD Working  Party  on  SMEs  and  Entrepreneurship  (WPSMEE)  and  the  G20/OECD  Task Force on Institutional Investors and LongTerm Financing (Task Force) the first relating to Principles 1 2 3 and 5 and the second covering Principles 4 6 8 9 10 and 11.  4. The results of the first survey were presented in an interim report submitted to the WPSMEE  and  Task  Force  for  comments  during  their  April  and  May  2017  meeting respectively.  A  revised  report  was  submitted  to  the  WPSMEE  during  its  October  2017 session  and  to  the  Task  Force  by  written  communication  also  in  October  2017.  The results of the second survey were presented to the WPSMEE at its meeting in April 2018 and to the Task Force at its meeting in May 2018.  With regard to policy approaches for enhancing  SME  financial  skills  (Principle  7)  a  dedicated  survey  was  launched  via  the OECD  International  Network  on  Financial  Education  (OECD/INFE)  and  its  working group on financial education for MSMEs in March 2017 building on recent work in this area.  A  preliminary  version  of  the  results  on  Principle  7  was  presented  at  the  8th OECD/INFE Technical Committee meeting in New Delhi in November 2017. The final version was circulated to OECD/INFE full members through written process in February 2018. 5. A  draft  consolidated  report  was  then  circulated  to  both  the  WPSMEE  and  the Task Force in May 2018 and discussed by WPMSEE and Task Force Delegates during a joint  meeting  on  23 May  2018. The report  was submitted  to  the  Infrastructure Working Group under written procedure in June 2018. 6. The report identifies a set of approaches for the implementation of the Principles based on the results of the surveys. The executive summary sets out the key findings from the exercise. A summary table of the full results of the exercise can be found in Annex A.      \\xe2\\x94\\x82 3    \\x0c4 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   Identify SME financing needs and gaps and improve the evidence base (Principle 1) 7. Governments  recognise  the  importance  of  building  the  evidence  base  for  policy making  in  the  area  of  SME  finance  and  take  steps  to  identify  the  financing  needs  and challenges of their SME population. In all participating countries a framework is in place to collect quantitative data on SME finance. Central banks and statistics offices generally play a major role in the collection of data on bank loans while countries tend to rely on the  data  provided  by  business  associations  as  regards  investments  in  SMEs  by  private equity and venture capital firms.  8. The large majority of countries also gather evidence on SMEs which do not have access to mainstream financial services and products through surveys. Governments rely on public bodies for such exercises too with only a few countries collecting data from or through  private  sector  providers.  Very  few  countries  collect  information  on  the  specific products SMEs do not have access to though. 9. Relevant  stakeholders  are  involved  in  the  assessment  of  SME  financing  gaps through institutionalised consultative bodies like an SME committee or panel or through more  informal  ad  hoc  consultations  (which  seems  more  frequent).  This  assessment  is generally  published  often  through  periodic  or  dedicated  online  publications  by  the central bank the ministry of finance or the SME agency.  Strengthen SME access to traditional bank financing (Principle 2) 10. Guarantees  appear  to  be  the  most  widespread  tool  to  strengthen  SME  access  to traditional  bank  financing.  Most  guarantee  schemes  target  specific  segments  which receive  preferential  conditions.  In  particular  innovative  and  growthoriented  SMEs young  and  women  entrepreneurs  as  well  as  startups  are  a  priority  for  many  guarantee programmes.  A  number  of  countries  have  also  put  in  place  measures  to  support  the securitisation  of  SME  loans  in  order  to  free  balance  sheets  and  favour  an  increase  in SME lending by spreading the risk across more players. In most countries these measures aim at creating an enabling and conducive framework including through the creation of registers to increase the availability and transparency of information. 11. Numerous  countries  have  put  in  place  simplified  or  accelerated  insolvency procedures  for  SMEs.  They  have  also  taken  measures  to  enhance  the  timeliness  in insolvency proceedings while ensuring that the insolvency framework provides creditors with a range of opportunities to monitor the progress of an insolvency administration in which they have an interest. This is generally coupled with a digitisation of the procedure intended  to  make  it  easier  and  quicker  to  deal  with.  Countries  have  also  strived  to improve  insolvency  competencies  in  courts in  particular  by  putting  in place specialised courts or judges. Enable SMEs to access diverse nontraditional financing instruments and channels (Principle 3) 12. On the demand side various platforms (generally online) and awareness seminars are  in  place  to  increase  the  knowledge  of  SME  owners  and  managers  of  all  available financing options.  13. On the supply side most countries provide equity to SMEs  via a government or governmentrelated institution or via subscriptions to funds. Initiatives to increase SME access  to  assetbased  financing  instruments  seem  to  have  focused  on  factoring  and supplychain  finance.  A  majority  of  countries  have  also  taken  steps  to  encourage  retail investors to invest in SME financial markets often in the form of tax incentives.      \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 5  Promoting financial inclusion for SMEs (Principle 4) 14. Young entrepreneurs SMEs located in remote areas and women entrepreneurs are the  most  widespread  priority  subsegments.  Programmes  targeting  specific  SME populations  are  more  rarely  evidencedriven  while  most  countries  can  provide  a breakdown  of  the  evidence  and  data  collected  on  SMEs  which  do  not  have  access  to mainstream financial products and services  by sector and size only a few countries can provide  a  breakdown  by  location  or  owner  demographics.  For  instance  while  26 countries have designed policies targeting SMEs located in remote areas only 6 countries collect  data  disaggregated  by  location.  There  appears  to  be  room  to  further  build  the evidence base as regards access to finance by specific subsegments. 15.  Most countries have taken steps to support the development of Fintech solutions as a way of increasing the financial inclusion of SMEs. Generally countries have created an  enabling  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  On  the  demand  side  governments  have provided  awareness  and  training  workshops  or  online  courses.  Fintech  appears  to  be viewed as an opportunity by policy makers and supervisors who aim to accompany the development  of  Fintech  solutions  and  mitigate  related  risks  (as  regards  investor protection and data privacy in particular). Design  regulation  that  supports  a  range  of  financing  instruments  for  SMEs  while ensuring financial stability and investor protection (Principle 5) 16. A  majority  of  countries  have  conducted  a  review  of  the  legal  and  regulatory framework  to  identify  measures  restricting  SME  access  to  finance.  Such  reviews  are generally  complemented  by  processes  aiming  at  considering  the  potential  impact  of relevant upcoming laws and regulations on SME access to finance at the drafting stage. A few  countries  have  undertaken  tax  reforms  with  the  explicit  aim  of  supporting  the diversification of financing instruments for SMEs. These reforms generally take the form of  fiscal  incentives  for  certain  types  of  investments  (e.g.  investments  in  venture  capital funds). Improving transparency in SME finance markets (Principle 6) 17. Digitalisation  appears  to  be  an  effective  way  to  improve  access  to  the  data contained  in  business  or  credit  registries.  It  can  also  help  increase  the  coverage  and relevance  of  these  data  by  making  submission  and  update  processes  simpler  and  less costly.  There  remain  important  differences  in  the  level  of  consultation  fees  across countries  though  which  may  reflect  different  views  as  regards  the  importance  of  free access to such information and transparency for an efficient functioning of markets. 18. Commercial  credit  reporting  companies  are  more  frequent  than  public  credit registries. Half of the countries which have commercial credit reporting companies have put  in  place  an  oversight  of  these  companies.  The  nature  of  the  oversight  and  the authority in charge vary across countries. The reflection on the risks which come with the benefits  such  companies  can  provide  to  market  players  and  the  most  efficient  way  of mitigating and managing them is still ongoing in many countries. Enhance SME financial skills and strategic vision (Principle 7) 19. Very few countries measure the financial skills of SME owners and managers in order to identify their strengths and weaknesses. Financial education initiatives for SMEs target  a  range  of  skills  including  basic  knowledge  of  financial  concepts  understanding traditional  and  alternative  financial  products  as  well  as  accessing  and  managing  credit. Most initiatives deliver financial education via workshops trainings printed booklets and     \\x0c6 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   online information but mobile phone applications online videos and elearning platforms are also emerging in some countries.  20. National  strategies  often  target  the  SME  population  as  a  whole.  Nonetheless  in some  countries  notforprofits  and  less  frequently  governments  tailor  programmes  to specific  segments  such  as  young  entrepreneurs  women  entrepreneurs  indigenous  and immigrant entrepreneurs or startups.  Empirical  evidence  on  the  effectiveness  of  financial  education  and  business 21. training programmes remains limited.   Adopting principles of risk sharing for publicly supported SME finance instruments (Principle 8) 22. Nearly  all  responding  countries  have  a  public  financial  institution  which contributes to national objectives regarding SME access to finance. It generally operates alongside  or  through  private  sector  players.  Banks  largely  remain  the  most  important partner  of  public  authorities  with  other  financial  institutions  (nonbank  financial institutions like leasing or factoring companies or equity funds) playing a less prominent role.  23. Guarantees to financing operations undertaken by SMEs with commercial players are the most widespread type of collaboration between privatesector financial institutions and  public  financial  institutions  (the  public  financial  institution  provides  guarantees  in twentysix  countries).  A  few  countries  offer  risksharing  instruments  other  than guarantees  (generally  firstloss  risk  cover).  In  slightly  more  than  a  third  of  countries which  have  a  public  financial  institution  the  public  financial  institution  coinvests alongside privatesector players. Encouraging  timely  payments  in  commercial  transactions  and  public  procurement (Principle 9) 24.  When  it  comes  to  tackling  the  cash  flow  issues  SMEs  may  face  as  a  result  of payment delays the majority of governments tend to focus on payments by public bodies while  they  seem  reluctant  to  restrict  the  contractual  freedom  of  private  firms  to  pay invoices.  There  are  numerous  initiatives  in  that  area  from  prompt  payment  codes  to tracking  systems  which  can  provide  detailed  information  on  payment  delays  by  public bodies.  Some  of  these  mechanisms  have  proved  particularly  effective  in  swiftly  and substantially reducing payment delays. Designing  public  programmes  for  SME  finance  which  ensure  additionality  cost effectiveness and userfriendliness (Principle 10) 25. Ensuring  the  financial  and  economic  additionality  of  public  programmes  is  a guiding principle in almost all countries. There are different interpretations of what these concepts  imply  though.  There  appears  to  be  room  to  improve  the  methodology  when assessing the additionality of programmes. Likewise while a large majority of countries report  that  a  framework  is  in  place  to  ensure  that  the  costs  associated  with  the implementation  of  public  programmes  do  not  outweigh  their  benefits  less  than  a  third conduct  a  formal  assessment.  Regarding  userfriendliness  governments  recognise  the importance of raising SME awareness of programmes for which they may be eligible and do so through dedicated websites or awareness campaigns.      \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 7  Monitoring  and  evaluating  public  programmes  to  enhance  SME  finance  (Principle 11) 26. There  is  a  contrast  between  governments\\xe2\\x80\\x99  recognition  of  the  importance  of evaluating programmes to improve SME access to finance and corresponding evaluation methodologies  and  procedures.  Very  few  countries  conduct  evaluations  based  on  a rigorous methodology and thorough metrics in a systematic manner. There also appears to be scope to increase the extent to which the findings of evaluations are taken into account when  designing  new  programmes.  However  most  countries  do  publish  evaluations generally online.       \\x0c8 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   Introduction 27. In  November  2015  at  their  Summit  in  Antalya  G20  Leaders  welcomed  and agreed  on  the  G20/OECD  HighLevel  Principles  on  SME  Financing  which  were developed by the OECD together with other relevant international organisations (IOs) at the request of G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors.  28. The Principles are voluntary and nonbinding and addressed to G20 and OECD members  and  other  interested  economies  and  can  apply  to  diverse  circumstances  and different economic social and regulatory environments (see Box 1). They provide broad guidelines  for  the  development  of  crosscutting  policy  strategies  efforts  to  benchmark policies and the assessment of current initiatives on SME financing at the local national and  international  levels.  The  Principles  also  aim  to  encourage  dialogue  exchange  of experiences  and  coordination  including  regulatory  coordination  among  stakeholders  in SME finance among which policy makers financial institutions research institutions and SME  management  on  how  to  enhance  SME  access  to  finance  and  increase  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 contribution to resilient and inclusive growth. 29. In  their  2015  Antalya  Action  Plan  G20  Leaders  called  for  work  to  identify effective approaches to facilitate the implementation of the Principles and in 2016 they reiterated  that  call.  Work  on  effective  approaches  was  also  supported  by  G20  Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors at their February April and July 2016 meetings. 30. Building on the experience from recent exercises carried out to develop effective approaches  to  support  the  implementation  of  other  G20/OECD  HighLevel  Principles including  those  on  longterm  investment  financing  by  institutional  investors1  and  on financial consumer protection2 a surveybased process was adopted. In November 2016 a first survey was launched that considered a subset of related Principles i.e. Principles 1 2  3  and  5  which  cover  key  framework  issues  for  SME  finance.  The  survey  was conducted through  the  G20/OECD  Task  Force on  Institutional  Investors and  Longterm Financing  (hereafter  the  Task  Force)  and  the  OECD  Working  Party  on  SMEs  and Entrepreneurship (hereafter the WPSMEE).                                                        1 See  Report on Effective  Approaches to Support  Implementation of the G20/OECD HighLevel Principles  on  Longterm  Investment  Financing  by  Institutional  Investors  submitted  to  the  G20 Brisbane Summit in November 2014. 2 See Update Report on the Work to Support the Implementation of the G20 HighLevel Principles on  Financial  Consumer  Protection  and  Annex  submitted  to  the  G20  Saint  Petersburg  Summit  in September 2013 as well as Effective Approaches to Support the Implementation of the remaining G20  HighLevel  Principles  on  Financial  Consumer  Protection  and  Addendum  submitted  to  G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors at their meeting in Cairns in September 2014.     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 9  Box 1.

Twentyfive  countries  including  10  G20  countries  completed  the  first  survey Austria Belgium Canada Chile China the Czech Republic Denmark Estonia France Germany  Greece  Ireland  Israel  Italy  Japan  Latvia  Lithuania  Mexico  Portugal  the Russian  Federation  Spain  Sweden  Switzerland  Turkey  and  the  United  Kingdom.  The results of this first survey were presented in an interim report submitted for comments to the WPSMEE and Task Force during their April and May 2017 meeting respectively. A revised report was submitted to the WPSMEE during its October 2017 session and to the Task Force by written communication also in October 2017. The revised report was submitted along with a draft second survey relating to the 32. remaining Principles i.e. Principles 4 6 8 9 10 and 11. 33. After  taking  Delegates\\xe2\\x80\\x99  comments  on  the  draft  survey  into  account  the  second survey was circulated to the Task Force on 30 November 2017 and to the WPSMEE on 1 December 2017.  34. Thirtyeight countries including 14 G20 countries completed the second survey Australia  Austria  Belgium  Canada  Chile  China  Colombia  Costa  Rica  the  Czech Republic  Denmark  Egypt  Estonia  Finland  France  Germany  Greece  Ireland  Israel Italy  Japan Korea  Latvia  Lithuania Mexico  the  Netherlands  New  Zealand  Norway Poland  Portugal  Romania  the  Russian  Federation  South  Africa  Spain  Sweden Switzerland Turkey the United Kingdom and the United States. A report on the results of the second survey was submitted to the WPSMEE during its April 2018 meeting and to the Task Force during its May 2018.  35.  With  regard  to  policy  approaches  for  enhancing  SME  financial  skills  (Principle 7)  a  dedicated  survey  was  launched  via  the  OECD  International  Network  on  Financial Education  (OECD/INFE)  and  its  working  group  on  financial  education  for  MSMEs  in     \\x0c10 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   March  2017  building  on  recent  work  in  this  area3.  Thirteen  authorities  from  twelve countries and economies submitted replies Angola Austria Canada the Czech Republic Estonia  Hong  Kong  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  China  India  Indonesia  Japan  Portugal  Spain  and  Turkey.  A preliminary  version  of  the  results  on  Principle  7  was  presented  at  the  8th  OECD/INFE Technical  Committee  meeting  in  New  Delhi  in  November  2017.  The  final  version  was circulated to OECD/INFE full members through written process in February 2018. Given the limited number of responses the section on Principle 7 does not distinguish between common  and  other approaches  on the one  hand  and innovative  approaches  on  the  other hand.  It  also  draws  on  other  work  of  the  OECD/INFE  on  the  financial  education  of MSMEs including a stock taking survey conducted in 20154.  36. A draft consolidated report covering all principles and based on the results of all surveys was discussed during a meeting gathering delegates from both the WPSMEE and the Task Force in May 2018. Comments were taken into account in a draft final report which was submitted to 37. the Infrastructure Working Group under written procedure in June 2018. A table summarising the full results of the exercise can be found in Annex A. The 38. three questionnaires can be found in an Addendum to this document. Definitions of common other and innovative approaches \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommon  approaches\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  are  approaches  which  are  adopted  by  a  majority  of 39. responding countries. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOther approaches\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are approaches which are adopted by less than a majority of 40. countries. 41. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInnovative  approaches\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  are  approaches  adopted  by  only  a  few  countries (sometimes  only  one  country)  which  show  some  novelty  in  the  approach  adopted  to implement the principle and potential for replication. 42. Policies  are  qualified  as  effective  when  they  are  considered  to  be  effective  by implementing  countries  and  when  experience  results  and  evidence  suggest  that  this  is the case. 43. The  effective  approaches  identified  in  the  report  are  not  comprehensive illustrative and  nonbinding.  They  are intended as examples  to  assist  policy  makers  and other relevant stakeholders in their policy work to improve SME access to finance.                                                          3 See OECD/INFE High Level Principles on National Strategies for Financial Education endorsed by G20 Leaders at their Los Cabos Summit in June 2012. 4  The  survey  fed  into  the  OECD  working  paper  "Financial  Education  for  MSMEs  and  Potential Entrepreneurs".     \\x0cReport on Effective Approaches for Implementing the G20/OECD HighLevel Principles on SME Financing   \\xe2\\x94\\x82 11      \\x0c12 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   Principle 1  Identify SME financing needs and gaps and improve the evidence base As  a  first  step  in  developing  a  strategy  to  enhance  SME  access  to  finance  governments  should assess the extent to which SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financing needs are met and where gaps exist in cooperation with relevant stakeholders including central banks and financial supervisory authorities financial and research institutions and SME representatives. This requires a strong evidence base and a better understanding  of  SME  financing  needs  and  challenges  by  public  authorities  and  financial suppliers.5  Efforts  should  be  placed  on  improving  statistical  information  on  SME  financing particularly in developing economies where a lack of reliable evidence constrains policy design implementation and assessment. This calls for cooperation at the national and international levels (including through an expansion of the OECD Scoreboard on Financing SMEs and Entrepreneurs) to increase transparency regarding definitions improve the comparability of data and indicators within  and  across  countries6  facilitate international  benchmarking7  and  regulatory  coordination and shed light on outstanding financing gaps and issues.  Common and other approaches 44. Governments  recognise  the  importance  of  building  the  evidence  base  for  policy making  in  the  area  of  SME  finance  and  take  steps  to  identify  the  financing  needs  and challenges  of  their  SME  population.  In  all  the  countries  surveyed  a  framework  is  in place to collect quantitative data on SME finance.  45. As regards data on bank loans the central bank and statistics office generally play a major role in data collection efforts. Data collected almost always include SME loan stocks and flows interest rates and nonperforming loans rates. Less frequently data is collected  on  loan  rejection  rates collateral  requests  drawdowns  overdraft  utilisation                                                       5  Evidence  on  SME  financing  including  micro  data  and  micro  analysis  is  needed  for informed  policy  discussion;  the  evaluation  of  policies;  monitoring  the  implications  of  financial reforms on SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to finance and for a better understanding by financial suppliers of SME financing needs. Evidence on financing needs and gaps by firm size and stage in the firm life cycle is especially important to tailor policy  strategies. In this regard regular quantitative demandside surveys can represent an important source of information but their harmonisation at the national regional  and  international  level  should  be  encouraged  to  improve  the  quality  of  information  and crosscountry comparability. 6  by differences in definitions and methodology. At the  international level comparison of data on  SME  finance is significantly  hampered 7  Strengthening  the  ability  to  document  differences  in  SME  access  to  finance  across countries can shed light on policy experiences and facilitate the exchange and adaptation of good policy practices.     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 13  loan  terms  and  conditions  direct  government  loans  government  guaranteed  loans restructured loans or export credit guarantees.  46. Data  collection  is  done  through  reporting  exercises  to  these  public  bodies  as well  as  through  surveys.  While  reporting  is  due  on  a  regular  basis  (with  basic  data collected on a monthly basis) surveys are conducted either on a regular basis or based on needs  (before  designing  a  new  programme  for  example).  Their  frequency  can  vary substantially from one type of survey to another as well as from one country to another. That  frequency  can  be  linked  to  the  scope  of  the  survey.  For  instance  some  countries conduct  resourceintensive  surveys  on  a  pluriannual  basis  and  lighter  surveys  in  the years these resourceintensive surveys are not conducted. 47. For data on funds received by SMEs from private equity and venture capital firms  or  business  angels  most  countries  rely  on  relevant  or  specialised  business associations. These associations tend to collect data through surveys which are generally conducted on an annual basis with some data also collected on a biannual or quarterly basis. 48. Other sources used to collect both  quantitative and qualitative  data include bank associations  economic  research  institutes  and  research  centres  development  banks  (for all countries which have one) and guarantee institutions. Resort to data from commercial providers and nongovernmental organisations is rarely mentioned. 49. Breakdowns  collected  almost  always  include  size  sector  and  location.  Age  of firm  and  form  of  ownership  are  collected  by  some  countries  albeit  less  frequently. Collection of data on owner characteristics is also less frequent sometimes due to privacy laws or confidentiality concerns. However a number of countries do collect data on the gender or age of the owner as well as other characteristics like the birth country of the owner for example. 50. A large majority of surveyed countries also gather evidence on SMEs which do  not  have  access  to  mainstream  financial  services  and  products8  (29  out  of  38). Surveys appear to be an effective tool to gather such evidence with around twothirds of countries conducting a survey or several surveys.  51. Breakdowns by sector and size appear to be the most prevalent (with 14 countries which can provide a breakdown by size  generally measured by number of employees or turnover  and  14  countries  which  can  provide  a  breakdown  by  sector).  Breakdowns  by other dimensions are less widespread (only seven countries can provide a breakdown  by location and six a breakdown by owner demographics). 52.  While  there  is  a  certain  variety  in  the  bodies  through  which  data  is  collected (whether  through  surveys  or  not)  public  bodies  are  considered  to  be  effective  data providers with only a few countries resorting to evidence collected by the private sector.                                                       8  The  paragraphs  on  evidence  gathered  by  countries  on  SMEs  which  do  not  have  access  to mainstream financial services and products draw on  countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 replies to related survey questions under Principle 4. They are grouped with information gathered under Principle 1 since replies to these  questions  both  relate  to  identifying  SME  financing  needs  and  gaps  and  improving  the evidence gap. Under Principle 1 countries have provided information on the data they collect on the  funding  provided  to  SMEs  while  under  Principle  4  countries  have  provided  information  on how they gather evidence on SMEs which do not have access to mainstream financial services and products.      \\x0c14 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   The two most prevalent bodies involved are the central bank or supervisor (mentioned by 18  countries)  and  the  statistics  office  (mentioned  by  12).  Other  public  bodies  involved include  government  agencies  (in  eight  countries)  ministries  (in  five  countries)  the development or public bank (in five countries). Six countries also leverage data collected by international organisations.  53. Very  few  countries  collect  evidence  on  the  specific  products  SMEs  do  not  have access to  with the  information  gathered  through  survey  processes relating  to  \\xe2\\x80\\x9caccess to finance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in general. Among the countries which do not collect data on the products SMEs have access to or not one country however organises informal roundtables with SMEs on an ad hoc basis in order to better understand the financing products to which they have sufficient and insufficient access.  54.  When  it  comes  to  gathering  comparative  evidence  from  other  countries  and regions  to  assess  SME  financing  trends  and  conditions  nine  countries  mention  the OECD  Scoreboard  on  Financing  SMEs  and  Entrepreneurs  with  six  out  of  nine relying on the Scoreboard only. Most Eurozone countries also use data produced by the European  Central  Bank  (in  particular  data  collected  through  the  European  Central Bank/European Commission Survey on the Access to Finance of Enterprises and the ECB Bank Lending Survey) as well as data produced by Eurostat. Survey replies also suggest that  other  Eurozone  countries  are  considered  as  the  relevant  benchmark  for  these countries. 55. The  OECD  SME  Financing  Scoreboard  appears  as  the  main  tool  through which  surveyed  countries  contribute  to  international  efforts  to  improve  the comparability of statistical data on SME finance. Out of 22 countries which answered this  question  16  countries  mentioned  the  Scoreboard  and  12  the  Scoreboard  only. Countries which participate in other initiatives to improve the comparability of statistical data  on  SME  finance  are  generally  European  Union  countries  which  participate  in European Union initiatives including through the SME Envoys Network. 56. A large majority of countries report that they involve relevant stakeholders in  the  assessment  of  SME  financing  gaps.  These  include  the  main  public  bodies (central  bank  ministry  of  finance  and  statistics  office)  as  well  as  relevant  business associations  (banks  association  private  equity  and  venture  capital  association  and sometimes  also  SME  association).  Some  countries  have  an  SME  committee  or  panel which  meets  on  a  regular  basis  (generally  three  or  four  times  a  year)  to  discuss  SMErelated questions including access to finance and serves as a consultative body. For most countries though the consultation process seems to be more informal and conducted on an  ad  hoc  rather  than  regular  basis.  Consultations  sometimes  also  include  research institutes or experts. 57. Likewise  most  countries  report  that  they  publish  the  government  assessment  of SME financing needs and trends. This publication takes various forms. Periodic or ad hoc publications by the central bank ministry of finance or SME agency are widespread with publication  often  occurring  on  the  respective  websites  of  these  bodies.  Less  frequently some countries also publish press releases or organise press conferences to make the main highlights of this assessment known to the general public. Innovative approaches  58. A novel approach adopted to gather data on funding provided to SMEs by private equity  and  venture  capital  firms  or  business  angels  is  a  partnership  between  public     \\x0cbodies (central bank ministry of finance and/or statistics office) and private equity venture capital or angel capital business associations to conduct surveys on the state of  SME  financing  in  these  segments.  This  represents  an  interesting  combination  of access to the relevant companies on the one hand and technical capacity on the other hand (since  these  public  bodies  have  technical  capacities  in  the  statistics  field  in  particular that  very  few  business  associations  have  to  the  same  extent)  in  a  sector  which  is  not submitted to the same type of regulation as the banking sector and whose players do not submit regular reportings.

Measures  may  include  credit  guarantees securitisation  credit  insurance  and  adequate  provisioning  for  loan  losses.  Risk  mitigation measures  should  be  strengthened  making  use  of  new  technologies  and  mechanisms  for underwriting  risk.  Effective  and  predictable  insolvency  regimes  should  ensure  creditor  rights while  supporting  healthy  companies  and  offering  a  second  chance  for  honest  entrepreneurs. Likewise  SMEs  should  be afforded credit  on  reasonable  terms  and  with  appropriate  consumer protection measures in place. Policy makers should consider enabling SMEs to use a broader set of  assets  beyond  fixed  collateral  such  as  movable  assets  to  secure  loans.  The  feasibility  of expanding the use of intangibles as collateral should be carefully considered to ease access to lending  particularly  by  knowledgebased  companies  while  taking  into  account  potential  risks. The use of credit information should also be enabled to improve risk management for lenders and access for borrowers. Improving banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 capacity to lend to SMEs Common and other approaches 59. Out of 25 countries which completed the survey 23 provide direct policy support to bank lending to SMEs. Guarantees to SME loans appear to be the most widespread instrument  with  guarantee  funds  mentioned  by  almost  all  countries  and  as  the  main pillar of support for SME lending. Guarantees are generally capped but this cap can be quite  high  and  a few countries  guarantee  up  to  100%  of  the amount  of the  loans.  Most countries  have  one  guarantee  fund  providing  guarantees  for  SME  loans.  In  a  few countries  various  institutions  are  involved  depending  on  the  sector  in  which  the  SME operates  for  instance.  Most  guarantee  funds  target  specific  segments  which  receive preferential  conditions.  In  particular  innovative  and  growthoriented  SMEs  young and women entrepreneurs as well as startups are a priority for a number of guarantee programmes. 60. Incentives to foster SME lending by commercial banks are less widespread than direct  support  policy  measures  (eight  countries  do  not  have  such  incentives).  For European Union countries incentives include the SME supporting factor introduced in the Capital Requirements Directive IV under which the capital requirement for loans to SMEs is reduced by the application of a 0.7619 multiplier. A similar multiplier is applied in some nonEU countries. Other incentives include a lower reserve requirement ratio and  different  terms  for  liquidity  provision  for  countries  which  have  a  minimum amount of SME loans or share of SME loans in their total loan portfolio. 61. In 14 countries the government has put in place or is in the process of introducing measures to support the securitisation of SME loans. In most cases these measures aim at creating an enabling and conducive framework through legal and regulatory reform or the creation of registers increasing the availability and transparency of information. In     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 17  countries which have a public financial institution it generally participates actively in the  securitisation  market  so  as  to  support  its  growth.  One  country  has  worked  to increase  awareness  and  skills  in  that  area  by  the  means  of  inhouse  and  external seminars and trainings to help market  participants understand securitisation and actively participate in the market. These seminars are complemented by online information. 62. As regards the effectiveness of measures only six countries could reply that the measures  implemented  had  proven  effective.  In  other  countries  the  measures  were  just being put in place or it was too early to tell whether they had been effective. Innovative approaches 63. Some innovative approaches intend to  make the credit approval process more transparent to SMEs. In one country banks have an obligation to provide SMEs with a standardised  credit  report  and  with  their  credit  rating  based  on  a  common methodology. Another country has put in place a credit review office providing a credit appeals process for SMEs. The credit review office is meant to help SMEs who have had an application for credit of up to three million euros declined or reduced by participating banks but feel that they have a viable business proposition. It also looks at cases where borrowers feel that the terms and conditions of their existing loan or a new loan offer are unfairly onerous or have been unreasonably changed to their detriment.  64. As regards securitisation in one country the government supported the creation of a securitisation company on the initiative of the central bank and in partnership with commercial  banks.  This  company  issues  guaranteed  debt  securities  backed  by  loan portfolios  including  SME  and  midcap  loan  portfolios.  These  securities  can  be  used  as collateral  in  capital  markets  operations.  The  company  rating  system  established  by  the central bank plays a major role in the good functioning of this scheme.  Insolvency regime Common and other approaches 65. Nineteen countries have introduced measures to streamline insolvency procedures and  reduce  the  related  administrative  burden.  These  measures  tend  to  put  in  place simplified  or  accelerated  procedures  for  SMEs  thus  aiming  at  making  them  more manageable  for  entrepreneurs  and  small  businesses  which  may  not  have  internal  legal resources or access to external legal advice. 66. Eighteen  countries  have  taken  measures  to  enhance  timeliness  in  insolvency proceedings.  Overall  the  measures  established  clear  timelines  for  the  various  steps  of insolvency proceedings (in particular the filing of  claims the creditors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 meeting and the court hearing) or shortened these timelines. This was often coupled with a digitisation of the  procedure  through  online  forms  meant  to  make  it  easier  and  quicker  to  deal  with. Only three countries have conducted evaluations of the effectiveness of measures to enhance  timeliness  in  insolvency  proceedings  one  through  a  government  evaluation body  one  through  an  independent  consultancy  and  one  through  a  published  research article. 67. Sixteen  countries  have  taken  steps  to  ensure  that  the  insolvency  framework provides creditors with a range of opportunities to receive information and to monitor the progress  of an insolvency  administration  in  which  they  have  an  interest.  Seven of  these countries  have  put  in  place  an  online  insolvency  register.  While  it  generally  provides     \\x0c18 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   realtime  access to submissions  made  by  other  parties  to the  proceedings reports of  the insolvency  administrator  and  issued  judgements  of  the  court  there  are  some  variations across countries in both the extent of the information contained in the online register and the  extent  of  the  access  provided  (i.e.  who  can  access  the  register  and  when  the information it contains can be accessed). 68. One country has put in place an insolvency bulletin in the form of an electronic newsletter  which  provides renegotiations  and reorganizations  conducted  and  undertaken.  This  bulletin  is  considered  as  the  only  valid form to notify the parties. Any person can have access to the newsletter and review all the proceedings undertaken. information  about liquidations 69. Seventeen  countries  have  taken  measures  to  enhance  insolvency  competencies in courts. Out of these 17 countries 14 have put in place specialised courts or judges and two have provided specific training to judges. 70. A  few  countries  allow  debt  discharge  to  facilitate  a  second  chance  for  nonfraudulent  entrepreneurs. However  the timelines  vary  substantially  from  one country to another.  In  one  country  debtors  subject  to  bankruptcy  are  discharged  from  their  debts after  12  months  with  the  restriction  extended  beyond  12  months  only  when  there  has been some  wrongdoing.  In  another  country  however  early  debt  discharge for  insolvent entrepreneurs implies that while the general rule is that a discharge can only be obtained after six years an early discharge is available after three years provided that the debtor covers  the  costs  of  the  proceedings  and  discharges  at  least  35%  of  outstanding  debts. Some  countries  report  that  no  such  regime  is  in  place.  In  one  of  them  an  insolvent entrepreneur cannot request any credit from banks for seven years.  Innovative approaches 71. The most favourable regime in terms of debt discharge under which debtors are discharged of their debts after 12 months also includes some innovative features intended to allow a nonfraudulent entrepreneur to quickly start a new activity. In particular during bankruptcy  a  debtor  may  keep  their  tools  of  trade  and  a  vehicle  to  enable  them  to continue  to  work.  They  may  also  set  up  a  new  business  whilst  bankrupt  but  must disclose  their  full  name  and  if  obtaining  credit  over  a  limit  must  disclose  their bankruptcy status. A bankrupt individual cannot be a company director but s/he can seek leave of the court to take on or continue a directorship. Collateral common and other approaches 72. Among  measures to reduce  the  costs and time  for  filing  and  registering  security interests a few countries have digitised this registration so that it can be made in a few minutes. Digital registers also appear as an effective way of publicising the existence of security rights on assets to creditors purchasers and the general public. 73. Only three countries reported having taken steps to facilitate the use of nonfixed and intangible assets (such as patents trademarks and other intellectual property) to secure loans. Two countries have undertaken evaluations to assess the benefits costs and risks implied by the use of nonfixed and intangible assets to secure loans.     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 19  Selected effective approaches to strengthen SME access to traditional bank financing based on survey results \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Providing government guarantees to SME loans with specific programmes targeting priority segments (women entrepreneurs young entrepreneurs startups etc.). \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Supporting  the  securitisation  of  SME  loans  including  by  creating  an  enabling  and conducive legal and regulatory framework or by putting in place a register increasing the availability and transparency of information. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Making  the  credit  approval  process  more  transparent  to  SMEs  for  instance  by providing them with a standardised credit report and with their credit rating based on a standardised methodology. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Making insolvency procedures simpler and quicker for SMEs including by digitising the process (through an online register allowing online submission of forms and realtime consultations by the parties along the process) or by establishing clear timelines for the various steps of insolvency proceedings. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Enhancing  insolvency  competencies  in  courts  through  specialised  courts  judges  or the provision of specific training to judges. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Digitising  the  registration  of  security  interests;  digital  registers  can  also  be  an effective  way  of  publicising  the  existence  of  security  rights  on  assets  to  creditors purchasers and the general public.       \\x0c20 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   Principle 3  Enable SMEs to access diverse nontraditional financing instruments and channels Recognising the complementary nature of the role of banks and other financing channels access to  a  sufficiently  broad  range  of  SME  financing  instruments  is  desirable  in  order  to  obtain  the form and volume of financing best suited to SMEs specific needs and the stage of the firm lifecycle.  Multiple  and  competing  sources  of  finance  for  SMEs  should  be  supported  and  efforts should be made to increase entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 awareness of the available financing options through targeted  outreach  initiatives.  The  development  of  alternative  financial  instruments  for  SMEs should  also  aim  to  attract  a  wider  range  of  investors  including  institutional  investors9  and  to enhance their understanding of SME markets. Assetbased finance10 could be fostered to enable young and small firms to access working capital on rapid and flexible terms as well as supply chain and trade finance to support their integration in global value chains. Alternative forms of debt11  could  be  cultivated  to  enable  SMEs  to  invest  expand  and  restructure.  Adequate  policy attention  should  go  to  the  development  of  hybrid  tools12  and  equity  instruments13  to  strengthen SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  capital  structure  and  boost  investment  in  innovative  startups  and  highgrowth  SMEs14. Special consideration should be given to venture and private equity financing including capital for seed early and later stage investments as well as to trade finance instruments. Increasing entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 awareness of the available financing options Common and other approaches 74. Online platforms providing comprehensive and tailored information in order to  increase  the  knowledge  of  SME  owners  and  managers  of  all  available  financing options are common. Information programmes and campaigns are widespread. They can                                                       9  institutional investors and their related effective approaches.  See  also  the  G20/OECD  High  level  Principles  of  long  term  investment  financing  by 10  finance warehouse receipts and leasing. Asset based finance includes for example assetbased lending factoring purchase order 11  Alternative forms of debt include corporate bonds private placements direct lending by nonbank institutions and peertopeer lending. Hybrid 12  loans  and  bonds  silent  participations participating  loans  profit  participation  rights  convertible  bonds  bonds  with  warrants  and mezzanine finance include  subordinated instruments 13  instruments specialised platforms for public listing of SMEs and equitybased crowdfunding Equity instruments comprise venture capital business angel investing other private equity 14  instruments for investors. The existence of appropriate channels for exit can help increase the attractiveness of these     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 21  take different forms and be undertaken by various stakeholders depending on the country context. Examples include awareness actions conducted by the public financial institution in partnership with the chamber of commerce in the form of seminars in the capital and in the regions. They are sometimes accompanied by tailored consulting services.  In one country  free  regional  advisory  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclinics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  give  SMEs  the  opportunity  to  meet  with  a corporate finance expert to discuss in private and on a onetoone basis their individual funding  plans.  Another  one  has launched an  SME Business  Navigator  which is  a free web tool for entrepreneurs willing to start a business which provides them with helpful information  including  on  financing  options.  To  make  the  SME  Business  Navigator particularly accessible mobile applications are available. Innovative approaches 75. Innovative  approaches  go  beyond  raising  awareness  or  providing  consulting services and play an active role in matching SMEs with funds or investors. This can be achieved through an  online platform matching startups and investor needs a business network  created  by  the  government  or  a  concierge  service  offering  free  customised advice to SMEs and connecting them to funding and support programmes that will help them  grow  their  business  through  innovation.  Such  matching  can  also  be  achieved through \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMeet the Funder Events\\xe2\\x80\\x9d providing businesses with information on and access to  a  range  of  funding  providers.  Speakers  address  how  businesses  should  approach  the funding process and companies have an opportunity to network with funding providers.  76. One country has also put in place a  referral regime whereby SMEs rejected for credit  by  the  largest  banks  must  be  offered  a  referral  to  a  designated  online  finance platform. Broadening the base of SME investors common and other approaches 77. Governments  in  15  countries  have  taken  action  to  encourage  retail  investors  to invest  in  SME  financial  markets.  In  two  thirds  of  these  countries  this  took  the  form  of tax incentives. Tax reductions granted for investments in SMEs are always capped but this  cap  varies  substantially  across  countries.  Eligibility  for  the  tax  reduction  may  also depend on the fulfilment of a certain number of criteria which can include the age of the SME  its  location  or  the  way  the  shares  were  acquired  (must  be  via  a  crowdfunding platform for example). Assetbased finance Common and other approaches 78. Only  a  few  countries  report  having  taken  action  to  support  the  development  of assetbased lending for SMEs in some cases because such reforms are not considered to be  needed  because  an  enabling  framework  is  already  in  place.  A  few  countries  have promoted factoring of electronically recorded monetary claims while industry efforts aim  at  developing  systems  that  enable  different  electronic  monetary  claim  recording institutions to electronically transfer recorded monetary claims to each other. Some others have put in place a framework supporting supply chain finance for instance by allowing lending between nonfinancial institutions if there is a commercial link between them. A few countries have set up supply chain finance electronic platforms accompanied with access to assistance and training.     \\x0c22 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   Innovative approaches 79. One  country  after  setting  up  an  online  platform  providing  a  registration  service for  accounts  receivable  pledges  and  transfers  finance  leases  inventory  and  warehouse receipts pledges as well  as a public notification system for movable assets financing is working on a service platform for inventory finance. With the authorisation of the owner lenders  could  have  access  to  the  warehouse  system  for  owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  inventory  historical record. Information related to the collateral situation would also be available during the effective  period  of  pledge.  The  platform  would also enable the  simultaneous  exchange of commodities ownership information. Alternative forms of debt corporate bonds and private placements common and other approaches 80. Fifteen  countries  have  introduced  measures  to  enhance  the  public  issuance trading and clearing conditions of corporate debt securities. Nine report that rules are in place to provide for private placements of corporate securities. In 17 countries the legal and regulatory framework allows nonlisted SMEs to issue corporate bonds and this can generally  be  done  on  the  same  terms  as  for  listed  companies  which  include  the preparation of a prospectus unless an exemption is granted. Such exemptions are granted for issuances below a certain cap or addressed to sophisticated investors only for instance. Hybrid instruments common and other approaches 81. A  few  countries  support  the  provision  of  mezzanine  finance  to  SMEs  through mezzanine funds targeting SMEs and with the objective of supporting the development of  commercial  mezzanine  finance  markets.  These  funds  can  be  managed  by  the  public financial  institution  for  countries  which  have  one  or  funding  can  be  provided  to  a privately  managed  fund  extending  mezzanine  finance  to  SMEs.  One  country  has  put  in place  a  micromezzanine  fund  which  provides  silent  partnerships  for  SMEs  with smaller funding needs. Equity finance Common and other approaches 82. In  21  countries  a  government  or  governmentrelated  institution  makes direct  equity  investments  in  SMEs.  The  public  financial  institution  is  generally  in charge of these equity investments through a series of different funds. They are generally coinvestments alongside private investors. In most cases this is combined with indirect equity investments through funds of funds.  83. A  few  countries  offer  targeted  initiatives  to  improve  investorreadiness  of  startups  and  SMEs  generally  through  accelerators  or  incubators  providing  them  with training (finance and pitching training in particular) as well as mentoring coaching and networking opportunities. 84. In  most countries seed and early stage investors such as venture capitalists and business  angels  are  not  subject  to  licensing  norms  solvency  or  funding  requirements accounting requirements or investment regulations. Likewise very few jurisdictions have restrictions  on  investments  in  seed  and  early  stage  ventures  by  banks  insurance companies or retail collective investment. Restrictions tend to affect pension funds more     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 23  with  eight  countries  mentioning  restrictions  in  pension  funds\\xe2\\x80\\x99  investments  in  seed  and early stage ventures. 85. Support  to  equity  investments  through  tax  incentives  is  widespread.  However foreigners are eligible for these incentives in only eight countries and in two of these countries  only  if  they  are  resident  while  for  two  others  only  EU  or  EEA  citizens  are eligible. As regards listings rules and requirements are adapted to small equity issuers in 86. 13 countries. Innovative approaches 87. In a few countries support is provided to SMEs which are or will be listed in the form of mentoring/coaching with the objective of helping them comply with listing requirements. Such support can even be mandatory until one year after the listing. Crowdfunding common and other approaches 88. A  clear  regulatory  framework  is  in  place  in  13  countries.  However  this framework generally covers only equity crowdfunding. Various limitations apply to both the issuer and the investor. The issuer is submitted to a number of information and publication obligations. The amount the issuer can raise can also be limited. Investors are limited  in  the  amounts  they  can  invest  and  may  be  obliged  to  seek  the  advice  of  an investment adviser. Caps vary substantially across countries. 89.  Campaigns  to  increase  awareness  on  crowdfunding  options  are  conducted  in various forms including seminars crowdfunding days and brochures on crowdfunding. Some countries focus on the risks associated with equity crowdfunding for investors and carefully monitor the activity of crowdfunding platforms.   Selected  effective  approaches  to  enable  SMEs  to  access  diverse  nontraditional financing instruments and channels based on survey results \\xef\\x82\\xb7 Increasing  awareness  of  SME  owners  and  managers  of  all  available  financing options through a combination of online platforms information programmes and seminars delivered in various locations across the country.  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Matching  SMEs  with  funds  or  investors  through  an  online  platform  or  through dedicated events.  \\xef\\x82\\xb7 Improving  the  investorreadiness  of  startups  and  SMEs  through  accelerators  or incubators  providing  them  with  training  as  well  as  mentoring  coaching  and networking opportunities. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Putting in place a referral regime whereby SMEs rejected for credit by the largest banks must be offered a referral to a designated online finance platform.       \\x0c24 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   Principle 4. Promote financial inclusion for SMEs and ease access to formal financial services including for informal firms Policy  should  aim  to  maximise  the  number  of  SMEs  which  have  access  to  and  use mainstream  financial  services and  products  at  a  reasonable  cost.  Financial  inclusion  is an important tool to reduce informality and national financial inclusion strategies should include reviewing the legal and regulatory framework of the financial sector; defining a public  intervention  strategy  and  identifying  appropriate  delivery  instruments;  and ensuring  the  existence  of  tools  for  groups  excluded  from  the  formal  banking  sector. Microfinance  schemes  should  be  given  adequate  attention  particularly  in  developing countries as a means to enhance entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to small amounts of funding at an affordable cost. Common and other approaches  90.  Most  countries  have  implemented  numerous  measures  in  the  field  of  financial inclusion although they do not necessarily fall under a financial inclusion strategy. Only six countries have a financial inclusion strategy. SME access to finance is an important dimension  of  countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99  work  in  the  area  of  financial  inclusion  with  21  countries signalling that SMEs are among targets in the financial inclusion strategy or in measures in the area of financial inclusion (out of 24 concerned). These are reviewed regularly in 17 countries including seven countries in which the review is conducted annually. 91. As  regards  policies  aiming  at  increasing  the  access  to  finance  of  specific  subsegments  priority  segments  are  generally  young  entrepreneurs  SMEs  located  in remote  areas  and  women  entrepreneurs  (with  specific  policies  targeting  these  subsegments  in  around  twothirds  of  surveyed  countries).  Half  as  many  countries  have launched  programmes  targeting  senior  entrepreneurs and  entrepreneurs  with  disabilities. Migrants  businesses  are  a  priority  in  ten  countries.  Some  programmes  combine components and target rural women entrepreneurs for example.  92. Policies  targeting  SMEs  located  in  remote  areas  are  generally  a  component  of regional  development  programmes  aiming  at  supporting  the  development  of  regions lagging behind and ensuring fair access across the country. In that regard there seems to be a contrast between the high number of countries which design policies aiming at improving  the  access  to  finance  of  SMEs  located  in  remote  areas  and  the  low number  of  countries  collecting  data  disaggregated  on  SMEs  which  do  not  have access  to  mainstream  financial  services  and  products  by  location  (26  vs  seven  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  cf supra).  There  appears  to  be  scope  to  further  build  the  evidence  base  as  regards  SME access to finance across territories. 93. A  number  of  countries  also  mention  programmes  targeting  the  unemployed graduates  or  veterans.  On  the  former  entrepreneurship  is  viewed  by  numerous     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 25  governments as one way of helping some categories of the unemployed population get a job in particular youth or people who are in longterm unemployment. 94. Common policies to improve the access to finance of these subsegments include access  to  a  guarantee  subsidies  and  various  exemptions  (tax  exemptions  simplified licensing  etc.).  These  programmes  are  sometimes  complemented  by  demandside measures  like  the  provision  of  advisory  or  consultancy  services  trainings  or  access  to networks. 95.  Most  governments  provide  public  support  to  microfinance  institutions (MFIs) (25 out of 38). In some countries support is provided at the local level. Policies to  support  MFIs  include  the  provision  of  funding  to  be  channelled  to  priority  segments (either  directly  through  a  public  financial  institution  or  indirectly  through  partner financial  institutions)  access  to  guarantees  subsidies  or  loss  cover  sometimes complemented  by  technical  assistance.  Such  support  is  generally  accompanied  by  an encouragement to serve financially excluded SMEs (in 20 out of 25 countries). MFIs do not appear to be a significant channel to serve informal SMEs in surveyed countries.  96.  More assessment of the effectiveness of measures to enhance access to finance through  MFIs  appears  to  be  warranted.  While  13  countries  declare  that  the  measures undertaken  have  proven  effective  the  metrics  used  to  measure  this  effectiveness (increase in lending or number of loans extended by MFIs amount disbursed decrease in the  interest  rate  charged  or  higher  survival  rate  of  funded  microbusinesses)  could  be improved. Four countries replied that the effectiveness of measures was unknown since no evaluation had been conducted while one replied that it was too early to assess the impact of the measures undertaken.  97. Only  one  country  has  observed  that  access  to  microfinance  loans  increases chances of formalisation of SMEs while eight replied that it was not the case and four that this was unknown since no evaluation had been conducted. 98. A  large  majority  of  countries  have  taken  steps  to  support  the  development  of Fintech solutions as a way of increasing SME access to finance (27 out of 38). In most of these countries (19 out of 27) related measures consisted of or included the creation of an  enabling  legal  and  regulatory  framework.  Some  countries  have  also  created \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdesks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cportals\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or similar platforms to favour a continuous dialogue between Fintech companies  or  entrepreneurs  willing  to  create  a  Fintech  company  and  supervisors.  The provision of awareness and training workshops or online courses on crowdfunding is also  mentioned.  One  country  has  supported the creation  of  an association  of Fintech companies.  Overall  Fintech  appears  to  be  viewed  as  an  opportunity  by  policy makers  and  supervisors who  aim  to  accompany  the  development of  Fintech  solutions while  mitigating  related  risks  (as  regards  investor  protection  and  data  privacy  in particular). Innovative approaches 99. As  regards  policies  targeting  specific  segments  (young  entrepreneurs  women entrepreneurs  senior  entrepreneurs  entrepreneurs  with  disabilities  migrants  businesses and  SMEs  located  in  remote  areas)  a  few  countries  have  gone  beyond  the  common policies  mentioned  supra  (guarantee  subsidy  etc.)  to  offer  programmes  specifically designed  for  the  targeted  segment.  Based  on  a  thorough  assessment  to  identify  the specific challenges the segment faces a multidimensional programme involving various stakeholders  is  structured  so  as  to  address  these  specific  challenges.  These  tailored     \\x0cprogrammes  appear  particularly  effective  in  helping  targeted  segments  overcome  the challenges  they  face  to  access  suitable  forms  of  finance.  Likewise  in  designing  and implementing  programmes  targeting  women  entrepreneurs  one  country  has  opted  for partnerships  with  national  women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  organisations  as  well  as  with  the  International Labour  Organisation  (ILO)  so  as  to  both  build  on  the  knowledge  of  these organisations on the women entrepreneurs segment and leverage their networks to optimise the outreach of the programmes. 100.  Among  measures  to  support  MFIs  one  country  has  opted  for  the  provision  of credit  reports  by  the  credit  bureau  at  a  lower  price  in  order  to  help  them  in  their credit  scoring.  To  benefit  from  this  option  MFIs  must  commit  to  report  data  on  their customers to the credit bureau so as to increase its comprehensiveness and usefulness to all users.  101.  One  country  has  conducted  an  econometric  evaluation  using  propensity matching to assess government support to MFIs which showed that the programme had reached the target group and succeeded in helping them catch up. 102. In  a  few  countries  support  for  the  development  of  Fintech  solutions  to  increase SME  access  to  finance  through  the  creation  of  an  enabling  legal  and  regulatory framework  took  innovative  forms.  A  few  jurisdictions  have  resorted  to  regulatory sandboxes  which  operate  under  different  conditions  depending  on  the  country.  In  one country  for  instance  the  supervisor  introduced  industry  wide  licensing  exemptions  to allow  eligible  Fintech  businesses  to  test  certain  specified  services  for  up  to  12  months without a financial services or credit license. Regulatory sandboxes appear to have been quite effective in favouring a variety of initiatives in the field of Fintech. One country has partnered with the private sector to develop an early payment and supply chain finance solution to strengthen SME access to liquidity.   Selected  effective  approaches  to  promote  financial  inclusion  for  SMEs  and  ease access  to  formal  financial  services  including  for  informal  firms  based  on  survey results \\xef\\x82\\xb7 Including  relevant  breakdowns  (by  gender  by  location  etc.) in the  collection  of data  on  SMEs  which  do  not  have  access  to  mainstream  financial  services  and products so as to design evidencebased policies targeting priority segments. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Developing  specific  programmes  for  priority  segments  based  on  a  thorough assessment of the specific challenges and obstacles they face.  26 \\xe2\\x94\\x82        \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 27  Principle 5  Design regulation that supports a range of financing instruments for SMEs while ensuring financial stability and investor protection Policy  makers  and  regulatory  authorities  should  ensure  that  regulation  is  designed  and implemented  that  facilitates  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  access  to  a  broad  range  of  financing  instruments  without compromising  financial  stability  and  investor  protection  and  enables  a  return  on  investment. Regulatory  certainty  is  needed  to  ensure  a  predictable  and  stable  operating  environment  for firms  and  investors.  The  combined  effects  of  different  regulations  should  also  be  considered. Regulations should be proportionate to the risks of different financing instruments. Efforts should be  made to avoid  undue  administrative burdens  (including through  digitalisation)  cut red tape and  facilitate  bankruptcy  resolutions.  Particularly  in  the  equity  space  flexibility  provided  to SMEs should be compatible with investor protection integrity of market participants corporate governance  and  transparency.  Good  corporate  governance  in  SMEs  should  be  encouraged  to enhance  their  access  to  equity  markets.  Legal  tax  and  regulatory  frameworks  (including  tax policies which provide incentives to encourage both debt and equity financing) should contribute to foster diverse sources of finance.15 International regulatory coordination can serve to promote crossborder financing for SMEs.16 Common and other approaches 103.  A large number of surveyed countries (21) have conducted a review of the legal and  regulatory  framework  to  identify  measures  restricting  SME  access  to  mainstream financial services and products. Importantly in all these countries except one the results of this review fed into policies or resulted in amendments to the legal or regulatory framework.   104.  Such  reviews  of  the  existing  stock  are  generally  complemented  by  processes aiming  at  considering  the  potential  impact  of  relevant  upcoming  laws  and regulations  on  SME  access  to  finance  at  the  drafting  stage  before  such  laws  and regulations are adopted and implemented.  105.  Consultative mechanisms with the private sector are in place to assess regulation affecting the business environment and design regulatory reform in 19 countries. Among these  countries  there  is  an  almost  even  distribution  between  two  types  of  consultation processes.  On  the  one  hand  some  countries  conduct  consultations  only  before  issuing new regulations. This consultation generally takes the form of a public consultation. On the other hand some countries have institutionalised consultative bodies like an SME council  or  committee  including  representatives  of  the  private  sector  which  meet  on  a                                                       15 This may be of particular importance to attract private investors to early stage investments. 16 In addition international exchange of experiences on regulation for new sources of finance can be particularly beneficial.      \\x0c28 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   regular  basis  to  discuss  various  questions  related  to  SMEs17  and  are  consulted  on  draft regulations  and  regulatory  reforms.  These  consultative  bodies  tend  to  have  subcommittees  or  working  groups  specialised  on  specific  themes  which  generally  include access to finance or regulation. A few countries mention the creation of working groups before  drafting  and  issuing  regulations.  These  working  groups  can  include  members  of academia as independent parties complementing the views of interested stakeholders. 106.  Regulatory coordination seems to take place at regional level rather than at an  international  level.  For  European  Union  countries  regulatory  coordination  takes place through participation in the work of relevant European Union agencies. In addition the  Capital  Markets  Union  project  appears  as  the  main  work  stream  under  which European countries improve international regulatory coordination as a means to promote crossborder  financing.  Likewise  countries  in  Latin  America  mention  initiatives  under the Pacific Alliance. 107.  Tax  policies  are  examined  to  ensure  that  they  contribute  to  fostering  diverse sources of finance for businesses in twelve countries out of the seventeen which answered that  question.  These  assessments  are  often  based  on  expert  opinions  or  broad considerations. Nine countries have in recent years undertaken tax reforms with the explicit  aim  of  supporting  the  diversification  of  financing  instruments  for  SMEs. These tax reforms target both SMEs and investors. They generally take the form of fiscal incentives  for  certain  types  of  investments  e.g.  investments  in  venture  capital  funds investing in SMEs. 108.  Very  few  countries  have  adopted  policies  to  encourage  good  corporate governance in SMEs or taken action to raise awareness about good corporate governance principles  by  startups  and  SMEs  approaching  capital  markets.  Efforts  in  that  area  are focused  on  listed  companies  with  SMEs  being  reached  by  these  efforts  when  they  are listed.  Some  countries  mention  initiatives  intended  to  improve  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  accounting standards so as to improve their financial transparency.  Selected  effective  approaches  to  design  regulation  that  supports  a  range  of financing  instruments  for  SMEs  while  ensuring  financial  stability  and  investor protection based on survey results \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Considering  the  potential  impact  of  relevant  new  laws  and  regulations  on  SME access to finance. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Reviewing  relevant  existing  laws  and  regulation  to  assess  their  impact  on  SME access to finance. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Consulting  the  private  sector  and  all  relevant  stakeholders  when  assessing  the impact of existing or contemplated regulation on SME access to finance through a  public  consultation  an  ad  hoc  and  dedicated  working  group  or  through  the consultation  of  an  institutionalised  consultative  body  like  an  SME  council  or  an SME committee. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Examining tax policies to ensure that they contribute to fostering diverse                                                        17  Please  see  supra  regarding  the  involvement  of  relevant  stakeholders  in  the  assessment  of  the SME financing gaps.     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 29  Principle 6. Improve transparency in SME finance markets Information  asymmetries  in  finance  markets  should  be  minimised  to  increase  market transparency  encourage  greater  investor  participation  and  reduce  financing  costs  for SMEs.  Information  infrastructures  for  credit  risk  assessment  should  aim  to  support  an accurate evaluation of the risk in SME financing. To the extent possible and appropriate credit  risk  information  should  be  standardised  and  made  accessible  to  relevant  market participants  and  policy  makers  to  foster  both  debt  and  nondebt  SME  financing instruments.  Accessibility  of  this  information  at  the  international  level  should  be supported  to  foster  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  crossborder  activities  and  participation  in  global  value chains. Common and other approaches  109.  Almost  all  countries  have  a  business  registry  which  is  considered  to  be  an effective  tool  for  overcoming  information  asymmetries.  The  registry  is  generally available online. It can be held by different bodies including chambers of commerce and either at the national or at the local level (regional chambers of commerce for example). 110.  Most  countries  have  undertaken  measures  to  enhance  the  accessibility  of  the business  registry  (31  out  of  38  and  one  is  exploring  undertaking  such  measures).  The main  measure  undertaken  is  the  digitisation  of  the  registry  so  as  to  make  it  available online. In some countries this includes not only the possibility of consulting the registry but also the possibility to register a business online and sometimes in a very short time one day for example. Digitisation appears to be an effective way of improving access to the data contained in the registry. 111.  While  a  few  countries  have  made  all  information  available  for  free  the  norm seems to be that basic information (date of incorporation address etc.) is accessible for  free  while  access  to  other  information  (financial  statements  in  particular) requires the payment of a fee. A few countries have aimed at increasing accessibility by reducing the cost to consult the register. This is generally achieved by decreasing the cost of  each  consultation  but  can  also  take  the  form  of  allowing  a  number  of  free consultations.  For  example  in  one  country  consultations  cost  USD  1  while  in  another one every business is allowed 30 free consultations (which do not include the possibility to copy or save however). Overall there seems to remain  important differences in the level of fees across countries. 112.  A large number of countries (24 out of 38) have undertaken measures to increase the comprehensiveness and quality of the information provided by the business registry (and  one  country  is  exploring  doing  so).  For  instance  one  country  offers  a  free  online service to upload electronic copies of financial statements and proxy circulars. 113.  Around  a  third  of  surveyed  countries  have  a  public  credit  registry  which covers SMEs (and one country is currently establishing a public credit registry). A large     \\x0c30 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   number  of  these  registries  comply  with  the  General  Principles  for  Credit  Reporting  at least partially. Almost all contain both negative and positive information (12 out of 14 and  the  country  which  is  currently  establishing  a  public  credit  registry  will  establish  a registry  which  contains  both  positive  and  negative  information).  The  registry  contains solely  negative  information  in  one  country  only.  There  are  important  variations  in  (i) coverage  with  some  public  credit  registries  including  information  from  leasing  or factoring  companies  for  example  while  others  do  not;  (ii)  access  to  the  information which  is  restricted  to  banks  in  some  countries  but  can  include  insurance  companies  or some asset management companies in others; (iii) the duration for which data is available (which  is  generally  around  five  years);  and  (iv)  the  frequency  at  which  these  databases are updated. The public credit registry is generally held by the central bank.  114.  Commercial  credit  reporting  companies  which  cover  SMEs  are  widespread (with  28  countries  reporting  that  such  companies  are  in  place).  Public  authorities  have mainly  supported  the  development  of  private  credit  bureaus  (11  countries)  and  credit rating  agencies  (10  countries).  Aggregation  companies  and  scoring  platforms  are developing  with  the  information  collected  including  utility  bills  and  processed  to produce credit reports sold to any interested party. 115.  Only  around  half  of  the  countries  which  have  commercial  credit  reporting companies  have  put  in  place  an  oversight  of  these  companies.  The  nature  of  the oversight and the authority in charge vary across countries. The oversight can be ensured by the authority in charge of data privacy the central bank the financial supervisor or a ministry.  The  reflection  on  the  risks  which  may  go  along  with  the  benefits  such companies  can  provide  to  market  players  and  the  most  efficient  way  of  mitigating and  managing  them  is  still  ongoing  in  many  countries.  A  few  countries  have  taken steps to raise awareness of the General Principles for Credit Reporting18.  116.  When it comes to SME accounting practices among the 16 countries which have taken  steps  to  improve  accounting  practices  among  SMEs  most  did  so  through workshops  raising  awareness  or  by  providing  trainings  or  through  the  publication  of guidelines.  Only  five  countries  have  undertaken  initiatives  to  raise  awareness  on International  Financial  Reporting  Standards  (IFRS)  for  SMEs  and  the  benefits  they  can bring  in  terms  of  access  to  finance.  In  four  out  of  these  five  countries  the  measures proved effective in fostering the adoption of IFRS by SMEs (in the remaining country no evaluation  was  conducted).  A  few  countries  signalled  that  there  was  no  need  to  do  so because  national  accounting  standards  have  largely  integrated  IFRS  for  SMEs.  Some countries  also  highlight  that  there  are  no  restrictions  to  SME  access  to  finance  due  to accounting practices.  117.  One  country  is  developing  a  Business  Advisory  Hub  aimed  at  further  assisting SMEs  to  improve  their  accounting  practices  by  having  all  relevant  information  in  one place;  this  is  in  addition  to  an  important  offer  of  awareness  campaigns  training mentoring  (which  includes  a  4week  \\xe2\\x80\\x98small  business  accounting\\xe2\\x80\\x99  course  to  give participants  confidence  in  working  their  business  books  and  records  as  well  as  the knowledge to keep proper books of account and to deal with all necessary obligations). 118.  Another country has put in place annual accounting consultations which aim at explaining  to  SMEs  the  main  requirements  of  accounting  law  and  national  accounting                                                       18 Please see General Principles for Credit Reporting.     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 31  standards i.e. how to apply accounting requirements in practice in order to improve the quality  of  the financial  statements. These consultations  are  organised in  different  cities and  are  free  of  charge.  They  complete  the  possibility  for  accountants  to  get  advice  on practical accounting issues from the Authority of Audit Accounting Property Valuation and  Insolvency  Management  through  consultations  on  the  phone  by  email  or  at  the office and publicly available guidelines of national accounting standards which provide examples of practical application and detailed explanation of accounting requirements. 119.  As  regards  credit  rating  agencies  one  country  has  promoted  the  healthy development  of  the  sector  by  introducing  industry  standards  regulating  the  sector  and strengthening guidance. 120. Incentives  for  SMEs  to  have  their  accounts  audited  are  rare.  In  the  few countries which have introduced such incentives they appear to have proven effective in encouraging SMEs to have their accounts audited. Innovative approaches 121.  One  country  has  adopted  a  credit  information  policy  requiring  designated banks  to  share  information  on  their  SME  customers  with  other  lenders  through designated Credit Reference Agencies so as to increase competition by making it easier for alternative lenders to make good credit assessments on SMEs and help SMEs access finance from alternative lenders. 122.  One  country  provides  funding  to  an  organisation  of  more  than  11000  senior executive  volunteers  that provide free  advice  to  SMEs. This  comes  in  addition  to  an online  learning  centre  with  courses  available  to  anyone  with  internet  access  which includes six courses dedicated to SME finance. 123. In  order  to  encourage  SMEs  to  have  their  accounts  audited  one  country  has included  audited  accounts  among  eligibility  criteria  of  some  public  programmes supporting SME access to finance.

Enhance SME financial skills and strategic vision To  enable  SMEs  to  develop  a  longterm  strategic  approach  to  finance  and  improve  business prospects public policies should champion SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 enhanced financial literacy; their awareness and  understanding  of  the  broad  range  of  available  financial  instruments;  and  changes  in legislation  and  programmes  for  SMEs.  SME  managers  should  be  encouraged  to  devote  due attention  to  finance  issues  acquire  skills  (including  digital  skills)  for  accounting  and  financial and  risk  planning  improve  communication  with  investors  and  respond  to  disclosure requirements Efforts should also aim to improve the quality of startups\\xe2\\x80\\x99 business plans and SME investment  projects  especially  for  the  riskier  segment  of  the  market  Programmes  should  be tailored  to  the  needs  and  financial  literacy  levels  of  different  constituencies  and  target  groups including  groups  that  are  underserved  by  financial  markets  such  as  women  young entrepreneurs minorities and entrepreneurs in the informal sector and to different stages in the SME business cycle.  124.  Many  countries  address  the  needs  of  SMEs  for  improved  financial  literacy through coordinated strategies devoted to financial education or SMEs/entrepreneurship. Some other countries and economies are developing or implementing  national strategies for  financial  education19  some  of  which  have  identified  SMEs  and  entrepreneurs  as intended target audiences. In a few other countries and economies initiatives to enhance the financial skills of SMEs are part of strategies to develop entrepreneurship or to foster financial  inclusion.  Dedicated  measures  to  improve  the  financial  skills  of  SMEs  are  a common feature of such strategies.  125.  Public institutions leading these strategies typically engage with the private and notforprofit  sector  to  cooperate  and  coordinate  their  awareness  and  education activities. Commercial banks and financial industry associations are often mentioned as important stakeholders to enhance the financial skills of SME owners and managers due to  their  close  contact  with  firms  in  the  lending  process.  Other  organisations  with  direct access to businesses such as chambers of commerce and sectoral business associations are also frequently involved in the design of SME policies on financial skills and play an important role in the implementation of these strategies at the local level. 126.  Measuring  the  financial  skills  of  SME  owners  and  managers  in  order  to identify  their  strengths  and  weaknesses  is  not  an  established  practice.  Only  four countries  conducted  dedicated  financial  literacy  surveys  on  representative  samples  of                                                       19  See  the  2015  OECD/INFE  Policy  handbook  on  the  implementation  of  national  strategies  for  financial education.        \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 33  SMEs  with  a  questionnaire  specifically  developed  to  capture  the  financial  literacy  of managers/owners  of  SMEs  (as  opposed  to  most  financial  literacy  surveys  which  are targeted to households/consumers). More countries may engage in such an exercise once the OECD/INFE finalises a survey instrument to measure the financial literacy of micro and small business owners expected to be released in the course of 2018.  127.  Some  other  countries  have  made  an  attempt  to  gather  evidence  on  the  financial skills  of  SME  owners  and  managers  by  including  booster  samples  of  entrepreneurs  or SMEs in broader financial literacy samples of adults or by analysing responses separately by employment status (typically looking at those who report that they are selfemployed). One  country  collected  qualitative  information  from  representatives  of  government authorities involved in supporting the development of SMEs\' financial skills and strategic vision.  128.  When targeting SMEs national strategies for financial education tend to focus on the  foundations  of  financial  literacy  for  SME  owners  and  managers  (including  basic knowledge of financial concepts and understanding traditional financial products) while SME strategies put an accent on more applied and operational tools to improve access to SME financing such as drafting good business plans and accessing/managing credit. The most common topics included in strategies and programmes aiming at providing financial skills to the smallest players (potential entrepreneurs and/or microenterprises) include an understanding  of  basic  financial  principles  (such  as  risk  diversification  interest compounding  and  the  effect  of  inflation)  an  understanding  of  financial  products  and knowledge of how to access and manage credit.  129. In  developing  the  content  of  its  SME  financial  education  activities  one  country has created a fullyfledged core competency framework for financial training to serve as commonly agreed basis across different stakeholders. Some other governments have also identified particular topics considered of relevance for SME owners and managers albeit without  creating  a  formal  framework.  These  include  topics  such  as  corporate restructuring  with  the  aim  of  anticipating  the  start  of  restructuring  processes  and  good corporate  governance  with  the  aim  of  improving  financial  management  reporting  and facilitating assessment by potential investors. 130.  Educational  activities  to  facilitate  SME  access  to  diverse  and  alternative financing instruments  are  also  being  developed in  some countries.  These include (i) initiatives  to  raise  awareness  about  the  full  spectrum  of  available  funding  products  and services  including  crowdfunding  options  with  the  aim  to  broaden  the  base  of  SME financing;  (ii)  guidelines  and  trainings  for  valuing  intangibles  and  using  exchange platforms  for  receivables  to  increase  knowledge  and  takeup  of  assetbased  financing options; and (iii) counselling and mentoring to improve investorreadiness of startups to support equity financing. 131.  Workshops trainings and printed booklets are the most frequent channels to deliver financial education to SMEs but more innovative ways such as mobile phone applications  online  videos  and  elearning  platforms  are  also  used  in  a  smaller number of countries.  132.  The choice of the preferred delivery method depends on the groups targeted by  the  specific  financial  education  initiatives.  While  online  resources  fairs  and roadshows are used in some countries as appropriate to reach a wide audience dedicated workshops business consulting and companyspecific assistance  are also used when the target  group  is  smaller.  A  few  countries  reported  that  participation  in  trainings  is  a     \\x0c34 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   requirement  for  accessing  grants  or  other  sources  of  funding  provided  under SME/entrepreneurship  strategies.  In  a  few  countries  state  development  banks supporting  SMEs  offer  them  advisory  and  counselling  services  on  various  issues including financial management.   133.  The  extent  to  which  financial  education  is  provided  to  SMEs  for  free  or through paidfor channels varies greatly. In several countries most basic services and information  are  free  but  some  more  tailored  services  are  feebased.  Notforprofits  are less  likely  to  charge  for  their  services  than  the  business  sector  which  most  frequently provides paidfor training and mentoring.  134.  A  less  widespread  but  interesting  practice  is  the  delivery  of  free  guidance  and mentoring  including  on  financial  issues  from  established  entrepreneurs  to  less experienced ones.  135.  One  country  reported  holding  semiformal  "town  hall"  meetings  conducted  in SME clusters with the participation of local entrepreneurs and representatives of financial institutions. The main goal of such meetings is to foster financial literacy and awareness among unbanked entrepreneurs to support their formal financial inclusion.  136.  The SME sector as a whole is generally considered as the beneficiary of financial education  initiatives  included  in  national  SME  strategies  or  in  national  strategies  for financial  education.  However  in  some  countries  notforprofits  and  less  frequently governments  are  devising  special  programmes  tailored  to  subgroups  of  companies  and entrepreneurs  such  as  young  women  or  indigenous  and  immigrant  entrepreneurs  and companies  in  the  startup  phase.  Targeted  approaches  include  the  development  of customised  training  material  and  in  some  cases  of  dedicated  approaches  (such  as  the involvement of female mentors in programmes dedicated to women). 137.  One country highlighted a programme to enhance SME financial skills in which each training programme is tailored to the needs and knowledge level of the SME owners and  managers  involved  based  on  a  diagnosis  that  is  made  at  the  beginning  of  the programme. 138. In  some  cases  different  initiatives  covering  specific  content  areas  of  financial education  are  made  available  to  different  groups  of  entrepreneurs  based  on  their experience and company size.  139.  Rigorous evidence on the effectiveness of financial education programmes for SMEs  remains  limited.  Some  governments  and  notforprofit  organisations  have evaluated the effectiveness of financial education initiatives for SMEs showing examples of  positive  impact  of  financial  education  interventions  on  indicators  of  business performance such as new venture survival access to credit sales and profits. And some countries  have  undertaken  basic  studies  to  better  understand  the  process  reach  and participant  satisfaction  of  programmes  to  enhance  SME  financial  skills.  However rigorous  impact  evaluations  are  still  far  from  common  and  empirical  evidence  on  the effectiveness of financial education and business training programmes therefore remains limited.         \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 35  Selected effective approaches to enhance SME financial skills and strategic vision based on survey results \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Engaging  with  the  private  and  notforprofit  sector  to  cooperate  and  coordinate awareness and educational activities. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Developing  educational  activities  facilitating  SME  access  to  diverse  and alternative financing instruments.  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Providing  guidance  and  mentoring  on  financial issues  from  established entrepreneurs to less experienced ones. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Tailoring each training programme to the needs and knowledge level of the SME owners and managers involved based on a diagnosis made at the beginning of the programme.     \\x0c36 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   Principle 8. Adopt principles of risk sharing for publicly supported SME finance instruments Public programmes for SME finance should help catalyse and leverage the provision of private  resources  especially  in  risk  capital  markets.  Under  certain  conditions  public schemes  can  be  effective  in  kickstarting  the  offer  of  financing  tools  for  SMEs. Nevertheless leveraging private resources and competencies may be essential to enhance the  resilience  of  SME  financing  in  the  face  of  rapid  economic  and  regulatory  change. Policies should aim at encouraging the participation of private investors and developing appropriate risksharing and mitigating mechanisms with private partners which ensure proper functioning of public measures including the allocation of government resources to their most efficient use. Policies should also be designed to avoid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoral hazard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d i.e. excessive  risktaking  against  the  public  interest  and  potential  crowdingout  effects. Multilateral development banks (MDBs) national development banks (NDBs) and other public funds should be encouraged to promote SME financing directly and indirectly. Common and other approaches 140.  Almost all countries have a public financial institution in operation which is considered  an  effective  mechanism  to  contribute  to  national  objectives  regarding  SME access to finance (32 out of 38).   141.  Twothirds  contribute  to  broadening  the  range  of  financing  instruments available  to  SMEs.  The  nonbank  instruments  supported  either  directly  or  indirectly mentioned  by  participating  countries  are  venture  capital  (11  countries)  equity  (10 countries) angel funding (five countries) and seed financing (three countries).  142.  The subsegments most targeted by the public financial institutions are startups (16 countries) women entrepreneurs (11 countries) and SMEs located in remote areas  (11  countries).  Other  subsegments  mentioned  include  growthoriented  SMEs (nine  countries)  innovative  SMEs  (seven  countries)  SMEs  expanding  internationally (seven countries) hightech startups (six countries) young entrepreneurs (six countries) migrants  businesses  (three  countries)  SMEs  operating  in  the  agricultural  sector  (two countries) and SMEs operating in the green sector (one country). 143.  Practically  all  public  financial  institutions  operate  alongside  or  through privatesector players (29 out of 32). As regards the type of partner the public financial institution  works  with  26  countries  mention  banks  13  mention  funds  and  10  mention nonbank  financial  institutions  (NBFIs).  Therefore  banks  largely  remain  the  most important  partner  of  public  authorities  in  their  policies  to  increase  SME  access  to finance with other financial institutions playing a role which is still (far) less prominent. That may somewhat constrain public financial institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 capacity to contribute to broadening the range of financial instruments SMEs have access to.     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 37  144.  Guarantees to financing operations undertaken by SMEs with privatesector financial institutions are the most widespread type of collaboration between privatesector  financial  institutions  and  public  financial  institutions  (the  public  financial institution  provides  guarantees  in  twentysix  countries).  Coinvestment  is  mentioned  by slightly more than a third of countries which have a public financial institution and a few countries  offer  risksharing  instruments  other  than  guarantees  (generally  firstloss  risk cover up to a ceiling). 145.  Direct  or  indirect  support  to  increased  access  to  finance  is  accompanied  by technical  assistance  in  a  bit  more  than  half  of  the  countries  which  have  a  public financial  institution  contributing  to  increasing  SME  access  to  finance.  Technical assistance  is  provided  mainly  in  the  fields  of  business  management  and  development (nine  countries)  and  accounting  and  finance  (eight  countries).  Other  areas  mentioned include  sales  and  marketing  (four  countries)  international  expansion  (two  countries) corporate  governance  (two  countries)  IT  (two  countries)  and  HR  (two  countries). Therefore in some countries public support to SME access to finance appears to be focused on the supply side and  less so on the demand side  by providing SMEs with the knowledge and skills needed to apply for the most suitable financing instrument in a successful and sustainable manner. 146. Importantly  there  appears  to  be  scope  to  strengthen  the  evaluation  of  the contribution of the public financial institution to national objectives regarding SME access to finance. Fourteen out of 32 countries indicate that an evaluation was conducted. One  country  declares  that  an  evaluation  was  conducted  but  not  recently.  And  another country  declares  that  an  evaluation  is  currently  being  undertaken.  Among  these  14 countries a number of countries appear to rely on measures of effectiveness which may benefit from being further developed (disbursements increase in overall SME lending or number of loans for instance). Innovative approaches 147.  As regards evaluation in one country the activities of the public investment fund are  evaluated  every  three  years  with  the  latest  evaluation  conducted  by  a  consulting company  and  the  fund  has  engaged  in  collaboration  with  consultants  and  a  business school with the aim of mapping the effects of its activities. The entire evaluation is made available online.  Selected  effective  approaches  to  adopt  principles  of  risk  sharing  for  publicly supported SME finance instruments based on survey results \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Accompanying the direct or indirect provision of funding by the public financial institution  with  measures  addressing  demandside  challenges  and  obstacles  for example  by  providing  SMEs  with  the  knowledge  and  skills  needed  to  apply  for the most suitable financing instrument in a successful and sustainable manner.  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Conducting  regular  evaluations  of  the  contribution  of  PFI  programmes  to improving and diversifying SME access to finance. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Publishing evaluations of the activity of the public financial institution online for instance.      \\x0c38 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   Principle 9. Encourage timely payments in commercial transactions and public procurement Timely  payments  in  Business  to  Business  (B2B)  and  Government  to  Business  (G2B) transactions could  be  encouraged  to  enhance the  cash  flow  of  small business suppliers. Policy  makers  and  regulators  should  ensure  that  SMEs  which  are  particularly vulnerable to late payments or nonpayment are offered clear and appropriate payment terms. Norms could be designed implemented and enforced to discourage late payments in commercial transactions including for crossborder trade. Common and other approaches 148.  The majority of governments do not restrict the contractual freedom to pay invoices.  Only  around  a  third  of  surveyed  countries  took  action  in  that  direction  to address  payment  delays.  More  (15)  have  put  in  place  measures  to  ensure  automatic entitlement  to  compensation  for  late  payments.  This  compensation  can  consist  of  a penalty  the  payment  of  interest  or  both.  A  number  of  EU  countries  mention  that  they took related measures when transposing the Late Payment Directive 2011/7/EU. 149. In one country although no action was taken to restrict the contractual freedom to pay  invoices  the  public  authorities  encourage  businesses  to  sign  up  to  the  national supplier  code  developed  by  the  industry  which  commits  signatories  to  paying  small businesses  within  thirty  days.  Similarly  another  country  which  has  taken  action  to restrict the contractual freedom to pay invoices has also introduced a Prompt Payments Code whereby signatories commit to pay suppliers on time provide clarity in their terms and encourage good practice. A third country which has also taken action to restrict the contractual  freedom  to  pay  invoices  has  accompanied  such  action  with  two  voluntary initiatives  to  support  prompt  payments  a  15day  prompt  payment  agreement  for public sector bodies only and a voluntary prompt payment code of conduct. To date the country counts 138 public sector and 73 private sector signatories to the code. It also launched a public campaign to advertise the code and encourage sign up while officials attend and manage various late payment information events every year.    150.  Fifteen countries have put in place mechanisms enabling SMEs to challenge unfair contractual terms and practices. Only one of them has conducted a study on the use  of  such  mechanisms  by  SMEs  and  specifies  that  a  survey  is  conducted  every  year. Other countries do not assess the effectiveness of these measures. 151.  Governments appear to focus their effort on payments by public bodies with 21  countries  which  have  implemented  measures  to  ensure  automatic  entitlement  to compensation  for  late  payments  by  a  public  body.  Eight  specify  that  late  payment  by  a public body results in a right for SMEs to claim interest (upon meeting certain conditions in  one  country)  and  two  that  SMEs  are  entitled  to  the  payment  of  both  a  penalty  and interest.      \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 39  152.  While  25  out  of  38  countries  did  not  provide  an  answer  to  that  question  five countries  report  that  measures  to  ensure  automatic  entitlement  to  compensation  for  late payments by a public body or mechanisms enabling SMEs to report late payments by a public  body  resulted  in  an  improvement  in  the  delays  under  which  public  bodies  settle their  bills  and  can  provide  supportive  evidence  (three  other  countries  report  an improvement  but  without  supportive  evidence  and  five  countries  declare  that  no improvement was observed yet). Among these five countries one country reports that the average payment time of public orders has decreased from 45.1 days in 2011 to 24.5 in 2016. Another one reports that the average payment delay decreased by more than 48% in 2016 compared to the previous year. Innovative approaches  153.  One country has established an Observatory of payment delays which gathers a number of Directorates from Ministries and representatives from the Statistics Office and examines the conditions of payments between enterprises every year based on data on companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99  balance  sheets  provided  by  the  central  bank.  This  Observatory  has  proven quite effective in contributing to the reduction of payment delays.  154.  Among  mechanisms  to  challenge  unfair  contractual  terms  and  practices  in  one country  the  Mediator  of  Enterprises  is  competent  on  all  questions  related  to  payment delays whether the client is public or private. The Mediator of Enterprises has proven to be an effective mechanism to support SMEs when faced with unfair contractual terms and practices and the nonrespect of payment terms is one of the main reasons for resorting to the  Mediator  with  1200  cases  in  2017.  Likewise  another  country  has  launched  a complaint handling service of its Small Business Commissioner to ensure fair payment practices  for  small  businesses.  The  Small  Business  Commissioner  advises  on  SME complaints  and  challenges  on  late  payment  and  payment  terms  including  considering complaints and providing an alternative dispute resolution service.  155.  Nine  countries  have  put  in  place  mechanisms  enabling  SMEs  to  report  late payments by a public body. Among these countries one has designed a comprehensive programme  called  Timely  Payment  which  aims  at  promoting  supplier  payment  by public  institutions  in  thirty  days  or  less.  The  programme  is  structured  around  five dimensions  (i)  timely  information  the  programme  provides  public  institutions  officials permanent information related to their institution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s payment behaviour; (ii) an application through which both suppliers and public institutions can manage their payment process;  (iii)  claim  management  a  unit  follows  up  on  payment  claims  made  by  suppliers;  (iv) training  the  programme  trains  both  suppliers  and  public  institutions  on  payment procedures  and  good  payment  practices;  (v)  strategic  alliances  the  programme  signed strategic alliances with specific actors mostly public institutions. These countries gather statistics regarding the use of such entitlement or mechanisms. 156. In one country the government surveys and reports on the payment performance of  its  agencies  with  the  Pay  On  Time  Survey  which  also  reports  on  the  amount  of penalty interest paid across reporting agencies. In another one as part of the Management Accountability  Framework  process  departments  are  required  to  provide  on  an  annual basis  for  the  latest  completed  fiscal  year  the  following  elements  the  number  of payments to suppliers made on time the total number of payments to suppliers and the percentage of payments to suppliers made on time. Going beyond one country has put in place a system which records all the information reported in electronic invoices. This system allows gathering the number of invoices issued by each supplier and their amount     \\x0cas  well  as  the  number  of  invoices  received  by  each  public  body  and  their  amount.  It reports  payment  times  and  possible  delays  and  allows  to  calculate  the  average payment  period  and  delay  for  each  public  body.  In  one  country  all  information  on payment  performance  by  public  bodies is  available  online ensuring  a  high level  of accountability  and  transparency.  Another  interesting  example  is  a  Government Payment  Service  Monitor  under  which  the  Ministry  reports  to  Parliament  on  the payment behaviour of public bodies. The monitor includes central government and local authorities and is also published online. 157.  Finally one country has put in place  project bank accounts in some sectors to ensure prompt payment by public bodies to the supply chain. A project bank account is a bank account with trust status used to make payments to suppliers working on a project whilst providing protection to beneficiaries in case of insolvency.  Selected  effective  approaches  to  encourage  timely  payments  in  commercial transactions and public procurement based on survey results \\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\xef\\x82\\xb7   Tracking  delays  in  payments  by  public  bodies  consolidating  related  data  and potentially also publishing it (online) or sharing it with the Parliament.  Putting in place mechanisms enabling SMEs to report late payments by public bodies.

Design public programmes for SME finance which ensure additionality cost effectiveness and userfriendliness The  design  of  public  programmes  to  enhance  SME  access  to  finance  should  ensure financial  and  economic  additionality  along  with  cost  effectiveness.  Policy  coherence across levels of government and between government and nongovernment bodies dealing with SME finance should be pursued based on reliable evidence. The target population eligibility  criteria  credit  risk  management  and  fees  structure  should  be  considered carefully  and  defined  clearly  when  designing  programmes  which  should  be  easy  to understand  for  SMEs.  The  administrative  burden  and  compliance  costs  of  new  and existing  policies  should  be  proportionate  to  the  service  provided  the  impact  on beneficiary  firms  and  the  broader  economy  as  well  as  to  the  nature  and  size  of  the targeted businesses. Common and other approaches 158.  Almost all countries declare ensuring financial additionality when designing and implementing public programmes for SME finance (32 out of 38) and many (25) declare that  a  framework  is  in  place  to  ensure  that  programmes  for  SME  finance  generate economic  additionality.  On  the  other  hand  there  appear  to  be  wide  differences  in  what the  concept  of  additionality  covers  across  countries  particularly  economic  additionality (while  the  definition  of  financial  additionality  seems  more  consistent  and  capturing  the need  for  public  programmes  not  to  crowd  out  the  private  sector  and  rather  address  a financing  gap).  In  addition  most  of  the  time  the  information  provided  as  regards  how additionality is assessed whether financial or economic suggests that there is scope for methodological improvements in that area. 159.  Twentyfive countries report that a framework is in place to ensure that the costs associated with the implementation of public programmes do not outweigh their benefits. On  the  other  hand  less  than  a  third  of  surveyed  countries  report  conducting  a  formal assessment. For countries which do conduct an assessment ex post assessment is the most widespread  (12  countries)  with  ex  ante  assessment  coming  next  (nine  countries)  and with few countries monitoring this along the transaction. Additionally assessments rely on  clearly  defined  and  measurable  key  performance  indicators    KPIs  in  just  two countries. 160.  Twentyeight countries have put in place coordination mechanisms to ensure the consistency  of  policies  aiming  to  enhance  SME  access  to  finance  across  levels  of government while twentyfour have put in place coordination mechanisms to ensure the consistency of policies between government and nongovernment bodies. 161.  Responses  suggest  that  governments  recognise  the  importance  of  raising  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 awareness  to  programmes  for  which  they  may  be  eligible.  Indeed  31  countries  ensure that SMEs are made aware of public SME finance programmes in a transparent and clear     \\x0c42 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   manner  through  dedicated  websites  (nine  countries)  awareness  campaigns  (three countries) or both (14 countries). 162. In  one  country  the  Business  Network  is  the  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  multichannel information  and  advisory  service  for  small  businesses  and  entrepreneurs.  It  provides information  and  advice  to  SMEs  that  are  seeking  government  programmes  services permits licenses and regulations to start manage finance and grow a business. Its main service  delivery  channels  include  a  website  of  programmes  and  services  tollfree telephone and email services as well as inperson services provided through local service centres.  Additionally  each  local  service  centre  is  mandated  to  undertake  outreach  and information  sessions  in  their  particular  geographic  region.  Through  these  initiatives centre  staff  gives  presentations  attend  conferences  and  offer  training  sessions  to  help inform local SMEs about programmes and services that are available to  them including SME financing programmes.  163.  Numerous  countries  have  also  taken  steps  to  facilitate  access  to  SME  financing programmes mainly by making relevant information available online. In some cases the application process can also be completed online. Innovative approaches 164.  Requiring some form of evidence of additionality in the form of refusals from financial  institutions  is  an  approach  that  appears  to  be  effective.  In  one  country rejection letters from two financial institutions are necessary to be eligible to a guarantee so  as  to  ensure  that  the  borrower  would  not  qualify  for  a  loan  from  a  privatesector financial  institution  on  reasonable  terms  without  a  government  guarantee.  In  another country lenders must first apply their normal lending requirement to assess a borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finance  application  and  only  applications  that  are  unsuccessful  are  then  offered  a  loan under  the  programme  against  payment  of  a  two  percent  annual  guarantee  fee  to  the government.  165.  As regards SME awareness of government programmes to support SME finance one country has put in place an  SME Online Tool thanks to which by answering eight simple  questions  a  business  owner  or  entrepreneur  can  find  out  which  support programmes are available to them.   Selected effective approaches to design public programmes for SME finance which ensure  additionality  cost  effectiveness  and  userfriendliness  based  on  survey results \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Defining  a  clear  methodology  to  assess  the  additionality  of  contemplated measures  to  increase  SME  access  to  finance  and  putting  in  place  procedures  to make sure that this assessment is done in a systematic manner. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Requiring  evidence  of  additionality  in  the  form  of  refusals  from  financial institutions for instance. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Raising  SME  awareness  of  public  programmes  for  SME  finance  for  which  they may be eligible through dedicated websites coupled with awareness campaigns in various locations and partnering with business associations or local authorities to increase outreach.     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 43  Principle 11. Monitor and evaluate public programmes to enhance SME finance Monitoring  and  evaluation  of  policies  to  ease  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  access  to  finance  should  be promoted. Ex ante and ex post evaluation should be performed regularly based on clearly defined rigorous and measurable policy objectives and impacts and in cooperation with financial  institutions  SME  representatives  and  other  stakeholders.  Evaluation  findings should feed back into the process of policy making in particular when measures fail to meet their stated objectives or are found to have undesirable impacts. Regional national and  international  policy  dialogue  and  exchange  of  experiences  on  how  to  monitor  and evaluate public programmes to enhance SME finance should be encouraged. Common and other approaches 166.  Responses suggest a significant contrast between governments\\xe2\\x80\\x99 recognition of the importance of evaluating programmes to increase SME access to finance on the one hand and  the  degree  to  which  corresponding  evaluation  methodologies  and  procedures  are  in place on the other hand.  167.  Almost all countries have a framework in place to ensure the evaluation of SME finance programmes (35 out of 38 and one is establishing it). This framework includes an ex ante evaluation in 29 countries continuous monitoring in 32 countries and an ex post evaluation in 33 countries. On the other hand these evaluations and monitoring are  not always systematic and may be conducted only on a casebycase basis. 168.  When  asked  whether  mechanisms  are  in  place  to  ensure  that  monitoring  and evaluation needs are taken into account at the design stage of the programmes while 32 countries  declare  that  such  mechanisms  are  in  place  only  22  can  provide  examples  of such  mechanisms.  Likewise  while  29  countries  report  that  evaluations  are  based  on clearly  defined  rigorous  and  measurable  policy  objectives  and  impacts  although  not always  in  a  systematic  manner  the  examples  provided  only  sometimes  meet  these criteria. In particular  objectives and impacts seem to be rarely quantified and their achievement even more rarely assessed against baselines set at the beginning of the implementation phase. 169.  One  country  conducts  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cincrementality  studies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  which  seek  to  determine  the extent to which the programme has assisted SMEs in accessing financing that they would not  otherwise  have  been  able  to  access  in  the  absence  of  the  programme  (i.e.  their additionality).  Another  country  conducted  a  study  of  both  the  guarantee  fund\'s additionality  and  its  contribution  to  the  economy  relative  to  its  cost.  Finally  one country  mentions  research  articles  which  have  looked  into  the  incremental  lending  to SMEs  which  resulted  from  the  programmes  implemented  by  the  country  to  directly support SME lending.     \\x0c44 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   170.  Most  countries  engage  a  series  of  stakeholders  in  the  evaluation  process including  beneficiaries  and  partner  financial  institutions  generally  through  surveys interviews focus groups or a combination of these which appear to be effective ways of gathering feedback and views on public programmes. One country when reviewing one of  its  guarantee  programmes  received  input  from  over  50  stakeholders  including individual businesses and business representatives representatives from the accountancy and  advisory  professions  representatives  from  banks  responsible  finance  providers assetbased  lenders  and  academics.  In  addition  as  part  of  the  review  an  independent study was conducted by a consultancy to undertake a qualitative assessment with delivery partners  and  borrowers  to  assess  the  effectiveness  of  the  scheme  and  identify  potential delivery barriers. This research involved conducting indepth interviews and focus groups with  fifteen  lenders  and  indepth  interviews  with  twentyfour  borrowers.  The  borrower interviews  were  structured  by  the  type  of  lender  from  which  they  had  accessed  their supported loan.  171.  Although they are not systematic and may benefit from relying on more rigorous methodologies  and  metrics  evaluations  are  published  in  28  countries  and  available online in 18 out of these 28 countries.  172. It is unclear whether the general public has any knowledge of the availability of evaluation reports. Very few countries communicate about their findings. The ones which do  so  generally  conduct  press  conferences.  There  are  also  a  few  examples  of  seminars during which the findings are shared and thought through by various stakeholders (public bodies  beneficiaries  financial  institutions  academics  etc.)  to  draw  the  lessons  of  the evaluations so that they feed into upcoming programmes.  173.  Accountability  seems  to  be  to  the  Parliament.  Indeed  in  numerous  countries the results of evaluations are sent to the Parliament or a specific Parliament committee or discussed in a dedicated session (with the former prevailing over dedicated sessions and discussions).  These  processes  are  sometimes  linked  to  the  budget  process  with  the provision of more funding or the continuation of funding of the programme dependent on positive evaluation results. 174.  There  appears  to  be  scope  to  strengthen the  extent  to which  the findings  of evaluations  are  taken  into  account  in  designing  new  programmes.  While  a  large majority of countries seem to view this as a logical and important step very few countries have put in place procedures and processes ensuring that this is the case. Most countries mention  only  sharing  evaluation  reports  while  this  in  itself  does  not  guarantee  that  the findings of evaluation reports are taken into account. 175. In  order  to  encourage  the  exchange  of  experiences  on  how  to  monitor  and evaluate SME finance public programmes one country holds a  periodical international evaluation conference coorganised by the Ministry of Economic Development and the Agency  for  Enterprise  Development.  In  another country  the  Agency  for  Growth  Policy Analysis  was  requested  by  the  government  to  arrange  a  series  of  seminars  for  the Government  Offices  and  various  agencies  tasked  with  implementing  growth  policy with the objective of spreading and sharing knowledge about how to monitor and evaluate growth policy programmes in general including SME finance programmes. Finally one country  has  an  evaluation  network  which  serves  as  a  forum  for  the  exchange  of experience and information among evaluators clients and users.      \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 45  Innovative approaches 176. In  one  country  the  evaluations  of  the  National  Council  of  Evaluation  of  Social Development  Policies  take  into  consideration  a  Matrix  of  Indicators  for  Results  for  the analysis of the programmes of the National Entrepreneur Fund.

G20/OECD HIGHLEVEL PRINCIPLES ON SME FINANCING PREAMBLE Small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs)20  including  microenterprises  are 1. important engines of innovation growth job creation and social cohesion in high income and  emerging  economies  as  well  as  lowincome  developing  countries  (LIDCs)21. However  SMEs  and  entrepreneurs  can  only  reach  their  full  potential  if  they  obtain  the finance necessary to start sustain and grow their business.  2. A lack of appropriate forms of finance is a longstanding hurdle for SMEs with varying severity of financing constraints across countries. In developing countries credit to  the  private  sector  as  a  share  of  GDP  is  well  below  the  average  in  highincome countries SME loans represent a smaller proportion of business credit and the lack of a welldeveloped  financial  infrastructure22  poses  challenges.  Financing  is  also  a  major constraint  in  advanced  economies  where  financing  gaps  for  SMEs  and  entrepreneurs were  exacerbated  by  the  200809  financial  and  economic  crisis.  Here  regulatory reforms23 are expected to have various impacts on the availability of credit to SMEs. 3. SMEs are typically at a disadvantage with respect to large firms when accessing finance  owing  to  opacity  undercollateralisation  high  transaction  costs  and  lack  of financial  skills.  Financing  needs  and  constraints  vary  widely  across  the  business population.  Firm  size  age  and  phase  of  development  have  an  important  bearing  on  the type  of  financing  needed  and  access  to  diverse  financing  sources.  SMEs  generally  face higher  interest  rates  tighter  borrowing  terms  and  are  more  likely  to  be  creditrationed than large firms. Capital gaps also exist for innovative and growthoriented firms as well as  for  mediumsize  enterprises  that  seek  to  invest  and  expand.  Informal  SMEs  in particular  may  be  unserved  or  underserved  by  financial  institutions.  Furthermore financial  sources  tend  to  dry  up  more  rapidly  for  small  firms  than  for  large  companies during  economic  downturns.  The  shortage  of  finance  experienced  by  SMEs  makes  the economic  and  social  impacts  of  economic  crises  more  severe  and  longlasting.  While many  SMEs  face  problems  obtaining  bank  finance24  access  to  nonbank  financing  is                                                       20  It  should  be  noted  that  SMEs  are  defined  differently  across  countries  and  regions  reflecting specificities  in  the  economic  social  and  regulatory  environment.  Also  different  definitions  are  adopted  for different policy purposes such as based on profitability for taxation purposes or on number of employees for employment legislation. 21  In  high  income  economies  SMEs  undertake  the  majority  of  private  economic  activity  accounting for more than 60% of employment and 50% of GDP. In emerging economies SMEs contribute on average to more  than  50%  of  employment  and  40%  of  GDP.  In  LIDCs  SMEs  contribute  significantly  to  broadening employment opportunities social inclusion and poverty reduction. 22  includes elements such as payment systems credit information bureaus and collateral registries. Financial infrastructure refers to the framework and institutions for financial sector transactions and 23  of the Basel framework. Such reforms may take place at the national level or the international level for example in the case 24  Banks  are  here  defined  as  licensed  financial  institutions  including  chartered  banks  and  credit unions whose primary role is to receive monetary deposits from individuals and organizations and to supply credit and other financial services to households and businesses.     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 55  often even more constrained. Most sources of finance beyond straight bank debt25 are at the  reach of  only  a  small  share  of  SMEs  especially  in  economies  where  private  capital markets are underdeveloped and SMEs lack the scale knowledge and skills to approach alternative  sources  of  finance.  While  bank  financing  will  continue  to  be  crucial  for  the SME sector across all economies there is a pressing need to develop a more diversified set  of  options  for  SME  financing  in  order  to  reduce  their  vulnerability  to  changes  in credit market conditions strengthen their capital structure seize growth opportunities and boost  longterm  investment.  This  will  also  contribute  to  the  resilience  of  the  financial sector and the real economy and to fostering new sources of growth. 4. In the context of its programme of work the OECD has produced several reports including  policy  recommendations  related  to  these  issues.  The  reports  were  discussed and  declassified  by  the  relevant  OECD  bodies  and  shared  with  the  G2026.  In  order  to provide a general framework for government action on SME finance at their meeting in April  2015  the  G20  Finance  Ministers  and  Central  Banks  Governors  asked  the  OECD together  with  other  relevant  international  organisations  to  develop  voluntary  highlevel principles  on  SME  financing27.  These  principles  provide  broad  guidelines  for  the development  of  crosscutting  policy  strategies  efforts  to  benchmark  policies  and  the assessment of current initiatives on SME financing at the local national and international levels.  The  principles  also  aim  to  encourage  dialogue  exchange  of  experiences  and coordination  including  regulatory  coordination  among  stakeholders  in  SME  finance including  policy  makers  financial institutions  and  SME management on how to enhance SME access to finance and increase their contribution to resilient  and  inclusive  growth.  Further  work  may  involve  the  identification  of  effective approaches in G20 OECD and other countries which could facilitate the implementation of the Principles28.  institutions  research 5. The  present  document  contains  the  final  version  of  the  principles  which  reflect both  this  G20  request  and  the  ongoing  work  of  the  OECD  and  other  international organisations. It benefits from contributions from the OECD Working Party on SMEs and                                                       25  Straight  bank  debt  includes  bank  loans  overdrafts  credit  lines  and  the  use  of  credit  cards.  The defining  characteristic  of  straight  debt  instruments  is  that  they  represent  an  unconditional  claim  on  the borrower  who  must  pay  a  specified  amount  of  interest  to  creditors  at  fixed  intervals  regardless  of  the financial condition of the company or the return on the investment. The interest rate may be fixed or adjusted periodically according to a reference rate. Straight debt does not include any features other than payment of interest and repayment of principal i.e. it cannot be converted into another asset and bank claims have high priority in cases of bankruptcy (\\xe2\\x80\\x98senior debt\\xe2\\x80\\x99). 26  See  New  Approaches  to  SME  and  Entrepreneurship  Financing  Broadening  the  range  of instruments  and  SME  Debt  Financing  Beyond  Bank  Lending  the  Role  of  Securitization  Bonds  and  Private Placements transmitted to G20 Finance Ministers and Central Bank Governors in February 2015;  Financing SMEs  and  Entrepreneurs  2015.

It  also  benefits  from  discussions  held  in  the  context  of  the B20 and the Business and Industry Advisory Committee to the OECD (BIAC). An earlier version  of  this  document  was  submitted  as  a  draft  progress  report  to  the  2021  August meeting of the G20 Investment and Infrastructure Working Group. It was revised in line with  comments  received  and  transmitted  to  the  45  September  meeting  of  the  G20 Finance  Ministers  and  Central  Banks  Governors  who  welcomed  the  progress  report  in their  communiqu\\xc3\\xa9.  In  addition  APEC  Finance  Ministers  welcomed  the  progress  on  the development  of  these  principles  at  their  meeting  on  11  September.  The  document  was submitted to the G20 Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI) at its meeting on 12 September. Another round of consultation including a stakeholder consultation took place during the second half of September.  6. The final draft of the Principles was submitted for agreement on 15 October 2015 to  the  OECD  Working  Party  on  SMEs  and  Entrepreneurship  the  OECD  Committee  on Financial  Markets  and the  G20/OECD  Task  Force  on  Institutional  Investors  and  Longterm  Financing  as  well  as  to  the  G20  Infrastructure  and  Investment  Working  Group (IIWG) for any final comments. Taking these comments into account the final report is now transmitted as planned to G20 Leaders. G20/OECD HIGHLEVEL PRINCIPLES ON SME FINANCING 7. These high level principles are addressed to G20 and OECD members and other interested  economies  to  support  their  efforts  to  enhance  access  to  a  diverse  range  of financing  instruments  by  SMEs  including  microenterprises  and  entrepreneurs.  The principles  are  voluntary  and  nonbinding  and  build  on  existing  international  financial principles and guidelines.  8. Crosscutting  policy  strategies  to  enhance  SME  access  to  finance  are  needed  to provide  a  coherent  framework  for  government  actions  in  this  area  within  the  broader policy  ecosystem  for  SMEs.  Such  strategies  are  instrumental  to  define  specific  policy objectives;  design  coordinate  and  implement  policy  measures;  and  to  provide  a framework for monitoring and evaluation.1  9. The principles that follow may serve the development of such strategies. They can apply to  diverse  circumstances  and  different  economic  social  and  regulatory environments.  More  detailed  policy  guidance  is  under  development  to  support governments in operationalising the highlevel principles. 1. Identify SME financing needs and gaps and improve the evidence base  10. As  a  first  step  in  developing  a  strategy  to  enhance  SME  access  to  finance governments should assess the extent to which SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financing needs are met and where gaps  exist  in  cooperation  with  relevant  stakeholders  including  central  banks  and financial  supervisory  authorities  financial  and  research institutions  and  SME representatives. This requires a strong evidence base and a better understanding of SME financing  needs  and  challenges  by  public  authorities  and  financial  suppliers.2  Efforts should be placed on improving statistical information on SME financing particularly in developing  economies  where  a  lack  of  reliable  evidence  constrains  policy  design implementation  and  assessment.  This  calls  for  cooperation  at  the  national  and     \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 57  international  levels  (including  through  an  expansion  of  the  OECD  Scoreboard  on Financing  SMEs  and  Entrepreneurs)  to  increase  transparency  regarding  definitions improve the comparability of data and indicators within and across countries3 facilitate international  benchmarking4  and  regulatory  coordination  and  shed  light  on  outstanding financing gaps and issues.  2. Strengthen SME access to traditional bank financing.  1. As a main source of external finance for most small businesses efforts to improve banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99  capacity  to  lend  to  SMEs  should  be  pursued.  Measures  may  include  credit guarantees  securitisation5  credit  insurance  and  adequate  provisioning  for  loan  losses. Risk  mitigation  measures  should  be  strengthened  making  use  of  new  technologies  and mechanisms for underwriting risk67. Effective and predictable insolvency regimes should ensure creditor rights while supporting healthy companies and offering a second chance for honest entrepreneurs. Likewise SMEs should be afforded credit on reasonable terms and  with  appropriate  consumer  protection  measures  in  place.  Policy  makers  should consider  enabling  SMEs  to  use  a  broader  set  of  assets  beyond  fixed  collateral  such  as movable  assets  to  secure  loans.  The  feasibility  of  expanding  the  use  of  intangibles  as collateral  should  be  carefully  considered  to  ease  access  to  lending  particularly  by knowledgebased companies while taking into account potential risks. The  use of credit information  should  also  be  enabled  to  improve  risk  management  for  lenders  and  access for borrowers.  3. Enable SMEs to access diverse nontraditional financing instruments and channels Recognising  the  complementary  nature  of  the  role  of  banks  and  other  financing 2. channels access to a sufficiently broad range of SME financing instruments is desirable in order to obtain the form and volume of financing best suited to SMEs specific needs and the stage of the firm lifecycle. Multiple and competing sources of finance for SMEs should be supported and efforts should be made to increase entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 awareness of the available financing options through targeted outreach initiatives. The development of alternative  financial  instruments  for  SMEs  should  also  aim  to  attract  a  wider  range  of investors including institutional investors8 and to enhance their understanding of SME markets.  Assetbased  finance9  could  be  fostered  to  enable  young  and  small  firms  to access  working  capital  on  rapid  and  flexible  terms  as  well  as  supply  chain  and  trade finance  to  support  their  integration  in  global  value  chains.  Alternative  forms  of  debt10 could  be  cultivated  to  enable  SMEs  to  invest  expand  and  restructure.  Adequate  policy attention  should  go  to  the  development  of  hybrid  tools11  and  equity  instruments12  to strengthen SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 capital structure and boost investment in innovative startups and highgrowth  SMEs13.  Special  consideration  should  be  given  to  venture  and  private  equity financing including capital for seed early and later stage investments as well as to trade finance instruments. 4. Promote financial inclusion for SMEs and ease access to formal financial services including for informal firms  3. Policy should aim to maximise the number of SMEs which have access to and use mainstream financial services and products at a reasonable cost. Financial inclusion is an important  tool  to  reduce  informality14  and  national  financial  inclusion  strategies  should include reviewing the legal and regulatory framework of the financial sector; defining a     \\x0c58 \\xe2\\x94\\x82   public  intervention  strategy  and  identifying  appropriate  delivery  instruments;  and ensuring  the  existence  of  tools  for  groups  excluded  from  the  formal  banking  sector.15 Microfinance  schemes  should  be  given  adequate  attention  particularly  in  developing countries as a means to enhance entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to small amounts of funding at an affordable cost.  5. Design regulation that supports a range of financing instruments for SMEs while ensuring financial stability and investor protection 4. Policy makers and regulatory authorities should ensure that regulation is designed and implemented that facilitates SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to a broad range of financing instruments without compromising financial stability and investor protection and enables a return on investment.  Regulatory  certainty  is  needed  to  ensure  a  predictable  and  stable  operating environment for firms and investors. The combined effects of different regulations should also be considered. Regulations should be proportionate to the risks of different financing instruments.  Efforts  should  be  made  to  avoid  undue  administrative  burdens  (including through  digitalisation)  cut  red tape and facilitate  bankruptcy  resolutions.  Particularly  in the  equity  space  flexibility  provided  to  SMEs  should  be  compatible  with  investor protection integrity of market participants corporate governance and transparency. Good corporate  governance  in  SMEs  should  be  encouraged  to  enhance  their  access  to  equity markets.  Legal  tax  and  regulatory  frameworks  (including  tax  policies  which  provide incentives  to  encourage  both  debt  and  equity  financing)  should  contribute  to  foster diverse  sources  of  finance.16  International  regulatory  coordination  can  serve  to  promote crossborder financing for SMEs.17 6. Improve transparency in SME finance markets  5. Information  asymmetries  in  finance  markets  should  be  minimised  to  increase market transparency encourage greater investor participation and reduce financing costs for SMEs. Information infrastructures for credit risk assessment18 should aim to support an  accurate  evaluation  of  the  risk  in  SME  financing.  To  the  extent  possible  and appropriate  credit  risk  information  should  be  standardised  and  made  accessible  to relevant  market  participants  and  policy  makers  to  foster  both  debt  and  nondebt  SME financing  instruments.  Accessibility  of  this  information  at  the  international  level  should be  supported  to  foster  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  crossborder  activities  and  participation  in  global  value chains.  7. Enhance SME financial skills and strategic vision  6. To  enable  SMEs  to  develop  a  longterm  strategic  approach  to  finance  and improve business prospects public policies should champion SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 enhanced financial literacy19;  their  awareness  and  understanding  of  the  broad  range  of  available  financial instruments; and changes in legislation and programmes for SMEs.2021 SME managers should be encouraged to devote due attention to finance issues acquire skills (including digital  skills)  for  accounting  and  financial  and  risk  planning  improve  communication with  investors  and  respond  to  disclosure  requirements.22  Efforts  should  also  aim  to improve the quality of startups\\xe2\\x80\\x99 business plans and SME investment projects especially for the riskier segment of the market.23 Programmes should be tailored to the needs and financial  literacy  levels  of  different  constituencies  and  target  groups  including  groups that  are  underserved  by  financial  markets  such  as  women  young  entrepreneurs minorities  and  entrepreneurs  in  the  informal  sector  and  to  different  stages  in  the  SME business cycle.      \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 59  8. Adopt principles of risk sharing for publicly supported SME finance instruments  7. Public  programmes  for  SME  finance  should  help  catalyse  and  leverage  the provision  of  private  resources  especially  in  risk  capital  markets.  Under  certain conditions24 public schemes can be effective in kickstarting the offer of financing tools for SMEs. Nevertheless leveraging private resources and competencies may be essential to enhance the resilience25 of SME financing in the face of rapid economic and regulatory change.  Policies  should  aim  at  encouraging  the  participation  of  private  investors  and developing  appropriate  risksharing  and  mitigating  mechanisms  with  private  partners which  ensure  proper  functioning  of  public  measures  including  the  allocation  of government  resources  to  their  most  efficient  use.  Policies  should  also  be  designed  to avoid \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmoral hazard\\xe2\\x80\\x9d i.e. excessive risktaking against the public interest and potential crowdingout  effects.26  Multilateral  development  banks  (MDBs)  national  development banks (NDBs) and other public funds should be encouraged to promote SME financing directly and indirectly.  9. Encourage timely payments in commercial transactions and public procurement 8. Timely  payments  in  Business  to  Business  (B2B)  and  Government  to  Business (G2B)  transactions  could  be  encouraged  to  enhance  the  cash  flow  of  small  business suppliers. Policy makers and regulators should ensure that SMEs which are particularly vulnerable to late payments or nonpayment27 are offered clear and appropriate payment terms. Norms could be designed implemented and enforced to discourage late payments in commercial transactions including for crossborder trade.28  10. Design public programmes for SME finance which ensure additionality cost effectiveness and userfriendliness   The  design  of  public  programmes  to  enhance  SME  access  to  finance  should 9. ensure  financial  and  economic  additionality29  along  with  cost  effectiveness.  Policy coherence30  across  levels  of  government  and  between  government  and  nongovernment bodies  dealing  with  SME  finance  should  be  pursued  based  on  reliable  evidence.  The target population eligibility criteria credit risk management and fees structure should be considered  carefully  and  defined  clearly  when  designing  programmes  which  should  be easy  to  understand  for  SMEs.  The  administrative  burden  and  compliance  costs  of  new and  existing  policies  should  be  proportionate  to  the  service  provided  the  impact  on beneficiary  firms  and  the  broader  economy  as  well  as  to  the  nature  and  size  of  the targeted businesses.  11. Monitor and evaluate public programmes to enhance SME finance 10.  Monitoring and evaluation of policies to ease SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to finance should be promoted. Ex ante and ex post evaluation should be performed regularly based on clearly defined rigorous and measurable policy objectives and impacts and in cooperation with financial  institutions  SME  representatives  and  other  stakeholders.  Evaluation  findings should  feed  back  into the process  of  policy  making  in  particular  when  measures  fail  to meet their stated objectives or are found to have undesirable impacts. Regional national and  international  policy  dialogue  and  exchange  of  experiences  on  how  to  monitor  and evaluate public programmes to enhance SME finance should be encouraged.     \\x0c60 \\xe2\\x94\\x82    1  Strategies may be developed at various geographical and sectoral levels.   2  Evidence on SME financing including micro data and micro analysis  is needed for informed policy discussion;  the  evaluation  of  policies;  monitoring  the  implications  of  financial  reforms  on  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  access  to finance and for a better understanding by financial suppliers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of SME financing needs. Evidence on financing needs and gaps by firm size and stage in the firm life cycle is especially important to tailor policy strategies. In this regard regular quantitative demandside surveys can represent an important source of information but their  harmonisation  at  the  national  regional  and  international  level  should  be  encouraged  to  improve  the quality of information and crosscountry comparability. 3  differences in definitions and methodology.

To gather more accurate information about businesses banks may also make use of external experts 7  costs and increasing service levels. The use of credit scoring models may also serve to facilitate bank lending to MSMEs by reducing 8  investors and their related effective approaches.

Asset  based  finance  includes  for  example  assetbased  lending  factoring  purchase  order  finance  10   institutions and peertopeer lending. Alternative forms of debt include corporate bonds private placements direct lending by nonbank 11  profit participation rights convertible bonds bonds with warrants and mezzanine finance Hybrid instruments include subordinated loans and bonds silent participations participating loans 12  instruments specialised platforms for public listing of SMEs and equitybased crowdfunding Equity  instruments  comprise  venture  capital  business  angel  investing  other  private  equity 13  instruments for investors.

In addition international exchange of experiences  on regulation for new sources of finance  can be 18  information infrastructures for credit risk assessment.  Credit  bureaus  or  registries  or  data  warehouses  with  loanlevel  granularity  may  be  part  of  the      \\x0c  \\xe2\\x94\\x82 61   19  Financial literacy is defined as a combination of awareness knowledge skill attitude and behaviour necessary  to  make  sound  financial  decisions  and  ultimately  achieve  financial  wellbeing  by  the OECD/International Network on Financial Education (INFE) and G20. 20  The  OECD/INFE  on  financial  education  for  micro  small  and  medium  enterprises  has  developed work in this area which can provide additional guidance. See also the OECD/INFE High Level Principles on National Strategies for Financial Education endorsed by G20 Leaders in 2012. 21  SME  awareness  about  alternative  lending  options  should  also be  improved  to  enable  them  to  obtain the most favourable credit terms and conditions. 22  Efforts  should  be  made  to  improve  awareness  and  understanding  by  SMEs  of  the  information required by creditors and other investors in order to consider their demand for finance.  This should include feedback  from  financial  institutions  on  how  to  improve  the  quality  of  applications  for  external  financing. Entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financial literacy and skills can be improved either through the education system as part of a more general effort to teach entrepreneurship skills or through specific programmes and advocacy including in  cooperation  with  the  private  and  notforprofit  sector.  Approaches  such  as  training  mentoring  and coaching  can  help  SMEs  understand  how  different  instruments  serve  different  financing  needs  at  specific stages  of  the  life  cycle;  the  advantages  and  risks  implied;  the  complementarities  and  possibility  to  leverage different  sources  of  finance;  and  how  to  approach  different  types  of  investors  and  meet  their  information requirements.  23  Investment  readiness  programmes  can  support  startups  and  SMEs  in  understanding  investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 specific  needs  gathering  information  and  developing  business  plans  so  as  to  address  these  needs appropriately.  Furthermore  accompanying  support to  financing  such  as  mentoring  and  coaching including by investors can improve the survival and growth of new and small firms. 24  Public policy may be essential to maintain offer of finance to SMEs under certain conditions such as economic crises or natural disasters. Due to information asymmetries public policy may also be important to  kickstart  or  boost  offer  of  financial  products  and  services  to  specific  types  of  SMEs  and  entrepreneurs which are typically underserved by financial markets including young and growthoriented enterprises. 25  Resilience is the capacity of individuals communities and systems to resist adapt and grow in the face of stress and shocks. Resilience involves being prepared for uncertainty but also developing the capacity to cope with change and emerge stronger than before. 26   Mechanisms  for  the  development  of  effective  publicprivate  partnerships  in  SME  financing  may include  coinvestment  schemes  privatepublic  equity  funds  the  delivery  of  public  support  through  private sector intermediaries and the provision of credit guarantees where risks are shared by the public and private sector. 27  to cut back investment and hiring plans. Late payments typically force SMEs to seek external finance in order to cover cash flow gap and/or 28  Possible  policy  actions  to  encourage  timely  payments  in  commercial  transactions  include  the restriction  of  the  contractual  freedom  to  pay  invoices  the  automatic  entitlement  to  compensation  for  late payments  the  possibility  for  SMEs  to  challenge  unfair  terms  and  practices  and  the  simplification  of  debt recovery procedures including for transnational transactions. 29  Financial  additionality  means  that  public  support  reaches  viable  enterprises  which  would  not otherwise  have  had  access  to  finance  or  would  have  accessed  finance  at  tighter  conditions  (e.g.  higher financing  cost  shorter  debt  maturity).  Economic  additionality  implies  that  the  intervention  produces  a  net positive impact on the economy. 30  Policy  coherence  is  defined  as  the  systematic  promotion  of  mutually  reinforcing  policy  actions across  government  departments  and  agencies  creating  synergies  towards  achieving  the  agreed  objectives. Within  national  governments  policy  coherence  issues  arise  between  different  types  of  public  policies between different levels of government and between different stakeholders.     \\x0c'
