We shall comprehensively discuss the current state of the platforms in the countryincluding the potential bene\\xef\\xac\\x81ts and challenges. Such af\\xef\\xac\\x82ictions include the hugelyconcentrated deposit market tobegin with and the discrepancies between regulators and the technological changes while the high internet and mobilephone penetration are only one of the many advantages the country are endowed with. The study aims to highlight thechallenges faced in increasing \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion before the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech platforms begin to \\xef\\xac\\x82ourish and how they differ to thecurrent condition. Novel and relevant policy recommendations are also provided in the latter parts of the discussion.JEL Classi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation G21; G28Keywords\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion \\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technology \\xe2\\x80\\x94 Indonesia \\xe2\\x80\\x94 digital divide1Institute for Economic and Social Research Faculty of Economics and Business Universitas Indonesia(cid70)Corresponding author Jl.

Efforts have been made to help more Indonesian acquire access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services. The growth hasbeen remarkable \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in fact Indonesia had the biggest accountownership increase in the region as the number increasedfrom 20 percent in 2011 to 36 percent in 2014 and 49 percent in 2017 (World Bank 2018). Even the population withthe least amount of ownership i.e. the poorest 40 percentthe rural population young adults and those outside thelabor force have been showing signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant progress in amere six years period of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial account ownership.As of 2014 around 8 percent of the population aged 15or more used debit cards for purchasing. The \\xef\\xac\\x81gure grew to11 percent in 2017 (DemirgucKunt et al. 2018). A similarstory is observed regarding the poorest 40 percent of thepopulation as the proportion of such subset making digital payments in 2014 stands at 7 percent and subsequentlygrowing to 14 percent in 2017 percent. Noticeably the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion indicators in Indonesia show considerablegrowth and penetration. However the number might not beenough as the country still trails to the developing countriesin other regions such as Brazil India and Russia.Recent dynamics have seen another major player entering the market \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technologies or \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech. Capitulating on the immense penetration of mobile and internetusage in Indonesia the platform has enabled the Indonesian customers to get easier access to lending (borrowing).Companies such as Investree Modalku and Koinworks areonly a few of the \\xef\\xac\\x82ourishing \\xef\\xac\\x81ntechbased startups in thecountry. However the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies are still only penetrating the urban and suburban population. In light of themassive and rapid changes in the originally illprepared \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion landscape such advancements may bringnot only bene\\xef\\xac\\x81ts but also the possibility of a \\xe2\\x80\\x98digital divide\\xe2\\x80\\x99in the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial market. As the banked and underbankedpopulation in the urban areas are getting better access to the\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services through such platforms the unbanked andthose living in the more rural areas are arguably stagnating.This study aims to discuss the bene\\xef\\xac\\x81ts and the potentialof such entry in the Indonesian context. We cover \\xef\\xac\\x81rst thetechnological and \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial progress of the country. Second we describe our classi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation of banking users inthis study in which we introduce our de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of \\xe2\\x80\\x98underbanked\\xe2\\x80\\x99 citizens. We then proceed to discuss the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech\\xe2\\x80\\x99sentry into the landscape. Following the section is a comparison between Indonesia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case and the other bestpracticecountries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 cases. We emphasize the distinction betweenthe Indonesian progress and the others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 through which wedeem the former to be rather \\xe2\\x80\\x98trapped\\xe2\\x80\\x99 amid the exponential progress. We conclude the paper by bringing up thedebate on whether the progress induces more inclusion orfragmentation instead.2. The Mobilecaptured SocietyFinancial technology in Indonesia along with the otherdigital economy aspects such as ecommerce and sharingeconomy platforms has also been supported by the penetration of internet and telecommunication devices. Noticeablyinternet penetration in Indonesia showed a positive trendthroughout the last decade. It started from 500000 usersin 1998 and reached 143260000 of internet users in 2017(APJII 2017) the majority of which are in the young agecategory which ranges from 1334 years old. APJII\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surveyin 2017 states that the penetration of the internet in an agecategory is quite varied. The highest amount of penetrationswas obtained by the 1318 years old group (75.5%) the second was obtained by the 1934 years old group (74.23%)the third was 35\\xe2\\x80\\x9354 years old group (44.06%) and the lastwas >54 years old group (15.72%).1\\x0cFinancial Technology in Indonesia A Fragmented Instrument for Financial Inclusion? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 2/9Figure 1. Brimming with progress \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Ownership of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institution account in IndonesiaSource World Bank (2018)Figure 2. Internet Users in Indonesia (in millions)Source APJII (2017)Despite the high penetration the number or actual internet users was much lower than the amount of internetpenetration. Based on the age category internet users whowere in 1318 years old group only accounts for 16.68%of samples 19\\xe2\\x80\\x9334 years old users account for 49.52% ofsamples 34\\xe2\\x80\\x9354 years old users account for 29.55% of samples and >54 years old users account for 4.24% of samples.Majority of internet users who get penetrated more were inpostgraduate or doctoral education and the internet userswho get penetrated less didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any educational degree.Penetration of the internet also revolving mostly on highincome society (93.10%) rather than the lowest income society (21.72%). However the composition of internet usagewas dominated by lower income society (74.62%) contrasting with the highincome society internet users (1.98%).Lastly internet penetration was higher in the urban area(72.41%) rather than the ruralurban area (49.49%) andrural area (48.25%). Most of Indonesians experienced internet penetration in 2014\\xe2\\x80\\x932016 (37.12%) or 2011\\xe2\\x80\\x932013(28.61%) and the rest was in the year before 2011.whelming online networking use and webbased businesses(ecommerce). Their social media usage is among the mostelevated of any population in the world. In 2016 the revenue of the webbased business in Indonesia added up toUSD6 billion where 78 percent of current Internet clientsmade online buys. The business is required to develop byaround 18 percent every year in the following \\xef\\xac\\x81ve yearsachieving a market volume of USD16.4 billion before the\\xef\\xac\\x81nish of 2020 (based on McKinsey projection in 2016).Besides Indonesia is a mobile\\xef\\xac\\x81rst nation; around 75percent of the online buys are made through cellphones.Statistic of internet usage in Indonesia is surpassing thedeveloped nations for example the United States wherethese media have been around longer and are \\xef\\xac\\x81rmly settled.Moreover Indonesia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Internet population is expecting tobe higher in the future because of the growing accessibilityof the portable Internet just as the expanding accessibilityof cheap telephones. Indonesia is relied upon to include50 million new Internet clients from 2015 to 2020 mightachieve a penetration rate of more than 53 percent.At any rate Indonesian internet users are very digitallysavvy. They are \\xe2\\x80\\x9dnetizens\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a requirement for a steadynetwork instant information and developing more craving for digital content.

The quantities of mobile subscribers in Indonesia achieves aroundLPEMFEB UI Working Paper 036 May 2019\\x0cFinancial Technology in Indonesia A Fragmented Instrument for Financial Inclusion? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 3/9278 million while there are 11 million \\xef\\xac\\x81xed line endorsers.Just about 85 percent of the Indonesian population possesscell phones while 43 percent carry cell phones. Mobile operators are picking up power in the Internet Service Provider(ISP) part since a large portion of the roughly 53 millionweb clients in Indonesia is using their cell phones to accessthe internet. Further \\xef\\xac\\x81xedline ISPs also aim for corporateand private clients while in the same time concentratingon upgrading their infrastructures by building \\xef\\xac\\x81beropticsystems of changing sizes and capacities in some biggesturban areas in Indonesia (ICLG 2018).Major operators for mobile subscribers in Indonesia areTelkomsel Indosat Ooredoo and XL Axiata; they dominate80 percent of the telecommunication sector. The mobilesector is expected to gain 78 percent revenue growth in2019 as all major operators race to expand 4G coverage inthe region and capitalize on the growing demand for data(DBS 2018). Since the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst half of 2017 to the third quarterof 2018 highspeed \\xef\\xac\\x81xed broadband household penetrationin Indonesia has doubled from 4 to 8 percent showingthe development by all major \\xef\\xac\\x81xed broadband players toincrease their coverage regions to pro\\xef\\xac\\x81t on the \\xe2\\x80\\x9dgrowingappetite\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for highspeed data among the expanding middleincome class in Indonesia. DBS Bank (2018) expects tosee penetration of highspeed broadband services risingto at least 20 percent over the next three years addingapproximately 9 million new households to the highspeedbroadband segment.Further the majority of total Indonesia population havealready had communication devices. This data is obtainedfrom a survey made by Asosiasi Penyelenggara Jasa Internet Indonesia (APJII) in 2017. Survey results showedthat out of 262 million people in Indonesia 50.08 percent have smartphone/tablet and 25.72 percent have computer/laptop. This means around 131209600 people ownsmartphone/tablet and 67386400 people own computer/laptopin Indonesia. To access the Internet out of 143.26 millionInternet users 44.16 percent use smartphone/tablet 4.49percent use computer/laptop 39.28 percent use both and12.07 percent use other devices. Even so these ownershipsare still concentrated in urban areas especially in Java.In urban areas 82.6 million (31.55%) people own computer/laptop and 185.9 million (70.96%) people own smartphone/tablet. These amounts are signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cantly higher if compared to ruralurban and rural areas. In ruralurban areaspeople who own computer/laptop and smartphone/table areonly 61.3 million (23.42%) and 119 million (45.42%) respectively. Meanwhile there is only a slight difference incommunicative devices ownership between ruralurban andrural areas. Result shows that around 62.3 million (23.83%)own computer/laptop and 110 million (42.06%) own smartphone/tablet in rural areas.Smartphones/tablets are the most common communication devices that people use. But in all areas (urban ruralurban and rural) number of people owning both smartphone/tablet and computer/laptop exceed 30%. Around17.19% of Internet users own more than one computer/laptopand 4.25% own more than one smartphone/tablet. Thiscould be seen as a successful penetration of telecommunication devices into Indonesia as the number of ownerships inIndonesia is high and owning more than one is perceptible.APJII (2017) found that even though the number of Internetusers has been increasing compared to the year before andthe number of telecommunication devices ownerships ishigh the Internet usage for banking purpose is only 7.39%.This amount is low if compared to the usage for chatting(89.35%) social media (87.13%) search engine (74.84%)downloading video (70.23%) uploading a \\xef\\xac\\x81le (35.99%)and email (33.58%). Meanwhile in the economic categoryInternet usage for banking transaction only accounts for17.04%. Also only 928900 out of 132.7 million (0.7%)Internet users are using their telecommunication devices foremoney purpose (APJII 2016). Nevertheless this percentage is bound to get higher as the potential growth of theInternet and telecommunication devices are substantial.2.1 The \\xe2\\x80\\x98Underbanked\\xe2\\x80\\x99Next we shall discuss the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial landscape of the country.The current \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial landscape in the country consists of the\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services concentration being heavily concentratedin multiple aspects. First in terms of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial servicesconcentration the country is still being heavily reliant on thebanking sector. It was reported that around 79 percent of thecountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services was dominated by banks whileother types of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutions remain insigni\\xef\\xac\\x81cant(World Bank 2010). Other types of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutionsremain scarce including the likes of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nance companies(5 percent) insurer (6 percent) pension funds (4 percent)securities \\xef\\xac\\x81rm (2 percent) mutual funds (2 percent) andthe more traditional/rural institutions including pawnshops(2 percent).Second regarding the distribution of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institution geographically the concentration was reported to beheavier in the Western part of Indonesia. The previouslymentioned report explained that \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutions aremore densely available in the western part of Indonesia particularly Java Sumatra and Bali (World Bank 2010). Thereport suggested that the Indonesian commercial bankingoutlet was distributed mostly in Java (52 percent) Sumatra(22 percent) Kalimantan (9 percent) Sulawesi (8 percent)Bali and Nusa Tenggara (5 percent) and Maluku as well asPapua (4 percent).Such concentrations have put citizens particularly inunderserved areas under certain dif\\xef\\xac\\x81culties to access \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services. As this study also focuses on the Smalland Medium Enterprises (SMEs) we are also interested inobserving the challenges endured by the particular subset.There have been several barriers such as SMEs face dailyrelated to the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services. First the SMEs are stillstruggling to seek \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing. Several reasonings are associated with such dif\\xef\\xac\\x81culty; the lack of collateral requirementsand the highinterest rates are a few of the main hindrancefor the SMEs in accessing the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing they need. Therehave also been problems such as the mismatch between theloans repayment schemes with the seasonal nature of certainSMEs income such as those in the yieldbased sectors i.e.the farming and the \\xef\\xac\\x81sheries (World Bank 2010).Further the preferences of the SMEs are also hampering their efforts in accessing formal \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing. Most of theSMEs especially at the smaller scales do not have of\\xef\\xac\\x81ciallegal status (World Bank 2010). Such offthebook operation made it dif\\xef\\xac\\x81cult not only for the SMEs in getting theirLPEMFEB UI Working Paper 036 May 2019\\x0cFinancial Technology in Indonesia A Fragmented Instrument for Financial Inclusion? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 4/9Figure 3. Capitulating the ripe market \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Internet and mobile penetration in IndonesiaSource World Bank (2018)loans but also for the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutions to adequatelyassess the risks related to the proposed loans. The problemis worsened by the fact that a considerable proportion ofthe SMEs is still preferably conducting their transactionsin cash despite being exposed and using banking services.Despite the barriers however it is still worth noting that theSMEs are still brimming with potential for the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial industry practitioners. As reported by the Bank Indonesia Fintech Of\\xef\\xac\\x81ce only 10 percent of all MSMEs are actively usingecommerce platforms. With the right encouragements theuntapped potential of the SMEs is only to be gained by theindustry and society.In discussing the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial landscape one of the mostprominent issues is the banking ownership by the citizens.This study classi\\xef\\xac\\x81es the banking ownerships of Indonesiancitizens into three categories. First we have banked citizens.The category refers to the people or organizations with banking account ownership and also access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial servicesi.e. credit cards loans and others. Second we have the underbanked citizens. The classi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation represents the peopleor organizations who do not have suf\\xef\\xac\\x81cient access to thepreviouslymentioned \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services but do own bankingaccounts for saving. Lastly we have the unbanked citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x93 those completely without banking accounts nor access to\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services.The de\\xef\\xac\\x81nitions above are slight modi\\xef\\xac\\x81cations from theone provided by World Bank (2010). In the report the WorldBank classi\\xef\\xac\\x81es the citizens into the banked citizens practically those with complete access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutionsand the unbanked citizens. Our study however argues thatthe Indonesian landscape requires a \\xe2\\x80\\x98middleground\\xe2\\x80\\x99 classi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation disentangling the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutions into thebanking services and other \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services i.e. lendinginsurance and others. The ones with access to the bankingservices but not the other \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services are the ones thisstudy classi\\xef\\xac\\x81es as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98underbanked\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the banked peoplein terms of saving but not the others. For the records theWorld Bank (2010) reported that 32 percent of the Indonesian population was classi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed as the unbanked.Based on World Bank Global Findex Database debitcard\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner in rural Indonesia reached the 7% of population (2011) and the debit card ownership showed theLPEMFEB UI Working Paper 036 May 2019increasing trend in the next period of survey. It reached 18%of rural population in 2014 and 28% of rural population in2017. On the other hand credit card ownership in rural Indonesia still on its lowest point in 2011 no one in rural areahas credit card. In the next period of survey credit card ownership in Indonesia is getting higher. Credit card ownershipin rural Indonesia reached 1% of population in 2014 and 3%of population in 2017. In developing countries debit andcredit card ownership in rural areas tend to be lower than thecard ownership in urban areas. Global Findex survey useddifferent approach in every countries which makes it hardto make a consistent de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of the urbanrural partitionat the global and regional dimension. Another challengeis that the estimates of account ownership for urban populations are often imprecise. Because of above conditionthere is no data available of card ownership for the urbanarea. Population in rural area needs more access to bankfacilities such as debit and credit card in order to increasethe \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion Generally urban population havecredit card ownership higher than rural population. Theyneed more \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial access other than bank for example\\xef\\xac\\x81ntech services which could be accessed more easily inurban areas due to higher internet usage.In the conventional landscape the interactions betweenthe aboveclassi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed citizens and the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services market players are presented in Table 1. The banked citizensown saving accounts in banks borrow money from thebanks own insurances from the insurance companies andmake payments through the banking services and by cash.Meanwhile the underbanked citizens living in the more urban areas own saving accounts in banks but borrows moneyfrom their local pawnshops. We assume their insuranceownership to be relatively low and still make payments predominantly by cash. The underbanked citizens living in themore rural and remote areas however may not necessarilypossess similar traits with their urban counterparts. We assume that this type of citizens owns their saving accounts inthe local cooperatives BPR (rural banks) and even rotatingsaving and credit association (ROSCA in Bahasa arisan).They borrow from the local pawnshops loan sharks andthe arisan schemes while making mostly cash payments.The unbanked may have the all the similar characteristics\\x0cFinancial Technology in Indonesia A Fragmented Instrument for Financial Inclusion? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 5/9but the saving aspect \\xe2\\x80\\x93 we assume they make their savingsnot in the formal institutions such as cooperatives or ruralbanks but rather in the informal institutions such as thearisan scheme.It is important to note that the above classi\\xef\\xac\\x81cations maynot perfectly represent the actual landscape of the country.For the scope of the discussions however we deem thegeneralizations adequate as they are to be heavily used inthe preceding sections.As of 2009 notable progress on the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xef\\xac\\x81nanciallandscape was present. The year marked the launch of emoney platforms such as Flazz Tapcash among others.The usage of such platforms helped the customers to makemore comfortable payments. Now the emoney circulationhas risen from 3 million in 2009 to a staggering 136 millioncards. While the growth has been nothing short of remarkable it has to be noted that the majority of the usage is stillin Jawa.3. Enter Financial TechnologyThe recent changes have seen the country experience a\\xef\\xac\\x82ourishing entry and growths of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technology(\\xef\\xac\\x81ntech) platforms and companies. While there has yet tobe a formal de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition for the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech itself Dor\\xef\\xac\\x82einter et al.(2017) de\\xef\\xac\\x81ne the term as the companies or representativesof companies that combine \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services with moderninnovative technologies. The \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ventures in Indonesiahas been done in numerous forms including the bankbased\\xef\\xac\\x81ntech the telcobased \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech the appsbased \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech andthe widely used \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech lending.Arner et al. (2015) found that \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech refers to the useof technology to deliver \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial solutions. Otoritas JasaKeuangan (OJK) stated that citizens need alternative funding sources which are more \\xef\\xac\\x82exible transparent and canreach a wider scope of the population than the traditional\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services provided by most banks and the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntechconcept can \\xef\\xac\\x81t the bill. The founded establishments such asAsosiasi Fintech Indonesia (AFI) in September 2015 andBank Indonesia Fintech Of\\xef\\xac\\x81ce in 2016 paved the way for awave of \\xef\\xac\\x82ourishing \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies since those are considered as a sign of support for the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies tothrive in Indonesia.The number of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech pro\\xef\\xac\\x81les in Indonesia has signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cantly increased; OJK recorded that the number of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntechoperating companies registered at OJK improved from 32in January 2018 to 106 in April 2019. Using data fromBank Indonesia in 2017 as can be seen from Figure 3 thepaymentrelated companies dominate the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech landscapewith around 42% of all \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies in Indonesia. Thenext biggest sector is the lending companies especiallypeertopeer (P2P) lending with around 33%. There areonly 14% of the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies operate in investmentand \\xef\\xac\\x81nance management \\xef\\xac\\x81eld a minority in terms of theproportion of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies in Indonesia.The differences between the development progress ofeach sector are compelling. For example in the bankingindustry the amount of saving account reached 246293377accounts in 2018 which was signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cantly bigger whencompared to the number of investors in the stock market \\xe2\\x80\\x93around 829.426 SID in 2018. Due to the high number ofFigure 4. Sectors of Fintech Platforms in IndonesiaSource Indonesia Fintech Association Data (2017)bank service users in Indonesia the banking industry mustbe able to develop their products rapidly to at least keepthe satisfaction level of the bank service users and thusretaining them as the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 customers. OJK in 2018 statedthat the banking industry has been developing its system tofasten for the ease of doing \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial transaction by utilizingdigital advancement (digital banking).The stock market on the other hand started to digitalizeits system relatively later than the banking industry. Furthermore by using digital banking services bank serviceusers can connect their digital banking accounts with manymarketplaces while securities in the stock market are not asliquid as the funds from the banking accounts when transacted to other marketplaces. Although with the apparentdiscrepancy on the number of users between banking industry and portfolio investment sector the digital systemof the stock market in Indonesia has made it easier to openan account in the stock market which should stimulate thedesire of investing in Indonesia.As a fusion of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial and technology services \\xef\\xac\\x81ntechbrings many bene\\xef\\xac\\x81ts for consumers. Financial technologyoffers more product choices in ful\\xef\\xac\\x81lling many needs a better quality of services and lower prices. Also \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialtechnology brings bene\\xef\\xac\\x81ts for the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial system suchas decentralization and diversi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation which can dampenthe effects of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial shocks the ability to be moreef\\xef\\xac\\x81cient in operating \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial service activities since it reduces time and place barriers in reaching more customersalso improvements in transparency since all \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial transactions are recorded on the internet and thus less asymmetric information and eventually support \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion.For the economy itself \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technology offers bene\\xef\\xac\\x81tssuch as supporting monetary policy transmissions increasing money velocity which indicates the incremental of thebusiness sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s productivity and eventually affects theincremental of economic growth.In 2014 the Bank of Indonesia and OJK (Otoritas JasaKeuangan) also launched two different forms of branchless banking. The \\xef\\xac\\x81rst is a bankbased and telcobased\\xef\\xac\\x81ntech referred to as the Digital Financial Services (DFS)emoney. The DFS is registered electronic money on themobile phones and web facilitated by agents as the third parLPEMFEB UI Working Paper 036 May 2019\\x0cFinancial Technology in Indonesia A Fragmented Instrument for Financial Inclusion? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 6/9TypesSavingLendingInsurancePaymentTable 1.

Meanwhile the other form launched was the branchlessbanking platform called Laku Pandai (Smart Act branchless banking service). The latter is the provision of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial product for communities yet to be covered by conventional \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services. The two complemented the\\xef\\xac\\x82ourishing \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech growth in Indonesia. As of the secondquarter of 2018 Laku Pandai agents have increased from19400 agents in the same period of 2015 into 740000agents (Nuryakin et al. 2018). Nuryakin et al. howeverreported that such growth is slowing down.The widely used \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech platform in the country is thelendingbased \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech platforms. The immense potential ofsuch platforms is shown to date a total of USD56 millionhave been invested in the country. The leading companies inthe industry are the likes of Investree Modalku Koinworksamong others. Early estimates suggest that while the numberof such companies is in the region of hundreds the numberof registered companies is only 64 in June 2018. The lenderto borrower ratio of the companies are still well below one \\xe2\\x80\\x93the estimates are at 0.07 as of September 2018. The numberscan only grow in the future as more of the untapped marketis captured.The involvement of the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies on the SMEsis also not to be understated. As a reference Investree oneof the leading \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies has had 95 percent of alltheir lending given to the MSMEs. As of July 2017 aroundIDR241 billion was lent by the company with a near zeropercent of nonperforming loan (NPL) \\xef\\xac\\x81gures. Owing tosuch pro\\xef\\xac\\x81tability several banks have entered the marketthrough certain workarounds \\xe2\\x80\\x93 some invested in the venturecapitals that in turn invested on the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies. Suchdeliverance of loans however needs to still be carefullymanaged for the platforms to grow even further in the nearfuture.The \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies are still however concentratedin the lending aspect. To date renowned schemes like peertopeer lending crowdfunding among others are focusedon the credit aspect of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services. The legal issueis one of the main drivers as the regulations have beenpushing players away from shadow banking practices \\xe2\\x80\\x93effectively hindering any chances of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech innovations onthe saving sectors despite the huge animosity by banks. It isequally important to note though that saving is an equallyimportant playground for the players (Finke and Huston2013; Gourinchas and Parker 2001).In stimulating \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technology innovation all stakeholders in Indonesia have to be cooperative with each other.Academicians and research institutions should educate people about digital economy literacy which can end up producing a talented workforce and broaden the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech community. Furthermore Bank Indonesia the government andthe authorities should provide supportive regulations to helpLPEMFEB UI Working Paper 036 May 2019\\xef\\xac\\x81ntech grow and protect consumers at the same time. Asan example Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) is responsiblefor creating a protection mechanism for \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial customers.On the other hand investors should provide capital and view\\xef\\xac\\x81ntech as a viable instrument; startups should improve theef\\xef\\xac\\x81ciency of existing \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services business models;and incubators accelerators and innovation laboratoriesshould provide tools for big business to engage and assistyoung companies.4. Trapped in the MiddleJuxtaposed with the other bestpractice countries contextsIndonesia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s progress is intriguing. Before bringing up thedebate on whether the country has been illprepared for the\\xef\\xac\\x81ntech platforms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 advancements this study looks at thecases of China and the United States for comparison. Foralmost two decades China for instance has been eagerlydeveloping their technology. One sector which has beengrowing rapidly is Financial Technology. Since 2013 allsegments of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technology such as online peertopeerlending online wealth management digital insurance andthirdparty payment have been facing a double or even triplegrowth every year. As we can see from the \\xef\\xac\\x81gure belowthe amount of loan balance for online peertopeer wasRMB31 Billion in January 2014 and increased to RMB856Billion in January 2017. The thirdparty online and mobilepayments system was growing from RMB7.3 Trillion in2013 to RMB54.5 Trillion in 2016.China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Financial Technology is now considered as oneof the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest ecosystem. It has 2252 of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialcredit platform at the end of June 2017. Several famous\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial credit platform or companies are Ant FinancialWeBank JD Finance Baidu Suning Lufax etc. By looking at the valuation the companies who have the biggestvaluation which above USD10 Billion are Ant Financialand Lufax. The second tiers which have a valuation between USD5\\xe2\\x80\\x9310 Billion are JD Finance and WeBank. Thethird tier which values USD1\\xe2\\x80\\x935 Billion is renrendai.comppdai.com quadian.com rong360.com etc.The phenomenon is supported by four key drivers ofChina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s digital transformation which are structural shortcomings in the traditional \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial system a high level ofdigital connectivity in Chinese society the high relative signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cance of ecommerce and governmental or regulatoryenvironment conducive to innovation. First the structuralshortcomings in the traditional \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial system result fromthe polarization of activity in a traditional bank. The traditional banks are stateowner companies and have a lowdevelopment in the local capital market which cause limitedfunding sources that can be given to the society. Party whohurt the most from this situation is SMEs. Thus there are\\x0cFinancial Technology in Indonesia A Fragmented Instrument for Financial Inclusion? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 7/9Figure 5. Financial Technology Ecosystem in IndonesiaSource Compiled by authorsproblems in granting credit and other problem in traditionalbanks. Second China is also having a high level of digitalconnectivity in its society. The country is already facing thematurity of its digital infrastructure and having a large number of global internet users. China has 25% of global userswhich more than the combination of US India and Japaninternet users. It also has 11 times greater in payment transaction than in the United States. Third China is the largestin the world in term of online sales. China also has sustained growth at around 25% annual rates. It represents therelative importance of ecommerce within the country. Thelast key is favorable government or regulatory environment.Digitalization and promotion of innovative technology areone of the pillars of \\xef\\xac\\x81veyear development plans by TheChinese Government. The government attempts to speed upthe modernization of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial industry and boost up theconsumption through greater \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion.How about the United States? The CAGR transactionalvalue of the US \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technology (\\xef\\xac\\x81ntech) market is8.6 percent over the 2019\\xe2\\x80\\x932024 forecast period. FinTechis transforming the US \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial sector including lendinginvesting opting for loans fund startups and even buyinginsurance. On average two or more \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech services areused by one out of three digitally active consumers. TheU.S. accounts for 57 percent of the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech market as of2018. Country consumers have identi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed the key bene\\xef\\xac\\x81tsthat \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech innovation can bring such as convenience security simplicity transparency and customization. The largeincrease in digitalonly online banks and mobile phone payments has resulted in increased \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech money transfers andpayment services being adopted. Digital payment is theleading market segment with a total transaction value ofUSD 880 billion as per 2018.banking are leveraging regulatory tailwinds and referringfor charters and licenses due to respective regulators. Regulators globally have been lowering the barriers for techstartups to enter the market as a way to break up banking monopolies and stimulate competition. The FCA wasamong the earliest to pilot limited licenses like the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cemoneylicense\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that enabled tech entrants like Revolut to launch aremittances business through initially partnering with a chartered bank that decreased the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s time to market.Revolut obtained a charter in 2018 and has been applyingthe same playbook to expand globally.Over the past several decades there have been substantial improvements in \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion in the United Statesnarrowing somewhat the gaps in inclusion that exist alongracial regional and income lines. More recently a range ofnew technologies has emerged that has the promise to offernew safer and more affordable \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services to a largerswath of the population. Whereas banks and credit unionshave historically provided three categories of services tohouseholds\\xe2\\x80\\x94saving borrowing and payment\\xe2\\x80\\x94new \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies often focus on a single service and thisdevelopment may help expand \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion.The use of checks in the country has intriguingly beenmore than modest; according to one estimate householdswith checking accounts pay an average of USD104 in totalfees per year (Stango and Zinman 2009). Another studyon WalletHub\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xef\\xac\\x81nance website estimates thatthe typical consumer would pay an average of USD151 inchecking account fees annually (Comoreanu 2015). Furthermore The St. Louis Fed reports a range of 2.5 to 3percent for government bene\\xef\\xac\\x81ts to check and 4 to 5 percentfor a payroll check while the FDIC reports a range of 1 to4 percent for both.Fintech startups which want to replace the old guard ofComparing the two cases mentioned above several keyLPEMFEB UI Working Paper 036 May 2019\\x0cFinancial Technology in Indonesia A Fragmented Instrument for Financial Inclusion? \\xe2\\x80\\x94 8/9differences in the Indonesian context are observable. Firstthe Chinese case has seen the country experiencing a massive leap of technological progress and inclusion \\xef\\xac\\x81nancially.The use (and ef\\xef\\xac\\x81ciency) of Alipay and Wechat led to hegemonies by the two rendering the conventional \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialservices more on the complementary side. The Americancase is also showing vast ventures of the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech platformswhile the traditional \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial system is well established.The Indonesian case however portrays a slightly differentlandscape. The huge reception of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech platforms in thecountry is primarily driven by the fact that conventional\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services have not been properly developed. Thismay lead to signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant problems; as we will discuss in thefollowing sections.5. Inclusion or Fragmentation?The technological advancements of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial servicesare expected initially to help the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion of thecountry. Easier usage and access are hoped to capture theuntapped potential amongst the underbanked and unbankedcitizens. However we argue that a new possible inquiry mayarise from the current advancements \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are we advancing toorapidly? While the progress is \\xef\\xac\\x82ourishing as we speak thequestion remains whether the advancements are addressingthe fundamental matters hindering the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusionin the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst place. That is whether the improvements aretackling the main problems affecting the underbanked andunbanked.Take the Laku Pandai schemes for instance. The platform was aimed to be the bankbusiness model able tocapture the underbanked and unbanked population\\xe2\\x80\\x99s untapped saving sector. However the Laku Pandai schemewas shown to be still not able to penetrate the rural community. The problem of the rural area population on theaccess to better \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services is the lack of ability ofthe rural population to provide the collateral required. LakuPandai suffers from the same problem \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the scheme is alsoyet to give the muchneeded noncollateral schemes for therural community. LPEM FEBUI (2018) also reported that70 to 90 percent of the Laku Pandai agents are existingaccount holders. Banks also have limitations in expandingtheir agents while Laku Pandai is also sometimes deemedunpro\\xef\\xac\\x81table for the banks. Thus the expected impact on\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion is still hindered.The emoney has also been mostly capturing urbanhouseholds in terms of payment services. The rural households are still yet to be using the emoney due to the lackof incentives to do so as the emoney platforms have beengathering more users by making partnerships with publicservices transports and merchants located mostly in theurban areas. The regulations have also hindered the possibleventures of telcobased payment methods to penetrate therural areas despite possessing the adequate network reach tothe rural population nor the ability of the existing playersto appoint the muchneeded individual agents in the ruralareas.In the lending sector the more recently expanding \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies are also still having limited access to ruralareas. The unbanked are still struggling to get access to thesaving services not to mention the lending services. ThoseLPEMFEB UI Working Paper 036 May 2019needing the credits such as the farmers and the \\xef\\xac\\x81shers arealso yet to be entirely addressed by the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies.There have been progressing however as new startups aretrying to help give lending access to such borrowers. Weargue that the fact that the abovementioned problems persist despite the advancements of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutionsindicates the possibility of a new \\xe2\\x80\\x98digital \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial divide\\xe2\\x80\\x99 inthe industry. The following Table 2 depicts the changes theadvancements made from the original landscape in Table 1.As observable in Table 2 above even the new advancements are still yet to completely help the rural underbankedand unbanked population. The rapid and immense marketcapitalization of the platforms however may lead to the \\xe2\\x80\\x98divide\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Those without access to the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services remainwithout access while those with the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial access furtherembrace the access. The problem would be the rapid growthof the platforms \\xe2\\x80\\x93 making the discrepancy unprecedented.Further studies are inevitably needed to observe the aboveinquiry quantitatively but this study aims to raise publicawareness of such a possibility.6. Looking AheadSeveral potential tinkering may be done in addressing theabovementioned problems. As we might notice in the abovediscussions the MSMEs and the rural areas remain untapped especially the underbanked and unbanked. To sohowever radical changes are needed. More support on theschemes addressing the yieldbased borrowers is apparent.The cooperatives and rural banks may be improved with the\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technologies while the \\xe2\\x80\\x98ruralized \\xef\\xac\\x81tness\\xe2\\x80\\x99 may beneeded to help the speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c subset of the population get themuchneeded \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services.Exploring the opportunities in telcobased services isone of the viable options. Regulatory level changes arethen needed in addressing the issue. Success stories of suchschemes could be spotted across the regions i.e. the telcobased services \\xef\\xac\\x82ourishing in India (PwC 2017). WhileLaku Pandai emoney and \\xef\\xac\\x81ntechs are still struggling topenetrate the untapped rural areas telcobased services withthe existing highlevel of infrastructure may be of help.The government must also build on the existing programs. Improvements need to be made such as better targeting better network management and even national IDintegration in the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services sector are the way to goforward. The need for improvement is timely as the possibility is only supported by technologies such as blockchain.The lending sector may bene\\xef\\xac\\x81t hugely from the national IDintegration for instance as better risk assessment may stillbe conducted despite the same limited initial informationon the potential borrowers. Better tracking of the thirdpartyfunds for instance may also be conducted by such integration among other bene\\xef\\xac\\x81ts.Finally fostering the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technology landscapeneeds to be one of the focus going forward. With the existing USD56 million investment the ecommerce sector isestimated to reach USD150 billion in 2020. Such potentialneeds to be nurtured carefully. Better reach to SMEs remainsan important issue for the government and with the rightpush the ecommerce and other technologybased \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialplatforms might hugely bene\\xef\\xac\\x81t the industries.
