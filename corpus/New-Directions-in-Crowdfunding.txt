Crowdfunding   is one of the most dynamically growing segments of fintech but at the same time  the academic world is voicing justified scepticism   in respect of the sustainability and operating background of the original model. For the time being  the position of banks is protected   by the legislative and regulatory background  but digitally advanced users are seeking out walletfriendly and convenient solutions   for the administration of their financial affairs as well. According to certain estimates  bank revenues could drop by as much as   20% by 2023 due to the rise of the fintech sector  and one third of bank employees could lose their jobs in ten years. Equitybased   crowdfunding has the potential to become an alternative to traditional corporate and projectfinancing techniques. The community  forming power of online fundraising platforms is strong  and certain campaigns may also serve market communication purposes.1    KeywordS  crowdfunding  fundraising  venture capital  financial innovation  startup financing    JeLcodeS  G19  G24  G31  G32  F36  016         for     alternative     Ttoday   crowdfunding  has  become  a  viable     fundraising   innovative   entrepreneurial ideas (schwienbacher Larralde    2010   p.  2).  innovation   enterprises’  needs   for  growth   technological  development  and   the  increasingly  democratic  capital  market   role of the masses enabled the emergence of a   new  breed  of  financing  forms   where  funders   –  supporters  or  investors  –  strive  to  gain    among other things  social benefits through the   allocation of funds via internet platforms (Kuti   ‒ Madarász  2014).    Following  a  theoretical  introduction  of   a  more  general  nature   this  study  will  pre  sent  the  investmentbased   returnsfocused   crowdfunding model. in the near future  this   modern form of investment could potentially   become  a  competitive  and  secure  alternative     Email address   akos.gabossy@outlook.com    to traditional fundraising options outside the   united states as well. The initial hypothesis of   this  paper  is  that  the  original  crowdfunding   business  model  is  in  a  state  of  transition   as   demonstrated by the recent focus on – strictly   interpreted  –  profitoriented  initiatives  that   are  also  sustainable  in  the  long  run.  Besides   helping the creator/project owner raise funds    a relevant aspect of these initiatives is to offer   services similar to those provided by banks to   investors.  The  traditional  banking  sector  has   also become aware of the gaining of ground of   the socalled fintech sector2  and technology  based – typically online – financial businesses   are optimising more and more banking pro  cesses.    domestic  literature  –  presumably  on  ac  count of the absence of successful platforms   in continental europe – has to date not ex  amined crowdfunding indepth. At the same     Public Finance Quarterly  2016/4  533     studies     time  one of the refreshing exceptions is the   2014 publication by the author duo Mónika   Kuti  and  Gábor  Madarász   who  provide  a   comprehensive  overview  of  the  basic  types   and main driving forces of the phenomenon   (Kuti  –  Madarász   2014).  The  publication   by  András  Bethlendi  and  Richárd  Végh   also   released in 2014  presents the most popular   platforms  and  also  analyses  the  regulatory   background and necessity of the sector in cer  tain key countries (Bethlendi ‒ Végh  2014).   This  paper  takes  the  theoretical  background   of  the  Kuti  –  Madarász  article  as  its  basis.   The topicality of the subject matter is well re  flected by the fact that according to the report   prepared based on data from industry players    while in 2012 crowdfunding platforms medi  ated a total of usd 2.7 billion  in 2015 this   (audited) value was in excess of usd 34 bil  lion   keeping  with  the  approximately  100%   rate  of  growth  per  year  (Massolution  LLC    2015).    ThEorETiCAl bACkGround    prEsEnTATion oF CrowdFundinG    Globalisation   along  with  the  proliferation   of  the  internet   gradually  created  a  system   of  selforganising  networks   where  work  is   performed along principles of laboursharing   and  access  to  information  represents  true   value.  After  the  military   communication   and  entertainmentrelated  application  of  the   internet   it  was  inevitable  that  the  potential   in  network  developments  will  sooner  or   later  also  impact  the  financial  and  trade   sectors.  Based  of  the  organisation  theory   approach  of  Evans  and  Wurster   meaningful   communication  can  primarily  be  realised   among  a  few  players  positioned  close  to   one  another  in  a  hierarchical  system   while   widespread information provision is primarily   realised  through  the  indirect  channels  of     the  organisational  pyramid.  Based  on  the   conclusions   a  few  new  businesses  will  pro  fit  from  networkbased  economic  models    while trust and business reputation will serve   as key values in the future (evans ‒ Wurster    1997).  The  roles  of  users   buyers  and  sellers   will become blurred and mixed up  resulting   in  a  symmetric  flow  of  information  (András   Nemeslaki   2004).  This  is  accompanied  by   an intense wave of technologyled innovation   —  a  process  that  typically  started  at  the   beginning  of  the  2000s  —  that  allowed  for   the satisfaction of latent consumer needs at a   new and higher level of quality. The concept   of  innovation  was  introduced  in  economics   in 1939 by Schumpeter  and has since formed   the  basis  of  all  new  innovation  theories   despite  the  fact  that  this  initially  referred  to   manufacturing companies. Crowdfunding is a   complex product  an innovative solution where   (with the help of technological development)   technology  and  the  market  develop  side   by  side   and  the  result  has  high  innovation   value  for  all  players  in  the  market.  internet   companies  still  in  their  early  development   phase  recognised  consumer  susceptibility   to  innovative  financial  solutions   and  paired   these  –  after  a  relatively  brief  development   period  –  with  convenient   technological   solutions  that  are  easy  to  understand  and   test  by  users   and  can  be  integrated  into   past  experiences.  The  unique  characteristic    however  of internet technologies is that they   are relatively simple to duplicate. in addition    the  profitgenerating  capacity  of  businesses   is  also  typically  evidenced  in  a  later/mature   operating phase (Chikán  2005). The market   advantage attainable by companies is limited    and no business has managed to acquire a truly   monopolistic position in the given market to   date. Market leaders  for the most part  are also   only exploiting their market communication   powers   rather  than  relying  on  individual    proprietary and secret technological solutions.    534  Public Finance Quarterly  2016/4    Nonetheless  the swiftly rising popularity of   interactive fundraising campaigns realised via   the internet cannot be disputed. Venture capi  tal and private equity funds  along with other   relevant industry players  invested more than   usd 50 billion in nearly 2 500 fintech firms   after 2010. These are companies that  thanks   to their innovative solutions  have rethought   the saving  borrowing  insurance and financial   transaction  habits  of  households  (Accenture    2016).    As a result of media interest and the pro  motion of wellknown Web 2.0 applications    smaller or larger scale fundraising campaigns   realised online are in a state of explosive ex  pansion.  At  the  same  time   grave  concerns   have  been  raised  by  a  number  of  stakehold  ers in respect of the sustainability and the op  erational  background  of  the  original  model   (Burtch  Ghose – Wattal  2013  p. 16). it was   in response to the dynamic growth of the mar  ket and to academic and practical experience   and criticisms that the Obama Administration   adopted the Jumpstart Our Business startups   Act  (JOBs  Act)  which  primarily  aims  to  set   out  the  secure  operating  background  of  the   equitybased business model.    Crowdfunding  is  a  fundraising  process    where a private individual  a project or a com  pany receives smaller amounts of funds from   a  high  number  if  interested  parties/investors   –  for  moral  reasons   for  voting  rights  or  in   exchange  for  (in)tangible  goods  –  typically   via the internet (Oxford dictionary). it is as  sumed that the term originates from the word   crowdsourcing  initially introduced during the   first Obama campaign.    The essence of this activity is that coopera  tive groups organised on the internet use the   power of the community to develop a given   project  and work together and participate in   a valuecreating process (e.g. creative design    artistic creation  charity  etc.).    in the case of crowdfunding  these are typi     studies     cally initiatives that in the past were informally   financed by friends and family members  rath  er than institutional investors (Vargas  2011    p. 2). These projects without background or   track record did not pass – on account of the   extreme underlying risk and unpredictability   –  the  business  plan  analysis  and  assessment   processes developed by venture capital firms    business  angels  and  banks.  Moreover   these   are often notforprofit and cultural initiatives   that should actually fall into the category of   patronage or donation. The success of crowd  funding sites (that have been growing increas  ingly  popular  online  since  the  beginning  of   the  2000s)  automatically  meant  that  viral    grassroots initiatives could be financially and   morally supported along the principles of “lit  tle  streams  make  great  rivers”  and  by  intro  ducing  appropriate  technological  solutions.   The uniqueness of the market is well reflected   by the fact that the roles of the buyer and the   seller are determined on the basis of perspec  tive. While the platform represents the supply   side  the project owner and the simple user/  small  investor  are  also  part  of  demand.  in   contrast with the services offered by the tradi  tional banking system  the driving forces be  hind the propagation of crowdfunding – pri  marily from a user/investor perspective – can   be  summed  up  as  follows  (drew  Hendricks    2014)     •	the  transaction  is  convenient  and  easily   accessible for players on both sides;  •	the  power  of  the  crowd  legitimises  the   idea and confirms market demand;  •	investor  risk  is  reduced   therefore   the   project owner does not start developing/  investing without funds;  •	stakeholders   instantaneous   receive   feedback  as  the  internet  allows  for  swift   communication;  •	an efficient marketing tool as promotion   based on spontaneous sharing is by far the   most efficient.    Public Finance Quarterly  2016/4  535     studies     Moreover  from a technological perspective    everything was given for developers to adapt   the  communitybased  transactions  already   tried and tested by consumers to moneyori  ented  platforms  that  are  able  to  bring  tradi  tional financial products closer to laymen and   make them easier to understand. it should be   noted  that  no  new  financing  solutions  were   created  and  there  was  no  organisational  in  novation.  These  were  only  mediating  web  sites that  for the most part  mediated exist  ing financial products through new channels   to  market  players  with  higher  risk  resilience   (and  greater  yield  expectations).  Companies   with bad credit ratings are more likely to turn   to crowdfunding solutions. Banking products   are less accessible to businesses with minimal   collateral background. Banking activity typi  cally  becomes  sluggish  in  the  time  of  finan  cial  crises.  in  such  periods   crowdfunding   becomes  a  primary  fundraising  opportunity   (daniel Blaseg – Michael Koetter  2015).    The  following  section  presents  the  four   basic crowdfunding models known today  ac  cording to their spreading over time (Mollick    2014  p. 3).    The  patronage  model  where  the  commu  nity supports various charitable initiatives and   expects no direct return is perhaps the least in  teresting form from an economic perspective.   This  in essence  is simple donation. An indi  vidual or a group in some part of the world re  quires help and the community comes to their   assistance  patronising them along humanitar  ian principles. Perhaps the most wellknown   manifestation of this model is the supporting   of  (typically)  agricultural  initiatives  that  fa  cilitate the daytoday sustenance of impover  ished people in the third world.    in the lending (peertopeer lending) model    private individuals lend money based on cer  tain  principles  to  others  for  a  specific  inter  est   who  then  repay  the  loan  according  to  a   preagreed  schedule.  Given  the  fact  that  in     these  business  transactions  collateral  is  not   adequately  elaborated   the  patronage  nature   is  frequently  apparent.  deviating  from  the   philanthropic  model   the  target  audience  of   these platforms is not the developing world    but primarily Western civilisation  where us  ers often borrow to buy a vehicle or a hobby   tool. The service is mostly considered to be a   replacement product of credit cards or smaller   personal bank loans. in contrast with conven  tional banking operation  the benefits of in  ternet lending can be summed up as follows   (Alistair Milne – Paul Parboteeah  2016)     •	the lender is able to generate higher yields   with  lower  fees  than   for  example   by   investing money in bank deposits;  •	credit  assessment  is  often  more  lenient    which means that people considered to be   insolvent from a banking perspective also   have access to funds;  •	social valuecreation is potentially realised   during transactions  while the process also   has personal elements;  •	technological  innovation  improves  the   quality  and  speed  of  administration    resulting in a more convenient service for   both the lender and the beneficiary.  The third model  rewardbased crowdfund  ing   is  the  most  prevalent  form  of  crowd  funding  today   with  truly  impressive  and   easytocommunicate  projects  having  been   implemented  as  a  result  of  these  initiatives.   in  this  approach   funders  receive  a  tangible   or  intangible  reward  for  backing  a  project.   They are often referred to as early customers   or prebuyers as they purchase the given prod  ucts before they are actually marketed (in the   prototype phase)  thereby supporting product   development and market introduction. Based   on this logic  a multitude of online develop  ments   inventions   computer  games   tech  nological   innovations  and  culturalartistic   creations  have  found  millions  of  supporters   through  the  mediation  of  the  revolutionary     536  Public Finance Quarterly  2016/4    Kickstarter website. Venture capital firms have   the most to fear from the continuing progress   of  these  platforms   but  the  market  of  low  amount  coveragebased corporate loan prod  ucts could also take a hit. Beyond the fact that   the project owner does not have to release a   business  share  to  launch  operations   another   great competitive advantage of the model in   contrast to conventional banking products is   that financing is typically realised on a confi  dential (and not coverage) basis. One of the   most important collateral instruments of such   platforms is publicity.    The efficiency of the model is well reflected   by the fact that  as research found  a success  ful fundraising campaign will very likely lead   to further investments. in the case of a usd   75 000 campaign  the probability of the tar  get  company  receiving  another  capital  injec  tion  when  it  reaches  the  marginal  efficiency   level is 40%; in other words  from that point   onwards  each  additional  dollar  attracts  new   investors at a smaller rate. in addition  a suc  cessful  campaign  can  generate  considerable   publicity and the stakeholders are very likely   to find committed employees  conclude ben  eficial business agreements and establish a sta  ble clientele (Venkat Kuppuswammy – Kathy   Roth  2016).    The  traditional  capital  investment  model   differs  from  the  aforementioned  three  ar  rangements in that it is based on strictly busi  ness foundations  the interests of investors are   properly represented and the yields expected   vary depending on the risk of the given pro  ject/undertaking.  The  founder  acquires  capi  tal   while  the  investors  receive  their  stake  as   well  as  related  voting  rights.  if  the  project   owner offers investors a certain percentage of   future revenues  we talk about a royaltybased   model. These models require a higher level of   expertise as well as appropriate statutory regu  lations.  in  the  us   only  accredited  investors   can  take  part  in  iPOs  (initial  Private  Offer     studies     ings)  as  private  individuals  (such  issues  are   riskier  but promise higher returns). it was the   loosening of this barrier  amongst other things    that the JOBs Act was meant to accomplish   in the us  which – by reducing bureaucratic   obstacles – considerably expands the fundrais  ing  opportunities  of  startup  businesses  and   also makes the route to public listing simpler.   This model could bring restructuring primar  ily on the market of larger corporate loans and   bonds; in addition  private equity investment   funds operating with considerably lower yield   expectations  –  compared  to  venture  capital   firms – will also gain new competitors.    CriTiCism oF TrAdiTionAl    modEls    Given  that  certain  crowdfunding  websites   can  look  back  on  ten  years  of  operation    considerable operationrelated experience has   been amassed in this topic. The business model   has been criticised on numerous occasions by   both  academic  and  professional  circles.  The   issue that perhaps impacts the greatest number   of  stakeholders  is  the  protection  of  funder   interests.  Very  few  industry  opinion  leaders   are truly aware that in respect of the operation   of  crowdfunding  platforms   the  funder  is   at  least  as  important  a  player  as  the  project   owner.  if  the  website  is  unable  to  guarantee   that the donor’s money will go to a safe place   or that the beneficiary can only use the funds   for  the  predefined  purpose   sustainability   is  thrown  into  doubt.  A study  published  in   2012 examined 471 Kickstarter projects that   succeeded  in  reaching  their  funding  goals.   interestingly   of  the  471  projects  381  had   clearly  identifiable  outcomes  before  the  date   selected by the researchers. Of the 381 closed   and  assessable  project  launches   there  were   14 initiatives that turned out to be frauds; in   other words  the project owner disappeared or     Public Finance Quarterly  2016/4  537     studies     failed to account for the funds raised (Mollick    2014  p. 11). Based on the report released by   Kickstarter  itself   the  number  of  registered   frauds  or  fraudulent  attempts  is  negligible    which is impressive for a semi notforprofit   initiative  although it does raise a number of   questions when compared to a bank.    On  a  related  note   less  than  one  third  of   the  projects  featured  in  the  aforementioned   study  were  completed  on  time;  in  other   words   product  manufacturing  did  not  start   by  the  undertaken  deadline.  it  is  clear  that   despite  project  owners/entrepreneurs  taking   their commitment very seriously  professional   and  organisational  problems  are  frequently   encountered  during  implementation.  Many   feel that the success of a given product launch   depends  more  on  presentational  ability  and   luck  than  actual  entrepreneurial  and  indus  tryspecific  knowhow.  Founders  do  not  go   through  the  usual  entrepreneurial   creative   and  preparatory  process;  the  funds  more  or   less  fall  into  their  lap  after  a  wellexecuted   video  presentation   but  afterwards  many  of   them fail to manage/account for the money   received. deviating from this logical analogy   is the opinion which states that the launch  ing  of  a  project  has  the  power  to  generate   demand  and as such many are systematically   using  these  sites  as  marketing  tools   as  the   first  step  of  introducing  a  new  professional   service/product to the market. in the case of   classic  equity  investments   one  of  the  most   important characteristic of the funder is that    in  addition  to  the  necessary  funds   it  also   provides social and knowledge capital to their   partner. due to the high number of investors   involved in crowdfunding  establishing an in  timate  relationship  is  practically  impossible    and this type of cooperation is decidedly im  personal.    Another  interesting  observation  is  that  in   traditional models  the minimum amount of   own funds risked by the beneficiary cannot be     regulated  and therefore  idea creators or pro  ject launchers primarily use the funds of oth  ers and risk nothing but their own time. An  other justified criticism about the operation of   traditional crowdfunding sites is that – due to   unlimited publicity – projects offering confi  dential business/technology solutions are wary   of raising funds online (Caldbeck  2013). At   the  same  time   Facebook  twitter  and  other   popular social media sites can make any given   campaign  lose  credibility  as  tabloidinfected   fundraising  might  scare  off  serious  investors   planning  for  the  longterm.  Finally   perhaps   the most severe criticism of traditional mod  els is that crowdfunding has become “trendy”   and the realisation of ideas – generated by the   truckload – is not shaped by realistic demand   and supply. The segment is showing signs of   the emergence of a dangerous financial bub  ble   allowing  people  to  invest  into  projects   without  expertise   thereby  giving  financial   support  to  others  without  merit  (dupree    2013). Moreover  those familiar with the sys  tem are able to manipulate certain campaigns   for profit  and companies with multiple suc  cessful  campaign  launches  under  their  belt   are able to accelerate processes through well  timed capital injections from their own funds    thereby  bolstering  the  viral  proliferation  of   projects  through  consciously  generated   false   popularity.    ThE EquiTybAsEd CrowdFundinG   modEl    in  response  to  the  critical  observations   detailed in the previous section – based on the   crowdfunding  report  published  annually  by   Massolution –  of the four general platforms    equitybased  crowdfunding  sites  have  the   highest  rate  of  growth.  Between  2007  and   2011   the  compound  annual  growth  rate   (CAGR)  of  campaigns  launched  was  114%     538  Public Finance Quarterly  2016/4    (Massolution  LLC.  2012   p.  17).  Once  an   appropriate  global  statutory  background  has   been  established   this  business  model  will   be  able  to  take  on  banks  as  well  as  other   institutional  investors.  The  obstacles  posed   by  physical  distances  become  practically   eliminated  and investors and project owners   can  both  think  within  global  frameworks   (Wingerden  –  Ryan   2011   p.  54).  Thanks   to  community  valuecreation   innumerable   realisations  and  concepts  were  integrated   into  the  various  projects.  Last  but  not  least    players  that  previously  did  not  have  the   opportunity can also invest in startup busi  nesses (Almerico  2013).    equitybased  crowdfunding  differs  from   the three basic models in several respects. in   most  cases   the  site  guarantees  some  sort  of   project screening or preliminary revision. This   is  followed  by  the  capital  allocation  process   based on the ‘all–or–nothing’ principle  where   the  venture  either  raises  the  target  amount   within a specific funding window or the pro  ject is not realised with the site’s involvement   and the money is returned to investors. This   is followed by the investment/implementation   period  where  in an optimal situation  owners   are provided information throughout the pro  cess   resulting  in  an  interactive  communica  tion of sorts. The process is concluded by the   operating period  where ownership is restruc  tured  the company is headed by professional   management  and profitgenerating corporate   operation is realised from a single idea (Col  lins – Pierrakis  2012). The representation of   investor interests in the above model can be re  alised in a number of ways. in an optimal case    they can influence the company’s operation at   a (virtual) general meeting and get involved in   the  operation  as  fullfledged  shareholders.  it   should be noted that one of the exceedingly   rare versions of the equitybased model is the   royaltybased  crowdfunding  model   where   investors acquire royalty interest in the intel     studies     lectual property of the company  thereby be  coming stakeholders in the given project with   a different perspective and with different in  terests (World Bank  2013  p. 20).    The 2016 study prepared by the european   union admits that the volume of crowdfund  ing is low for the time being but  at the same   time  the sector has considerable potential in   respect of growth and job creation (impacting   the sMe sector  startups and unlisted small   businesses). The analysis also touches on po  tential risks and notes that their regulation is   the responsibility of the countries concerned   (european  Commission   2016).  These  risks   may include the following     •	investors losing part or all of their capital   or  not  getting  the  returns  they  expect;   inability to exit investments in the absence   of a secondary market;  •	share dilution if the company engages in   further rounds of capital raising;  •	insufficient  information  or  inability  to   price  correctly  the  securities  invested  in    with appropriate professional control and   prescreening often missing;  •	conflict  and  misalignment  of  interests   between  entrepreneurs   platforms  and   investors;  •	insolvency  of  the  platform  operators   resulting  in  deterioration  of  quality   and   required financial guarantees are generally   missing by crowdfunding firms;  •	fraud (both for the investors and for the   project)  and  related  reputational  risk  for   platforms.  The  future  of  equitybased  models  is  ex  pected to be represented by initiatives similar   to real estate funds (Rudarakanchana  2013);   these  platforms   by  nature   can  manage  the   aforementioned risks in a more efficient man  ner.  Real  estate  investment  platforms  are   relatively  safe   easy  to  verify   their  operation   requires no special expertise  and the returns   they generate can be supported with a stable     Public Finance Quarterly  2016/4  539     studies     business plan. several platforms offer similar   services (occasionally  based on projectfinanc  ing foundations) on the internet already. The   majority of these  however  are still subject to   investment  licences  and  from  a  geographical   perspective  the projects in need of financing   are also primarily restricted to the territories   of Western countries.    it  can  also  be  projected  that  the  market   will  become  consolidated  and  –  given  the   high business potential – a wave of acquisi  tions may commence  primarily in the case of   equitybased crowdfunding sites. since capi  tal injection of some tens of thousands dol  lars  is  not  sufficient  for  a  startup  business    as another likely trend  the virtual space may   begin to see equity investments of dollar mil  lions thanks to the business sharebased mod  el. it is also indicative of a shift of sorts that   numerous  conferences  have  brought  up  the   dilemma that Kickstarter  as well as its main   competitor  indiegogo3 will both provide the   means for acquiring funds through equity in  vestment  (sawers   2014).  At  the  same  time    the  greatest  innovation  would  be  to  see  the   market  entry  of  a  platform  that  would  be   capable  of  raising  funds  worth  tens  of  mil  lions of dollars for investments by operating   as a bank and thinking as a large investor. in   this particular case  innovation would not be   a primary aspect. due to high capital needs    the  stable  liquidity  and  positive  cash  flow  generating capacity of these businesses as well   as  an  adequate  collateral  background  would   be  considered  more  important  than  the  as  pects  offered  by  traditional  crowdfunding   sites. These undertakings could become fully   fledged  financial  institutions  within  a  short   time.

FuTurE ouTlook  ExpECTEd mArkET   TrEnds    despite its brief existence  the crowdfunding   market  organised  through  the  internet  is  in   transition  already.  New  players  and  hybrid   business models have appeared and continue   to  spring  up  constantly.  The  international   publications  released  to  date  are  projecting   optimistic  outlooks.  Within  crowdfunding    profitbased  peertopeer  lending  and  equity  based platforms are expected to spread most   swiftly.  The  model  operating  on  the  basis   of  the  reward  system  has  been  criticised    justifiably  so   by  numerous  experts.  This   crowdfunding vogue is expected to depreciate   in proportion to the success of the other two   or three platforms.    for     share     From a technological perspective  the most   credible companies with the most userfriend  ly  interfaces  will  remain  standing  among   the  platforms  competing  with  one  another.   Another  important  challenge  is  to  create  an   opportunity   trading/mediating   through  the  given  platform  in  order  to  ease   the exit of investors. it is expected in the near   future that the various platforms will become   separated from one another according to the  matic systems  allowing strictly business based   enterprises  to  be  featured  on  different  lists   than those containing artistic and less profit  able projects. Owing to the digital revolution    applications  offering  financial  services  are   winning over users at an increasing rate  and   thanks to their flexible operating model  they   are more efficient in tracking market processes   than traditional banks.    The  wariness  shown  by  banks  is  also  pro  jecting  the  sector’s  success.  According  to  a   study prepared by Citigroup  banks stand to   lose  17  per  cent  of  their  revenues  by  2023    and  within  the  next  ten  years  they  will  be   forced  to  let  a  third  of  their  employees  go   on account of the expansion of fintech firms   (Citigroup  2016). The vast majority of con  ventional bank branches will be closed down   in the near future  while the customerbuyer   relationship will be typically conducted online   in  an  increasingly  impersonal  environment.   Moreover  new payment solutions will appear    the  training  routine  of  bank  employees  will   change  and the risk management techniques   of  crowdfunding  will  presumably  improve.   We can also assume that statutory regulation   will be adapted to market practice  and that   larger banking houses will acquire numerous   fintech  startups  and  various  financial  inno  vation solutions. Market trends also point to   the appearance of a website that will  in ad  dition  to  providing  crowdfunding  solutions    integrate  the  services  of  the  fintech  sector    becoming a major player of the international   banking  sector  once  the  appropriate  regula  tory background has been put in place.    hunGAriAn ExpEriEnCEs    the     spurred  by  the  phenomenon’s  international   success    first  Hungarianfocused   crowdfunding  platforms  appeared  around   2011.  Following  a  short  period  of  trial  anderror  it became clear that – as opposed   to  numerous  other  foreign  online  business   models  –  these  websites  (Creative  selector    indulj.be  kezdheted.hu  adjukossze.hu  etc.)   are either failing or stagnating. The reason is   that  in  many  respects   the  Hungarian  mar  ket  is  immature  and  too  small  to  profitably   operate such websites. experiences show that   Hungarian project owners tend to opt for the      studies     services  of  international  sites.  in  the  recent   period   many  successful  Hungarian  firms   and  private  individuals  have  raised  fairly   substantial startup capital for their respective   businesses  or   ideas.  At  the  same  time    however   as  a  successful  campaign  launch   requires  immense  effort  and  a  high  rate  of   equity  investment  from  project  owners  as   well  the number of those making the attempt   is limited (enikő Piti  2015). The situation is   not ideal on the investor side either  mainly   because the disposable income of enlightened   Hungarian  internet  users  is  a  mere  fraction   of the income of their Western counterparts.   in  addition   Hungary  is  still  lacking  an   entrepreneurialfriendly  environment   and   young people are not at all motivated to turn   their ideas into a reality. Based on an article   published in 2014 by Beáta Bakó  the reasons   for the limited popularity of crowdfunding in   Hungary can be summed up as follows (Beáta   Bakó  2014)     •	the market is too small  and the number   of project owners and investors/donors is   limited;  •	the  financial  literacy  and  education  of   Hungarians is low  there are still very few   people managing their finances online;  •	the statutory regulation of crowdfunding   and  the  fintech  sector  in  general  is  non  existent   and  the  sector  is  unregulated   from a taxation perspective as well.  The sMe  sector  is  supported  by  the  state   and the european union through numerous   instruments; consequently  smaller firms have   become  lazy   with  no  pressure  to  resort  to   alternative (crowdfundinglike  marketbased)   fundraising channels.    As a result  there is no indication as yet that   a new stable player would be able to cement   itself  in  the  Hungarian  market.  The  appear  ance  of  a  crossborder   legitimate  platform   with an international background and recog  nition seems most likely. According to András     Public Finance Quarterly  2016/4  541     studies     Bethlendi and Richárd Végh  “the success of a   portal depends on numerous factors  in order   to attract a critical mass  the portal must be  come a “brand” – a stable  neutral  independ  ent  institution  that  is  fully  compliant  with   the  criteria  of  investor  protection.  The  pres  ence of prestigious owners behind the portal   at its inception may also facilitate success. The   establishment of a secure and supporting it   background  is  of  key  importance.  And   last   but not least  crowdfunding portals must be   supported by a safe settlement system.” (An  drás Bethlendi – Richárd Végh  2014).    summAry    After the global economic crisis  the banking   sector’s  willingness  to  place  assets  dropped    and  the  fundraising  opportunities  of  smaller   companies  –  operating  without  appropriate   collateral  background  and  sufficient  own   funds  –  became  very  restricted.  At  the  same   time  with the development of the internet and   the growing prominence of fintech solutions    platforms  specialising  in  crowdfunding  have   grown increasingly popular in recent years.    Benefits for investors are numerous  risk be  comes diversified  they can gain quick access   to  innovation   the  given  idea/company  goes   through a multiplayer prescreening process   and   over  and  above   administrative  burdens   are reduced to a minimum. The project own  er  on the other hand  is able to efficiently test   the  product  and  the  market   receives  a  high   number of consumer feedback  and typically   gains access to lowcost capital without put  ting up collateral.    The  prerequisite  of  a  successful  project   launch is the use of the appropriate market  ing  tools.  Presentations  (typically  used  in   such projects) often push the given product/  idea itself into the background and – instead   of  rational  arguments   –  attempt  to  appeal     to consumer sentiments. Crowdfunding may   also serve purposes other than fundraising  in   the case of successful projects a selfgenerat  ing marketing effect is a direct consequence   of the process  which in turn could lead the   target company to further rounds of invest  ment.    The websites in question  for the most part    provide users with existing  traditional finan  cial  products  offered  by  banks  through  new   channels  and the innovation is in essence the   technological solution of how funds are man  aged   how  the  sites  communicate  with  users   and how they make their operation more ef  ficient.  sensing  the  explosive  popularity  of   fintech   banks  started  developing  their  own   systems and acquiring smaller or larger online   financial service providers and solutions.    Among crowdfunding models  the equity  based concept could prove to be most viable   in  the  long  run   and  once  appropriate  regu  lations have been established  these platforms   could potentially become true competitors of   the  traditional  banking  system.  The  unique   feature of the model is that the close link and   direct interaction between the project owner   and the funder  as well as the spirit of com  munity create a colourful product (which also   serves  marketing  purposes)  from  essentially   impersonal financial instruments.    There are still numerous uncertainty factors   in relation to the equitybased model as well.   A number of questions still remain  how can   hundreds  of  owners  be  represented  and  in  formed at the same time  who has what rights   and  as the case may be  how will market ex  its be handled. A sharetrading platform that   is organised entirely online and is capable of   documenting online managed iPOs in a flexi  ble and legally compliant fashion may  in part    offer satisfactory answers to these questions.    There are numerous reasons why the Hun  garian market is still unsuitable for the prop  agation  of  crowdfunding.  Owing  to  the  eu     542  Public Finance Quarterly  2016/4     studies     grants given to the sMe sector  project owners   have become lazy  with no pressure to resort   to alternative fundraising channels. it can be   stated in general  that adequate statutory reg  ulation  would  serve  the  development  of  the     online  market.  For  the  time  being   the  lack   of  investor  confidence  as  well  as  transparent   and prudent business operations is a common   problem  in  relation  to  crowdfunding  plat  forms.    Notes    1  The  background  to  this  study  is  the  paper  by   the  author  featured   in  the  2014  conference   publication  entitled tavaszi  szél  (spring  Wind)  as   published  by  the  Association  of  Hungarian  Phd   and  dLA  students.  The  paper  in  question  has   been considerably reworked and updated  and also   presents and analyses more recent trends.    2  the  term  fintech  originally  referred  to  the  it   in     background  administration  systems  used     traditional banking systems. today  the term refers to   a multitude of online and mobile communication  based financial innovations and business applications.    3  indiegogo     is  a  san  Franciscobased  website   specialising in crowdfunding  founded in 2008 by   danae  Ringelmann   slava  Rubin  and  eric  schell.
