However  the sector’s composition and its performance during the crisis   has varied considerably between individual countries. A focus on the domestic   market and an overwhelmingly large share of micro firms in the southern   countries of the euro area have made these SMEs less resilient to the macro  shocks and changes in domestic demand of recent years.     As a result of organisational features and business strategies that are rarely   publicly disclosed  capital market funding is seldom an option for SMEs which   largely rely on bank loans for funding. At the same time  SMEs in the countries   hit hardest by recession and unemployment struggle the most in their access to   bank credit. In addition  not only has it become more challenging for SMEs to   get loans but lending rates have also become less favourable for them after the   crisis.     Mitigating measures such as LTROs that provide liquidity to the markets and   support the liability side of banks’ balance sheets have had limited success in   easing lending standards for SMEs. Indeed  demand for LTROs is now far   below precrisis levels and it is doubtful whether the new TLTROs will have a   meaningful (positive) impact on bank lending to SMEs.     Instead  high lending rates for SMEs are correlated to a large extent with the   banks’ (still elevated) own refinancing costs at market rates and their risk   perception regarding the outlook for SMEs in general.     The securitisation of SME loans has the potential to bridge the gap between   SMEs’ funding needs and the availability of bank loans by allowing banks to   partly offload SME credit risks and transfer them from their balance sheets to   the capital markets. In fact  there is significant upward or rebound potential for   securitisation especially in the southern European countries. Therefore    strengthening SME securitisation may be one of the most effective ways to   facilitate the flow of funds to the real economy.     Whereas the market for SME securitisations has been shrinking recently  there   are signs of more aggressive competition for banks from shadow banks in   general. This may imply that some SME loans are now being funded by lightly   regulated or unregulated shadow lenders which may not be a desired outcome   for regulators.     There is a large spectrum of public institutions which aim to support SMEs’   access to finance in the euro area. However  privatesector involvement is   crucial as direct government lending or loan guarantees may result in significant   costs to taxpayers and may even hurt healthy and creditworthy SMEs. Although   capital marketbased initiatives are trying to help SMEs to further diversify their   funding sources  the success of these efforts has been limited so far.      * The author would like to thank Marlene Braun for her valuable research assistance.     SME financing in the euro area     SME definition of the European Union          1     Enterprises which employ fewer than 10   persons and whose annual turnover does not   exceed EUR 2 m  and/or whose balance sheet   total does not exceed EUR 2 m are defined as   micro enterprises. Enterprises which are larger   than micro firms but employ fewer than 50   persons and whose annual turnover does not   exceed EUR 10 m  and/or whose balance   sheet total does not exceed EUR 10 m are   defined as small enterprises. Enterprises which   are larger than small firms but employ fewer   than 250 persons and whose annual turnover   does not exceed EUR 50 m  and/or whose   balance sheet total does not exceed EUR 43 m   are defined as mediumsized enterprises.      Taken together  micro  small and medium  sized enterprises make up the category of   SMEs.      Sources  Annex  Article 2  2003/361/EC      Introduction     Small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) play a pivotal role for employment    job creation  investment  innovation and economic growth and thus are crucial   for the recovery of the European economy. SMEs’ access to finance  however    has been challenging in the aftermath of the financial crisis and  given SMEs’   central importance  became the focus of policymakers’ attention.     The organisational features and the informational opacity of SMEs (see box 1   for a definition of SMEs) limit their access to standardised public equity and debt   markets for funding.1 As a result  one of the major challenges in financing SMEs   is their heavy reliance on bank loans which puts them under pressure when   banks tighten credit conditions  as has been the case in the recent financial   upheaval. In addition to the tightening of credit standards in general  another   problem is the discrepancy between borrowing costs of SMEs visàvis those of   large enterprises which widened significantly with the crisis.2 The fact that both   the tightening in bank loan criteria and the increase in the rate spread has been   more pronounced in peripheral countries puts the SME funding problem into the   spotlight of the policy debate. Against this background  a number of mitigating   measures are currently being introduced to ease SMEs access to bank lending   and allow for more favourable rates. These aim at either supporting the liability   side of banks’ balance sheets  e.g. through longterm refinancing operations  or   the asset side  e.g. via the securitisation of SME loans. Nevertheless  from a   banking sector perspective  the perception of risks regarding the outlook for   many SMEs together with the banks’ own refinancing costs at market rates    which remain elevated  may make it difficult to relax lending conditions for   SMEs. Relief could come from the securitisation of SME loans which may have   the potential to bridge the gap between the SMEs’ funding needs and the   availability of bank loans. Meanwhile  there are indications that credit   intermediation  including some lending to SMEs  has in part already shifted   outside the regulated banking system.     In closing the funding gap of SMEs  direct publicsector initiatives are as   essential as the mitigating measures that are directed at the banking system.   Even though some public initiatives for funding innovative firms and startups as   well as SMEs existed already  a number of new initiatives or umbrella   organizations for similar purposes were introduced recently. These existing and   newly introduced initiatives either support the credit financing channel through   providing loans or enable SMEs to raise equity funds from the capital market.   Recently  privatesector or marketbased initiatives have emerged that aim at   providing direct access to finance for SMEs as well. However  these public and   marketbased initiatives differ significantly from country to country in terms of   volume and scope. Therefore  an overview and comparison of already existing   and recently introduced public and marketbased initiatives is a topic of interest   for policymakers and market participants alike.     In this study  we take a closer look at the funding patterns and funding problems   of SMEs in the euro area  the mitigating measures to facilitate their access to   finance as well as public and marketbased initiatives to provide financing to   SMEs. We start with stylised facts of SMEs in individual euroarea countries   before discussing the funding alternatives available to SMEs  whereby we   differentiate between bank lending and capital market funding. Assessing the   degree of availability of bank credit in the euro area in aggregate terms and for a   subset of individual countries  we show that SMEs in the countries facing the                                                       1   Unless otherwise stated  the EC’s definition is used to define SMEs throughout this study.   2   See OECD (2013) for a detailed discussion.         2     |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     starkest recession and highest unemployment struggle the most to obtain   access to bank credit. We pursue our analysis by focusing on the relative   borrowing cost of SMEs compared with large enterprises. In explaining the   heightened lending rates to SMEs  we discuss the impact of mitigating   measures such as longterm refinancing operations that support the liability side   of banks’ balance sheets as well as securitisation which supports the asset side.   Moreover  we delve deeper into bankrelated factors such as the banks’ own   refinancing costs and their perception of risks in explaining the unfavourable   lending rates to SMEs. We briefly discuss the possibility of a shift in SME   lending to the shadow banking sector. Later on  we focus on the public   initiatives that support the financing of SMEs. In doing this  we differentiate   between measures targeting debt and equity financing separately for a subset of   countries. Finally  we provide a brief overview of existing marketbased   initiatives in some euroarea countries.     Financing patterns and problems for SMEs in    the euro area     SMEs are the backbone of the real economy     Although it is intuitively evident why SMEs are of special importance and a key   driver of the recovery of the European economy  it is illustrative to start with a   brief overview on SMEs’ paramount contribution to GDP and their pivotal role as   employers (see chart 2).     The most recent statistics on SMEs document that 99.8% of all European   businesses are SMEs which generate around 58% of the gross value added of   the corporate sector in Europe. Moreover  with 86.8 million people  they account   for almost 67% of private sector employment. About 85% of all European SMEs   operate in the manufacturing and services sectors  employing a total of 74   million people and producing EUR 2.9 tr of annual value added. The largest   contribution of the European SMEs in terms of employment and value added is   in the construction sector  a driving force of jobs and growth in the EU. Mean  while  in the manufacturing sector SME employment stands at roughly 60% of   total sector employment and SME contribution to the sector’s overall value   added is around 45%. In the services sector  which generates the lion’s share of   growth in the postindustrial era  an even higher share of employment (67%)   and 68% of total value added are generated by SMEs.     SMEs play a very crucial role in job creation too  between 2002 and 2010 85%   of newly created jobs in the EU came from SMEs. Considering the high un  employment rates in many euro area countries  the role of SMEs in job creation   has become increasingly important in the recovery from the financial and debt   crises. Given their paramount role for the real economy  SMEs are of particular   importance for a sustained economic recovery and balanced growth.     Characteristics of SMEs and their performance during the crisis in   individual countries     SMEs’ contribution to employment  value added and their performance during   the crisis as well as the share of micro enterprises among all SMEs differ   significantly in individual euro area economies. Among SMEs  micro enterprises   are traditionally more focused on domestic markets and therefore more   vulnerable to changes in local demand and local credit availability. Because   value added per employee tends to increase with company size  economies               SMEs are the engine of the European   economy     2     SMEs share as percentage in 2012 for EU 27     Number of   enterprises     Employment     Value added     0%  20%  40%  60%  80%  100%     Micro     Small     Mediumsized     Large     Sources  European Commission  London Economics    Deutsche Bank Research     Composition of SMEs by country     3     DE     FR     ES     IT     0%     20%     40%     60%     80%     100%     Micro     Small     Mediumsized     Sources  London Economics  European Commission    Deutsche Bank Research     3     |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     SMEs' contribution to employment   and value added     4     Share of SMEs in total in %     80     70     60     50     40     EU 27     DE     FR     ES     IT     Employment     Value added     Sources  London Economics  European Commission    Deutsche Bank Research     Micro firms' contribution to total   employment     5     %     50     40     30     20     10     0     EU 27     DE     FR     ES     IT     Sources  London Economics  European Commission    Deutsche Bank Research     featuring mostly micro firms are likely to be lagging in terms of aggregate   efficiency.3 Taken together  an overwhelmingly large share of micro firms could   make SMEs as a whole less resilient to macroshocks and changes in domestic   demand in times of financial upheaval.     In Germany  compared with other countries  SMEs feature a larger share of   small and mediumsized firms relative to micro firms. The share of micro   enterprises among SMEs is some 10 pp less than the EU average which can   largely be explained by structural differences such as i) German SMEs’ greater   export orientation as a result of which they benefited from decades of global  isation and ii) fewer obstacles to corporate growth in Germany than in other euro   area countries. German SMEs still generate “only” 62% of all jobs and 54% of   value added which is some 4 pp below the EU average. Nevertheless  it is   important to note that the EC definition of SMEs does not necessarily cover the   entire German Mittelstand  which usually also includes larger familyowned   companies with e.g. up to 500 employees. Policy initiatives to support SMEs/the   Mittelstand in Germany are welldeveloped and offer a number of alternative   debt financing options which we discuss in detail later. EC reports suggest that   German SMEs were by and large resilient even during the financial upheaval   and recession of 2008/09 and have since fully recovered from the crisis.4      The share of micro enterprises among SMEs and SMEs’ contribution to value   added in France are about the EU average  while at 63%  SMEs’ contribution to   total employment is somewhat lower. In contrast to German SMEs  the SME   sector in France was affected severely by the global financial crisis.5 Following a   moderate improvement after the crisis  SMEs’ recovery has been losing   momentum again over the past two years. Despite favourable and well  established public support schemes  the overall subdued performance of French   SMEs may partly be explained by their frequent focus on local markets and role   of subcontractors to large firms.     Micro enterprises make up the vast majority of SMEs in Italy and provide almost   half of the economy’s total employment with 46% and 30% of value added. In   total  SMEs generate 80% of employment and almost 70% of value added in   Italy. Similar to French SMEs  SMEs in Italy were hit hard by the recent financial   upheaval.6 The overwhelmingly large share of micro enterprises seems to make   it harder for Italian SMEs to withstand macroshocks and to adjust to changes in   access to finance.     Similar to Italy  micro enterprises represent a disproportionally large share of   SMEs in Spain and account for 40% of employment and 28% of value added. In   total  SMEs generate 75% of employment and almost 65% of value added in   Spain. Spanish SMEs largely comprise lowtech manufacturing and less   knowledgeintensive services that focus on domestic markets. These features   tend to make Spanish SMEs less competitive and particularly vulnerable to   changes in domestic demand. Against this background  policy initiatives in   Spain aim at supporting competitiveness and export orientation of SMEs. EC   reports point out that the prolonged recession between 2008 and 2012 in Spain   had a severe impact on the country’s SMEs and large enterprises alike.7 With   demand for their goods and services dropping substantially  SMEs not just in   Spain  but also in other countries saw cash flows weakening  shifting attention   to their overall financing structure.                                                                      3   See Vetter and Köhler (2014) for a detailed discussion.   4   See European Commission (2013a).    5   See European Commission (2013b).    6   See European Commission (2013c).    7   See European Commission (2013d).     4     |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     Limited market funding for SMEs     6     % of balance sheet     25     20     15     10     5     0     Small      Mediumsized     Large     Bank loans     Securities issued     Countries covered are Austria  Belgium  France  Germany    Italy  Portugal  Spain and the Netherlands.

As a result of their organisational features and   business strategies that are rarely publicly disclosed  SMEs are usually not as   transparent as large enterprises. This informational opacity limits their access to   standardised public markets for equity and debt.      The Bank for the Accounts of Companies Harmonized (BACH)8 database sheds   light on the differences between balance sheets of SMEs and those of large   firms. As shown in chart 6  the share of bank loans in total assets is inversely   related with firm size. Bank loans constitute 23% of small and 20% of medium  sized firms’ balance sheets compared with only 11% for large firms. By contrast    SMEs are virtually unable to raise funds directly from investors  i.e.  basically   none of the small firms has issued any (debt or equity) securities  which also   account for barely 1% of mediumsize firms’ balance sheets compared with 4%   for large corporations. Clearly  prohibitively high legal  accounting and marketing   costs together with SMEs’ inherent structural characteristics  ownership features   etc. are major impediments for SMEs to issue equity. Against a similar backdrop   of exorbitant fixed costs  tapping bond markets is not a viable option for the   overwhelming majority of SMEs either. What’s more  debt capital market   financing in the euro area is generally much more limited compared with the US   which as such already makes tapping bond markets a less likely alternative   even for large firms. As a consequence  it is not surprising to see barely any   SME issuing bonds. Taken together  unlike large enterprises which may turn to   the capital markets  SMEs largely rely on bank loans for funding. This narrow   set of financing sources makes them more vulnerable to changing conditions in   credit markets.     A complementary discussion focuses on internal funds. Generally  the avail  ability of internal funds reduces external financing needs and may put a firm in a   relatively better liquidity position when other forms of funding dry out. In this   respect  a crosscountry look at SMEs’ internal funds (and their use of bank   loans) reveals differences and similarities in financing structures across Europe   (see chart 7). Data from the ECB’s survey on access to finance (SAFE)9 shows   a broadly comparable degree of reliance on bank loans for German  French    Italian and Spanish SMEs  between 32% and 41% of SMEs in these countries   report to have used bank credit for financing in the last six months. Internal   funds play a notable role as well. Nevertheless  German SMEs have made by   far greater use of them recently than their peers elsewhere. 37% of SMEs in   Germany but only roughly 20% in the other large EMU economies reportedly   used internal funding in the last six months – a pattern that has broadly held true   since the start of the SAFE survey in 2010. This may indicate better profitability   as well as higher capital ratios for German SMEs which can be important factors   in determining the supply and demand for bank credit. Indeed  banks will   normally request higher risk premia for loans to undercapitalised SMEs whereas   better capitalised or more profitable SMEs are able to rely more on internal   resources for funding and in addition may have access to cheaper bank credit.   To delve deeper into these trends  we discuss bank loan availability in more   detail in the following section.                                                       8   The BACH database only looks at a single criterion – sales volume – for classifying SMEs       but here it follows the EC definition  enterprises with an annual turnover not exceeding   EUR 10 million are defined as small; enterprises with a turnover between EUR 10 million and   EUR 50 million are defined as mediumsized; enterprises with a turnover above that are defined   as large.      9   Data availability for individual countries is limited in the BACH database but the SAFE survey   data provides useful insights into the use of particular funding instruments on a crosscountry   level.               5     |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     Most pressing problems for SMEs in the   euro area     8     %  (2013H2)     Finding customers     Costs of production or     labour     Access to finance     Availability of skilled     staff     Regulation     Competition     Other     0     5     10  15  20  25     Sources  SAFE  Deutsche Bank Research     Most pressing problem for SMEs    access to finance     Percentage of SMEs reporting access to finance    as most pressing problem          9     25     20     15     10     5     0     Germany     France     Italy     Spain     H1 2010     H2 2013     Sources  SAFE  Deutsche Bank Research     Euro area SMEs find it difficult to obtain   bank loans     10     Percentage of SMEs reporting obstacles when   applying for bank loan (2013H2)     Rejected     Limited part     Discouraged     Cost too high     0     2     4     6     8     10     12     Sources  SAFE  Deutsche Bank Research               Availability of bank loans for SMEs     The fact that SMEs rely heavily on bank credit does not necessarily imply they   face financing obstacles. The period before the financial crisis  for instance  was   marked by easy access to bank loans. However  the favourable market   conditions changed drastically with the intensification of the financial crisis in   2008 and since then SMEs on aggregate have suffered to some extent from   disruptions in the supply of bank credit. By now  while 24% of the SMEs   surveyed in SAFE cite finding customers as the most pressing problem –   potentially due to weak demand in the aftermath of the crisis – a still substantial   14% name difficulties in the access to finance as the single most pressing   problem (see chart 8).      A crosscountry comparison reveals a striking divergence in access to finance   being an obstacle for SMEs. Access to external funding is the single most   challenging problem for SMEs in Italy  as indicated by 19% of firms and the   second most challenging problem for SMEs in Spain  as mentioned by 18% of   firms (see chart 9). The situation has deteriorated in particular in Italy with the   share having increased significantly (up 5 pp) since H1 2010. SMEs in France   report moderate problems in their access to finance (cited by 13% of firms). At   the other extreme  only 6% of German SMEs report access to finance as their   most pressing problem  down from 11% in 2010 which seems to be in line with   both more relaxed credit supply conditions and lower external funding needs of   German SMEs.     The survey also asks for more details about the exact problems SMEs face in   accessing their most important source of funding  i.e. bank loans (see chart 10).   For instance  11% of the SMEs in Euroland reported that their credit application   was rejected outright in the second half of 2013  and 10% received only a   limited part of the loan sum they had applied for.10 Moreover  6% did not apply   at all  fearing possible refusal. There is strong crosscountry heterogeneity in   rejection rates too. On the one hand  in Germany  SMEs hardly experience   problems obtaining bank credit  only 1% were rejected when they applied for   credit and only 6% report they got a smaller loan than needed. Moreover  the   rate of discouraged SMEs in Germany stands at around 2%  the lowest level in   the entire euro area  and is down from 11% in 2010. On the other hand  Italian   and Spanish SMEs report both high rejection rates (almost 15% and 10%    respectively) and a high share (almost 15% each) of loan applications that were   only partly approved.      Overall  while having the greatest need for loans  it seems that SMEs in the   countries with the fiercest recession and highest unemployment struggle the   most in their access to bank credit  which is attributable to weaker profitability   and lower capital positions. Meanwhile  if SMEs’ demand for credit rises due to   limited availability of internal funds  supply side problems in bank lending   become more critical. This demandsupply imbalance may be more severe in   countries such as Spain and Italy which is also reflected in unfavourable lending   rates to SMEs.      Cost of bank credit increased disproportionally for SMEs     Not only has it become more challenging for SMEs to obtain loans at all but   lending rates also became less favourable for them after the crisis. To shed   more light on the borrowing cost of SMEs visàvis large enterprises  a widely   used proxy is the spread between the interest rates of loans with a size of up to   EUR 1 million and those over EUR 1 million. Information on the borrowing costs   of micro enterprises can also be gleaned from the spread between the interest                                                     10  “Limited part” corresponds to a loan amount between 1% and 74% of the applied volume.     6     |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     SMEs in southern countries have   problems in obtaining bank credit     Percentage of SMEs reporting obstacles when   applying for bank loan (2013H2)     11     rates of loans up to EUR 0.25 million and over EUR 1 million.

However  a   significant widening took place with the intensification of the financial crisis in   late 2008  and again in 2012 with the acceleration of the sovereign debt crisis.   Following this second surge and only a slight moderation since then  SMEs’   borrowing costs today are still around 140 bp higher than those of large   enterprises in the euro area. Similar upward trends are observable for the   relative borrowing costs of micro enterprises too  the spread widened up from   approximately 150 bp before the aggravation of the sovereign debt crisis to over   250 bp in summer 2012. Recently  the disproportionally high borrowing costs for   micro firms have somewhat stabilised at a spread of around 210 bp  which   nevertheless is significantly higher than in the presovereign crisis period.     The increase in lending rates to SMEs has been particularly pronounced in   southern euro area countries  therefore demanding greater attention. During the   boom phase  SMEs’ relative borrowing costs in the largest economies of the   euro area had converged to some 80 bp. Remarkably  during this period    German SMEs were paying persistently higher rates than SMEs in Spain  Italy   and France in both absolute and relative terms. For instance  in September   2008 lending rates for SMEs in France were only 17 bp higher than for large   enterprises compared with a spread of 63 bp in Germany. These trends   reversed following the collapse of Lehman Brothers. However  even though the   borrowing costs of SMEs surged in all countries  the upswing was much more   evident in France  Italy and Spain. In Germany  the increase was relatively   modest and by now the relative borrowing cost of SMEs is only slightly higher   than in the precrisis period. On the other hand  a significant normalisation over   recent months notwithstanding  the increase in lending rates to SMEs was much   more pronounced in Italy and Spain  with peak spread values around 200 bp   and 300 bp  respectively. Moreover  a stark divergence still persists compared   with countries such as Germany.     All in all  SMEs and in particular micro firms from the countries with the deepest   recession and highest unemployment pay significantly higher rates for bank   loans than large enterprises. In normal times  analysts and policymakers would   probably have agreed that action is needed to reduce these rates. However    under the current circumstances there is no consensus among market   participants whether elevated rates in these countries are in line with SMEs’   fundamentals or not. On the one hand  some argue that before the outbreak of   the financial crisis  lending rates to SMEs were unreasonably low and fuelled   excessive indebtedness. According to this line of argument  policy action to   reduce lending rates would in fact negatively affect the economy as a whole by   draining funds from the healthier parts of the economy to structurally weak   SMEs.11 On the other hand  others claim that in addition to significant negative   spillover effects during the crisis among the southern countries and to other   euro area members  the unsustainable level of unemployment in southern   countries indeed requires policy action.12 Furthermore  it is not clear a priori if   the elevated lending rates to SMEs are due to SMEs’ structural weaknesses or   due to deleveraging in the banking sector  banks’ risk aversion and liquidity   problems. In line with the proponents of market intervention to reduce lending   rates to SMEs  the ECB has introduced several mitigating measures which we   discuss in detail below.                                                                       11  See Moec (2013) for a detailed discussion.   12  See Darvas (2013) for a detailed discussion.     7     |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     ECB balance sheet expanded     14     EUR bn     3000     2500     2000     1500     1000     500     0     00     02     04     06     08     10     12     14     LTRO     Other assets     Sources  ECB  Deutsche Bank Research     LTRO amounts alloted and number of   bidders     15     Amount alloted in EUR bn (left)     Total number of bidders (right)     2500     2000     1500     1000     500     0     5500     4500     3500     2500     1500     500     2004  2006  2008  2010  2012  2014     Alloted amount     Number of bidders     2014 alloted amounts and total number of bidders are   yeartodate (JanuarySeptember).     Sources  ECB  Deutsche Bank Research               Mitigating action (I)  Longterm refinancing operations     To boost bank lending and thereby spur economic activity  the ECB provides   cheap funding to banks in the form of longterm refinancing operations (LTROs)   which come in addition to its provision of shortterm liquidity. It is important to   note  however  that the features of the LTROs have markedly changed since the   precrisis period. First  originally  the longest maturity offered was only three   months  which subsequently was lengthened to one year  three years and  most   recently  four years. In addition  the ECB until 2008 set a fixed amount of   funding it would provide and then obtained banks’ bids for a certain volume.   Overall  the amounts on offer were much lower than today  leading almost   always to excess demand and oversubscription for LTROs. Third  the rates   applied by the ECB – usually the normal benchmark rate – were much higher.   All these factors dampened LTRO volumes significantly until late 2008.   However  with the acceleration of the financial crisis and the onset of recession    the ECB took extraordinary measures  switching from an auctioning process to   full allotment of any amount the banks applied for. Furthermore  the central bank   considerably extended LTRO maturities in several steps  and cut the interest   rates banks had to pay to record lows. Currently  the LTRO rate stands at only   0.15%  with durations of the latest tenders of up to four years. To shed more   light on LTRO trends  chart 14 presents the ECB’s LTRO volume (across all the   different terms and conditions) and its total assets over time.     Prior to the crisis  the outstanding LTRO volumes were broadly stable at around   EUR 150 bn. Bids for LTROs still exceeded the allotted amounts just before the   failure of Lehman Brothers (on 9th September 2008  the ratio was about 2 to 1).   After Lehman  LTRO volumes expanded; and LTRO bids and allotted amounts   have been balanced since  of course. Volumes reached a record level of EUR   1 093 bn or 37% of the ECB’s total assets in April 2012. Following significant   repayments over recent years  LTRO volumes now stand at only EUR 430 bn or   21% of the ECB’s balance sheet total.      The outstanding LTRO amounts provide limited information on the demand for   LTROs and the reasons for the recent decline in volumes. More insights can be   gained from the total number of bidders which is a proxy for the demand for   LTROs (presented in chart 15). Similar to the surge in the outstanding amounts    the number of bidders increased exponentially with the crisis and reached a   peak in 2009. Demand then remained elevated and allotted amounts marked a   record volume in 2011. However  from 2012 onwards  demand for LTROs and   allotted volumes decreased significantly and both are now far below even pre  crisis levels.      Undoubtedly  mitigating measures such as the LTROs have supported the   banking sector during the crisis and have contributed to easing liquidity and   funding constraints of the industry  thereby indirectly also helping bank lending   to SMEs and large enterprises alike. However  the fact that both LTRO volumes   and SME lending rates reached their peak at about the same time could be   interpreted as evidence that LTROs indeed were hardly successful in bringing   down lending rates to SMEs. We will take a further look at this potential causal   relationship in an empirical analysis below. By now at least  both the demand for   LTROs and the actual flows – which of course are partly affected by the   maturing exceptional 3year LTROs – have dwindled significantly  while the   elevated costs of bank credit for SMEs still persist. This may indicate that there   are factors other than a lack of cheap liquidity and funding for banks that lead to   higher lending rates for SMEs.      Recently  the ECB has introduced targeted longerterm refinancing operations   (TLTROs)  to promote bank lending to the real economy  i.e. bank lending to   euro area nonfinancial corporations and households excluding loans for house   purchase. The two TLTRO operations (the first conducted in September  the     8     |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     Banks' own financing costs     16     bp     750     600     450     300     150     0     03     05     07     09     11     13     Banks' deposit rates   Banks' bond spreads     Sources  ECB  Markit  Deutsche Bank Research          second to follow in December) will allow banks to borrow up to 7% of their   outstanding loans to the nonfinancial private sector in the euro area. The ECB   loans will have a maturity of a maximum of 4 years and will be priced at 10 bp   above the benchmark interest rate. Nonetheless  considering the subdued   impact the 3year LTROs seem to have had on SME credit supply  it looks   unlikely that the new TLTROs will create meaningful incentives to lend to SMEs.   Indeed  the September tender’s result remained well below the EUR 400 bn on   offer from the ECB  with banks borrowing only EUR 83 bn.     Banks’ own refinancing costs     But why did the cheap ECB liquidity not find its way to small and mediumsized   firms? Banks may refrain from transmitting the favourable conditions of central   bank funding to their clients due to their own balance sheet constraints  high   refinancing costs or perceived risks in the SME sector. The ECB’s interest rate   statistics on deposit rates may help to shed light on the banks’ own financing   costs (chart 16). At first glance  this data does not seem to suggest a rise in   financing costs; rather  it shows a noticeable decline in deposit rates over recent   years. However  it needs to be kept in mind that this decline primarily reflects   the ECB’s monetary policy aimed at keeping lending rates at very low levels.   Also shown in chart 16 is the index of banks’ bond yields which provides the   floor rates charged to firms. Indeed  bond yields were broadly stable prior to the   start of the crisis at around 50 bp above the benchmark. However  financial   bond spreads surged with the outbreak of the financial crisis  jumping to an all  time high of almost 700 bp in April 2009 and reaching another peak of more   than 500 bp in January 2012. Even though bond yields have come down since    mostly due to searchforyield sentiment  they remain elevated  at about twice   the precrisis level. Thus  overall  banks’ cost of funding via debt securities has   increased considerably from 2008 onwards.      A closer look in the form of an empirical analysis of the relative borrowing costs   of SMEs  the LTRO volumes13 and banks’ own refinancing costs proxied by   bond spreads can provide better insights into the relevant transmission   channels. Even though all these elements are closely interrelated and are likely   to be correlated with numerous other factors  a simple statistical method may   help to determine if there is an empirical relationship between the banks’ own   refinancing costs as well as LTRO volumes and lending rates for SMEs. In doing   this  we run a vector auto regression model and perform a Granger causality   analysis. Causality in this context is discussed in a narrow statistical sense and   indicates if one series helps to predict future values of the other series and vice   versa. Table 17 summarizes the results of this exercise.     Table               17          The rejection of a causal relation between LTRO volumes and SMEs’ borrowing   costs suggests that the success of LTROs in reducing SMEs’ borrowing costs   may be limited. Moreover  the rejection of the reverse causality further supports   a weak relation between the two. On the other hand  there is a causal relation   from banks’ own refinancing costs to the borrowing costs of SMEs. This implies   that banks’ balance sheet constraints or elevated refinancing costs may   translate into higher lending rates for SMEs. The rejection of reverse causality   from SMEs’ borrowing costs lends further support to the onesided relation                                                     13  We use the ratio of the LTRO volume and total assets of the ECB for our analysis.      9     |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     HypothesisLTROBanks own refinancing costsImpact on SME borrowing costsNOYESReverse impact from SME borrowing costsNONOSource  Deutsche Bank ResearchSME financing in the euro area     Banks‘ risk perception regarding SMEs     18     Contributed to tightening of credit standards   minus contributed to easing in %     80     60     40     20     0     20     08     09     10     11     12     13     14     Industry outlook     General economic outlook     Risk of collateral demanded     Sources  BLS  Deutsche Bank Research     between the two. Taken together  LTROs seem to contribute relatively little to   boosting SME lending which may put the effectiveness of the TLTROs in this   regard into question. Admittedly  the results presented here say nothing about   the nature of the common trends between these indicators and therefore do not   claim to uncover a structural economic relationship.      Banks’ risk perception regarding SMEs     In addition to banks’ own funding costs  a second factor may have been relevant   in explaining the substantial rise in SMEs’ borrowing costs  banks’ risk aversion   and increasingly cautious view on the outlook for SMEs. By and large  SMEs are   perceived to have a higher probability of default than larger firms which in turn   may lead banks to generally be more selective in supplying loans to SMEs. At   the same time  as shown above  bank loans are much more crucial for smaller   firms than for larger ones which have additional funding options  mainly in the   capital markets. To shed light on banks’ sentiment regarding SMEs’ riskiness    chart 18 demonstrates the contribution of different factors to the tightening of   banks’ credit standards for loans to SMEs as documented in the Bank Lending   Survey (BLS) of the ECB. Each series shows the net change (share of tightened   minus share of eased) in the relevant factor compared with the previous quarter.      BLS data suggests that at the height of the financial crisis all factors had a peak   in their contribution to the tightening of SME lending standards. Similarly    negative risk perceptions reemerged with the intensification of the sovereign   debt crisis. These trends overlap with increases in the relative borrowing costs   of SMEs. Even though in recent years the risk perception of banks seems to   have contributed less to a tightening of bank credit conditions (which itself also   came to an end  largely)  the much more negative assessment of SME risks   compared with the pre2007 period may not have reversed yet. Again  it is   important to note that the BLS defines (net) changes in a series with respect to   the level of the previous quarter. Therefore  the most recent slightly negative   figures almost certainly do not imply a reversal or full normalisation of the risk   perception’s contribution to credit standards. By contrast  this de facto merely   reflects a halt in a prolonged tightening process due to an ever greater risk   perception  and banks’ cautiousness with respect to lending to SMEs may   basically persist.          All in all  our findings indicate that the mitigating measures that provide liquidity   to the markets and support the liability side of banks’ balance sheets may have   had a limited impact on reducing the high borrowing costs of SMEs. On the   other hand  these costs seem to be correlated to a larger extent with banks’ own   refinancing costs (specifically  the market rates) and banks’ risk perception   regarding the outlook for SME credit in general. Hence  alternative mitigating   measures are worth discussing that allow for the transfer of the credit risk of   SME loans to other parts of the financial system.     Mitigating action (II)  Securitisation of SME loans     In addition to mitigating measures that provide liquidity at favourable conditions   and thus support the liability side of banks’ balance sheets  there are other   measures such as securitisation that target the asset side of banks’ balance   sheets to facilitate lending to SMEs. This can be achieved by creating tradable   or collateralisable securities linked to SME loans  thereby transferring their credit   risk to the capital markets in an effective manner. To address the securitisation   trends of recent years  chart 19 shows the outstanding volume of securitised   SME loans in Europe. The available data suggests rapid expansion especially   from 2006 to 2009  followed by a lull period and  since 2012  contraction.

Even though   there is no exact data on the outstanding amount of SME loans  as lending   figures in general are aggregates with respect to company size  OECD (2014)   and Bundesbank (2013) statistics may help to quantify the approximate   amounts  at least for some countries in the euro area. Using the most recent   SME loan shares statistics 15 we estimate that there are around EUR 282 bn   SME loans outstanding in Germany  EUR 196 bn in Spain  EUR 192 bn in   France and EUR 168 bn in Italy (for a total of EUR 838 bn). Put differently    around 24% of all business loans in these four countries are loans to SMEs. It is   important to note that the predicted values of SME loans are approximate   figures using various information sources and hence they do not claim to be   precise point estimates.      To complete the picture  chart 21 presents the breakdown of securitised SME   loans for these four countries. In total  some EUR 56 bn or 7% of the out  standing SME loans are securitised as of Q22014. Meanwhile  the aggregate   figures mask a stark crosscountry heterogeneity  in Germany and France    outstanding volumes of securitised SME loans are quite low  at EUR 2.3 bn and   EUR 1.2 bn respectively. Considering the overall subdued securitisation markets   in these countries  this is not a surprising observation. By contrast  in line with a   buoyant securitisation market in general  SME loan securitisations in Spain   amount to around EUR 27 bn. Put differently  despite a significant decrease   over recent years  some 14% of the SME loans in Spain are securitised. In Italy    the securitisation of SME loans gained a pace considerably after 2012  almost   reaching the level of Spain  and now stands at around EUR 26 bn or 16% of all   SME loans.      The available data reveals a clear divergence in euro area economies with   regard to the securitisation of SME loans. On the one hand  in countries where   SMEs’ access to bank credit is less of a problem  securitisation is meagre – as   might be expected. On the other hand  where SMEs have significant difficulties   in their access to finance or where lending rates are high  the volume of   securities backed by loans to SMEs is higher. But there is upward or rebound   potential both in Italy (with its positive development recently) and Spain (given   that the market used to be much bigger). Higher levels of SME securitisation   would allow Italian and Spanish banks to reduce the (credit) risks on their   balance sheets by transferring further SME loans to the capital markets. By   doing this  banks could benefit from capital relief and free up capacity for new   loans to SMEs.16 Thus  securitisation allows banks to improve their capital   positions without damaging lending to SMEs. SMEs may benefit through   reduced lending rates or eased credit standards in general. In this respect    public initiatives that support the securitisation of SME loans may be helpful   though of course  in doing this  the introduction of new risks should be avoided.   For instance  new securitised products should be transparent and have   standardised structures (no multiple securitisation); in addition  originators   should have sufficient skin in the game to avoid moral hazard etc.17 Taken   together  strengthening SME securitisation may be one of the most effective   ways to facilitate the flow of funds to the real economy  while not creating too   much distortion. Potentially this could also involve at least temporary buying by                                                       14  Data availability prevents a crosscountry analysis of SME loan securitisation before 2010.   15  2012 for all countries.   16  See KraemerEis (2010) for a detailed discussion.    17  See KraemerEis (2013) for a detailed discussion.                    11  |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     Shadow bank assets on the rise in the   euro area     22     Total assets in EUR tr (left)    Shadow bank share in financial sector % (right)     60     45     30     15     0     36     32     28     24     20     00     02     05     07     10     12     Insurance corporations and pension funds     Shadow banks (OFIs)     Banks (MFIs)     Shadow bank assets share      For computing shadows banks' relative share  financial    sector is defined as the sum of MFI  OFIs as well as   insurance corporations and pension funds.

It is worth mentioning that banks often sell securitised SME (and other) loans to   special purpose vehicles. In other words  even though the regulated banking   sector plays a key role in originating and possibly securitising SME loans  a   different part of the financial system is ultimately financing the securitised   assets. We discuss the role of this nonbank financial sector in detail below.     Does SME lending shift to alternative providers?     Given the constraints some SMEs face in getting sufficient credit from banks    due to ongoing deleveraging and regulatory pressure  are other sources of   funding becoming more relevant? Shadow banks could emerge as alternative   lenders  i.e. institutions which act like financial intermediaries but stay in the   lightly regulated or unregulated nonbank financial sector. These nonbank   entities  in addition to investing in securitised products  can also directly lend in   the form of peertopeer lending  crowd funding or in other forms.     The shadow banking sector in the euro area has seen remarkable growth in the   past few years. Chart 22 shows the total assets of banks  insurance   corporations and pension funds as well as those of “other financial inter  mediaries”  a conservative proxy for the size of the shadow banking system.18   Prior to 2005  the shadow banking sector was somewhat moderate in size with   total assets amounting to around EUR 8 tr at end2005. Since then  however    total shadow banking assets have more than doubled (with a temporary dip   during the financial crisis)  reaching EUR 18 tr at the end of 2013. The   remarkable growth of this sector is visible in relative terms too. The share of   shadow banks in the financial sector as a whole has climbed considerably to   around 32% today  from 25% in 2005.      Certainly  an expansion in shadow bank assets does not necessarily indicate an   increase in shadow bank lending to SMEs. Furthermore  bank assets are far   larger than those of shadow banks. However  there are indeed some signs that   change is underway. For instance  some nonbank financial institutions have   publicly mentioned their interest in lending to SMEs. Moreover  policymakers   point to growing activity of shadow banks in peertopeer lending and some   other forms of credit creation for SMEs. A lack of data by and large prevents   detailed analysis of these trends  but the BLS may shed some light on this   discussion. It asks banks whether competition from nonbanks has an impact on   the tightening (or easing) of their conditions for SME loans. Not surprisingly    banks tend to ease credit standards in response to competitive pressures from   the nonbank sector such as shadow banks. In the BLS context  the nonbank   sector consists of insurance corporations and pension funds  financial auxiliaries   and other financial intermediaries  for whom data is available from 2008 onward   (see chart 23). The BLS results suggest that during the first few years of the   crisis  nonbank competition has actually even led to some tightening which may   largely be explained by the fragile situation of the financial sector as a whole    including nonbanks. During this period  shadow banks seem to have had   similar constraints as banks  thus refraining from providing credit. Between 2009   and 2013  nonbank competition only had a marginal impact on the availability   of bank loans to SMEs. However  over the past few quarters  competition from   shadow lenders seems to have become somewhat stronger  which contributed   to a moderate net easing of credit standards.19 This may imply that some SME   loans are now being funded by lightly regulated or unregulated shadow banks.                                                                 18  See FSB (2013) for a detailed discussion.    19  Overall  most of the other factors driving SME credit conditions have also started to contribute     similarly to a moderate relaxation of banks’ lending standards.      12  |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     It is important to bear in mind that shadow banks are often highly opaque in   terms of their activities and cannot rely on explicit public sector backstops for   liquidity. Therefore  a situation in which banks are not able to lend to SMEs and   the real economy is instead becoming dependent on more volatile and   potentially unreliable alternatives may not be a desired outcome for regulators   and policymakers. This underlines the importance of the mitigating measures   already discussed and of other initiatives to support new loans (or equity   financing) for SMEs described below.      Other initiatives to support SME funding     In closing SMEs’ financing gap  another option is that publicsector or market  based entities e.g. lend directly to SMEs or provide guarantees for SME loans.   In this respect  public and marketbased initiatives are as essential as the   mitigating measures  i.e. ECB funding and securitisation. Even though some   public initiatives to help fund innovative firms and startups as well as SMEs   already existed  a number of public initiatives or umbrella organisations for   similar purposes have been set up only recently.20 These initiatives either target   debt by providing loans to SMEs or equity such as venture capital or tax   incentives which we discuss in detail below.      Public / government initiatives     The financing problems of euro area SMEs have led to public interventions to   overcome the obstacles. With the direct intervention of national governments    stateowned banks and other companies  these initiatives aim at improving   financing conditions for SMEs through favourable interest rates or public   guarantees for traditional bank loans as well as through support targeted at   equity financing.

KfW Group is the leading institution to provide longterm investment and working   capital loans to SMEs in Germany. In terms of promoting credit to SMEs  KfW   offers a number of different programmes  i) for individuals who are self  employed  ii) for small enterprises that were established only recently and iii) to   SMEs that have been active in the market for a longer time. KfW generally   grants SME loans through any regular commercial bank the borrower has   chosen (incl. savings banks and cooperative banks). KfW typically provides   longterm funding at fixed rates. These interest rates are either based on its   AAA capital market rating without any further subsidies or additionally   subsidized by KfW or government grants. KfW channels these funds via   commercial banks to the final customers. Collateralisation of the loans is left to   usual banking procedure. Risk margins are regulated according to rating and   collateralisation. In their role as relationship banks  these commercial banks first   analyse the commercial risk and then decide whether KfW should be involved in   the provision of the loan or not. This twostep process ensures fair and   reasonable allocation of funds.     Depending on the lifetime of the SMEs  KfW offers numerous loan and subsidy   programmes (see table 24). For instance  ERPloan programmes provide credit   to SMEs with different maturities and at subsidised interest rate conditions. ERP   Innovation programmes provide longterm financing for investments in the                                                     20  For a detailed discussion see Infelise (2014).

For SMEs that have been active in the market for longer  KfW provides   entrepreneurloans with favourable interest rates. To provide equity financing to   SMEs  KfW has the ERPStartfonds and ERP participation programmes.     In 2013  the startup and general corporate financing continued to increase with   new (gross) lending of EUR 11.3 bn. KfW issued more than 34 000 entre  preneur loans  with a total volume of almost EUR 8 bn. Meanwhile  despite a   shrinking number of startups in Germany  the committed volumes for both start  up loans increased to EUR 2.6 bn. Similarly  loan volumes rose in 2013 for KfW   innovation funding and for promoting young innovative enterprises. Taken   together  the range of KfW’s public support schemes for German SMEs is   markedly diversified and may be quite effective in facilitating access to finance   especially in times of financial upheaval. Moreover  the availability of robust   public support lowers the risk of funding uncertainty  thereby allowing for a   longerterm approach to business.

It provides assistance and financial support to SMEs for   accessing bank credit as well as in raising equity capital  focussing on startups   and innovation funding. Bpifrance is an umbrella institution that combines the   activities of OSEO  CDC  FSI  Fonds Stratégique d’Investissement Regions and   takes the lead in coordinating the variety of public initiatives promoting the   economic development of French SMEs.     The supportive programmes of Bpifrance consist of three elements  sub  sidisation of bank loans  guarantees for SME loans and advisory support (see   table 25). For instance  Prêt Participatif d’Amorçage (PPA) and Contrat de   Développement Innovation (CDI) subsidise bank loans and do not require   collateral or guarantees. Prêt Pour l’Innovation (PPI) is designed for SMEs that   commercialise new products. With Contrat de Développement Participatif   (CDP)  Bpifrance intends to collaborate with a firm’s commercial bank and co  finance bank credit. Garantie Innovation  Biotech Garantie and Garantie de   Caution sur Projets Innovants are different loan guarantee programmes offered   by Bpifrance. In order to promote equity funding of SMEs  the French   government has established public investment funds and also guarantees   privatesector investments in SMEs’ capital.      France is the leading country in Europe with regard to the total number of SMEs   financed  Bpifrance guaranteed EUR 8 bn of bank loans to 60 800 companies in   2013. In terms of financing innovation  Bpifrance granted EUR 747 million in   2013 and has a target budget of EUR 985 million for this year. As regards public   initiatives targeting equity financing  the investment funds initiated by Bpifrance   (directly or indirectly) invest in 1 000 enterprises on average each year. In 2013    equity investments in SMEs thus amounted to EUR 121 million with an   investment target of EUR 170 million for 2014. All in all  the public initiatives in   France offer a diversified range of financial support and are primarily intended   for SMEs during their highrisk phases. Indeed  these highrisk phases – start  up  innovation  development  internationalisation and buyout – play a key role in   terms of job creation and employment. Hence  combined with tight supervision   by the state and a sound liquidity position  Bpifrance has become crucially   important (and promisingly successful) in supporting French SMEs.                14  |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     Italy          26     Italy     Programmes     Terms     Debt financing public initiatives     Nuovo Plafond PMI   Investimenti     transmission of   favourable loan   conditions     Plafond PMI Crediti   vs PA     shortterm iquidity   support     Fondo Centrale di   Garanzia   (Guarantee)     up to 80% of the   investment with a max.   of EUR 2.5 million     Equity financing public initiatives     Fondo Italiano   d'Investimento   (Direct and Indirect   Equity Capital)     no threshold     Source  Deutsche Bank Research          Italian public programmes that provide financial support to SMEs are less   diversified  yet more concentrated in terms of the funding capacity of each   programme. The stateowned Cassa Depositi e Prestiti (CdP) takes the leading   role in coordinating a variety of public initiatives to finance and promote the   economic development of Italian SMEs. CdP and the Italian Banking   Association jointly set up in January 2012 the Nuovo Plafond PMI Investimenti   programme which aims at facilitating SMEs’ access to bank credit by   channelling funds at favourable conditions through participating commercial   banks (see table 26). Plafond PMI Crediti vs PA is a complementary programme   which focuses on providing shortterm liquidity. In order to support SMEs’ equity   financing  in 2010 the Italian government established the investment fund Fondo   Italiano d’Investimento together with a number of sponsoring banks and trade   associations.      The most recent figures show that the CdP has stepped up its lending activity   substantially with the outstanding amount of SME loans increasing to EUR 7.6   bn  up from EUR 5.7 bn in 2012. By and large  a strong upward trend in public   support for SMEs is observable in Italy and indeed  considering the limited   alternatives to bank credit  sustained support from the CdP may be of central   importance for restoring the financial viability and growth of Italian SMEs.

ICO and ENISA offer a number of different support schemes to promote the   economic development of Spanish SMEs (see table 27). The ICO Liquidity   Facility provides loans to SMEs. Meanwhile  ENISA programmes provide loans   with different maturities and amounts to SMEs that are either innovative firms    active in manufacturing or technologybased and to SMEs undertaking M&A   projects in order to improve the firm’s competitiveness. There are also SME   Guarantee Programmes for selfemployed individuals. Public support for SMEs’   equity financing in Spain is coordinated by two initiatives  a programme helping   firms to go public and the ICO investment fund.      This broad range of financial support programmes involves substantial sums    ICO granted EUR 12 bn of SME loans in 2013 alone  thereby facilitating access   to liquidity and the internationalisation activities of Spanish SMEs. In the first   quarter of 2014  ICO already provided EUR 3.8 bn through Spanish credit   institutions in particular for micro firms and freelancers. ENISA approved 809   operations in 2013 with a total amount of EUR 102 million. Overall  given that   around 96% of Spanish companies have less than 10 employees  the   supportive programmes offered by public institutions may be of significant   importance and may play a key role in improving the financing situation of   Spanish SMEs.     Principles of efficient public initiatives     Given the large spectrum of public institutions and initiatives which aim at   supporting SMEs’ access to finance  determining the most efficient way of public   intervention has pivotal relevance for market participants and policymakers   alike.     15  |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     First and foremost  private sector involvement is crucially important. Indeed  few   institutions are as skilled and experienced in assessing and managing risk as   banks – which is one of the reasons why they exist. Moreover  their often long  term client relations may allow banks to gauge credit risk more precisely than   other creditors. In addition  private involvement reduces the incentive problems   that may otherwise arise in the distribution of loans  public intervention could   lead to credit decisions being politically driven instead of commercially  thus   impeding efficient allocation of capital and in fact of taxpayers’ funds. Taken   together  initiatives that share the commercial risk of loans between the private   and the public sector or in which the authorities grant loans through banks are   more likely to really reach the healthy and most creditworthy SMEs. By   incorporating banks  public initiatives can draw on their risk management   expertise and build on banks’ client relations as well as ensure sufficient skin in   the game. In the large euroarea countries at least  KfW in Germany seems to   achieve private involvement most effectively. Even though public institutions in   other countries share similarities with KfW  direct government lending schemes   or loan guarantees in southern countries could result in significant costs to   taxpayers and  due to crowding out effects  even lead to problems in credit   availability for healthy and creditworthy SMEs in the long run.21     Another important aspect is efficient coordination and harmonisation of public   resources. Indeed  too many public institutions may lead to extensive   bureaucracy and costs for public budgets. As a result  having a single umbrella   institution seems to be the best way to minimise administrative costs for   taxpayers. By and large  this has been achieved in Germany and  recently  also   in France. However  it might be even more important to harmonise resources at   the EU level. It is therefore good news that there are now indications of   cooperation and harmonisation between individual countries. The recent   agreement  worth EUR 1.6 billion  between KfW and ICO to finance SMEs in   Spain is a meaningful step in this direction. Finally  as a true EU umbrella   institution  the European Investment Fund  too  has a significant role to play in   supporting the continent’s SMEs in accessing finance.      Marketbased initiatives     In addition to public support for SMEs  a number of marketbased initiatives   were launched in recent years. Their main objective is to diversify SMEs’   funding options by facilitating access to external financing sources such as   equity or bond markets.     In many countries equity trading platforms are better developed than bond   markets. In general  specific trading platforms for SME stocks usually target   mediumsized firms but not micro firms  due to minimum size requirements.   These trading platforms have a greater growth potential in countries where the   financial market infrastructure is better developed and the proportion of medium  sized enterprises is higher. Due to a relatively low share of such firms  at least   compared with Germany  in Italy  Spain and France  the number of SMEs that   utilise these funding platforms is still relatively low.      In Germany  the Entry Standard segment for shares gives SMEs the opportunity   to raise capital under reduced administrative requirements and at lower costs. In   France  Alternext offers small and mid caps an alternative way to enter the   capital market. Launched in May 2013  Mercado Alternativo Bursátil is the   Spanish trading platform with a more flexible regulatory framework exclusively   targeting SMEs. Similarly  in Italy  AIM ItaliaMAC represents the market                                                       21  Of course  there is also the general problem of competitive distortion as government intervention   may prevent a market shakeout and keep firms going even without a sustainable business model    to the detriment of their better positioned rivals.     16  |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     segment that attracts SMEs in a more flexible and less costly administrative   framework than the ordinary regulated market. In addition  in April 2012  the   Italian exchange (Borsa Italiana) in cooperation with the Italian government and   other major Italian financial institutions initiated the Elite Programme  which is a   specific platform aiming to support SMEs’ growth intentions.      Alternative investment markets for SME bonds to support access to debt capital   markets are on the rise in Germany  too. For instance  the Entry Standard for   corporate bonds on the Frankfurt Stock Exchange is wooing clients with   reduced requirements regarding disclosures and issuance size. The ExtraMOT   PRO segment of the Italian stock exchange was created in February 2013 in   order to promote external financing of SMEs through bond issuance. Similarly    in October 2013  Spain initiated the Alternative FixedIncome Market (Mercado   Alternativo de Renta Fija – MARF) specifically for SME bond trading.   Nonetheless  the overall uptake has been mixed so far and SME funding   through the bond markets has yet to develop to indeed become a meaningful   force.     The development of alternative capital markets for SMEs can help mitigate   costly administrative obstacles. The scope and intensity of these marketbased   initiatives differs substantially between countries though. In terms of SMEs   which are already listed on stock exchanges  Germany and France are ahead of   Spain and Italy. Spanish and Italian public initiatives  on the other hand    increasingly establish schemes which aim at bringing more SMEs to the market    including technical and advisory support. In all cases  however  it is important to   note that the national structure of SMEs’ stock markets limits the attractiveness   for international investors. On the debt side  Germany has taken a leading role   in developing bond segments specifically designed for SMEs whereas other   countries only recently started to promote this channel.      Conclusion     In this study  we have taken a closer look at the funding problems of SMEs in   the euro area  the mitigating measures to facilitate their access to finance as   well as other public and marketbased initiatives. Among the largest euro area   countries  SMEs’ contribution to economic activity and employment and their   performance during the crisis varies considerably. This can largely be explained   by structural differences of SMEs in individual countries  German SMEs e.g.   tend to be rather exportoriented and thus more resilient to changes in local   demand whereas there is an overwhelmingly large share of micro enterprises   among Italian and Spanish SMEs which find it harder to withstand macro  shocks. SMEs usually rely heavily on bank credit for funding  although in   Germany they currently seem to be more profitable and thus able to fund   themselves to a greater extent internally. But there is strong crosscountry   heterogeneity when it comes to the availability of bank credit. The tightening of   lending standards over the past few years was far more pronounced in the   countries with the starkest recession and highest unemployment. Moreover    SMEs and especially micro firms in these countries pay significantly higher   lending rates than large enterprises. This has shifted the focus on some   mitigating measures.      By and large  policies that aim to expand bank lending may address either the   liability or the asset side of banks’ balance sheets. However  the mitigating   measures such as ECB LTROs that provide liquidity to the markets and support   the liability side seem to have had limited success in reducing the borrowing   costs of SMEs. Instead  high lending rates for SMEs are correlated to a large   extent with banks’ (still elevated) own refinancing costs at market rates and their   risk perception regarding the outlook for SMEs in general. Therefore  it is     17  |  October 14  2014     EU Monitor     SME financing in the euro area     doubtful whether the new TLTROs will have a meaningful (positive) impact on   bank lending to SMEs.      Mitigating measures such as securitisation that support the asset side of banks’   balance sheets are more or less a niche topic in countries where SMEs’ access   to bank credit is less of a problem. On the other hand  the securitisation of SME   loans has gained pace over the recent years in Italy and equally has substantial   upward potential in Spain. Strengthening this option would allow Italian and   Spanish banks to partly offload SME credit risks and transfer them from their   balance sheets to the capital markets  thereby freeing up equity and extending   their capacity to lend. Taken together  securitisation has the potential to bridge   the gap between SMEs’ funding needs and the availability of bank loans   especially in those countries where SMEs report significant problems in   accessing finance.      There are currently some signs of more aggressive competition for banks from   shadow lenders. This may imply that some SME loans are now being funded by   lightly regulated or unregulated shadow banks which may not be a desired   outcome for regulators.      In closing SMEs’ financing gap  another option is that publicsector or market  based entities e.g. lend directly to SMEs or provide guarantees for SME loans.   Public initiatives are extensive in the countries that we focus on. In   Germany  the range of public support schemes for SMEs is markedly diversified   and may fundamentally lower SMEs’ funding risk. In France  newly introduced   public institutions also offer a diversified range of financial support. In Italy and   Spain  public support for SMEs is on a strong upward trend which is of particular   relevance considering the overwhelmingly large share of micro firms in these   countries. For public intervention to be effective and efficient  private sector   involvement is crucial. Direct government lending or loan guarantees could   result in significant costs to taxpayers and even hurt healthy and creditworthy   SMEs by channelling funds towards firms that are politically better connected. In   addition  public initiatives should be coordinated and harmonised within   countries and beyond to avoid excessive bureaucracy and competitive   distortions.     A number of marketbased initiatives that allow direct access to equity and bond   markets have been launched in many European countries in recent years too.   These may help SMEs to diversify their funding sources by facilitating access to   external marketbased financing. Nonetheless  the uptake here has been mixed   so far and SME funding through the capital markets has yet to develop further.
