However  only since 2014 has the sector attracted the focused attention   of regulators  consumers and investors.

An evolutionary approach to create a framework of understanding is necessary to   understand the implications for established financial institutions  IT companies    startups and regulators alike.     FinTech Evolution and Typology     Evolution   FinTech is often seen today as the new marriage of financial services and information   technology. However  this interlinkage has a long history and has evolved over three   distinct time periods.

The 2008 GFC had a catalysing effect on the growth of the FinTech sector due to       • Postcrisis regulatory reforms   • Financing gap  Contraction of the interbank market (eg trust issues) and increase in   regulatory  capital  to  be  held  against  loan  portfolio  (eg  additional  +US$150bn  set   aside)     • Operational  cost  reduction   Downsizing  teams  (eg  IT  &  back/middle  office)  plus     using technology to reduce costs (e.g. straighttrough processing)     • Public perception  Growing distrust of formal financial institutions from the public     allowed new entrants to emerge (eg UK challenger banks  P2P or FX platforms)     • Technology   Smartphone  penetration   directly  providing  Point  of  Sales  (POS)  and     stored value systems to individuals  solving infrastructure mismatch            Comparison   Because  FinTech  is  a  contraction  of  the  words  “Financial”  and  “Technology”  it   encompasses a range of actors which can all be classified as FinTech companies.

Better to break down highlevel approaches (e.g. risk or productbased) and   complement them with a subset of specific regulations (eg payments  AML).      Broadly speaking  financial regulators have 4 main mandates                  Prudential   Regulation     Financial    Stability          Conduct & Fairness     Competition &   Development     Regulatory implications   Many  startups  use  technology  to  disintermediate  banks  and  directly  propose  their   services or products to consumers (eg Telco providing payment services).      This creates a set of questions       •           • How  to  balance  startup  low  cost  models  and  agility  benefits  with  compliance       Who  can/should  provide  financial  services  or  products?  (eg  Telcos  or   Banks)     Increasingly a blurred line           costs?       Banking  licence  restrictions  limits  business  model  freedom  (eg  mobile     money balance acting as a current account)           Regulatory threshold   New  emerging  FinTech  companies  often  have  limited  track  records  regarding  their   business  (eg  risk  management   liquidity  and  profitability)  and  difficulty  identifying   their obligations (eg applicable regulations or licences).      For  regulators   these  earlystage  companies  represent  a   limited  prudential  &   consumer  risk.  However   exponential  company  growth  can  create  “risk  blind  spots”.   Additionally  frequent failures or fraud can impact market or investor confidence.        Too Small   to Care     Tacit acceptance      Too Large   to Ignore     Licensing obligation      Too Big   to     Fail     Risk blindspots   Using size (eg small  large  systemic) as a way to evaluate risk is not adequate  given   interconnectedness  of  financial  markets  and  rapid  uptake  of  certain  financial   products.  Today   some  small  companies’  path  to  become  systemic  is  not  linear  but   exponential       • Kenya (2008)  In three years Mpesa was being used by over 18 million customers     and 43% of Kenya’s GDP was flowing thru this service             • China  (2014)   Third  party  mobile  payment  market  reached  1 433  trillion  yuan   a     +400% increase compared to 278 trillion exchanged in 2013     • China (2014)  Yu’e Bao  a money market fund part of Ant Financial Group (Alibaba)   held  over  US$  90billion  (e.g.  4th  largest  in  the  world)  just  10  months  after  its   creation          New risks   New business models and delivery mechanisms create new sets of risks       • P2P platform capital buffers during credit cycle change or interest rate liberalisation      2.5% deposits vs 15% P2P lenders (eg warning over 1 250 platforms in China)     • Money Market Fund (MMF) maturity mismatch enhanced by technology      Technology facilitation of ondemand redemptions (eg “mobile app bank run”)        • Liquidity problems for mobile money agents to meet large withdrawal requests    Can undermine public confidence  but also slows scalability of the solution      Scalability of process  policies and risk management frameworks    Particularly  for  companies  with  exponential  growth  (eg  loan  origination     •    quality)     Regulatory innovation   Since 2008  national and international regulators have been focused  on drafting and   implementing  reactive  regulations  covering  the  causes  of  the  GFC  to  avoid  its   repetition.  However   the  increased  layering  of  regulations  and  compliance  cost   facilitated the emergence of new FinTech startups.       There is nonetheless a set of proactive regulations emerging to allow for innovative   businesses propositions to emerge  eg       • US  Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act 2012 (JOBS Act)  Alternative financing   • EU  Payment System Directive 2008  Realtime payments   • UK  Small Business  Enterprise and Employment Bill  Loan referral to P2P   • HK   Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP) Automated bill payments     Institutional change   Regulatory supervision by specialist bodies focused on products appears inadequate   when looking at the rate of technological progress. This can  create grey areas as to   which  body  should  be  regulating  a  specific  business  (eg  insurance  companies   performing banking activities in the US pre2007).      Thus  financial innovation driven by technology is preferably overseen in the context of   a  twin  peaks  /  functional  model  such  as  in  the  UK  or  Australia.  This  is  particularly   relevant in jurisdictions that have more a sectoral approach.      Product Based Approach     Vs     Functional Based Approach     (eg United States  China  Hong Kong)     (eg United Kingdom  Australia)     Recent approaches in Asia   Unlike US and EU where FinTech sector emergence was driven by the private sector   first  in Asia governments and regulators are often seeking to lead            e  s  a  h  P     s  s  e  n  e  r  a  w  A    Singapore     Involvement with FinTech   Accelerator + consultation     Australia     ASIC creates Innovation   Hub      Hong Kong     SFC on the government   FinTech Steering Group     South Korea      Simplifying retail banking    licence for tech firms     New Zealand     Lifting investment criteria's   for equity crowdfunding     China     Comprehensive strategy          e  s  a  h  P  e  v  i  t  a         l  s  i  g  e  L    “Big data’ regulatory online reporting and analytics  among other technologies   could  create  a  new   generation of  UK regulatory technology (RegTech)”     RegTech   Blackett  Report  (UK)  government  recognizes  the  new  challenges  but  also  opportunities   brought by the FinTech sector.
