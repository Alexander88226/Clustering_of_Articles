In this article   I survey ten areas in which ﬁntech is poised to deliver high value to ﬁrms  markets  and  regulators. Much of this value is created through the use of machine learning technology   big data and cloud computing  and cryptographic methods.    Fintech refers to various ﬁnancial technologies used to automate processes in the ﬁnancial  sector  from routine  manual tasks to nonroutine  cognitive decision making. Various areas of  ﬁnance are subject to disruption  such as payment systems  contract checking  trading  risk  management  quantitative asset management  lending  mobile banking  customer retention   and investment banking. Annual ﬁntech ﬁnancing in 2018 was $112 billion  comprised of  2 196 deals  doubling over that of the previous year (2017  $51 billion).1 Figure 1 presents  one representation of the ﬁntech landscape.    Fintech may be characterized by technological change in three broad areas of ﬁnance   (1) raising capital  (2) allocating capital  and (3) transferring capital. Fintech is disrupting  all three. For example  payment systems eﬃciently transfer capital. Firms such as Com  monBond (https //commonbond.co/) are using technology to revolutionize how capital is  supplied. Likewise  roboadvising platforms are changing the way capital is allocated.    Deﬁnition  Fintech is any technology that eliminates or reduces  the costs of ﬁnancial intermediation.    Deﬁnitions of ﬁntech vary depending on source  and the deﬁnition here is a general ap  proach to capturing the main ﬂavor of what is currently understood as ﬁntech. For example   the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) deﬁnes ﬁntech in credit to “broadly include all  credit activity facilitated by electronic (online) platforms that are not operated by commer  cial banks” (see BIS Quarterly Review  September 2018  p. 31).    What is the longrun driver for ﬁntech as a disruptor? The main factor is the high cost  of ﬁnancial intermediation. This has historically always been so. In an interesting study     1https //assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/02/thepulseoffintech2018.pdf    2    Figure 1. The ﬁntech landscape. These “lumascape” diagrams show a sampling of a business  domain and ﬁrms within it. https //pbs.twimg.com/media/CYOHdfgW8AERjdO.png    Figure 2. The cost of ﬁnancial intermediation has held steady at 2% over time. Source  Philippon  (2016).    3    Figure 3. Employment in the ﬁnancial sector has increased its share from 5.0% to 6.5% in the  last two decades. Source  Philippon (2016).    Philippon (2016) shows that the average cost of intermediation has held steady at around  2% of transaction amounts. Figure 2 shows that this cost has hovered around this level  since 1880 until current times  for an astonishingly extended period of more than a century.  While one may speculate about the reasons for this high cost of ﬁnancial intermediation   such as lack of competition on the supply side  or ignorance of consumers on the demand  side  the fact remains that these rents accruing to large ﬁnancial institutions are now ripe  for the picking by smaller  agile  ﬁntech players. Technology is often a cheaper intermediary  and a driver of competition. Over the last two decades  employment in the ﬁnancial sector  has expanded from 5% to 6.5% of the workforce  as shown in Figure 3. Fintech may very  likely reduce this number dramatically.    Fintech applications range from simple automation to complex decision making. Many  rely on big data  and necessitate investments in cloud infrastructure and analytics. Success  ful ﬁntech applications display some common characteristics. First  it is valuable to develop  models from a theoretical foundation before bringing in data. This helps both in preparing  the data based on extant theory  and makes interpretation of the results facile as they are  seen from the backdrop of a theoretical foundation. For example  automated lending models    4    are based on a theoretical foundation of ﬁnancial concepts  such as leverage  and customer  behavior  which suggests the econometric speciﬁcation for the data. The variables used in  the model  denoted as “features” in machine learning (ML) models are better chosen using  theoretical ideas  especially when causal models are intended. Second  sharp deﬁnition of the  problem statement is critical—the question is primary and data is secondary. To consider  the problem of lending again  there are many diﬀerent ﬁrms with varied oﬀerings  as may be  seen in Figure 1. What diﬀerentiates them from one another is the speciﬁc pain point in the  lending process that they seek to ameliorate. Any entrant in this congested area of ﬁntech  must sharply deﬁne the niche problem it is solving so as to create a unique value proposition.  Third  many ﬁntech oﬀerings confront big data and computational bottlenecks. They face  problems with data extraction  integration  curation  quality  and analytics. How well these  are handled will determine the success of a ﬁntech venture. For a detailed description of these  issues  see Alexander et al. (2017). Fourth  ﬁntech tends to be multidisciplinary  calling for  teams that cut across many ﬁelds. A case in point is roboadvising  where an amalgama  tion of experience from portfolio management  behavioral ﬁnance  user interface design  risk  management  legal aspects of consumer ﬁnance  and so forth  are all required. Another  example is in cryptocurrencies  where specialized knowledge of cryptography  monetary sys  tems  payment methods  distributed computing  and so on  come into play. Applications  that are based on natural language processing also entail many diﬀerent sorts of expertise in  linguistics  computer science  artiﬁcial intelligence (AI)  and economics. ML and analytics  ﬁgure prominently in many ﬁntech applications. Table 1 is a sampling of areas in which  large banks may beneﬁt from ﬁntechimplemented analytics.    The incredible eﬀectiveness of ML in ﬁntech relies on advances in computational algo  rithms  such as matrix factorization  deep learning  classiﬁcation methods  and so forth   and a proliferation of special purpose hardware (cloud platforms  graphics processing units  [GPUs]  etc.) that exploit vast quantities of data. The conﬂuence of these scientiﬁc develop  ments has led to huge advantages for ﬁrms that have invested in ML technologies. Figure  4 shows that the performance of hedge funds that use ML outstrips that of funds that do  not.    5    Table 1.

In a recent paper  Srinivasan (2016) states that as of 2015   Ernst & Young reports that there were 1 400 ﬁntech ﬁrms  with more than $33 billion in  funding. In comparison  credit card fraud accounted for $31 billion in losses in a year. There  fore  even small improvements in just this area will generate substantial value compared to  the investments being made in ﬁntech. Furthermore  modern hardware  cloud infrastructure   and software tools have made possible the rapid development of sophisticated ﬁntech plat  forms by very small teams  enabling entrants with minimal funding to compete in this space.  Rapid development also has a dark side. Lo (2017)  p. 17  points out that “the unintended  consequences of technologyleveraged ﬁnance include ﬁresales  ﬂash crashes  botched initial  public oﬀerings  cybersecurity breaches  catastrophic algorithmic trading errors  and a tech  nological arms race that has created new winners  losers  and systemic risk in the ﬁnancial  ecosystem.” He suggests a strong focus on robust technology to manage this problem.    The distribution of ﬁntech is naturally uneven. Interestingly  one of the countries with  high adoption rates for ﬁntech is Hong Kong  with the United States coming second  followed  by Singapore. The Chinese government is now one of the biggest spenders on deep learning  technologies.    In the following sections  I present a taxonomy of ten areas where I expect ﬁntech to  grow rapidly and act as both an innovation and disruption. Such a taxonomy is also useful  in designing academic curricula for ﬁntech. After these discussions  we will explore the  use of ML  AI  and deep learning through some use case examples. These examples will  also highlight the tremendous advance in ML technology that has made these disruptions  possible. In the ensuing sections  we will examine some of the ideas and underpinnings of  various uses of mathematics and computer science  married with economic models in the  space of Fintech solutions.    7    I Machine Learning  Artiﬁcial Intelligence  and Deep    Learning    As described in Culkin and Das (2017)  AI has come of age through implementing “deep  learning” neural networks2 because of the conﬂuence of three important factors  (1) the  eﬃcacy of mathematical analysis for calibrating neural nets; (2) improvements in hardware  and software that allow very large (deep) neural nets to be computed eﬃciently; and (3) the  availability of big data with which to train these models. Deep learning models have been  proven to uncover subtle nonlinearities in data that are not discoverable using standard   more or less  linear econometric models. These models implement pattern recognition to  high levels of accuracy. By casting ﬁnance problems as pattern recognition problems  we  are able to avail of higher predictability than before. We can also use deep learning to  train pricing models from data on inputs and prices in the markets  bypassing the need for  theoretical models  such as those used for option pricing. In the words of Peter Norvig  “All  models are wrong  and increasingly you can succeed without them.” He makes the case that  data are the new theory.3    In order to explore this idea  we revisit work from the 1990s. Hutchinson  Lo  and  Poggio (1994) explored using neural nets to learn the Black and Scholes (1973) option pricing  formula  also developed by Merton (1973). In Culkin and Das (2017)  they created data for  the assessment of how a deep neural net would learn this equation  by randomly simulating  a range of call option prices. The data were divided into two random sets  one for training   and the other for validation. Before passing the prices to the deep learning net  the data  were normalized by exploiting a facet of the BlackScholes call option function—that is   that the pricing function is linear homogeneous in (S  K)  i.e.  C(S  K) = K · C(S/K  1).  2A neural net is a highly nonlinear ﬁtting model made up of several simple nested nonlinear functions  that take inputs and train them to generate a discrete or continuous output  through training on large data  sets. Neural nets are used  for example  in natural language translation  and in autonomous vehicles. This is  a very simplistic deﬁnition of neural nets  and nets with several tens of layers are known as “deeplearning”  nets.    3https //www.wired.com/2008/06/pbtheory/    8    Figure 5. Call option pricing errors from the ﬁtted deep learning neural net. Source  Culkin and  Das (2017).    Therefore     C(S  K)/K = C(S/K  1).    The data were normalized by dividing both stock price S and call price C by strike price  K. These normalized data were applied to the deep learning net to ﬁt the input variables  S  K  T  q  r  and σ (the feature set) to the output prices C. The outofsample root mean  squared error (RMSE) is 0.0112  with an average error of ±1% of the strike. The percentage  pricing error (error divided by option price) is 0.0421—that is  4% on average. The distri  bution of pricing errors is shown in Figure 5. A regression of the model values on the true  values has very high R2 = 0.9982.    Culkin and Das (2017) also found that with the exception of very small option prices   where the percentage error tends to be magniﬁed  moneyness is not correlated with pricing  error.    This simple example supports Norvig’s assertion that ML has the potential to replace  theoretically derived models with datadriven models. AI and ML models are now being  implemented widely across the ﬁnancial services industry. Here are some examples. Bridge  water Associates  the world’s largest hedge fund  has a project to automate decision making  to save time and eliminate human emotion volatility.4 Goldman Sachs now has 2 out of 600    4https //www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/    bridgewaterassociatesaiartificialintelligencemanagement    9    equity traders left in one part of its business. It found that a few traders can be replaced by  one computer engineer.5 It is estimated that by 2020  at least 5% of all economic transactions  will be handled by autonomous software.6    AI will process payment functions and learn from customer behaviors  through Intelligent  Payments Management (IPM). The potential savings are huge  AI will help consumers make  daily ﬁnancial decisions and monitor spending. New personal ﬁnancial management apps  use contextual awareness  which measures spending habits and online footprints to create  personalized advice. Combining pooled ﬁnancial data with end user control to oﬀer tailor  made services is a classic AI solution that we should expect to see plenty of. Algorithms  will automatically mine customer data and undertake crossselling of ﬁnancial products.  Automation of cognitive tasks is now occurring rapidly. For example  J.P. Morgan has a  software called COIN that interprets commercial loan agreements and has resulted in a  saving of 360 000 hours of lawyer time.7    There are several interesting applications under way. In the retail banking arena  Mizuho  Financial Group sent Pepper  its humanoid robot into its Tokyo branch to handle customer  inquiries.8 They partnered with IBM to enable Pepper to understand human emotions   and build interaction into apps. The Royal Bank of Scotland is trial testing Luvo AI  a  customer service assistant  to interact with staﬀ and customers.9 AXA (the insurer) has an  appbased bot called Xtra  which engages in bespoke conversations with customers about  healthy living.10 AI is used in peertopeer (p2p) lending.11 The role of chatbots in changing  the interface with banking customers is growing rapidly.12    5http //www.zerohedge.com/news/20170213    /goldmanhad600cashequitytraders2000itnowhas2    6http //www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartnerpredictsourdigitalfuture/  7https //futurism.com/    anaicompleted360000hoursoffinanceworkinjustseconds/    8https //www.mizuhobank.com/mizuho_fintech/news/pepper/index.html  9http //www.businessinsider.com/    royalbankofscotlandlaunchesaichatbotluvousingibmwatson20169?r=UK&IR=T&IR=T    10https //www.thedigitalinsurer.com/dia/    xtrabyaxaaidrivenpersonalwellnesscoachingapp/    11http //www.nanalyze.com/2017/04/aifintechstartupsloansnewcredit/  12https //www.americanbanker.com/news/    thisishowfinancialserviceschatbotsaregoingtoevolve    10    AI is also permeating the operations of hedge funds. BlackRock is replacing human stock  pickers with machine algorithms  using deep learning neural nets  as described earlier.13  Sentient Technologies is a hedge fund run entirely using AI.14 It is supposed to have a  secret algorithm with adaptive learning that uses thousands of machines. Numerai is a  hedge fund that makes trades by aggregating trading algorithms submitted by anonymous  contributors; prizes are awarded in cryptocurrency called Numeraire  which reside on the  Ethereum blockchain.15 Numerai opensources transformed big data  which is not revealed in  pure form because it scrambles the data using homomorphic encryption  a form of encryption  where the data can be used for pattern recognition and analysis without being able to extract  any original information from them.    A skeptical viewpoint is that there are very little data about the track record of these  AIdriven hedge funds  as the business remains secretive. It is also argued that such funds  will fail because investors will remain reluctant to turn over their money completely to a  machine. Yet  this is being disproved by the little data we have. Figure 4 shows that funds  using ML outperform others quite handily. And money is marching into AIdriven funds  as  Numerai Fund 1 LP raised more than $1 million in short order.16    Does the fact that hedge funds are successfully beating the market imply an unanticipated  failure of market eﬃciency? In order to explore this proposition  Das Mokashi  and Culkin  (2018) conducted a simple experiment using pattern recognition. Employing deep learning  neural nets  they trained an algorithm on data from all stocks in the S&P 500 index  and  attempted to predict  using a lookback number of days (e.g.  30  60  90 days)  the direction  of movement (up or down) in the index the following day. Undertaking diﬀerent experiments   the results  using daily data from 1963  show that it is diﬃcult to train an algorithm to guess  the sign of the index return with marginally betterthantheaverage up days in the markets    13http //fortune.com/2017/03/30/    blackrockrobotslayoffsartificialintelligenceaihedgefund/    14https //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentient_Technologies As of 2016  it is the most wellfunded AI    15https //numer.ai/  16https //www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1667103/000166710316000002/xslFormDX01/    company.    primary_doc.xml    11    (52.7%). Accuracy levels are low and suggest that  even with a greatly expanded information  set  markets are still eﬃcient. The availability of data and opensource software packages  such as TensorFlow make such tests of market eﬃciency easy to run. Indeed  this is probably  one of the ﬁrst tests of market eﬃciency  where the conditioning information set is as large  as all stocks in the S&P 500 index.    II Network Models  Fintech for Systemic Risk Mod    eling    In this section  I explore how graph theory is being applied to understanding the risks of the  ﬁnancial system  also known as “systemic” risk. Systemic risk has some universally accepted  characteristics. It is a risk that has (1) a large impact  (2) is widespread  and (3) creates a  ripple eﬀect that endangers the viability of the economic system.    Systemic risk is an attribute of the economic system and not that of a single entity.  Its measurement should have two important features  (1) quantiﬁability—it must be mea  surable on an ongoing basis and (2) decomposability—aggregate systemwide risk may be  broken down into risk contributions from all ﬁnancial entities in the system. Financial in  stitutions (FIs) that have large risk contributions to aggregate systemic risk may be deemed  “systemically important.”    The DoddFrank Act of 2010 and Basel III regulations characterize a systemically risky  FI as one that is (1) large  (2) complex  (3) interconnected  and (4) critical—that is  provides  hardtosubstitute services to the economy. Failure of such an institution is potentially dis  ruptive to the ﬁnancial system. The DoddFrank Act does not oﬀer quantiﬁcation speciﬁcs.    Recently  Das (2016) proposed a metric for systemic risk that has both the attributes of  system risk  captures the features of systemically important FIs  and is consistent with the  three universal characteristics of systemic risk. In order to accurately characterize systemic  risk  graph theory is used  and a network of banks is constructed. To see an example of this    12    network construction  see Burdick et al. (2011)  where text analytics was used to extract  interbank loan transactions from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) ﬁlings  and  construct a colending network of money ﬂows between banks. Coupling this interconnect  edness information with credit quality information from banks leads to a new measure of  systemic risk  that has attractive properties  as formalized in Das  Kim  and Ostrov (2019).  There is now a vast literature speaking to this problem  as in papers by EspinosaVega and  Sole (2010)  Billio et al. (2012)  ChanLau et al. (2018)  to cite just a few. It takes a careful  combination of graph theory and economics  using large quantities of data  to generate a  single metric for measuring systemic risk. The requirement to do this in real time makes this  a particularly interesting ﬁntech problem. For example  downloading and text mining all  SEC ﬁlings relating to interbank loans in order to visualize the interbank lending network is  an especially interesting problem  requiring terabytes of data combined with graph theory.  See Figure 6 for the networks plotted on an annual basis for 2005  and for 2006–2009.    The mathematics for this model in its stochastic form are created by generalizing the  Merton (1974) singleﬁrm credit risk model. This extended model derived in Das  Kim   and Ostrov (2019) allows us to construct stochastic risk networks in a structural credit risk  modeling framework. The model’s data are standard Merton model inputs for each ﬁrm     • Equity price = s = {s1  s2  ...  sn}  • Equity volatility = σ = {σ1  σ2  ...  σn}  • Number of shares = m = {m1  m2  ...  mn}  • Riskfree rate = r    The model variables are all derived from the Merton model)     • n = number of banks in the system    • a = nvector with components ai that represent the assets in bank i (derived from    s  σ  m  r).    13    2005    Figure 6. Lending networks between banks for ﬁve years  2005–2009 (Source  Burdick et al  2011).    14    2005$Ci'group$Inc.$J.P.$Morgan$Chase$Bank$of$America$Corp.$2006	   2007	   2008	   2009	   • λ = nvector with components λi that represent the average yearly chance of bank i    defaulting (from s  σ  r).    • E = n × n matrix with components Eij that represent the probability that if bank j  defaults  it will cause bank i to default (from s  σ  r). This matrix represents the risk  connectedness of the banks.    The following calculations lead to a single metric for systemic risk that captures both  inter  connectedness and credit quality of all banks. Deﬁne c to be an nvector with components  ci that represent bank i’s credit risk. More speciﬁcally  I deﬁne    c = a (cid 12) λ     where (cid 12) represents component multiplication (the Hadamard product)—that is  ci = aiλi.  The aggregate systemic risk created by the n banks in the system is    √    R =    c> · E · c  1>a         (1)    where 1 is an nvector of ones  so the denominator 1>a = nP    ai represents the total assets    i=1    in the n banks. We note that r is linear homogenous in λ.    The metric developed has four valuable properties  derived in Das  Kim  and Ostrov    (2019)     1. All other things being equal  R should be minimized by dividing risk equally among  the n ﬁnancial institutions  and maximized by putting all the risk into one institution.    2. R should increase as the ﬁnancial institutions become more interconnected.    3. If all the assets  ai  are multiplied by a common factor  α > 0  it should have no eﬀect    on R.    4. Substanceless partitioning of a bank into two banks should have no eﬀect on R.    15    Implementation of this simple system on a largescale across all banks is an interesting  challenge in the ﬁntech space.    The metric also leads to other useful metrics  which are easy to compute. The metric  R is linear homogeneous in λ. Let α be any scalar constant. If we replace λ with αλ  it  immediately follows that c is replaced by αc  and  by the equation for R  we see that R is  replaced by αR.    We can also calculate the sensitivity of R to changes in λ  Diﬀerentiating our equation    for R with respect to λ    ∂R  ∂λ    = 1  2    a (cid 12) [(E + ET)c]    √  cTEc    1Ta    whose components represent the sensitivity of R to changes in each bank’s value of λ. This    is the basis of risk decomposition  equal to D = (cid 16) ∂R    (cid 17)  a vector containing each bank’s    ∂λ (cid 12) λ    contribution to R.    A version of this model was implemented in India  with support from the Reserve Bank  of India. Metrics may be produced daily. More details are presented in Das (2016)  and for  illustration Figure 7 shows the Indian network  systemic score S  and risk decomposition D.  The metric is therefore easy to implement and oﬀers a realtime systemic risk management  tool for regulators.    Using publicly derived data for the U.S. banking system  Das  Kim  and Ostrov (2019)  also calculated the top risky banks and top risky links (Figure 8). On the technical side   we have 3D visualizations of ﬁnancial networks that support better decision making using  graph databases such as neo4j.17    III Personal and Consumer Finance    Households are consumers and allocators of capital. On the consumption side  they borrow  money to ﬁnance consumption and investments in capital assets. They also earn incomes     17https //neo4j.com/users/kineviz/    16    Figure 7. Network of banks in India and risk decomposition  December 3  2015 (Source  Das   2016).    generate savings  and allocate their wealth into various asset classes.    In recent times  households have faced several hurdles in the consumptioninvestment  cycle. First  asset returns have become exceedingly low  and this has made retirement targets  more elusive. For older investors  who rely on safe income streams after completing their  work lives  decent riskfree returns are no longer available  as riskfree interest rates have  dropped to near zero. Further  risk premiums on speculative assets have seemingly shrunk   though there are diﬀerences of opinion on the expected equity risk premium. Second  medical  advances have made longevity risk severe. There are heightened concerns about senior  citizens outliving their savings. Third  there is substantial volatility risk when reaching  for yield. Seeking higher returns in alternative asset classes comes with substantial risk  not  just in the second moment of returns but also from the presence of negative skewness and  excess kurtosis. Fourth  whereas riskadjusted returns keep falling  highcost providers of  ﬁnancial services have retained their pricing schedules. As shown in Figure 2  the average  unit cost of ﬁnancial intermediation is 2%. Fifth  inequality is also rising  and the ﬁnancial  system operates adversely against the poor  in a growing cycle of bias (Piketty  2014). The  share of income of the top decile of the population has grown from 35% in the 1940s to  around 50% today. These factors scream out for a ﬁntech solution to raise riskadjusted  returns so that investors may seek a less anxious retirement  with lower costs and inequality.    17    Panel 1  Most systemically risky banks    Panel 2  Most risky links    Figure 8.

Source  Das  Kim  and Ostrov (2019).    18    Various ﬁntech initiatives are addressing these issues. Roboadvising now enables in  vestors to use technology to place their money in welldiversiﬁed asset pools at much lower  cost  while oﬀering solutions to the retirement problem. Firms such as Wealthfront (www.  wealthfront.com) and Betterment (www.betterment.com) are cutting out highcost retire  ment providers using technology  while also educating naive  small investors. They have  been followed by the major players  such as Vanguard and Schwab. On the lending side   we have better credit models that enable ﬁrms to segment customers whose FICO scores  otherwise excluded them from accessing ﬁnancing. Not all subpar FICO scores come from  lowquality borrowers  and the ability to tease out the subset that might be of better quality  oﬀers ﬁntech lenders an opportunity to open up a new lending sector. Interesting approaches  are explored in this space  for example  social media interactions are used to identify good  customers  as in Wei et al. (2016). Digital footprints may be used to assess individual default  risk  as shown in Berg et al. (2019). Friendship networks may be exploited in peerlending  schemes  as demonstrated in Lin  Prabhala  and Viswanathan (2013). Firms such as PayAc  tiv18 are disintermediating the payday lending market  dropping the costs of borrowing by  around 90%. Big data helps remove biases that often arise with small data  and these may be  eliminated as discussed in Chowdhry  Das  and HartmanGlaser (2016). However  big data  needs to be handled carefully  as biases within may end up permeating ﬁntech algorithms  (O’Neill  2016). Overall  consumer ﬁnance is ripe for new  refreshing improvements  driven  by ﬁntech innovation.    IV Nowcasting    Forecasting has traditionally been a punctuated process with annual or  at best  quarterly  forecasts. Macroeconomic forecasts are rarely able to use current data  as statistics for gross  domestic product (GDP)  inﬂation  unemployment  and so forth  are usually available only  with a lag. Moreover  these reported statistics are often updated and corrected over time   so they are being revised just as they are being used to make forecasts. This is a shifting    18www.payactiv.com    19    Figure 9. Accuracy of forecasts made by the GDPNow model  as a function of the nearness of the  date of GDP statistics release. Source  Higgins (2014).    target  comprised of very lowfrequency data.    The availability of new sources of almost streaming time series that are correlated with  macroeconomic data has opened up the possibility that forecasting may be undertaken at  high frequency in real time. This approach is known as nowcasting and has been gaining  popularity as a new area in ﬁntech.    The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has implemented a nowcasting system known as  GDPNow (Higgins  2014). This model forecasts GDP growth by aggregating 13 subcomponents  of the GDP with a chainweighting methodology used by the U.S. Bureau of Economic  Analysis. The model beats other forecasting approaches and delivers more timely forecasts.  Figure 9 shows that the forecasts become more and more accurate as the date of the GDP  number release nears. For a survey of nowcasting methods  see Bańbura et al. (2013).    Nowcasting generally involves combining data of diﬀerent frequencies to create as high  frequency a forecast as possible  see Giannone  Reichlin  and Small (2008). In this sense   it is akin to ensemble modeling  where diﬀerent data are combined to improve prediction  accuracy. In Aastveita et al. (2014)  U.S. realtime data are used to produce combined density  nowcasts of quarterly GDP growth  based on a system of three commonly used model classes.    20    Nowcasts are updated whenever new information is released. Combined density nowcasts  always perform well relative to the model classes in terms of both logarithmic scores and  calibration tests. The density combination approach performs more eﬀectively than standard  approaches.    Another facet of nowcasting is the creation of realtime indices that are nontraded. Of  course  for traded indices  the process of trading itself generates the indicators of value in  real time. But  for nontraded indices  nowcasting using other traded variables and streaming  data is feasible. For example  Chacko  Das  and Fan (2016) provide a theoretical model in  which it is possible to generate an illiquidity index from any market sector for which an  exchangetraded fund (ETF) exists. In this model  liquidity in any market sector is modeled  as a set of options related to immediacy of trading. When immediacy is hard to come by in  illiquid markets  the option to trade perforce has higher value. Converting this option value  into basis points delivers the price of liquidity as a trading spread. The model is easy to  implement and requires only two inputs at any point in time—the price of the ETF and the  net asset value (NAV) of its underlying holdings  both of which are reported daily by ETFs.  The formula for the illiquidity index is as follows     BILLIQ = −10  000 × ln    "    #    N AV    N AV + |ET F − N AV |    (2)    where N AV is the net asset value of the exchange traded fund and ET F is its price. In liquid  markets  both ET F and N AV trade very close to each other. However  in illiquid markets  it  is easier to trade the ETF rather than the underlying components (i.e.  the NAV). Therefore   the two diverge in price  and the formula above picks up this diﬀerence and converts it into  a basis points spread.    Inﬂation forecasting has leapfrogged traditional Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicators  that have been criticized for two reasons. One  they are delayed and infrequent  and two   they are often based on outdated baskets of goods and therefore  do not represent current  inﬂation levels. Using easily scraped prices from internet shopping sites  various eﬀorts    21    are under way to create realtime inﬂation indices. The Billion Prices project at MIT is a  fascinating example of this new phenomenon.19    These examples suggest that the future of nowcasting is a direct consequence of the  growing availability of streaming data  and the technologies that enable its use. These  platforms will eventually provide feature sets that will form the kernel of deep learning  trading systems considered in Section I.    V Cybersecurity and Clandestine Fintech    People trust ﬁnancial institutions to keep their wealth and information secure. They also  trust banks to operate responsibly  but that impression of trust erodes with every ﬁnancial  crisis. The increasingly digital manifestation of banks has opened them up to hacking  and  the nature of theft has changed dramatically. No longer is information security a matter of  simply maintaining a good ﬁrewall. Rogue agents  in both digital and human form  reside  deep inside bank systems  and chief information security oﬃcers (CISOs) at banks no longer  assume that their ﬁrewalls are failsafe. PwC (2014) reports that 45% of ﬁnancial sector  companies experience crime versus an average of 34% in other industries.    Cyberthreats to ﬁnancial institutions may be categorized into three major forms. First   threats come from stateorganized actors. The news is replete with fact and conjecture about  the role of statesponsored hacking. Second  organized crime has discovered that hacking is  a source of easy proﬁts  at much less risk. When you can break and enter and loot assets or  information without leaving the comfort of your home  it’s easy to see why criminals see this  as a far better (often transnational) enterprise than oldstyle smash and grab.20 Cybercrime  has resulted in stealing information as in the wellknown scandal involving Target.21 The  “Bangladesh Bank cyber heist” in February 2016 entailed ﬁve fake money transfers through    19http //www.thebillionpricesproject.com/  20Despite this  physical bank robberies remain numerous; the FBI reported 3 033 in 2018  down from 4 251    in 2016. See https //www.fbi.gov/investigate/violentcrime/bankrobbery.    21The cyber breach of Target resulted in the theft of information of 40 million customers. See  http     //www.reuters.com/article/ustargetbreachidUSBRE9BH1GX20131219.    22    the SWIFT network  totaling $101 million  of which only $38 million was recovered.22 The  bank’s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was hacked  and the thefts were  traced to Sri Lanka and the Philippines  evidence that cybercrime in the ﬁnancial sector  operates easily on a global scale. The third actor in ﬁnancial cybercrime is rogue bank  employees. These are sleeper agents who gain access to servers as employees and wait for an  opportune moment to operationalize their malicious intent. Internal bank security systems  are being geared up to detect suspicious activity inside ﬁrewalls.    The recent dissemination of cybersecurity protocols by the SANS Institute has laid the  groundwork for a formalized approach. The essential idea is that there are 20 Critical  Security Controls (CSCs) that may be measured  and then aggregated into a cybersecurity  score.23 This score may now be integrated into a bank’s risk management practices. Figure  10 shows the diﬀerent CSCs and the overall framework (upper panel). It also shows the  various tools that are widely used to manage compliance with the CSCs (lower panel).    Financial cybercrime has been detailed in popular books. Poulsen (2011) recounts how a  hacker in the U.S.  Max Butler  stole 1.8 million credit card accounts from two Russian crime  syndicates  and was eventually caught by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). (This  was lucky for him  as he may easily have fallen into the hands of the Russians  who might  have meted out a much worse sentence than the 13 years Butler received.) Menn (2010) tells  the tale of a dyslexic young Californian who worked with the Feds to counteract hacking and  ﬁnancial ransom by the Russian mob and the maﬁa. It also describes how U.K.’s cybercrime  units proved to be eﬀective against Russian hackers. In the area of cybercrime in ﬁnance   fact reads like thriller ﬁction.    Finally  a discussion of ﬁnancial cybercrime would be incomplete without mentioning the  role of the “dark web.” A large amount of clandestine ﬁntech occurs on the dark web  which  resides on the dark net—that is  networks on the web that require special handshaking soft  ware to connect servers (closed versus open protocols). Most of our normal daily experience    22https //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery  23https //www.sans.org/media/criticalsecuritycontrols/criticalcontrolsposter2016.    pdf    23    Figure 10. SANS Institute Critical Security Controls (CSCs)  shown in the top diagram. The bot  tom diagram shows the various tools used for compliance with the CSCs. See  https //www.sans.  org/media/criticalsecuritycontrols/criticalcontrolsposter2016.pdf.  See also  https //www.sans.org/securityresources/posters/20criticalsecuritycontrols/55/  download.    24    involves the complement of the dark net  i.e.  the clear net. The dark net is a subnet of the  internet where people connect servers to each other via private networks. The deep web is  a subset of the internet that is not indexable by search engines. While diﬀerent from the  dark web  there is some overlap of dark and deep webs. The role of the dark web is to make  agents who interact safe from detection—that is  it ensures anonymity and nontraceability  of the source of activities on the web. As one might imagine  money laundering relies heavily  on the dark net. For a detailed treatment of the dark net  see Bartlett (2014).    An example of the dark side of ﬁntech evolving on the dark net is the creation of “tum  blers ” which are services to hide the source of transactions in Bitcoin or other cryptocur  rencies. By sending transactions through a tumbler  one can mask origination. Tumblers  mix up transactions by acting as intermediaries and take a fee for doing so. These are al  gorithmic services  and may also be bundled automatically with some cryptocurrencies such  as Cloakcoin (appropriately named!). Because the blockchain is a public  distributed  and  immutable transaction ledger  it makes tracing a transaction possible  rather than otherwise.  It is the fact that it is decentralized and does not need a single recording agency who controls  transactions and can change rules at a whim that make it attractive. Contrary to popular  belief  it is because the blockchain does not guarantee anonymity  that the role of tumblers  has become widespread.    VI Fraud Detection and Prevention    An interesting aspect of ﬁnancial crime is that it mostly allows the perpetrators to be removed  from the scene of the crime. Online fraud is an excellent example of this phenomenon.  Much of credit card fraud now occurs on shopping sites  and the old business of making  copies of charge cards with stolen credit card numbers is quickly turning irrelevant.24 Much  of the fraud occurs in three ways  account takeovers  synthetic ID use  and business e  In  https //www.fbi.gov/filerepository/    24Despite the increase in cybercrime  bank robberies continue to occur at high rates.    there were more than 4 000 bank robberies     see     2016   bankcrimestatistics2016.pdf/view.    25    mail compromise  and the number of successful attempts has risen 34% from 2013 to 2016  (Hasham  Hayden  and Wavra  2018).    Online ﬁnancial fraud management begins with record keeping  and it is essential that  all online activity be logged so that traceback is possible. Strict authentication is important   too. Many ﬁnancial platforms are designed around multifactor authentication  as in the  popular twostep veriﬁcation implemented by many banks and asset management ﬁrms.  Endtoend encryption is necessary to prevent a maninthemiddle attack. Authentication  is implemented in many ways  using tokens  passwords  PIN codes  digital keys  biometrics   and so forth. Many digital wallets today embed multiple digital passwords  often three  and  can be unlocked with at least two of these  which oﬀers a high level of security.25    However  authentication is a futile process if someone has stolen information through a  data breach  because the authentication system will not detect a malicious use of validly  accessed data. Activity analysis is needed  and additional data might be brought to bear.  For example  stolen credit card numbers oﬀer an online thief full access to purchasing power   so they need to be detected through recognizing that an attempted purchase does not follow  the user’s standard behavior patterns. This is the realm in which ML has proven to be  extremely eﬀective  especially when alternative data are used. Solutions in this space come  from using social media to detect anomalous behavior  noticing diﬀerent devices  unexpected  patterns in email use  unusual locations of use of the credit card from standard ones  and  so on. This is also known as the ﬁeld of adaptive behavioral analytics  epitomized by ﬁrms  such as Bionym  EyeVerify  and BioCatch.26    As we have seen  the ﬁrst layer in fraud prevention is authentication  which is related  to cybersecurity. As is well known  this is proving to be a hard problem  as ﬁrewalls and  accounts are breached in large numbers. A second layer of fraud detection lies in using varied  25Sometimes these levels of security may be breached when hackers ﬁnd holes in the code for the wallet  application itself  as occurred in July 2017 in the case of the Parity wallet  see https //www.coindesk.com/  30millionetherreportedstolenparitywalletbreach/. About $30 million of Ether (ETH) was  stolen.    26See https //techcrunch.com/2015/08/23/    nextgencybersecurityisallaboutbehaviorrecognition/.    26    data and conducting behavioral analysis  which is not easy to do  and requires extensive  data curation. A third aspect of the problem lies in the diﬃculty of training ML algorithms  to detect fraud. Algorithms that use big data in fraud detection are trained on highly  imbalanced data sets. For example  detecting credit card fraud is fraught with imbalanced  categories. The rate of fraudulent transactions in this realm is ∼0.10%—that is  1 in  1 000 transactions is fraudulent  which means the data have 999 zeros for every 1 binary  outcome. Precision and recall are very diﬃcult to control in such data settings  and false  positives are rampant. These “anomaly detection” problems have been addressed through  new techniques such as topological data analysis (TDA)  popularized by the ﬁrm Ayasdi.27  Other techniques have been developed by ﬁrms such as Simility.28 Various ML techniques  are used from oversampling to boosting  to deep learning  to random forests. Overall  fraud  detection is addressed with an interesting cocktail of authentication  behavioral modeling   device monitoring  and anomaly detection using ML on big data.    VII Payment and Funding Systems    Digital payments have changed the way in which we move money around  but they have also  changed our concept of money. Starting with PayPal  we now exchange money on several  platforms  and bypass the banking system. Since then  we have many such services—for  example  Venmo  Apple Pay  Samsung Pay  Google Pay  Dwolla  and more.    This disintermediation takes many forms  but is leaving an electronic payment trail that  is making black markets nervous. See  for example  the recent demonetization of the 500  and 1 000 rupee notes in India. Transacting in cash was hampered  and millions were lost in  concealed currency hoards  mostly used for property transactions. However  it also gave rise  to new transacting systems  with digital payments  such as the Paytm platform. In 2015  the  Indian central bank gave Paytm authorization to open a payments bank  known as “Paytm  Payments Bank Limited”. As of writing  Paytm now has more than 250 million wallets in    27https //www.ayasdi.com/  28https //simility.com/    27    its transaction stream.    Another form of paymentsdriven disintermediation comes from disruption in the pay  day lending space from ﬁrms such as PayActiv.29 This ﬁrm works with employers to issue  advances against earned wages to lowincome employees  part of a package of oﬀerings that  reduces ﬁnancial stress for people who live from paycheck to paycheck. It is estimated that  of a U.S. workforce of approximately 130 million people who receive a paycheck  about two  thirds live from one pay cycle to the next and are unable to withstand temporary cash ﬂow  shocks. These people are victims of payday lenders who charge them annualized funding  rates of 400%–500%. Disintermediation by ﬁrms such as PayActiv results in driving those  borrowing costs down to onetenth or less.    The lending space is also being disintermediated by p2p markets. These electronic mar  kets connect individual lenders and borrowers directly  and because they bypass large insti  tutions that have high overheads  they have the opportunity to oﬀer cheaper loans. Interest  rates are set by the p2p platform through analysis of borrower data or through competi  tion among lenders using reverse auctions. Prosper30 is one of the oldest such platforms   operating for more than a decade.  It supports small loans  mostly less than $5 000  and  make extensive use of borrower data. Most p2p lending platforms include borrower/lender  anonymity  provide loan pricing support  oﬀer lenders autonomy in picking their borrowers   and allow for both  secured and unsecured lending. Administrative services such as record  ing  credit checking  and online automation are standard. Targeted lending using big data  and ML brings greater beneﬁts to lenders (Crespo  Naveira  and Kwon  2018).    Fintech also enables new venture ﬁnancing  through crowdfunding. Top sites for this are  GoFundMe 31 KickStarter 32 indiegogo 33 Kiva.34. Crowdfunding results in more than $35  billion of fundraising per year. The platforms usually take 5%–10% of the money raised    29https //www.payactiv.com/.  30https //www.prosper.com/.  31https //www.gofundme.com/  32https //www.kickstarter.com/  33https //grow.indiegogo.com/  34http //www.kiva.org/    28    as their fee  so in terms of proﬁt  this is at least a $1–$2 billion business. There may  also be a processing fee added  so this parallels underwriting fees charged by investment  banks. Payment system technologies represent one of the fastest growing areas of ﬁnancial  disintermediation  but their success will eventually depend on whether they are truly able  to oﬀer payment services at cost levels much below that of traditional players. These costs  will also be adapted through AIdriven pricing (Rizzi  Wang  and Zielinski  2018).    VIII Automated and HighFrequency Trading    Whereas ﬁntech is new terminology  highfrequency trading (HFT) has been around for a long  time  marking some of the ﬁrst hightech advances in ﬁnance. TradeWorx35 and Automated  Trading Desk (ATD  bought by Citibank for $680 million in 2007)  were pioneers in the ﬁeld.  Algorithmic trading now accounts for 50% of executed trades in the equity markets  down  from around twothirds of stock trades in the late 2000s. Estimates vary  of course  and  Aldridge and Krawciw (2017) estimate the share of market trading at closer to 40%. The  proﬁts from algorithmic trading are under competitive pressure and regulatory oversight.    There is a vast academic literature on HFT  and several debates surround this somewhat  undertheradar ﬁeld. Some of the highlights are as follows. First  since 2013  twothirds of  the top 30 cited papers on HFTs show positive market eﬀects from highfrequency traders.  Second  automated ﬁrms reduced trading costs and  contrary to popular opinion  improved  market depth and stability. Third  new research is possible because various forms of high  frequency  streaming ﬁntech data have become available. Tickbytick data sets are now much  more prevalent  and ﬁrms are working with academics much more closely than in the past.  Fourth  there is now evidence that HFTs stabilize markets (Hendershott and Riordan  2013)   HFTs improve market quality and reduce bidask spreads (Hasbrouck and Saar  2013)  and  HFTs reduce trading costs (Menkveld  2013). Fifth  trading in dark pools has been prevalent  for quite a while but has changed form many times as risks and technologies evolve. For a    35http //www.tradeworx.com/    29    theoretical analysis of this activity  see Buti  Rindi  and Werner (2017).    This latest manifestation of the older ﬁeld of market microstructure is here to stay. It  It is also blamed for market disruptions such as  is being reinvented through technology.  the ﬂash crash of May 6  2010  which lasted all of a half hour in afternoon trading  when  the indexes crashed and rebounded  hitting several market triggers  and transferring vast  amounts of proﬁt/loss between trading accounts. Markets are also being transformed as a  better understanding of these trading models on new trading platforms is creating (hopefully)  marketplaces that are treating small players more fairly than in the past. A good example  is the creation of the Investor’s Exchange (IEX)  immortalized in the book Flash Boys by  Michael Lewis (2014).    Looking ahead  the big changes anticipated in HFT are (1) an increase in regulation  (2)  a reduction in proﬁts from competition  (3) lower relevance on sheer speed of execution  (4)  a greater role for the use of myriad sources of information  (5) the entry of deep learning  and AI  (6) a reduced human role in favor of greater automation  and (7) an emphasis on  hardware over software.    IX Blockchains and Cryptocurrencies    On August 13  2017  the price of cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $4 000. This  was a 20% increase over the previous week  after a plan to speed up trade execution was  agreed upon. The new solution  denoted SegWit2x 36 has been a bone of contention in  the BTC community. However  trade execution under older protocols was slow  and this  innovation is going to be a game changer. Nevertheless  trading BTC is still fraught with risk.  The daily volatility of BTC is around 5%  much higher than gold (1.2%)  major currencies  (0.5%–1%)  or tech stocks  1%–2%. And a few months later  on November 29  2017  the  price of BTC broke the $10 000 price barrier  an astounding price rise for any currency. It  ramped up to almost $20 000 in midDecember 2017  but then dropped drastically to below    36https //segwit2x.github.io/    30    $7 000 by February 2018. It has remained around that level ever since  after dropping even  lower towards the end of 2018  followed by a resurgence to $10 000 at the end of the third  quarter in 2019. Of course  there is no clear sense as to where its eventual trading range lies.  We do not have a good model for pricing BTC using fundamentals.    Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are distinct things. A blockchain is a distributed ledger  that has four properties. It has decentralized validation. It is immutable—that is  the record  may not be changed. It is secure—that is  tamper proof. It is trusted 37 such that only valid  transactions will enter the ledger and it will prevent double spending. It is also a ledger on  a p2p network.    A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange and a store of value  just like ﬁat currencies   though legally it is a security  and may be thought of as an asset class. Transactions in this  currency are recorded on the blockchain. BTC’s inventor is as yet unknown  though the  original paper on which it is based is attributed to Nakamoto (2009). BTCs are traceable   but generally oﬀer anonymity through masking methods. Whether BTC is a currency or a  speculative asset has been debated in Yermack (2015).    Transactions in cryptocurrencies on the blockchain are secured by encryption methods   and transactions are recorded in a decentralized set of nodes after approval. Approval of a  transaction occurs when a “miner” processes a transaction block by adding a number (the  nonce) to a variablelength transaction  and then solves a hashing problem to generate a  ﬁxedlength (256 bits) hash with a set number of leading zeros (required to be 17 at the  current time). This random guessing takes computational power (and electricity) and is  rewarded with a set number of BTCs  which is BTC 12.5 as of writing. This mining process  produces a “proof of work” that validates the transaction block. With today’s technology  a  block is solved every ten minutes.    Transaction volumes in BTC are currently quite low  about 1.5–2.0 transactions per  second (tps)  or roughly 300 000 transactions per day  versus PayPal at 125 tps  and Visa at  37Sometimes  this is called the opposite  a “trustless” system  because there is no need for a trusted player    in the middle of all other transacting entities.    31    4 000 tps. However  the technology is now widely accepted and way beyond mere proof of  concept. It forms a core part of modernday ﬁntech.    A broader theme for the future is that the blockchain oﬀers a networked platform on  which decentralized and automatic contracting is made possible. This has been implemented  most famously on the Ethereum platform  which is a programmable blockchain. Anyone can  create a smart contract on the Ethereum chain  using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)   and proof of work is rewarded with the cryptocurrency ETH  used for payments and fees  on the platform. For example  one may establish a trading exchange on Ethereum  and  contracts can be automatically settled on the platform once the program is so designed.  It allows anonymous trading while still permitting a regulator to get an overall picture of  risk concentration in the market  thereby allowing for systemic risk management. Another  example of the use of the Ethereum platform is in real estate contracts. Several beneﬁts  exist such as title veriﬁcation  settlement  shared equity in properties  and liquid trading of  real estate assets.    Ethereum has also supported the growth of decentralized autonomous organizations  (DAOs)  where group arrangements are explicitly contracted on the Ethereum blockchain as  smart contracts. One in particular  known as the DAO (same name)  was instituted to be  a $150 million venture fund  invested in by thousands of people in a crowdsourced success.  It was  however  hacked in 2016  and several millions of ETH were stolen but later restored  by canceling the stolen ETH on the chain  and resetting the blockchain  which is in direct  violation of the principle of immutability. This resulted in a hard fork in the Ethereum  blockchain. However  the hack was a result of weak security on the DAO side  not on that  of the Ethereum blockchain. The Parity wallet was hacked on Ethereum for $31 million  (in July 2017). Another $150 million was vulnerable  but white hat hackers stepped in and  hacked those accounts out to save them  in a strange situation where the disease itself pro  vided the remedy.38 These issues have not been addressed by regulators who are struggling  to keep pace. Recently  the SEC ruled that tokens issued by DAO were to be treated as    38https //medium.freecodecamp.org/ahackerstole31mofetherhowit    happenedandwhatitmeansforethereum9e5dc29e33ce    32    securities and are now regulated by federal law. A cynical viewpoint is that after regulation   cryptocurrencies will end up following the old rules of money in a new digital setting.    Another ﬁnance application that has grown rapidly are initial coin oﬀerings (ICOs).  These are analogous to a preproduct sale  where coins are issued on a blockchain as a store  of future value. These will also attract regulation by the SEC  and there have been 46 ICOs  in July 2017 alone. The SEC recently declared that ICOs are securities. Volumes in ICOs  are doubling annually. In 2018  by June 30  537 ICOs ($13.7 billion) were registered. In  2017  there were a total of 552 ICOs ($7.0 billion). The average size of an ICO has doubled  from $12.8 million in 2017 to more than $25.5 million in 2018.39    Companies such as Numerai40 have created their own cryptocurrency (called a Nu  meraire)  which investors in their crowdsourced hedged fund may use for investments  with  drawals  transaction fees  and payments to developers of trading algorithms they may invest  in. This cryptocurrency was made possible by hosting it on the Ethereum blockchain.    We are no longer in the nascent stages of the blockchain revolution  but there is still  largescale innovation in this space. It is likely that there will be vast changes in ﬁnancial  contracting  trading  risk management  and corporate ﬁnance  all implemented on blockchain  infrastructure. For a comprehensive outlook on the disruptive (and beneﬁcial) potential of  blockchains  see Harvey (2014)  Yermack (2017).    X Text Analytics    An important area of ﬁntech lies in applications that use “alternative” data.    Textual data greatly expand the universe of available data from the merely numerical.  The starting point of any text analysis is the quantiﬁcation of textual data—that is  a  mapping from words and documents to mathematical abstractions such as vectors  matrices   and tensors. The goal is to elucidate qualitative inferences and predictions after suitable    39https //cointelegraph.com/news/pwcreportfindsthat2018icovolumeisalreadydoublethatofpreviousyear  40https //medium.com/numerai/anaihedgefundgoesliveonethereuma80470c6b681    33    mathematical transformations.    There are several areas in which text analytics is now being applied in ﬁnance. For a  recent survey  see Das (2014). I will discuss some of these applications in this section. Sources  of text fall into three categories  (1) blogs  forums  and wikis  (2) news  and (3) content  generated by ﬁrms. Early work tended to focus on sentiment extraction using postings  on stock message boards  such as Yahoo!  Raging Bull  Motley Fool  and Silicon Investor.  Sentiment is also extracted from news sections in the Wall Street Journal  and the Dow Jones  and Reuters news services. These sources were at least at daily frequency. More recently   text streams have become available in real time  and Twitter has become a happy hunting  ground for sentiment analysts. Bollen  Mao  and Zeng (2011) state that they can predict the  direction of the Dow Jones index with 87% accuracy using tweets. Since then  there have  been a slew of papers using tweets  each with mixed success.    Predicting market direction is one of the obvious ﬁrst uses of text mining  and consid  erable energy has been devoted to this goal. Early research by Antweiler and Frank (2004)  and Das and Chen (2007) constructed a bullishness index     B = nB − nS  nB + nS    (3)    where nB  nS is the number of messages categorized as “buy” and “sell ” respectively. This  measure is also often called “polarity”. This research shows that it is hard to predict market  direction using message board postings  but there is a somewhat weak prediction of volatility.  Since then  much more attention has been directed towards using tweets instead. All these  initial forays into sentiment analysis of stocks ﬁrmly placed textual analysis in ﬁnance onto  ﬁrm footing.    Extensive use is made of corporate textual data for asset management. Data are extracted  from the vast universe of regulatory corporate ﬁlings  such as 10K and 10Q forms. See  papers by Loughran and McDonald (2011)  Burdick et al. (2011)  Bodnaruk et al. (2015)   Jegadeesh and Wu (2013)  and Loughran and McDonald (2014). These papers found that  special words lists  known as lexicons  were indeed useful in determining the sentiment    34    embedded in annual reports. For example  a count of riskrelated words in annual reports  is a good predictor of poor performance in subsequent quarters. Papers by Calomiris and  Mamaysky (2019) and Froot et al. (2017) show that textual information from largescale  media sources coupled with market information provides strong predictability of market  direction.    Another interesting development emanates from quantifying “readability” of annual re  ports. It turns out that metrics for readability of text are useful in predicting corporate per  formance  and the less readable an annual report is  the worse a ﬁrm performs. Readability  was originally quantiﬁed by researchers in linguistics  and measures such as the GunningFog  index (Gunning  1952) have become popular  as they are robust measures of readability. The  formula for the Fog index is    " #W ords    #Sentences    0.4 ×    #    + 100 · #ComplexW ords    #W ords    (4)    The formula returns a number that indicates the number of years of schooling needed to be  able to comprehend the text. In other words  it also renders the grade level at which the  text is written. The intuition for why low readability of annual reports correlates with poor  performance is that when a ﬁrm has bad news to convey  it tends to obfuscate as much as  possible in its ﬁlings (e.g.  10K). Subsequent research also found that longer annual report  discussion (in number of characters) was also an indicator of poor subsequent performance;  in fact  it was even better than poor readability. Once again  clearly  obfuscation comes more  easily with longwinded writing than with short  pithy text. Finally  research shows that  counting characters is unnecessary. Simply looking at the ﬁle size of the annual report on  the SEC server is a good sorting characteristic. Bigger ﬁle sizes predict poor performance.    News analytics is also widely used to enhance asset management. This domain deals  with the measurement of qualitative and quantitative attributes of unstructured news ar  ticles. Leinweber (2009) and Leinweber and Sisk (2011) oﬀer extensive discussion on news  analyticsbased trading strategies. Tetlock  SaarTsechansky  and Macskassay (2008) show  that the number of negative words forecasts negative earnings  and news stories that focus    35    on fundamentals are more informative than other articles. For a comprehensive treatment  of news analytics  see Mitra and Mitra (2011).    Prediction of corporate or banking failures has the potential to save vast sums of money.  In recent work  Das  Kim  and Kothari (2019) show how early warning signals may be  extracted from text by analyzing emails of senior management in a ﬁrm. Using Enron as a  test case  they propose a “zerorevelation” technology where a software program can analyze  emails for their qualitative characteristics such as sentiment  quantitative characteristics such  as size and frequency  spatial aspects such as networks  or aggregate focus through extracting  topics. Because the program reads and provides an aggregate analysis  without revealing  the contents of the emails  this is a noninvasive approach that may be used by corporate  management or a regulator to predict ﬁnancial malaise early  thereby adding value to a ﬁrm’s  risk management process.    The main features of such an approach are as follows. (1) Financials are often delayed  indicators of corporate quality. (2) Internal discussion may be used as an early warning  system for upcoming corporate malaise.  (3) Emails have the potential to predict such  events. (4) Software can analyze vast quantities of textual data not amenable to human  processing. (5) Corporate senior management may also use these analyses to better predict  and manage impending crisis for their ﬁrms. (6) Most important  the approach requires zero  revelation of emails.    The empirical analysis of Enron’s emails primarily covers two years  2000 and 2001.  Enron failed in the fourth quarter of 2001  so this is the period before and during the crisis  the ﬁrm faced. Some clear results emanate.  (1) As Enron’s condition worsens  emails  are shorter in length. (2) Likewise  Enron’s sentiment extracted from emails drops a few  months before the crisis  and continues into it. (3) It is interesting that the length of senior  management emails is a better predictor of demise than is sentiment  although both are  useful. (4) It is also interesting that plotting the frequency of usage of words over time also  tells a story. The word losses sees more frequent usage than average in the crisis period   and the inverse is true for the word proﬁts. For example  see the word credit plotted against    36    Figure 11.  Interactive system to plot any word over time  if the word appears in the corpus  of emails from Enron for 2000 and 2001. Here  we plot the word credit. Source  Das  Kim  and  Kothari (2019).    sentiment for the two years in the data set; these track very closely  as shown in Figure 11.  (v) A topic analysis also shows that negative topics become more prevalent as we approach  the crisis versus positive topics. (vi) Finally  the email network for 2000 looks very diﬀerent  from that in 2001.    There are myriad applications for textual alternative data. Natural language processing  using deep learning has become an important recent use of text in ﬁnance. Text is being  classiﬁed to generate early warning signals about company actions  predict the eﬀect on the  stock price after an announcement. Since these new data features add value  many hedge  funds add textual features as an overlay to their trading algorithms.    XI Concluding Comments  The Good and the Bad    In this ﬁnal section  I consider two important issues that arise around ﬁntech  labor market  changes and implementation pitfalls along the ﬁntech path.    37    I The Finance Labor Market    Fintech is a potential disruptor of the ﬁnancial services labor market  which accounts for  6%–7% of U.S. employment. AI and ML will erode many of these jobs. However  the debate  on whether we will see the process evolve through intelligence augmentation (IA) versus AI  (artiﬁcal intelligence) is still open. The former will lead to less job loss. It may be easier to  replace highend trading jobs (through AI) than lowend customer service roles (IA). Firms  are recording traders’ keystrokes and screens and using the data to train algorithms to mimic  traders. These artiﬁcial agents are able to improve through techniques such as reinforcement  learning. These algorithms can analyze a certain type of data far more deeply than a human  can  but they are also poorer at considering a breadth of data  though they may eventually  be engineered to do so.41 In contrast  chatbots to replace customer service agents have a  long way to go before they are good enough to replace humans. Middlelevel jobs such as  paralegal work in securities contract checking is being eliminated with algorithms that have  lower error rates. This corresponds to Autor’s (2015) hypothesis that while very lowend  and very highend jobs will remain  several middlelevel jobs will be lost  such as ﬁnancial  analysts  routine trading functions  paralegals  human resources roles  loan oﬃcers  ﬁnancial  advisers  and so forth.    Ray Kurzweil has predicted the supremacy of machines  the “Singularity ” which he  suggested will occur in 2045. Norbert Wiener famously said  “We can be humble and live a  good life with the aid of machines  or we can be arrogant and die.”42 Setting these ominous  fears aside  we may dig deeper into the kinds of jobs that seem to be getting winnowed  away. A cynical hypothesis has been put forward by Graeber (2018) that there are legions of  “bullshit” jobs that are ﬁnally being eliminated such as corporate lawyers  ﬁnancial advisers   and so on. These are jobs that would make no diﬀerence were they to disappear; in fact   people doing these jobs know this and bear a psychological stigma as a consequence.43  I    41https //www.marketwatch.com/story/    aiwillchangestockmarkettradingbutitcantwipeouttheroleofpeople20180515    42https //www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/science/mitscholars1949essayonmachineageisfound.    html    43Graeber ﬁrst espoused these ideas in an essay titled “On the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs”  https     38    have a simple hypothesis for which jobs will be lost  if the job generates data  then an AI  agent can be trained on that data to replace the human. This is what we see happening  with trading jobs  paralegal work  and more.    Understandably  there will be jobs where ﬁntech will keep the “human in the loop”  (HITL). These are jobs where consideration of nonstandard cases is required or where a  human is needed in the loop to avoid legal liability–for example  risk managers. Such jobs  may escape “technological unemployment.”    II Pitfalls for Fintech    While ﬁntech heralds the new age of ﬁnance  it is by no means widely prevalent as yet  and  is certainly not the panacea for all open issues. While it is both an improving force and a  disruptive one  it needs to be implemented thoughtfully. Here  I brieﬂy survey seven pitfalls  to avoid when implementing ﬁntech.    First  the garbagein  garbageout (GIGO) problem. Fintech is consuming more and more  data  but it needs to be good data. Without “data curation ” ﬁnancial analyses will produce  poorquality output. This issue is itself being addressed with new technologies  where ML  is being used to clean data  generating better quality inputs as well as reducing the data  engineering cycle drastically. This is discussed extensively in Alexander et al. (2017)  and  technically  companies such as Tamr44 and Paxata45 oﬀer excellent solutions.    Second  we have information overload. This comprises collecting too much data and  not using them properly. An antidote for this is good theoretical modeling  which suggests  exactly what data should be provided to the algorithm. This approach transcribes the scope  of the data needed. It may also save money as a ﬁrm may be able to move from distributed  computing to using a single  large  and fast machine. Testing trading models and proper  backtesting will help in improving signaltonoise ratios. Tools for this are becoming widely  //strikemag.org/bullshitjobs/. The arrival of AI coincides now with the book on the same idea.    44https //www.tamr.com/  45https //www.paxata.com/    39    available  and businesses such as Quantopian46 and Numerai47 are making these widely  available so that trading ideas may be crowdsourced—another eﬀective antidote to processing  inhuman quantities of market information.    Third  big is not better. More data does not mean better results; quality matters.  However  AI and deep learning are making it possible to let machines make sense of large  scale data. Simple applications in the consumer ﬁnance space are seeing positive results from  the use of deep learning on large data  especially in the area of anomaly detection  as we  have seen with ﬁrms such as Ayasdi and Simility.    Fourth  separating correlation from causality. In the search for predictive analytics  the  use of big data is turning up better predictive models  but these are untraced to the cause  of predictability  and are largely atheoretic. Given this  ﬁrms revisit their models on much  tighter review cycles in order to ensure that they are still viable for trading. This issue  becomes especially acute when considering streaming data in HFT.    Fifth  the infrastructure for ﬁntech is expensive  and once a ﬁrm dips its toes in the  water  it is required to go all in  else it becomes impossible to get good results. HFT  for  example  requires an increasingly expensive investment in hardware and communications  technology. Deep learning platforms require outlays for expensive chips such as arrays of  GPUs. Blockchain infrastructure requires electricitygreedy specialpurpose hardware. The  list goes on and on. It’s an arms race.    Sixth  trust is a huge issue in adoption. Fintech oﬀerings tend to hand oﬀ previous  humandriven functions to technology—for example  replacing tellers with ATMs and online  banking. Cryptocurrencies are completely based on trust  where trust is transferred from a  centralized and regulated repository to trust in technology and decentralization. Without  trusted algorithms and data  ﬁntech will fail (Thakor and Merton  2018). Any ﬁrm developing  a new ﬁntech business must consider how it will implement trust through technology.    Seventh  while technology can be used to improve experience  more often than not  the  46https //www.quantopian.com/.  47https //numer.ai/.    40    opposite is the result. Excessive misdirected automation can lead to a terrible customer  experience. A case in point is the widespread use of chatbots for customer service inter  actions  where the quality range is huge. Roboadvising is another area in which careful  design of the interface becomes necessary. Firms are using design thinking to ensure that  customers are wellserved in ﬁntechdriven businesses. Finance houses need to become much  more consumercentric and use design thinking as actively as tech companies like Apple do.    I end with the following prediction  Finance companies will eventually become quasi    technology ﬁrms.    41    References    Aastveita  K.A.  K.R. Gerdrupa  A.S. Jore  and L.A.
