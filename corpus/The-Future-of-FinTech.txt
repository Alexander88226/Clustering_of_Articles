Das is the William and Janice Terry Professor of Finance in the Leavey School of Businessat Santa Clara University in Santa Clara CA. I am grateful to Kresimir Kalafatic Seoyoung Kim andChristine Parlour for discussion and comments and for discussion on the basic taxonomy of areas in \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech.I am also grateful for comments from seminar participants at various academic and industry forums.1\\x0cFinancial \\xef\\xac\\x81rms are rapidly using technology to transform their businesses. In this articleI survey ten areas in which \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech is poised to deliver high value to \\xef\\xac\\x81rms markets andregulators. Much of this value is created through the use of machine learning technologybig data and cloud computing and cryptographic methods.Fintech refers to various \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technologies used to automate processes in the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialsector from routine manual tasks to nonroutine cognitive decision making. Various areas of\\xef\\xac\\x81nance are subject to disruption such as payment systems contract checking trading riskmanagement quantitative asset management lending mobile banking customer retentionand investment banking. Annual \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing in 2018 was $112 billion comprised of2196 deals doubling over that of the previous year (2017 $51 billion).1 Figure 1 presentsone representation of the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech landscape.Fintech may be characterized by technological change in three broad areas of \\xef\\xac\\x81nance(1) raising capital (2) allocating capital and (3) transferring capital. Fintech is disruptingall three. For example payment systems e\\xef\\xac\\x83ciently transfer capital. Firms such as CommonBond (https//commonbond.co/) are using technology to revolutionize how capital issupplied. Likewise roboadvising platforms are changing the way capital is allocated.De\\xef\\xac\\x81nition Fintech is any technology that eliminates or reducesthe costs of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial intermediation.De\\xef\\xac\\x81nitions of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech vary depending on source and the de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition here is a general approach to capturing the main \\xef\\xac\\x82avor of what is currently understood as \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech. For examplethe Bank for International Settlements (BIS) de\\xef\\xac\\x81nes \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech in credit to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbroadly include allcredit activity facilitated by electronic (online) platforms that are not operated by commercial banks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (see BIS Quarterly Review September 2018 p. 31).What is the longrun driver for \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech as a disruptor? The main factor is the high costof \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial intermediation. This has historically always been so. In an interesting study1https//assets.kpmg/content/dam/kpmg/xx/pdf/2019/02/thepulseoffintech2018.pdf2\\x0cFigure 1. The \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech landscape. These \\xe2\\x80\\x9clumascape\\xe2\\x80\\x9d diagrams show a sampling of a businessdomain and \\xef\\xac\\x81rms within it. https//pbs.twimg.com/media/CYOHdfgW8AERjdO.pngFigure 2. The cost of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial intermediation has held steady at 2% over time. Source Philippon(2016).3\\x0cFigure 3. Employment in the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial sector has increased its share from 5.0% to 6.5% in thelast two decades. Source Philippon (2016).Philippon (2016) shows that the average cost of intermediation has held steady at around2% of transaction amounts. Figure 2 shows that this cost has hovered around this levelsince 1880 until current times for an astonishingly extended period of more than a century.While one may speculate about the reasons for this high cost of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial intermediationsuch as lack of competition on the supply side or ignorance of consumers on the demandside the fact remains that these rents accruing to large \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutions are now ripefor the picking by smaller agile \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech players. Technology is often a cheaper intermediaryand a driver of competition. Over the last two decades employment in the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial sectorhas expanded from 5% to 6.5% of the workforce as shown in Figure 3. Fintech may verylikely reduce this number dramatically.Fintech applications range from simple automation to complex decision making. Manyrely on big data and necessitate investments in cloud infrastructure and analytics. Successful \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech applications display some common characteristics. First it is valuable to developmodels from a theoretical foundation before bringing in data. This helps both in preparingthe data based on extant theory and makes interpretation of the results facile as they areseen from the backdrop of a theoretical foundation. For example automated lending models4\\x0care based on a theoretical foundation of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial concepts such as leverage and customerbehavior which suggests the econometric speci\\xef\\xac\\x81cation for the data. The variables used inthe model denoted as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfeatures\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in machine learning (ML) models are better chosen usingtheoretical ideas especially when causal models are intended. Second sharp de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of theproblem statement is critical\\xe2\\x80\\x94the question is primary and data is secondary. To considerthe problem of lending again there are many di\\xef\\xac\\x80erent \\xef\\xac\\x81rms with varied o\\xef\\xac\\x80erings as may beseen in Figure 1. What di\\xef\\xac\\x80erentiates them from one another is the speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c pain point in thelending process that they seek to ameliorate. Any entrant in this congested area of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntechmust sharply de\\xef\\xac\\x81ne the niche problem it is solving so as to create a unique value proposition.Third many \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech o\\xef\\xac\\x80erings confront big data and computational bottlenecks. They faceproblems with data extraction integration curation quality and analytics. How well theseare handled will determine the success of a \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech venture. For a detailed description of theseissues see Alexander et al. (2017). Fourth \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech tends to be multidisciplinary calling forteams that cut across many \\xef\\xac\\x81elds. A case in point is roboadvising where an amalgamation of experience from portfolio management behavioral \\xef\\xac\\x81nance user interface design riskmanagement legal aspects of consumer \\xef\\xac\\x81nance and so forth are all required. Anotherexample is in cryptocurrencies where specialized knowledge of cryptography monetary systems payment methods distributed computing and so on come into play. Applicationsthat are based on natural language processing also entail many di\\xef\\xac\\x80erent sorts of expertise inlinguistics computer science arti\\xef\\xac\\x81cial intelligence (AI) and economics. ML and analytics\\xef\\xac\\x81gure prominently in many \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech applications. Table 1 is a sampling of areas in whichlarge banks may bene\\xef\\xac\\x81t from \\xef\\xac\\x81ntechimplemented analytics.The incredible e\\xef\\xac\\x80ectiveness of ML in \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech relies on advances in computational algorithms such as matrix factorization deep learning classi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation methods and so forthand a proliferation of special purpose hardware (cloud platforms graphics processing units[GPUs] etc.) that exploit vast quantities of data. The con\\xef\\xac\\x82uence of these scienti\\xef\\xac\\x81c developments has led to huge advantages for \\xef\\xac\\x81rms that have invested in ML technologies. Figure4 shows that the performance of hedge funds that use ML outstrips that of funds that donot.5\\x0cTable 1.

Hedge fund performance is driven by ML. AI/Machine Learning Hedge Fund Indexversus quants and traditional hedge funds. See http//www.eurekahedge.com/Research/News/1614/ArtificialIntelligenceAIHedgeFundIndexStrategyProfile.6\\x0cThe scope of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech is huge. In a recent paper Srinivasan (2016) states that as of 2015Ernst & Young reports that there were 1400 \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech \\xef\\xac\\x81rms with more than $33 billion infunding. In comparison credit card fraud accounted for $31 billion in losses in a year. Therefore even small improvements in just this area will generate substantial value compared tothe investments being made in \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech. Furthermore modern hardware cloud infrastructureand software tools have made possible the rapid development of sophisticated \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech platforms by very small teams enabling entrants with minimal funding to compete in this space.Rapid development also has a dark side. Lo (2017) p. 17 points out that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe unintendedconsequences of technologyleveraged \\xef\\xac\\x81nance include \\xef\\xac\\x81resales \\xef\\xac\\x82ash crashes botched initialpublic o\\xef\\xac\\x80erings cybersecurity breaches catastrophic algorithmic trading errors and a technological arms race that has created new winners losers and systemic risk in the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialecosystem.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He suggests a strong focus on robust technology to manage this problem.The distribution of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech is naturally uneven. Interestingly one of the countries withhigh adoption rates for \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech is Hong Kong with the United States coming second followedby Singapore. The Chinese government is now one of the biggest spenders on deep learningtechnologies.In the following sections I present a taxonomy of ten areas where I expect \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech togrow rapidly and act as both an innovation and disruption. Such a taxonomy is also usefulin designing academic curricula for \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech. After these discussions we will explore theuse of ML AI and deep learning through some use case examples. These examples willalso highlight the tremendous advance in ML technology that has made these disruptionspossible. In the ensuing sections we will examine some of the ideas and underpinnings ofvarious uses of mathematics and computer science married with economic models in thespace of Fintech solutions.7\\x0cI Machine Learning Arti\\xef\\xac\\x81cial Intelligence and DeepLearningAs described in Culkin and Das (2017) AI has come of age through implementing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeeplearning\\xe2\\x80\\x9d neural networks2 because of the con\\xef\\xac\\x82uence of three important factors (1) thee\\xef\\xac\\x83cacy of mathematical analysis for calibrating neural nets; (2) improvements in hardwareand software that allow very large (deep) neural nets to be computed e\\xef\\xac\\x83ciently; and (3) theavailability of big data with which to train these models. Deep learning models have beenproven to uncover subtle nonlinearities in data that are not discoverable using standardmore or less linear econometric models. These models implement pattern recognition tohigh levels of accuracy. By casting \\xef\\xac\\x81nance problems as pattern recognition problems weare able to avail of higher predictability than before. We can also use deep learning totrain pricing models from data on inputs and prices in the markets bypassing the need fortheoretical models such as those used for option pricing. In the words of Peter Norvig \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAllmodels are wrong and increasingly you can succeed without them.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d He makes the case thatdata are the new theory.3In order to explore this idea we revisit work from the 1990s. Hutchinson Lo andPoggio (1994) explored using neural nets to learn the Black and Scholes (1973) option pricingformula also developed by Merton (1973). In Culkin and Das (2017) they created data forthe assessment of how a deep neural net would learn this equation by randomly simulatinga range of call option prices. The data were divided into two random sets one for trainingand the other for validation. Before passing the prices to the deep learning net the datawere normalized by exploiting a facet of the BlackScholes call option function\\xe2\\x80\\x94that isthat the pricing function is linear homogeneous in (S K) i.e. C(S K) = K \\xc2\\xb7 C(S/K 1).2A neural net is a highly nonlinear \\xef\\xac\\x81tting model made up of several simple nested nonlinear functionsthat take inputs and train them to generate a discrete or continuous output through training on large datasets. Neural nets are used for example in natural language translation and in autonomous vehicles. This isa very simplistic de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition of neural nets and nets with several tens of layers are known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeeplearning\\xe2\\x80\\x9dnets.3https//www.wired.com/2008/06/pbtheory/8\\x0cFigure 5. Call option pricing errors from the \\xef\\xac\\x81tted deep learning neural net. Source Culkin andDas (2017).ThereforeC(S K)/K = C(S/K 1).The data were normalized by dividing both stock price S and call price C by strike priceK. These normalized data were applied to the deep learning net to \\xef\\xac\\x81t the input variablesS K T q r and \\xcf\\x83 (the feature set) to the output prices C. The outofsample root meansquared error (RMSE) is 0.0112 with an average error of \\xc2\\xb11% of the strike. The percentagepricing error (error divided by option price) is 0.0421\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is 4% on average. The distribution of pricing errors is shown in Figure 5. A regression of the model values on the truevalues has very high R2 = 0.9982.Culkin and Das (2017) also found that with the exception of very small option priceswhere the percentage error tends to be magni\\xef\\xac\\x81ed moneyness is not correlated with pricingerror.This simple example supports Norvig\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assertion that ML has the potential to replacetheoretically derived models with datadriven models. AI and ML models are now beingimplemented widely across the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services industry. Here are some examples. Bridgewater Associates the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest hedge fund has a project to automate decision makingto save time and eliminate human emotion volatility.4 Goldman Sachs now has 2 out of 6004https//www.theguardian.com/technology/2016/dec/22/bridgewaterassociatesaiartificialintelligencemanagement9\\x0cequity traders left in one part of its business. It found that a few traders can be replaced byone computer engineer.5 It is estimated that by 2020 at least 5% of all economic transactionswill be handled by autonomous software.6AI will process payment functions and learn from customer behaviors through IntelligentPayments Management (IPM). The potential savings are huge AI will help consumers makedaily \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial decisions and monitor spending. New personal \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial management appsuse contextual awareness which measures spending habits and online footprints to createpersonalized advice. Combining pooled \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial data with end user control to o\\xef\\xac\\x80er tailormade services is a classic AI solution that we should expect to see plenty of. Algorithmswill automatically mine customer data and undertake crossselling of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial products.Automation of cognitive tasks is now occurring rapidly. For example J.P. Morgan has asoftware called COIN that interprets commercial loan agreements and has resulted in asaving of 360000 hours of lawyer time.7There are several interesting applications under way. In the retail banking arena MizuhoFinancial Group sent Pepper its humanoid robot into its Tokyo branch to handle customerinquiries.8 They partnered with IBM to enable Pepper to understand human emotionsand build interaction into apps. The Royal Bank of Scotland is trial testing Luvo AI acustomer service assistant to interact with sta\\xef\\xac\\x80 and customers.9 AXA (the insurer) has anappbased bot called Xtra which engages in bespoke conversations with customers abouthealthy living.10 AI is used in peertopeer (p2p) lending.11 The role of chatbots in changingthe interface with banking customers is growing rapidly.125http//www.zerohedge.com/news/20170213/goldmanhad600cashequitytraders2000itnowhas26http//www.gartner.com/smarterwithgartner/gartnerpredictsourdigitalfuture/7https//futurism.com/anaicompleted360000hoursoffinanceworkinjustseconds/8https//www.mizuhobank.com/mizuho_fintech/news/pepper/index.html9http//www.businessinsider.com/royalbankofscotlandlaunchesaichatbotluvousingibmwatson20169?r=UK&IR=T&IR=T10https//www.thedigitalinsurer.com/dia/xtrabyaxaaidrivenpersonalwellnesscoachingapp/11http//www.nanalyze.com/2017/04/aifintechstartupsloansnewcredit/12https//www.americanbanker.com/news/thisishowfinancialserviceschatbotsaregoingtoevolve10\\x0cAI is also permeating the operations of hedge funds. BlackRock is replacing human stockpickers with machine algorithms using deep learning neural nets as described earlier.13Sentient Technologies is a hedge fund run entirely using AI.14 It is supposed to have asecret algorithm with adaptive learning that uses thousands of machines. Numerai is ahedge fund that makes trades by aggregating trading algorithms submitted by anonymouscontributors; prizes are awarded in cryptocurrency called Numeraire which reside on theEthereum blockchain.15 Numerai opensources transformed big data which is not revealed inpure form because it scrambles the data using homomorphic encryption a form of encryptionwhere the data can be used for pattern recognition and analysis without being able to extractany original information from them.A skeptical viewpoint is that there are very little data about the track record of theseAIdriven hedge funds as the business remains secretive. It is also argued that such fundswill fail because investors will remain reluctant to turn over their money completely to amachine. Yet this is being disproved by the little data we have. Figure 4 shows that fundsusing ML outperform others quite handily. And money is marching into AIdriven funds asNumerai Fund 1 LP raised more than $1 million in short order.16Does the fact that hedge funds are successfully beating the market imply an unanticipatedfailure of market e\\xef\\xac\\x83ciency? In order to explore this proposition Das Mokashi and Culkin(2018) conducted a simple experiment using pattern recognition. Employing deep learningneural nets they trained an algorithm on data from all stocks in the S&P 500 index andattempted to predict using a lookback number of days (e.g. 30 60 90 days) the directionof movement (up or down) in the index the following day. Undertaking di\\xef\\xac\\x80erent experimentsthe results using daily data from 1963 show that it is di\\xef\\xac\\x83cult to train an algorithm to guessthe sign of the index return with marginally betterthantheaverage up days in the markets13http//fortune.com/2017/03/30/blackrockrobotslayoffsartificialintelligenceaihedgefund/14https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sentient_Technologies As of 2016 it is the most wellfunded AI15https//numer.ai/16https//www.sec.gov/Archives/edgar/data/1667103/000166710316000002/xslFormDX01/company.primary_doc.xml11\\x0c(52.7%). Accuracy levels are low and suggest that even with a greatly expanded informationset markets are still e\\xef\\xac\\x83cient. The availability of data and opensource software packagessuch as TensorFlow make such tests of market e\\xef\\xac\\x83ciency easy to run. Indeed this is probablyone of the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst tests of market e\\xef\\xac\\x83ciency where the conditioning information set is as largeas all stocks in the S&P 500 index.II Network Models Fintech for Systemic Risk ModelingIn this section I explore how graph theory is being applied to understanding the risks of the\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial system also known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9csystemic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d risk. Systemic risk has some universally acceptedcharacteristics. It is a risk that has (1) a large impact (2) is widespread and (3) creates aripple e\\xef\\xac\\x80ect that endangers the viability of the economic system.Systemic risk is an attribute of the economic system and not that of a single entity.Its measurement should have two important features (1) quanti\\xef\\xac\\x81ability\\xe2\\x80\\x94it must be measurable on an ongoing basis and (2) decomposability\\xe2\\x80\\x94aggregate systemwide risk may bebroken down into risk contributions from all \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial entities in the system. Financial institutions (FIs) that have large risk contributions to aggregate systemic risk may be deemed\\xe2\\x80\\x9csystemically important.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dThe DoddFrank Act of 2010 and Basel III regulations characterize a systemically riskyFI as one that is (1) large (2) complex (3) interconnected and (4) critical\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is provideshardtosubstitute services to the economy. Failure of such an institution is potentially disruptive to the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial system. The DoddFrank Act does not o\\xef\\xac\\x80er quanti\\xef\\xac\\x81cation speci\\xef\\xac\\x81cs.Recently Das (2016) proposed a metric for systemic risk that has both the attributes ofsystem risk captures the features of systemically important FIs and is consistent with thethree universal characteristics of systemic risk. In order to accurately characterize systemicrisk graph theory is used and a network of banks is constructed. To see an example of this12\\x0cnetwork construction see Burdick et al. (2011) where text analytics was used to extractinterbank loan transactions from Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) \\xef\\xac\\x81lings andconstruct a colending network of money \\xef\\xac\\x82ows between banks. Coupling this interconnectedness information with credit quality information from banks leads to a new measure ofsystemic risk that has attractive properties as formalized in Das Kim and Ostrov (2019).There is now a vast literature speaking to this problem as in papers by EspinosaVega andSole (2010) Billio et al. (2012) ChanLau et al. (2018) to cite just a few. It takes a carefulcombination of graph theory and economics using large quantities of data to generate asingle metric for measuring systemic risk. The requirement to do this in real time makes thisa particularly interesting \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech problem. For example downloading and text mining allSEC \\xef\\xac\\x81lings relating to interbank loans in order to visualize the interbank lending network isan especially interesting problem requiring terabytes of data combined with graph theory.See Figure 6 for the networks plotted on an annual basis for 2005 and for 2006\\xe2\\x80\\x932009.The mathematics for this model in its stochastic form are created by generalizing theMerton (1974) single\\xef\\xac\\x81rm credit risk model. This extended model derived in Das Kimand Ostrov (2019) allows us to construct stochastic risk networks in a structural credit riskmodeling framework. The model\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data are standard Merton model inputs for each \\xef\\xac\\x81rm\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Equity price = s = {s1 s2 ... sn}\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Equity volatility = \\xcf\\x83 = {\\xcf\\x831 \\xcf\\x832 ... \\xcf\\x83n}\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Number of shares = m = {m1 m2 ... mn}\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Riskfree rate = rThe model variables are all derived from the Merton model)\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 n = number of banks in the system\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 a = nvector with components ai that represent the assets in bank i (derived froms \\xcf\\x83 m r).13\\x0c2005Figure 6. Lending networks between banks for \\xef\\xac\\x81ve years 2005\\xe2\\x80\\x932009 (Source Burdick et al 2011).142005$Ci\'group$Inc.$J.P.$Morgan$Chase$Bank$of$America$Corp.$2006\\t \\xc2\\xa02007\\t \\xc2\\xa02008\\t \\xc2\\xa02009\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xce\\xbb = nvector with components \\xce\\xbbi that represent the average yearly chance of bank idefaulting (from s \\xcf\\x83 r).\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 E = n \\xc3\\x97 n matrix with components Eij that represent the probability that if bank jdefaults it will cause bank i to default (from s \\xcf\\x83 r). This matrix represents the riskconnectedness of the banks.The following calculations lead to a single metric for systemic risk that captures both interconnectedness and credit quality of all banks. De\\xef\\xac\\x81ne c to be an nvector with componentsci that represent bank i\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit risk. More speci\\xef\\xac\\x81cally I de\\xef\\xac\\x81nec = a (cid12) \\xce\\xbbwhere (cid12) represents component multiplication (the Hadamard product)\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is ci = ai\\xce\\xbbi.The aggregate systemic risk created by the n banks in the system is\\xe2\\x88\\x9aR =c> \\xc2\\xb7 E \\xc2\\xb7 c1>a(1)where 1 is an nvector of ones so the denominator 1>a = nPai represents the total assetsi=1in the n banks. We note that r is linear homogenous in \\xce\\xbb.The metric developed has four valuable properties derived in Das Kim and Ostrov(2019)1. All other things being equal R should be minimized by dividing risk equally amongthe n \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutions and maximized by putting all the risk into one institution.2. R should increase as the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutions become more interconnected.3. If all the assets ai are multiplied by a common factor \\xce\\xb1 > 0 it should have no e\\xef\\xac\\x80ecton R.4. Substanceless partitioning of a bank into two banks should have no e\\xef\\xac\\x80ect on R.15\\x0cImplementation of this simple system on a largescale across all banks is an interestingchallenge in the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech space.The metric also leads to other useful metrics which are easy to compute. The metricR is linear homogeneous in \\xce\\xbb. Let \\xce\\xb1 be any scalar constant. If we replace \\xce\\xbb with \\xce\\xb1\\xce\\xbb itimmediately follows that c is replaced by \\xce\\xb1c and by the equation for R we see that R isreplaced by \\xce\\xb1R.We can also calculate the sensitivity of R to changes in \\xce\\xbb Di\\xef\\xac\\x80erentiating our equationfor R with respect to \\xce\\xbb\\xe2\\x88\\x82R\\xe2\\x88\\x82\\xce\\xbb= 12a (cid12) [(E + ET)c]\\xe2\\x88\\x9acTEc1Tawhose components represent the sensitivity of R to changes in each bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s value of \\xce\\xbb. Thisis the basis of risk decomposition equal to D = (cid16) \\xe2\\x88\\x82R(cid17) a vector containing each bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s\\xe2\\x88\\x82\\xce\\xbb (cid12) \\xce\\xbbcontribution to R.A version of this model was implemented in India with support from the Reserve Bankof India. Metrics may be produced daily. More details are presented in Das (2016) and forillustration Figure 7 shows the Indian network systemic score S and risk decomposition D.The metric is therefore easy to implement and o\\xef\\xac\\x80ers a realtime systemic risk managementtool for regulators.Using publicly derived data for the U.S. banking system Das Kim and Ostrov (2019)also calculated the top risky banks and top risky links (Figure 8). On the technical sidewe have 3D visualizations of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial networks that support better decision making usinggraph databases such as neo4j.17III Personal and Consumer FinanceHouseholds are consumers and allocators of capital. On the consumption side they borrowmoney to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance consumption and investments in capital assets. They also earn incomes17https//neo4j.com/users/kineviz/16\\x0cFigure 7. Network of banks in India and risk decomposition December 3 2015 (Source Das2016).generate savings and allocate their wealth into various asset classes.In recent times households have faced several hurdles in the consumptioninvestmentcycle. First asset returns have become exceedingly low and this has made retirement targetsmore elusive. For older investors who rely on safe income streams after completing theirwork lives decent riskfree returns are no longer available as riskfree interest rates havedropped to near zero. Further risk premiums on speculative assets have seemingly shrunkthough there are di\\xef\\xac\\x80erences of opinion on the expected equity risk premium. Second medicaladvances have made longevity risk severe. There are heightened concerns about seniorcitizens outliving their savings. Third there is substantial volatility risk when reachingfor yield. Seeking higher returns in alternative asset classes comes with substantial risk notjust in the second moment of returns but also from the presence of negative skewness andexcess kurtosis. Fourth whereas riskadjusted returns keep falling highcost providers of\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services have retained their pricing schedules. As shown in Figure 2 the averageunit cost of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial intermediation is 2%. Fifth inequality is also rising and the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialsystem operates adversely against the poor in a growing cycle of bias (Piketty 2014). Theshare of income of the top decile of the population has grown from 35% in the 1940s toaround 50% today. These factors scream out for a \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech solution to raise riskadjustedreturns so that investors may seek a less anxious retirement with lower costs and inequality.17\\x0cPanel 1 Most systemically risky banksPanel 2 Most risky linksFigure 8.

Source Das Kim and Ostrov (2019).18\\x0cVarious \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech initiatives are addressing these issues. Roboadvising now enables investors to use technology to place their money in welldiversi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed asset pools at much lowercost while o\\xef\\xac\\x80ering solutions to the retirement problem. Firms such as Wealthfront (www.wealthfront.com) and Betterment (www.betterment.com) are cutting out highcost retirement providers using technology while also educating naive small investors. They havebeen followed by the major players such as Vanguard and Schwab. On the lending sidewe have better credit models that enable \\xef\\xac\\x81rms to segment customers whose FICO scoresotherwise excluded them from accessing \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing. Not all subpar FICO scores come fromlowquality borrowers and the ability to tease out the subset that might be of better qualityo\\xef\\xac\\x80ers \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech lenders an opportunity to open up a new lending sector. Interesting approachesare explored in this space for example social media interactions are used to identify goodcustomers as in Wei et al. (2016). Digital footprints may be used to assess individual defaultrisk as shown in Berg et al. (2019). Friendship networks may be exploited in peerlendingschemes as demonstrated in Lin Prabhala and Viswanathan (2013). Firms such as PayActiv18 are disintermediating the payday lending market dropping the costs of borrowing byaround 90%. Big data helps remove biases that often arise with small data and these may beeliminated as discussed in Chowdhry Das and HartmanGlaser (2016). However big dataneeds to be handled carefully as biases within may end up permeating \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech algorithms(O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Neill 2016). Overall consumer \\xef\\xac\\x81nance is ripe for new refreshing improvements drivenby \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech innovation.IV NowcastingForecasting has traditionally been a punctuated process with annual or at best quarterlyforecasts. Macroeconomic forecasts are rarely able to use current data as statistics for grossdomestic product (GDP) in\\xef\\xac\\x82ation unemployment and so forth are usually available onlywith a lag. Moreover these reported statistics are often updated and corrected over timeso they are being revised just as they are being used to make forecasts. This is a shifting18www.payactiv.com19\\x0cFigure 9. Accuracy of forecasts made by the GDPNow model as a function of the nearness of thedate of GDP statistics release. Source Higgins (2014).target comprised of very lowfrequency data.The availability of new sources of almost streaming time series that are correlated withmacroeconomic data has opened up the possibility that forecasting may be undertaken athigh frequency in real time. This approach is known as nowcasting and has been gainingpopularity as a new area in \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech.The Federal Reserve Bank of Atlanta has implemented a nowcasting system known asGDPNow (Higgins 2014). This model forecasts GDP growth by aggregating 13 subcomponentsof the GDP with a chainweighting methodology used by the U.S. Bureau of EconomicAnalysis. The model beats other forecasting approaches and delivers more timely forecasts.Figure 9 shows that the forecasts become more and more accurate as the date of the GDPnumber release nears. For a survey of nowcasting methods see Ba\\xc5\\x84bura et al. (2013).Nowcasting generally involves combining data of di\\xef\\xac\\x80erent frequencies to create as highfrequency a forecast as possible see Giannone Reichlin and Small (2008). In this senseit is akin to ensemble modeling where di\\xef\\xac\\x80erent data are combined to improve predictionaccuracy. In Aastveita et al. (2014) U.S. realtime data are used to produce combined densitynowcasts of quarterly GDP growth based on a system of three commonly used model classes.20\\x0cNowcasts are updated whenever new information is released. Combined density nowcastsalways perform well relative to the model classes in terms of both logarithmic scores andcalibration tests. The density combination approach performs more e\\xef\\xac\\x80ectively than standardapproaches.Another facet of nowcasting is the creation of realtime indices that are nontraded. Ofcourse for traded indices the process of trading itself generates the indicators of value inreal time. But for nontraded indices nowcasting using other traded variables and streamingdata is feasible. For example Chacko Das and Fan (2016) provide a theoretical model inwhich it is possible to generate an illiquidity index from any market sector for which anexchangetraded fund (ETF) exists. In this model liquidity in any market sector is modeledas a set of options related to immediacy of trading. When immediacy is hard to come by inilliquid markets the option to trade perforce has higher value. Converting this option valueinto basis points delivers the price of liquidity as a trading spread. The model is easy toimplement and requires only two inputs at any point in time\\xe2\\x80\\x94the price of the ETF and thenet asset value (NAV) of its underlying holdings both of which are reported daily by ETFs.The formula for the illiquidity index is as followsBILLIQ = \\xe2\\x88\\x9210 000 \\xc3\\x97 ln"#N AVN AV + |ET F \\xe2\\x88\\x92 N AV |(2)where N AV is the net asset value of the exchange traded fund and ET F is its price. In liquidmarkets both ET F and N AV trade very close to each other. However in illiquid markets itis easier to trade the ETF rather than the underlying components (i.e. the NAV). Thereforethe two diverge in price and the formula above picks up this di\\xef\\xac\\x80erence and converts it intoa basis points spread.In\\xef\\xac\\x82ation forecasting has leapfrogged traditional Consumer Price Index (CPI) indicatorsthat have been criticized for two reasons. One they are delayed and infrequent and twothey are often based on outdated baskets of goods and therefore do not represent currentin\\xef\\xac\\x82ation levels. Using easily scraped prices from internet shopping sites various e\\xef\\xac\\x80orts21\\x0care under way to create realtime in\\xef\\xac\\x82ation indices. The Billion Prices project at MIT is afascinating example of this new phenomenon.19These examples suggest that the future of nowcasting is a direct consequence of thegrowing availability of streaming data and the technologies that enable its use. Theseplatforms will eventually provide feature sets that will form the kernel of deep learningtrading systems considered in Section I.V Cybersecurity and Clandestine FintechPeople trust \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutions to keep their wealth and information secure. They alsotrust banks to operate responsibly but that impression of trust erodes with every \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialcrisis. The increasingly digital manifestation of banks has opened them up to hacking andthe nature of theft has changed dramatically. No longer is information security a matter ofsimply maintaining a good \\xef\\xac\\x81rewall. Rogue agents in both digital and human form residedeep inside bank systems and chief information security o\\xef\\xac\\x83cers (CISOs) at banks no longerassume that their \\xef\\xac\\x81rewalls are failsafe. PwC (2014) reports that 45% of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial sectorcompanies experience crime versus an average of 34% in other industries.Cyberthreats to \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial institutions may be categorized into three major forms. Firstthreats come from stateorganized actors. The news is replete with fact and conjecture aboutthe role of statesponsored hacking. Second organized crime has discovered that hacking isa source of easy pro\\xef\\xac\\x81ts at much less risk. When you can break and enter and loot assets orinformation without leaving the comfort of your home it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s easy to see why criminals see thisas a far better (often transnational) enterprise than oldstyle smash and grab.20 Cybercrimehas resulted in stealing information as in the wellknown scandal involving Target.21 The\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBangladesh Bank cyber heist\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in February 2016 entailed \\xef\\xac\\x81ve fake money transfers through19http//www.thebillionpricesproject.com/20Despite this physical bank robberies remain numerous; the FBI reported 3033 in 2018 down from 4251in 2016. See https//www.fbi.gov/investigate/violentcrime/bankrobbery.21The cyber breach of Target resulted in the theft of information of 40 million customers. See http//www.reuters.com/article/ustargetbreachidUSBRE9BH1GX20131219.22\\x0cthe SWIFT network totaling $101 million of which only $38 million was recovered.22 Thebank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account at the Federal Reserve Bank of New York was hacked and the thefts weretraced to Sri Lanka and the Philippines evidence that cybercrime in the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial sectoroperates easily on a global scale. The third actor in \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial cybercrime is rogue bankemployees. These are sleeper agents who gain access to servers as employees and wait for anopportune moment to operationalize their malicious intent. Internal bank security systemsare being geared up to detect suspicious activity inside \\xef\\xac\\x81rewalls.The recent dissemination of cybersecurity protocols by the SANS Institute has laid thegroundwork for a formalized approach. The essential idea is that there are 20 CriticalSecurity Controls (CSCs) that may be measured and then aggregated into a cybersecurityscore.23 This score may now be integrated into a bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s risk management practices. Figure10 shows the di\\xef\\xac\\x80erent CSCs and the overall framework (upper panel). It also shows thevarious tools that are widely used to manage compliance with the CSCs (lower panel).Financial cybercrime has been detailed in popular books. Poulsen (2011) recounts how ahacker in the U.S. Max Butler stole 1.8 million credit card accounts from two Russian crimesyndicates and was eventually caught by the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). (Thiswas lucky for him as he may easily have fallen into the hands of the Russians who mighthave meted out a much worse sentence than the 13 years Butler received.) Menn (2010) tellsthe tale of a dyslexic young Californian who worked with the Feds to counteract hacking and\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial ransom by the Russian mob and the ma\\xef\\xac\\x81a. It also describes how U.K.\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cybercrimeunits proved to be e\\xef\\xac\\x80ective against Russian hackers. In the area of cybercrime in \\xef\\xac\\x81nancefact reads like thriller \\xef\\xac\\x81ction.Finally a discussion of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial cybercrime would be incomplete without mentioning therole of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdark web.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A large amount of clandestine \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech occurs on the dark web whichresides on the dark net\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is networks on the web that require special handshaking software to connect servers (closed versus open protocols). Most of our normal daily experience22https//en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bangladesh_Bank_robbery23https//www.sans.org/media/criticalsecuritycontrols/criticalcontrolsposter2016.pdf23\\x0cFigure 10. SANS Institute Critical Security Controls (CSCs) shown in the top diagram. The bottom diagram shows the various tools used for compliance with the CSCs. See https//www.sans.org/media/criticalsecuritycontrols/criticalcontrolsposter2016.pdf.See alsohttps//www.sans.org/securityresources/posters/20criticalsecuritycontrols/55/download.24\\x0cinvolves the complement of the dark net i.e. the clear net. The dark net is a subnet of theinternet where people connect servers to each other via private networks. The deep web isa subset of the internet that is not indexable by search engines. While di\\xef\\xac\\x80erent from thedark web there is some overlap of dark and deep webs. The role of the dark web is to makeagents who interact safe from detection\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is it ensures anonymity and nontraceabilityof the source of activities on the web. As one might imagine money laundering relies heavilyon the dark net. For a detailed treatment of the dark net see Bartlett (2014).An example of the dark side of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech evolving on the dark net is the creation of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctumblers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which are services to hide the source of transactions in Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies. By sending transactions through a tumbler one can mask origination. Tumblersmix up transactions by acting as intermediaries and take a fee for doing so. These are algorithmic services and may also be bundled automatically with some cryptocurrencies suchas Cloakcoin (appropriately named!). Because the blockchain is a public distributed andimmutable transaction ledger it makes tracing a transaction possible rather than otherwise.It is the fact that it is decentralized and does not need a single recording agency who controlstransactions and can change rules at a whim that make it attractive. Contrary to popularbelief it is because the blockchain does not guarantee anonymity that the role of tumblershas become widespread.VI Fraud Detection and PreventionAn interesting aspect of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial crime is that it mostly allows the perpetrators to be removedfrom the scene of the crime. Online fraud is an excellent example of this phenomenon.Much of credit card fraud now occurs on shopping sites and the old business of makingcopies of charge cards with stolen credit card numbers is quickly turning irrelevant.24 Muchof the fraud occurs in three ways account takeovers synthetic ID use and business eInhttps//www.fbi.gov/filerepository/24Despite the increase in cybercrime bank robberies continue to occur at high rates.there were more than 4000 bank robberiessee2016bankcrimestatistics2016.pdf/view.25\\x0cmail compromise and the number of successful attempts has risen 34% from 2013 to 2016(Hasham Hayden and Wavra 2018).Online \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial fraud management begins with record keeping and it is essential thatall online activity be logged so that traceback is possible. Strict authentication is importanttoo. Many \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial platforms are designed around multifactor authentication as in thepopular twostep veri\\xef\\xac\\x81cation implemented by many banks and asset management \\xef\\xac\\x81rms.Endtoend encryption is necessary to prevent a maninthemiddle attack. Authenticationis implemented in many ways using tokens passwords PIN codes digital keys biometricsand so forth. Many digital wallets today embed multiple digital passwords often three andcan be unlocked with at least two of these which o\\xef\\xac\\x80ers a high level of security.25However authentication is a futile process if someone has stolen information through adata breach because the authentication system will not detect a malicious use of validlyaccessed data. Activity analysis is needed and additional data might be brought to bear.For example stolen credit card numbers o\\xef\\xac\\x80er an online thief full access to purchasing powerso they need to be detected through recognizing that an attempted purchase does not followthe user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standard behavior patterns. This is the realm in which ML has proven to beextremely e\\xef\\xac\\x80ective especially when alternative data are used. Solutions in this space comefrom using social media to detect anomalous behavior noticing di\\xef\\xac\\x80erent devices unexpectedpatterns in email use unusual locations of use of the credit card from standard ones andso on. This is also known as the \\xef\\xac\\x81eld of adaptive behavioral analytics epitomized by \\xef\\xac\\x81rmssuch as Bionym EyeVerify and BioCatch.26As we have seen the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst layer in fraud prevention is authentication which is relatedto cybersecurity. As is well known this is proving to be a hard problem as \\xef\\xac\\x81rewalls andaccounts are breached in large numbers. A second layer of fraud detection lies in using varied25Sometimes these levels of security may be breached when hackers \\xef\\xac\\x81nd holes in the code for the walletapplication itself as occurred in July 2017 in the case of the Parity wallet see https//www.coindesk.com/30millionetherreportedstolenparitywalletbreach/. About $30 million of Ether (ETH) wasstolen.26See https//techcrunch.com/2015/08/23/nextgencybersecurityisallaboutbehaviorrecognition/.26\\x0cdata and conducting behavioral analysis which is not easy to do and requires extensivedata curation. A third aspect of the problem lies in the di\\xef\\xac\\x83culty of training ML algorithmsto detect fraud. Algorithms that use big data in fraud detection are trained on highlyimbalanced data sets. For example detecting credit card fraud is fraught with imbalancedcategories. The rate of fraudulent transactions in this realm is \\xe2\\x88\\xbc0.10%\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is 1 in1000 transactions is fraudulent which means the data have 999 zeros for every 1 binaryoutcome. Precision and recall are very di\\xef\\xac\\x83cult to control in such data settings and falsepositives are rampant. These \\xe2\\x80\\x9canomaly detection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d problems have been addressed throughnew techniques such as topological data analysis (TDA) popularized by the \\xef\\xac\\x81rm Ayasdi.27Other techniques have been developed by \\xef\\xac\\x81rms such as Simility.28 Various ML techniquesare used from oversampling to boosting to deep learning to random forests. Overall frauddetection is addressed with an interesting cocktail of authentication behavioral modelingdevice monitoring and anomaly detection using ML on big data.VII Payment and Funding SystemsDigital payments have changed the way in which we move money around but they have alsochanged our concept of money. Starting with PayPal we now exchange money on severalplatforms and bypass the banking system. Since then we have many such services\\xe2\\x80\\x94forexample Venmo Apple Pay Samsung Pay Google Pay Dwolla and more.This disintermediation takes many forms but is leaving an electronic payment trail thatis making black markets nervous. See for example the recent demonetization of the 500and 1000 rupee notes in India. Transacting in cash was hampered and millions were lost inconcealed currency hoards mostly used for property transactions. However it also gave riseto new transacting systems with digital payments such as the Paytm platform. In 2015 theIndian central bank gave Paytm authorization to open a payments bank known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPaytmPayments Bank Limited\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. As of writing Paytm now has more than 250 million wallets in27https//www.ayasdi.com/28https//simility.com/27\\x0cits transaction stream.Another form of paymentsdriven disintermediation comes from disruption in the payday lending space from \\xef\\xac\\x81rms such as PayActiv.29 This \\xef\\xac\\x81rm works with employers to issueadvances against earned wages to lowincome employees part of a package of o\\xef\\xac\\x80erings thatreduces \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial stress for people who live from paycheck to paycheck. It is estimated thatof a U.S. workforce of approximately 130 million people who receive a paycheck about twothirds live from one pay cycle to the next and are unable to withstand temporary cash \\xef\\xac\\x82owshocks. These people are victims of payday lenders who charge them annualized fundingrates of 400%\\xe2\\x80\\x93500%. Disintermediation by \\xef\\xac\\x81rms such as PayActiv results in driving thoseborrowing costs down to onetenth or less.The lending space is also being disintermediated by p2p markets. These electronic markets connect individual lenders and borrowers directly and because they bypass large institutions that have high overheads they have the opportunity to o\\xef\\xac\\x80er cheaper loans. Interestrates are set by the p2p platform through analysis of borrower data or through competition among lenders using reverse auctions. Prosper30 is one of the oldest such platformsoperating for more than a decade.It supports small loans mostly less than $5000 andmake extensive use of borrower data. Most p2p lending platforms include borrower/lenderanonymity provide loan pricing support o\\xef\\xac\\x80er lenders autonomy in picking their borrowersand allow for both secured and unsecured lending. Administrative services such as recording credit checking and online automation are standard. Targeted lending using big dataand ML brings greater bene\\xef\\xac\\x81ts to lenders (Crespo Naveira and Kwon 2018).Fintech also enables new venture \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing through crowdfunding. Top sites for this areGoFundMe31 KickStarter32 indiegogo33 Kiva.34. Crowdfunding results in more than $35billion of fundraising per year. The platforms usually take 5%\\xe2\\x80\\x9310% of the money raised29https//www.payactiv.com/.30https//www.prosper.com/.31https//www.gofundme.com/32https//www.kickstarter.com/33https//grow.indiegogo.com/34http//www.kiva.org/28\\x0cas their fee so in terms of pro\\xef\\xac\\x81t this is at least a $1\\xe2\\x80\\x93$2 billion business. There mayalso be a processing fee added so this parallels underwriting fees charged by investmentbanks. Payment system technologies represent one of the fastest growing areas of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialdisintermediation but their success will eventually depend on whether they are truly ableto o\\xef\\xac\\x80er payment services at cost levels much below that of traditional players. These costswill also be adapted through AIdriven pricing (Rizzi Wang and Zielinski 2018).VIII Automated and HighFrequency TradingWhereas \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech is new terminology highfrequency trading (HFT) has been around for a longtime marking some of the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst hightech advances in \\xef\\xac\\x81nance. TradeWorx35 and AutomatedTrading Desk (ATD bought by Citibank for $680 million in 2007) were pioneers in the \\xef\\xac\\x81eld.Algorithmic trading now accounts for 50% of executed trades in the equity markets downfrom around twothirds of stock trades in the late 2000s. Estimates vary of course andAldridge and Krawciw (2017) estimate the share of market trading at closer to 40%. Thepro\\xef\\xac\\x81ts from algorithmic trading are under competitive pressure and regulatory oversight.There is a vast academic literature on HFT and several debates surround this somewhatundertheradar \\xef\\xac\\x81eld. Some of the highlights are as follows. First since 2013 twothirds ofthe top 30 cited papers on HFTs show positive market e\\xef\\xac\\x80ects from highfrequency traders.Second automated \\xef\\xac\\x81rms reduced trading costs and contrary to popular opinion improvedmarket depth and stability. Third new research is possible because various forms of highfrequency streaming \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech data have become available. Tickbytick data sets are now muchmore prevalent and \\xef\\xac\\x81rms are working with academics much more closely than in the past.Fourth there is now evidence that HFTs stabilize markets (Hendershott and Riordan 2013)HFTs improve market quality and reduce bidask spreads (Hasbrouck and Saar 2013) andHFTs reduce trading costs (Menkveld 2013). Fifth trading in dark pools has been prevalentfor quite a while but has changed form many times as risks and technologies evolve. For a35http//www.tradeworx.com/29\\x0ctheoretical analysis of this activity see Buti Rindi and Werner (2017).This latest manifestation of the older \\xef\\xac\\x81eld of market microstructure is here to stay. ItIt is also blamed for market disruptions such asis being reinvented through technology.the \\xef\\xac\\x82ash crash of May 6 2010 which lasted all of a half hour in afternoon trading whenthe indexes crashed and rebounded hitting several market triggers and transferring vastamounts of pro\\xef\\xac\\x81t/loss between trading accounts. Markets are also being transformed as abetter understanding of these trading models on new trading platforms is creating (hopefully)marketplaces that are treating small players more fairly than in the past. A good exampleis the creation of the Investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Exchange (IEX) immortalized in the book Flash Boys byMichael Lewis (2014).Looking ahead the big changes anticipated in HFT are (1) an increase in regulation (2)a reduction in pro\\xef\\xac\\x81ts from competition (3) lower relevance on sheer speed of execution (4)a greater role for the use of myriad sources of information (5) the entry of deep learningand AI (6) a reduced human role in favor of greater automation and (7) an emphasis onhardware over software.IX Blockchains and CryptocurrenciesOn August 13 2017 the price of cryptocurrency Bitcoin (BTC) surged above $4000. Thiswas a 20% increase over the previous week after a plan to speed up trade execution wasagreed upon. The new solution denoted SegWit2x36 has been a bone of contention inthe BTC community. However trade execution under older protocols was slow and thisinnovation is going to be a game changer. Nevertheless trading BTC is still fraught with risk.The daily volatility of BTC is around 5% much higher than gold (1.2%) major currencies(0.5%\\xe2\\x80\\x931%) or tech stocks 1%\\xe2\\x80\\x932%. And a few months later on November 29 2017 theprice of BTC broke the $10000 price barrier an astounding price rise for any currency. Itramped up to almost $20000 in midDecember 2017 but then dropped drastically to below36https//segwit2x.github.io/30\\x0c$7000 by February 2018. It has remained around that level ever since after dropping evenlower towards the end of 2018 followed by a resurgence to $10000 at the end of the thirdquarter in 2019. Of course there is no clear sense as to where its eventual trading range lies.We do not have a good model for pricing BTC using fundamentals.Blockchains and cryptocurrencies are distinct things. A blockchain is a distributed ledgerthat has four properties. It has decentralized validation. It is immutable\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is the recordmay not be changed. It is secure\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is tamper proof. It is trusted37 such that only validtransactions will enter the ledger and it will prevent double spending. It is also a ledger ona p2p network.A cryptocurrency is a medium of exchange and a store of value just like \\xef\\xac\\x81at currenciesthough legally it is a security and may be thought of as an asset class. Transactions in thiscurrency are recorded on the blockchain. BTC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s inventor is as yet unknown though theoriginal paper on which it is based is attributed to Nakamoto (2009). BTCs are traceablebut generally o\\xef\\xac\\x80er anonymity through masking methods. Whether BTC is a currency or aspeculative asset has been debated in Yermack (2015).Transactions in cryptocurrencies on the blockchain are secured by encryption methodsand transactions are recorded in a decentralized set of nodes after approval. Approval of atransaction occurs when a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cminer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d processes a transaction block by adding a number (thenonce) to a variablelength transaction and then solves a hashing problem to generate a\\xef\\xac\\x81xedlength (256 bits) hash with a set number of leading zeros (required to be 17 at thecurrent time). This random guessing takes computational power (and electricity) and isrewarded with a set number of BTCs which is BTC 12.5 as of writing. This mining processproduces a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproof of work\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that validates the transaction block. With today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s technology ablock is solved every ten minutes.Transaction volumes in BTC are currently quite low about 1.5\\xe2\\x80\\x932.0 transactions persecond (tps) or roughly 300000 transactions per day versus PayPal at 125 tps and Visa at37Sometimes this is called the opposite a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrustless\\xe2\\x80\\x9d system because there is no need for a trusted playerin the middle of all other transacting entities.31\\x0c4000 tps. However the technology is now widely accepted and way beyond mere proof ofconcept. It forms a core part of modernday \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech.A broader theme for the future is that the blockchain o\\xef\\xac\\x80ers a networked platform onwhich decentralized and automatic contracting is made possible. This has been implementedmost famously on the Ethereum platform which is a programmable blockchain. Anyone cancreate a smart contract on the Ethereum chain using the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM)and proof of work is rewarded with the cryptocurrency ETH used for payments and feeson the platform. For example one may establish a trading exchange on Ethereum andcontracts can be automatically settled on the platform once the program is so designed.It allows anonymous trading while still permitting a regulator to get an overall picture ofrisk concentration in the market thereby allowing for systemic risk management. Anotherexample of the use of the Ethereum platform is in real estate contracts. Several bene\\xef\\xac\\x81tsexist such as title veri\\xef\\xac\\x81cation settlement shared equity in properties and liquid trading ofreal estate assets.Ethereum has also supported the growth of decentralized autonomous organizations(DAOs) where group arrangements are explicitly contracted on the Ethereum blockchain assmart contracts. One in particular known as the DAO (same name) was instituted to bea $150 million venture fund invested in by thousands of people in a crowdsourced success.It was however hacked in 2016 and several millions of ETH were stolen but later restoredby canceling the stolen ETH on the chain and resetting the blockchain which is in directviolation of the principle of immutability. This resulted in a hard fork in the Ethereumblockchain. However the hack was a result of weak security on the DAO side not on thatof the Ethereum blockchain. The Parity wallet was hacked on Ethereum for $31 million(in July 2017). Another $150 million was vulnerable but white hat hackers stepped in andhacked those accounts out to save them in a strange situation where the disease itself provided the remedy.38 These issues have not been addressed by regulators who are strugglingto keep pace. Recently the SEC ruled that tokens issued by DAO were to be treated as38https//medium.freecodecamp.org/ahackerstole31mofetherhowithappenedandwhatitmeansforethereum9e5dc29e33ce32\\x0csecurities and are now regulated by federal law. A cynical viewpoint is that after regulationcryptocurrencies will end up following the old rules of money in a new digital setting.Another \\xef\\xac\\x81nance application that has grown rapidly are initial coin o\\xef\\xac\\x80erings (ICOs).These are analogous to a preproduct sale where coins are issued on a blockchain as a storeof future value. These will also attract regulation by the SEC and there have been 46 ICOsin July 2017 alone. The SEC recently declared that ICOs are securities. Volumes in ICOsare doubling annually. In 2018 by June 30 537 ICOs ($13.7 billion) were registered. In2017 there were a total of 552 ICOs ($7.0 billion). The average size of an ICO has doubledfrom $12.8 million in 2017 to more than $25.5 million in 2018.39Companies such as Numerai40 have created their own cryptocurrency (called a Numeraire) which investors in their crowdsourced hedged fund may use for investments withdrawals transaction fees and payments to developers of trading algorithms they may investin. This cryptocurrency was made possible by hosting it on the Ethereum blockchain.We are no longer in the nascent stages of the blockchain revolution but there is stilllargescale innovation in this space. It is likely that there will be vast changes in \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialcontracting trading risk management and corporate \\xef\\xac\\x81nance all implemented on blockchaininfrastructure. For a comprehensive outlook on the disruptive (and bene\\xef\\xac\\x81cial) potential ofblockchains see Harvey (2014) Yermack (2017).X Text AnalyticsAn important area of \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech lies in applications that use \\xe2\\x80\\x9calternative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d data.Textual data greatly expand the universe of available data from the merely numerical.The starting point of any text analysis is the quanti\\xef\\xac\\x81cation of textual data\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is amapping from words and documents to mathematical abstractions such as vectors matricesand tensors. The goal is to elucidate qualitative inferences and predictions after suitable39https//cointelegraph.com/news/pwcreportfindsthat2018icovolumeisalreadydoublethatofpreviousyear40https//medium.com/numerai/anaihedgefundgoesliveonethereuma80470c6b68133\\x0cmathematical transformations.There are several areas in which text analytics is now being applied in \\xef\\xac\\x81nance. For arecent survey see Das (2014). I will discuss some of these applications in this section. Sourcesof text fall into three categories (1) blogs forums and wikis (2) news and (3) contentgenerated by \\xef\\xac\\x81rms. Early work tended to focus on sentiment extraction using postingson stock message boards such as Yahoo! Raging Bull Motley Fool and Silicon Investor.Sentiment is also extracted from news sections in the Wall Street Journal and the Dow Jonesand Reuters news services. These sources were at least at daily frequency. More recentlytext streams have become available in real time and Twitter has become a happy huntingground for sentiment analysts. Bollen Mao and Zeng (2011) state that they can predict thedirection of the Dow Jones index with 87% accuracy using tweets. Since then there havebeen a slew of papers using tweets each with mixed success.Predicting market direction is one of the obvious \\xef\\xac\\x81rst uses of text mining and considerable energy has been devoted to this goal. Early research by Antweiler and Frank (2004)and Das and Chen (2007) constructed a bullishness indexB = nB \\xe2\\x88\\x92 nSnB + nS(3)where nB nS is the number of messages categorized as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbuy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9csell\\xe2\\x80\\x9d respectively. Thismeasure is also often called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpolarity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This research shows that it is hard to predict marketdirection using message board postings but there is a somewhat weak prediction of volatility.Since then much more attention has been directed towards using tweets instead. All theseinitial forays into sentiment analysis of stocks \\xef\\xac\\x81rmly placed textual analysis in \\xef\\xac\\x81nance onto\\xef\\xac\\x81rm footing.Extensive use is made of corporate textual data for asset management. Data are extractedfrom the vast universe of regulatory corporate \\xef\\xac\\x81lings such as 10K and 10Q forms. Seepapers by Loughran and McDonald (2011) Burdick et al. (2011) Bodnaruk et al. (2015)Jegadeesh and Wu (2013) and Loughran and McDonald (2014). These papers found thatspecial words lists known as lexicons were indeed useful in determining the sentiment34\\x0cembedded in annual reports. For example a count of riskrelated words in annual reportsis a good predictor of poor performance in subsequent quarters. Papers by Calomiris andMamaysky (2019) and Froot et al. (2017) show that textual information from largescalemedia sources coupled with market information provides strong predictability of marketdirection.Another interesting development emanates from quantifying \\xe2\\x80\\x9creadability\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of annual reports. It turns out that metrics for readability of text are useful in predicting corporate performance and the less readable an annual report is the worse a \\xef\\xac\\x81rm performs. Readabilitywas originally quanti\\xef\\xac\\x81ed by researchers in linguistics and measures such as the GunningFogindex (Gunning 1952) have become popular as they are robust measures of readability. Theformula for the Fog index is" #W ords#Sentences0.4 \\xc3\\x97#+ 100 \\xc2\\xb7 #ComplexW ords#W ords(4)The formula returns a number that indicates the number of years of schooling needed to beable to comprehend the text. In other words it also renders the grade level at which thetext is written. The intuition for why low readability of annual reports correlates with poorperformance is that when a \\xef\\xac\\x81rm has bad news to convey it tends to obfuscate as much aspossible in its \\xef\\xac\\x81lings (e.g. 10K). Subsequent research also found that longer annual reportdiscussion (in number of characters) was also an indicator of poor subsequent performance;in fact it was even better than poor readability. Once again clearly obfuscation comes moreeasily with longwinded writing than with short pithy text. Finally research shows thatcounting characters is unnecessary. Simply looking at the \\xef\\xac\\x81le size of the annual report onthe SEC server is a good sorting characteristic. Bigger \\xef\\xac\\x81le sizes predict poor performance.News analytics is also widely used to enhance asset management. This domain dealswith the measurement of qualitative and quantitative attributes of unstructured news articles. Leinweber (2009) and Leinweber and Sisk (2011) o\\xef\\xac\\x80er extensive discussion on newsanalyticsbased trading strategies. Tetlock SaarTsechansky and Macskassay (2008) showthat the number of negative words forecasts negative earnings and news stories that focus35\\x0con fundamentals are more informative than other articles. For a comprehensive treatmentof news analytics see Mitra and Mitra (2011).Prediction of corporate or banking failures has the potential to save vast sums of money.In recent work Das Kim and Kothari (2019) show how early warning signals may beextracted from text by analyzing emails of senior management in a \\xef\\xac\\x81rm. Using Enron as atest case they propose a \\xe2\\x80\\x9czerorevelation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d technology where a software program can analyzeemails for their qualitative characteristics such as sentiment quantitative characteristics suchas size and frequency spatial aspects such as networks or aggregate focus through extractingtopics. Because the program reads and provides an aggregate analysis without revealingthe contents of the emails this is a noninvasive approach that may be used by corporatemanagement or a regulator to predict \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial malaise early thereby adding value to a \\xef\\xac\\x81rm\\xe2\\x80\\x99srisk management process.The main features of such an approach are as follows. (1) Financials are often delayedindicators of corporate quality. (2) Internal discussion may be used as an early warningsystem for upcoming corporate malaise.(3) Emails have the potential to predict suchevents. (4) Software can analyze vast quantities of textual data not amenable to humanprocessing. (5) Corporate senior management may also use these analyses to better predictand manage impending crisis for their \\xef\\xac\\x81rms. (6) Most important the approach requires zerorevelation of emails.The empirical analysis of Enron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emails primarily covers two years 2000 and 2001.Enron failed in the fourth quarter of 2001 so this is the period before and during the crisisthe \\xef\\xac\\x81rm faced. Some clear results emanate.(1) As Enron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s condition worsens emailsare shorter in length. (2) Likewise Enron\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sentiment extracted from emails drops a fewmonths before the crisis and continues into it. (3) It is interesting that the length of seniormanagement emails is a better predictor of demise than is sentiment although both areuseful. (4) It is also interesting that plotting the frequency of usage of words over time alsotells a story. The word losses sees more frequent usage than average in the crisis periodand the inverse is true for the word pro\\xef\\xac\\x81ts. For example see the word credit plotted against36\\x0cFigure 11.Interactive system to plot any word over time if the word appears in the corpusof emails from Enron for 2000 and 2001. Here we plot the word credit. Source Das Kim andKothari (2019).sentiment for the two years in the data set; these track very closely as shown in Figure 11.(v) A topic analysis also shows that negative topics become more prevalent as we approachthe crisis versus positive topics. (vi) Finally the email network for 2000 looks very di\\xef\\xac\\x80erentfrom that in 2001.There are myriad applications for textual alternative data. Natural language processingusing deep learning has become an important recent use of text in \\xef\\xac\\x81nance. Text is beingclassi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed to generate early warning signals about company actions predict the e\\xef\\xac\\x80ect on thestock price after an announcement. Since these new data features add value many hedgefunds add textual features as an overlay to their trading algorithms.XI Concluding Comments The Good and the BadIn this \\xef\\xac\\x81nal section I consider two important issues that arise around \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech labor marketchanges and implementation pitfalls along the \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech path.37\\x0cI The Finance Labor MarketFintech is a potential disruptor of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services labor market which accounts for6%\\xe2\\x80\\x937% of U.S. employment. AI and ML will erode many of these jobs. However the debateon whether we will see the process evolve through intelligence augmentation (IA) versus AI(arti\\xef\\xac\\x81cal intelligence) is still open. The former will lead to less job loss. It may be easier toreplace highend trading jobs (through AI) than lowend customer service roles (IA). Firmsare recording traders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 keystrokes and screens and using the data to train algorithms to mimictraders. These arti\\xef\\xac\\x81cial agents are able to improve through techniques such as reinforcementlearning. These algorithms can analyze a certain type of data far more deeply than a humancan but they are also poorer at considering a breadth of data though they may eventuallybe engineered to do so.41 In contrast chatbots to replace customer service agents have along way to go before they are good enough to replace humans. Middlelevel jobs such asparalegal work in securities contract checking is being eliminated with algorithms that havelower error rates. This corresponds to Autor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (2015) hypothesis that while very lowendand very highend jobs will remain several middlelevel jobs will be lost such as \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialanalysts routine trading functions paralegals human resources roles loan o\\xef\\xac\\x83cers \\xef\\xac\\x81nancialadvisers and so forth.Ray Kurzweil has predicted the supremacy of machines the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSingularity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which hesuggested will occur in 2045. Norbert Wiener famously said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe can be humble and live agood life with the aid of machines or we can be arrogant and die.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d42 Setting these ominousfears aside we may dig deeper into the kinds of jobs that seem to be getting winnowedaway. A cynical hypothesis has been put forward by Graeber (2018) that there are legions of\\xe2\\x80\\x9cbullshit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d jobs that are \\xef\\xac\\x81nally being eliminated such as corporate lawyers \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial advisersand so on. These are jobs that would make no di\\xef\\xac\\x80erence were they to disappear; in factpeople doing these jobs know this and bear a psychological stigma as a consequence.43I41https//www.marketwatch.com/story/aiwillchangestockmarkettradingbutitcantwipeouttheroleofpeople2018051542https//www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/science/mitscholars1949essayonmachineageisfound.html43Graeber \\xef\\xac\\x81rst espoused these ideas in an essay titled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOn the Phenomenon of Bullshit Jobs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d https38\\x0chave a simple hypothesis for which jobs will be lost if the job generates data then an AIagent can be trained on that data to replace the human. This is what we see happeningwith trading jobs paralegal work and more.Understandably there will be jobs where \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech will keep the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chuman in the loop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d(HITL). These are jobs where consideration of nonstandard cases is required or where ahuman is needed in the loop to avoid legal liability\\xe2\\x80\\x93for example risk managers. Such jobsmay escape \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctechnological unemployment.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dII Pitfalls for FintechWhile \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech heralds the new age of \\xef\\xac\\x81nance it is by no means widely prevalent as yet andis certainly not the panacea for all open issues. While it is both an improving force and adisruptive one it needs to be implemented thoughtfully. Here I brie\\xef\\xac\\x82y survey seven pitfallsto avoid when implementing \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech.First the garbagein garbageout (GIGO) problem. Fintech is consuming more and moredata but it needs to be good data. Without \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdata curation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial analyses will producepoorquality output. This issue is itself being addressed with new technologies where MLis being used to clean data generating better quality inputs as well as reducing the dataengineering cycle drastically. This is discussed extensively in Alexander et al. (2017) andtechnically companies such as Tamr44 and Paxata45 o\\xef\\xac\\x80er excellent solutions.Second we have information overload. This comprises collecting too much data andnot using them properly. An antidote for this is good theoretical modeling which suggestsexactly what data should be provided to the algorithm. This approach transcribes the scopeof the data needed. It may also save money as a \\xef\\xac\\x81rm may be able to move from distributedcomputing to using a single large and fast machine. Testing trading models and properbacktesting will help in improving signaltonoise ratios. Tools for this are becoming widely//strikemag.org/bullshitjobs/. The arrival of AI coincides now with the book on the same idea.44https//www.tamr.com/45https//www.paxata.com/39\\x0cavailable and businesses such as Quantopian46 and Numerai47 are making these widelyavailable so that trading ideas may be crowdsourced\\xe2\\x80\\x94another e\\xef\\xac\\x80ective antidote to processinginhuman quantities of market information.Third big is not better. More data does not mean better results; quality matters.However AI and deep learning are making it possible to let machines make sense of largescale data. Simple applications in the consumer \\xef\\xac\\x81nance space are seeing positive results fromthe use of deep learning on large data especially in the area of anomaly detection as wehave seen with \\xef\\xac\\x81rms such as Ayasdi and Simility.Fourth separating correlation from causality. In the search for predictive analytics theuse of big data is turning up better predictive models but these are untraced to the causeof predictability and are largely atheoretic. Given this \\xef\\xac\\x81rms revisit their models on muchtighter review cycles in order to ensure that they are still viable for trading. This issuebecomes especially acute when considering streaming data in HFT.Fifth the infrastructure for \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech is expensive and once a \\xef\\xac\\x81rm dips its toes in thewater it is required to go all in else it becomes impossible to get good results. HFT forexample requires an increasingly expensive investment in hardware and communicationstechnology. Deep learning platforms require outlays for expensive chips such as arrays ofGPUs. Blockchain infrastructure requires electricitygreedy specialpurpose hardware. Thelist goes on and on. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an arms race.Sixth trust is a huge issue in adoption. Fintech o\\xef\\xac\\x80erings tend to hand o\\xef\\xac\\x80 previoushumandriven functions to technology\\xe2\\x80\\x94for example replacing tellers with ATMs and onlinebanking. Cryptocurrencies are completely based on trust where trust is transferred from acentralized and regulated repository to trust in technology and decentralization. Withouttrusted algorithms and data \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech will fail (Thakor and Merton 2018). Any \\xef\\xac\\x81rm developinga new \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech business must consider how it will implement trust through technology.Seventh while technology can be used to improve experience more often than not the46https//www.quantopian.com/.47https//numer.ai/.40\\x0copposite is the result. Excessive misdirected automation can lead to a terrible customerexperience. A case in point is the widespread use of chatbots for customer service interactions where the quality range is huge. Roboadvising is another area in which carefuldesign of the interface becomes necessary. Firms are using design thinking to ensure thatcustomers are wellserved in \\xef\\xac\\x81ntechdriven businesses. Finance houses need to become muchmore consumercentric and use design thinking as actively as tech companies like Apple do.I end with the following prediction Finance companies will eventually become quasitechnology \\xef\\xac\\x81rms.41\\x0cReferencesAastveita K.A.
