b"herein file   M  &  D  FORUM     SME Financing of the Postcrisis Era in China Based on Blue Ocean Strategy    MENG Lizhen Guangxi University of Finance and Economics Guangxi P.R.China 530003  Abstract  This  paper  deeply  analyzed  the  financing  characteristics  of  small  and  mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) in China and the new challenges they faced. Based on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlue Ocean Strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d some countermeasures were put forward to  improve the financing capability of  SMEs  in  China. In this way the cooperation among the government financial institutions and SMEs can be promoted. Meanwhile the problem of the financing difficulty in SMEs can be solved to facilitate them to develop healthily and sustainably. Keywords Postcrisis era SME (small and mediumsized enterprise) Financing Blue Ocean Strategy  1 Introduction  Recently  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs)  in  China  have  developed  rapidly.  However compared  with  large  enterprises  SMEs  show obvious  competitive  weakness  of  the  business  operation and  the  financing  difficulty  is  still  an  important  factor restricting  their  development.  Especially  in  the postcrisis  era  the  financing  cost  of  SMEs  increases  sharply  which  prevents  them  from  sustainable development  and  growth.  Hence  the  traditional  thinking  mode  should  be  broken  and  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlue  Ocean Strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  should  be  encouraged  to  help  SMEs  to  break  their  development  bottleneck.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlue  Ocean Strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  comes  from  the  book  Blue  Ocean  Strategy  written  by  two  professors  of  W.  Chan  Kim  and Renee Mauborgne in 2005. Under the framework of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlue Ocean Strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d enterprises need to create in the  practice  through  the  value  innovation.  That  is  they  are  expected  to  widen  the  current  market boundary and expand the requirement space to seek more broad new market. By doing in this way not by conducting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRed Sea\\xe2\\x80\\x9d competition with opponents they can keep the enterprise profit increasing.        2 The Financing Characteristics of SMEs in China in the Postcrisis Era  The number of SMEs accounts for over 99% in the total enterprises in China and SMEs contribute more than  50%  to  the  tax  revenue.  Meanwhile  their  contribution  rate  to  GDP  (Gross  Domestic  Product)  is over  60%.  Besides  they  provide  82%  of  the  new  product  development  and  80%  of  the  urban  posts1. SMEs contribute more to the sustained and stable growth of the national economy. But at the same time their financing difficulty also becomes increasingly notable as follows (1) Compared with large and medium enterprises small and micro businesses (simply called as SMB in the rest sections) show high loan financing demand. In 2011 the loan balance of SMB was 10800 billion yuan  with  the  yearonyear  growth  of  25.8%.  The  growth  speed  was  higher  than  that  of  the  large enterprise loan 14.2% and that of the medium enterprise loan 12.5%2. In 2012 the loan balance of SMB was 11580 billion yuan with the yearonyear growth of 16.6%. The growth speed was higher than that of the large enterprise loan 8% and that of the medium enterprise loan 1% in the same term3.     (2)  SMEs  show  the  single  financing  channel.  Their  main  capital  source  is  the  internal  financing including  the  following  ways  their  own  capital  capital  from  relatives  and  friends  and  the  profit retention etc. The main external financing channel is financing institutions like banks etc.  That is they                                                          1  The  chairman  Lai  Xiaomin  in  China  Huarong  Asset  Management  Co.

(3) Financing problems SMEs face are diverse  in different regions. Besides the economic level  in each region  this  is  also  related  with  the  formulation  and  the  implementation  of  relevant  policies  in  each region.    3 New Challenges    3.1 The financing crisis caused by the nonstandard private lending As a financing means with simple operation and abundant resources private lending plays an important role in relieving the current situation of inadequate bank credit funds. In the postcrisis era SMEs show insufficient capital but the financing cost and the threshold of financing institutions like banks and so on increase gradually. As a result to maintain the business SMEs have to conduct the financing  of private lending  from  small  and  mediumsized  lending  companies.  But  the  loan  pressure  of  high  interest  rate usually  becomes  the  root  cause  of  SME  entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cescape\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  without  paying  off  debts.  So  the nonstandard  private  lending  market  is  prone  to  cause  the  crisis  of  SME  capital  chain  break  and  the financing risk increases thereby.    3.2 The asset crisis caused by SME credit risk   SMEs  in  China  are  small  in  scale  and  short  in  survival  time.  Besides  the  corresponding  financial management  system  is  poor  and the  daily  operation  management  is  largely  influenced  by  the  external environment. All the factors increase the possibility of the credit risk to some degree which leads to the asset  risk  of  SMEs.  For  example  in  2011  a  SME  entrepreneur  in  Wenzhou  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cescaped\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  because  of the capital chain crisis of the private lending. After this incident many indexes of financial data declined in Wenzhou.  Among  the  indexes  the  nonperforming  loan  ratio  (NPLR)  of  financial  institutions  was 0.55% with the link relative growth of 0.18%. This was the first growth in the recent 10 years4. In July 2012  NPLR  of  financial  institutions  in  Wenzhou  rose  to  2.85%.  In  terms  of  enterprises  the nonperforming  loan  was  mainly  concentrated  in  small  enterprises  and  medium  enterprises  with  the nonperforming  loan  balance  reaching  to  6.668  billion  yuan  and  7.939  billion  yuan  respectively.  The nonperforming loan balance of SMEs accounted for 81.62% of the total nonperforming loan balance in which NPLR of small enterprises was 76.99%5.  3.3 The sharp increase of the SME financing cost In  the  postcrisis  era  China  mainly  implements  prudent  monetary  policies  and  the  credit  scale  is restrained. Thus the cost and threshold of the loan financing are much higher for enterprises. Compared with  large enterprises with largescale  loan and stable profit SMEs present weak loan bargaining right due to lack of  mortgaged goods poor antirisk capability and unstable profitability etc. The  financing cost reduction effect caused by Central Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest cut in 2012 was mostly to the advantages of large enterprises. At present the borrowing cost is among 5%10% for 59.4% of SMEs and for over 40% of SMEs the cost even exceeds 10%6. Therefore in 2013 the financing of SMEs is still full of challenges.    4 Blue Ocean Strategy the  Important  Strategic Choice of the SME  Financing in China in the Postcrisis Era    4.1 Improving the cooperative mechanism among enterprises SMEs  should  improve  the  cooperative  awareness.  They  are  expected  to  make  full  use  of  relevant                                                          4  China Securities Journal The nonperforming loan of Wenzhou Bank. 5  Daily Business The nonperforming loan of financial institutions in Wenzhou. 6  Boao  Asia  BBS  annual  meeting  in  2013  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe  financing  development  report  of  small  and  micro  businesses current status of China and Asian practice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. 257 \\x0c   M  &  D  FORUM     resources  according  to  their  own  regions  and  industrial  characteristics  to  establish  the  effective organization  pattern.  Then  they  can  combine  with  each  other  positively  to  form  the  SME  combo. Besides they also need to pay more attention to the coordination relationship with large enterprises. In this way they can form the operation management mode of the enterprise group and improve their own financing capacity to obtain more financing opportunities. For example Weihai City Commercial Bank in  Shangdong  province  and  Weihai  SME  bureau  developed  the  strategic  cooperation  project  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlue Ocean  Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  in  2012.  By  creating  new  financial  service  modes  the  financing  difficulty  of  SMEs  is further relieved. So far Weihai City Commercial Bank  has issued twoperiod collective trust loan for 9 SMEs reaching up to 0.13 billion in total7.    4.2 Innovative financing modes     By  forming  innovative  financing  modes SMEs can explore and establish  the  longterm  mechanism of financial  services  adapting  to  the  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  economic  restructuring  and  the  development  mode transformation.  Thereby  higher  SME  financing  demand  can  be  satisfied.  Firstly  SMEs  should  form innovative SME financing guarantee modes based on the integration of  multiaspect superior resources. Establishing  the  multilayered  guarantee  system  is  an  important  means  for  satisfying  SME  financing demand.  According to the statistics of China Banking Regulatory Commission (CBRC)  by the end of 2012  corporate  body  number  of  the  financing  guarantee  industry  had  reached  to  8590  in  total nationwide  with  the  yearonyear  growth  of  2.2%.  The  yearend  guarantee  balance  approached  to 2170.4 billion  yuan  in total with the growth of 16.4% compared with  the  balance  in the  beginning of that year. Besides the balance of the SME financing guaranteed loan was 1144.5 billion yuan with the yearonyear  growth of  15.3%. This  favors  the  development of  SMEs  greatly.  Secondly  SMEs  should establish the integrated platform of financing services. The financing supermarkets are gathered together such as banks trusts insurance bonding companies financial lease small loan companies etc. Thus the service platform for bankenterprise interaction online service and financing consultation is established between SMEs and financial institutions.    4.3 Reducing the operating cost and the asset risk of SMEs In the postcrisis era  apart  from the financing difficulty the increasing operating cost  also needs to  be solved as soon as possible. Firstly enterprises themselves should pay more attention to accumulation of their  own  capital  and  the  implementation  of  the  differentiated  management  mode  based  on  the  cost control  in the daily operation. Moreover they can also obtain more business opportunities by using the ecommerce  platform  of  B2B.  Secondly  government  should  formulate  relevant  fiscal  and  monetary policies  comprehensively.  The  government  needs  to  provide  preferential  tax  policies  for  SMEs  and allow  them  to  have  the  access  to  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe  flourish  plan  of  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  free  of  charge.  Financing  modes  are required  to  be  broadened  and  innovative  modes  should  be  formed.  Through  private  capital  from guarantee institutions etc. the collective bondissuing scale of SMEs can be expanded. Furthermore the approval process for enterprises to be listed  should be simplified. Thus the capital  market can play its role such as IPO (Initial Public Offering) financing of SME board etc.  4.4 Widening marketing ideas and improving competitiveness Development  maintenance  and  improvement  of  SME  market  competitiveness  can  be  reflected  in marketing  modes  of  enterprises  to  a  large  degree.  Based  on  the  implementation  of  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlue  Ocean Strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  enterprises\\xe2\\x80\\x99  basic  aim  is  to  realize  the  maximization  of  the  whole  values  including  society clients  enterprises  themselves.  To  achieve  this  aim  SMEs  are  expected  to  do  the  following.  Firstly under the premise of having a good knowledge of differentiated market demand SMEs in China should create new marketing philosophy and widen marketing ideas. In the marketing practice SMEs should do well in using the advanced marketing methods from other enterprises as the reference. Besides they also                                                          7  Weihai City Commercial Bank in Shangdong province 2013. 258 \\x0c   M  &  D  FORUM     need to  make good use of  convenient fast and lowcost  marketing platforms  involving a broad range such as the internet etc.. Thus they can form and carry out innovative marketing modes conforming to their  own  enterprise  cultures  and  the  personalized  market  demand  positively  and  actively.  Secondly SMEs need to pay great attention to cultivating and recruiting knowledgeable practical and innovative marketing  talents.  In  this  way  the  marketing  ideas  in  enterprises  can  keep  innovative  all  the  time. Thereby according to the differentiated market demand SMEs can form innovative marketing modes to improve  their  competitiveness.  Thirdly  SMEs  are  expected  to  carry  out  green  marketing  modes  and bring  the  green  culture  into  enterprises\\xe2\\x80\\x99  marketing  modes.  That  is  under  the  premise  of  realizing  the social  benefit  enterprises  should  improve  their  awareness  to  concern  for  consumers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  physical  and mental health. Meanwhile  in this way the operating cost of enterprises is reduced  or even enterprises\\xe2\\x80\\x99 economic profit becomes higher.      4.5 Emphasizing the development of the intrinsic value and the brand effect The  market  in  the  postcrisis  era  is  complex  and  changeable  with  much  attention  paid  to  the personalized demand. To survive and develop in the fierce market competition SMEs need to break the traditional  thinking  set  and  timely  obtain  the  information  of  the  consumer  demand  based  on  the adequate  market  research.  Firstly  according  to  the  differentiation  of  the  consumer  demand  SMEs should conduct the market segmentation. They  make full use of their own unique advantages to satisfy the personalized  demand of the particular  market. Meanwhile they can  occupy some  market shares  in the local market and obtain good economic benefit. Thus SMEs can maintain the sustainable and stable development. Secondly the initiative  of the product development and  innovation needs to be improved to  adapt  to  the  diverse  and  personalized  market  demand.  Under  the  framework  of  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvalue  innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d theory  SMEs  are  expected  to  emphasize  the  product  innovation  in  many  aspects  such  as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cquality function services and marketing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d etc. Moreover the development mode of the intrinsic value should be carried out from three aspects market differentiation product differentiation and image differentiation. Thus the brand effect is highlighted.  5 The Suggestions for the Implementation of SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlue Ocean Strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  5.1 Establishment and improvement of relevant legal system of SME financing   Establishing  and  perfecting  the  legal  system  of  SME  financing  are  the  basis  for  solving  the  financing difficulty  of  SMEs  in  China.  To  safeguard  the  legitimate  interests  of  SMEs  China  should  establish separate laws to help SMEs with their financing and development. In the SME Promotion Law enacted in  2002  many  legal  countermeasures  were  adopted  to  solve  the  problems  such  as  SME  financing difficulty  etc.  But  there  were  no  detailed  laws  and  regulations  corresponding  to  those  legal countermeasures. As a result it was difficult to put this law into effect. Government should  formulate a series of specialized laws that require institutions such as banks small loan companies pawnshops and so  on  to  provide  the  credit  for  SMEs.  By  establishing  laws  the  rights  of  institutions  with  credit behaviors are safeguarded.  But the  main contain  of the current Guarantee Law is the guarantee system of  the  real  estate.  Since  there  are  few  guaranties  of  the  real  estate  for  SMEs  in  China  this  law  is inconsistent with the actual situation of SMEs. Therefore relevant legal system of the chattel mortgage guarantee is required to be perfected in Guarantee Law. Besides the SME credit system platform should be established and perfected to effectively solve the problem that it is difficult for financial institutions like banks and so on to  collect SME credit data. To some degree this can  improve SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  initiative to pay enough attention to formation and maintenance of  their credit. Hence it is necessary and urgent to enact some laws related to SME financing.      5.2 Construction of the financial credit system for SMEs The  financial  credit  system  fitting  for  SMEs  should  be  established  under  the  policy  guide  of  Central Bank  and  governments  at  all  levels.  The  complementary  action  between  commercial  finance  and  the 259 \\x0c   M  &  D  FORUM     policybased  finance  is  supposed  to  play  its  role  to the  full.  Thereby  we  can  provide  multiangle  and credit support  for SMEs.  Based on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlue Ocean  Strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bank of China  provides \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwindow guidance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  to  promote  the  establishment  of  the  differentiated  financial  credit  system.  Under  the  loan financing  policy  guide  of  the  commercial  finance  the  financial  credit  system  between  Stateowned Commercial  Bank  (SOCB)  and  SMEs  is  established.  Innovative  financial  credit  products  are obtained timely to satisfy the  actual  financial demand of SME diversification.  Besides the differentiation  in the management  of  SME  credit  policies  should  be  reinforced  between  jointstock  commercial  banks  and regional  financial  institutions.  In  this  way  the  fights  or  vicious  competition  between  jointstock commercial banks and regional financial institutions can be avoided in the implementation of SME loan policies.  By  the  end  of  2012  there  had  been  939  new  rural  financial  institutions  nationwide  with  the yearonyear growth of 19.47%. The loan  balance was 234.7 billion  yuan8 nearly a  half of which was used to satisfied SME  financing demand.  Meanwhile  policybased  financial credit system  needs to be established. Policybased financial institutions serve as a carrier to conduct direct financing behaviors to SMEs  through  the  methods  such  as  the  construction  of  the  guarantee  system  of  SME  policybased finance etc. Besides commercial financial institutions are guided and encouraged to support SMEs.      5.3 Improvement of the guarantee system for SME financing credit The  establishment  and  perfection  of  the  guarantee  system  of  SME  financing  credit  are  required  to  be promoted. To achieve this goal the credit of the business entity should be improved by reinforcing the business management. Apart from that the differentiated credit guarantee system  is also expected to be established  and  put  into  effect.  China  needs  to  construct  the  organization  system  framework  of  the guarantee  system  of  SME  financing  credit  step  by  step  according  to the  plan.  The  policy  guarantee  is taken as the main part and the aim of helping SMEs with their development and growth is reflected in the  daily  operation  management  of  guarantee  institutions  financed  by  the  government.  Meanwhile mutual guarantee serves as the auxiliary part and on this basis the initiative of the commercial guarantee is  improved  to  play  a  positive  role  in  the  guarantee  system.  Thereby  the  guarantee  risk  of  SME financing credit can be reduced and relieved at different level.  5.4 Acceleratation of the standardized process for private lending Since  many  occurrences  of  private  lending  disputes  and  debtsdodging  incidences  in  Wenzhou  Inner Mongolia  Henan  and  so  on  in  2011  the  government  has  paid  much  more  attention  to  the standardization  of  the  private  lending.  Under  the  policy  guidelines  of  the  central  government  and Central Bank the standardization of private lending is accelerated. Each local government is encouraged and supported to enact a series of policy measures  for the standardization of private lending. Under the framework of the unified supervision system the regulation of private lending is reinforced at different level  to  standardize  the  development  of  private  lending.  Based  on  the  private  lending  of  SMEs  the capital of private lending is encouraged and supported to flow into industries. So guarantee institutions of private lending and SME development fund are set up;  besides new  financial organizations are also established  to  provide  financial  services  for  SMEs.  By  the  end  of  March  2013  there  had  been  6555 small  loan  companies  nationwide  and  the  loan  balance  had  reached  to  635.7  billion  yuan  with  yearly incremental loans of 43.4 billion yuan9. Hence accelerating the standardized process of private lending like small  loan companies and so on  is an  important strategic choice to relieve current SME financing plight.        6 Conclusion  Based on the framework of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlue Ocean Strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d theory the differentiated management mode for cost                                                          8  China Association of Small and Medium Enterprises (CASME) 2013. 9  People's Bank of China (PBOC) 2013.3. 260 \\x0c   M  &  D  FORUM     control  is  implemented.  Then  applying  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cvalue  innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  theory  into  the  operating  management  of enterprises and enhancing its internal management accumulation and utilization of enterprises\\xe2\\x80\\x99 capital can  be  realized.  Thus  enterprises  can  improve  their  internal  financing  capacity  gradually.  By implementing  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBlue  Ocean  Strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  of  SME  financing  the  cooperation  among  the  government financial institutions private lending companies and SMEs can be promoted. With the combined forces the situation of SME financing difficulty in China can be thereby changed.
