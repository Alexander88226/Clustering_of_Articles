Ask  people  this  question  and  they  are  likely  to  pick   familiar  technologies  such  as  printing  or  electricity.  But  they  are  unlikely  to  suggest  an   innovation  that  is  just  as  significant   the  financial  contract.  Widely  disliked  and  often   considered grubby  it has nonetheless played an indispensable role in human development for   at least 7 000 years”1.     Indeed   the  topic  of  finance  and  consequent  financial  innovation  has  both  supporters  and   opponents.  Tufano  (2013)  defines  the  financial  innovation  as  “the  act  of  creating  and  then   popularizing new financial instruments as well as new financial technologies  institutions and   markets” with a purpose of overcoming market imperfections. On a post2008financialcrisis  wave  the discussion of “bad” and “good” sides of the financial innovation regained interest of   various counterparts  including academia2 and international development organizations3.     In  2009   within  six  months  of  each  other   Paul  Krugman  and  Robert  Shiller   both  the  Nobel   Prize Winners in Economic Sciences  posted two diametrically different articles about financial   innovation. Krugman states his opposition to financial innovation by writing “it’s hard to think   of any major recent financial innovations that actually aided society  as opposed to being new    improved ways to blow bubbles  evade regulations and implement de facto Ponzi schemes4”     On  the  contrary   Shiller  supports  the  phenomena  by  saying   “it  is  critical  that  we  take  the   opportunity of the crisis to promote innovationenhancing financial regulation and not let this   be eclipsed by superficially popular issues5. He then lists several “good” innovations  which in   his opinion could have eased people’s lives  e.g. lifecycle fund and retirement annuities.     Nevertheless  regardless of the position in the discussion of “bad” and “good” sides of finance   and  financial  innovation   it  is  impossible  to  neglect  its  enormous  influence  on  global   development  overall  as  well  as  on  development  of  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  in   particular  as they are considered to be building blocks of developing countries’ economy due   to strong employment power6. SMEs account on average of 50% of jobs in both developing and   developed  countries   remaining  as  one  of  the  main  driving  forces  of  the  economy  (Torre    Martinez  Schmukler  2009).     Simultaneously  however  the SME segment suffers from access to finance constraints mostly   due to the inability of conventional finance to accommodate the segment’s needs. As stated by   Stein  Ardic & Hommes (2013) commercial banks are still perceived to be the major source of   funding for SMEs. Privately held commercial banks provide about 58% of external financing for                                                                     1 http //www.economist.com/news/essays/21600451financenotmerelypronecrisesitshapedthemfivehistoric   alcrisesshowhowaspectstodaysfina   2 See  for instance  Henderson’s and Pearson’s “The dark side of financial innovation  A case study of the pricing of a   retail financial product”  2010; or Allen’s “Trends in Financial Innovation and Their Welfare Impact”  2011   3 See  for instance  World Economic Forum’s “Rethinking financial innovation”  2012   4 http //www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/opinion/27krugman.html?_r=0   5 http //www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c4a74ba2ab8311de9be400144feabdc0.html#axzz3jokYMlsW   6 According to IFC Jobs Study  2013  SMEs represent on average about 66% of permanent  fulltime employment in   developing countries.          4          the  SME  sector   while  state  owned  banks  and  other  agencies  cover  a  further  20%.  These   numbers  make  the urgency for  innovation  of  the  banking industry  obvious.  As  Kevin Hanley    Director of Design and Services  at the Royal Bank of Scotland stated at the Financial Services   Forum (2324 June 2015  London)  “we spend most of our time in this industry fixing today  and   making incremental improvements. Innovation is different  it is thinking about what tomorrow   holds. And about making disruptive change happen”7.     Despite the evident augmentation of the financial system across the globe (Beck et al.  2008)    the financing gap of MSMEs (micro  small and medium enterprises) in developing countries is   still  estimated  at  $2.1  to  $2.6  trillion  (Stein   Ardic  &  Hommes   2013).  Figure  I  provides  an   overview of a total financing gap of both formal and informal MSME sector. Here  the region of   South  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  has  the  highest  percentage  of  unserved  and  underserved   MSMEs.      Figure 1  Formal and Informal MSMEs sector – Total financing gap          Source  Stein  Ardic & Hommes  2013     After  the  “role  of  the  entrepreneurial  enterprise  as  an  engine  of  economic  growth  has   garnered  considerable  public  attention  in  the  1990s”  (Berger  &  Udell   1998   p.  613)   the   finance gap hypothesis  which presumes that small and medium enterprises suffer from a lack   of external financing more than larger companies  has started being widely researched (Ang    1992;  Avery  et  al.   1998;  Berger  &  Udell   1998;  Gregory  et  al.   2005;  Beck  &  DemirgüçKunt    2006;  Ayyagari  et  al.   2007).  Consequently   all  types  of  factors  affecting  growth  and   development  of  SMEs  from  a  degree  of  institutional  development  and  judicial  system                                                                     7 http //thefinancialbrand.com/52725/bankinginnovationimperative/          5          efficiency (Kumar et al.  1999) to access to external financing (DemirgüçKunt & Maksimovic    1998;  Beck  &  DemirgüçKunt   2006;  Ayyagari  et  al.   2006)  also  grabbed  the  attention  of   academics and policymakers alike.      Traditionally  the  finance  gap  hypothesis  assumes  that  (i)  SMEs  will  grow  but  due  to  (ii)   disadvantageous  market  conditions  the  SMEs  sector  is  left  behind.  Using  an  empirical  set  of   data  i.e. World Business Environment Survey8  Ayyagari et al. (2006) define the main obstacles   that influence enterprise growth to be limited access to external finance  as well as high levels   of  crime  and  political  instability.  Additionally   Beck  et  al.  (2003)   using  the  survey  data  of   10 000 companies from 80 countries  conclude that foreignowned larger and older companies   face fewer constraints with external financing than SMEs.      The existence of a finance gap is driven by many factors. In addition to macro level issues  like   undeveloped  financial  and  legal  systems  (Beck  et  al.   2003)   there  are  at  least  five  more   obstacles (Zavatta  2008) faced both by the demand and supply sides when pursuing financing   of the SMEs sector           Informational asymmetry  where lender or investor faces difficulties with differentiation   between high and low quality projects (adverse selection problem) due to limited access to   unofficial insider information about financial status of the given SME.        Higher  risk  –  the  problem  of  informational  asymmetry  leads  to  a  problem  of  higher  risk   ratings  of  SMEs  projects.  Due  to  lack  of  hard  information  or  its’  opacity   SMEs  are  given   higher interest rates.        Transaction costs – SMEs financing is perceived as an expensive business as this segment   usually borrows little amount of loans  or better say  it is allowed to borrow only smaller   loans   due  to  direct  correlation  between repayment  power  and  size  of  operation. At  the   same  time  administrative  costs   legal  fees  and  cost  for  acquisition  of  information  about   business  stays  the  same  as  it  is  for  bigger  loans   while  profit  from  these  types  of  deal  is   kept low.    Lack  of  collateral  –  younger  and  smaller  businesses  have  fewer  (or  in  many  cases  none)   assets that could be used as a collateral.   Institutional  and  legal  factors  –  which  directly  influence  the  ease  of  SMEs’  access  to   external  finance.  This  includes  highly  concentrated  and  uncompetitive  banking  sector    which is built as a result of highly restrictive and conservative government regulations and   undeveloped legal systems.               From a theoretical point of view   the finance gap hypothesis is built upon at least two more   theories  i.e. conventional wisdom and relationship lending. For a long time  the “conventional   wisdom”   an  assurance  that  SMEs  are  better  served  by  small  and  niche  banks  through  the   “relationship  lending”   which  implies  application  of  “soft”  skills  by  a  relationship  manager  in   order  to  overcome  an  information  asymmetry  problem   was  believed  to  be  the  only  way  to   deal with the above stated obstacles for SMEs’ access to external financing. These two theories   started  being  widely  researched  and  discussed  in  early  90’s  after  the  USA  approved  its   Interstate  Banking  and  Branching  Act  in  1994.  An  ample  amount  of  publications  argued  that   large multioffice and branch banks were less likely to provide lending to small businesses than   other  types  of  banks  (Keeton   1995).  Furthermore   the  literature  stated  that  with  a                                                                   8 For the very recent data see http //data.worldbank.org/datacatalog/BEEPS          6          transformation  and  consolidation  into  more  complex  larger  banks   these  banks  reduced   funding for SMEs (Berger and Udell  1996; Craig and Hardee  2007; Francis et al.  2008; Jimenez   et al.  2009).      Furthermore   the  SME  sector  is  characterized  by  a  high  heterogeneity   making  it  highly   complicated to serve  as well as to define. Ang (1992) prefers to define a small firm as one that   is  privately  held  as  opposed  to  a  publicly  traded  firm.  The  condition  of  private  ownership  is   important  but  it  does  not  solve  the  problem  of  classification   as  it  differs  on  a  countryto  country basis. The more conventional approach is to define the size of an enterprise based on   the number of employees  Gibson and Vaart (2008) thus argue that a better way of defining   size of an enterprise is to base it on an annual turnover variable. The World Bank definition on   the other hand  puts a set of requirements  where the enterprise must meet at least 2 out of 3   characteristics  (see  Table  I)  in  order  to  qualify  for  MSME  definition.  Therefore   the  issue  of   defining SMEs still remains highly disputable.     Table 1  History of application of effectuation principles in field studies                              Source  Ayyagari et al.  2007     Despite  the  arguments  provided  and  discussed  above   substantial  changes  of  the  financial   landscape  over  the  past  years   including  the  post  and  pre2008financialcrisis   showed  that   the SME sector is “perceived to be big and with good prospective” (Beck et al.  2008  p.6) by all   types of banks.     In a highly competitive environment banks tend to have more incentives to bear the costs of   serving the SME sector and applying new approaches in doing so  such as  credit scoring  and   coming  up  with  innovative  products  like  factoring   fixedassets  lending  and  so  on  (Torre    Martínez   Schmukler   2010).  Because   as  Berger  &  Udell  (2006   p.2946)  stated   relationship   lending  is  not  the  only  way  to  work  with  the  SME  sector  and  “the  inference  that  large   institutions are disadvantaged in lending to opaque SMEs is flawed”.      Therefore  Chapter 2 will look through the current trends of innovation in the area of SMEs’   finance.                              7     Firm sizeEmployeesAssetsAnnual salesMicro <10<$100 000<$100 000Small <50<$3 mln<$3 mlnMedium <300<$15 mln<$15 mln     TRENDS           The list of identified and provided below trends in the area of SMEs’ finance is by no means   exhaustive  and/or  complete.  It  was  built  through  a  compilation  of  the  results  of  empirical   researches  in  the  area  of  finance   access  to  finance   financial  inclusion   and  financial   innovation. Hence  the typology of trends in SMEs’ finance was created.

Growing digitalization of financial services leads to increasing use of online platforms that   reduce intermediation between financial institutions and SMEs.     The FinTech innovators have started disrupting the financial sector after its’ global collapse in   2008. Goldman Sachs estimates that FinTech’s annual revenue could go up to $4.7 trillion9  the   revenue  taken  away  from  conventional  and  established  financial  companies  (WEF   2015).   There are at least four different types of nonbank market based online financing  which SMEs   can benefit from  namely        Crowdfunding  Kickstarter10 is a leading rewards and preselling based crowdfunding   site where project owners have raised over $1  billion in funding for their projects. In   the company’s own words  “Kickstarter is a new way to fund creative projects. We’re a   home for films  games  and music to art  design  and technology.” Kickstarter does not   support  charities  or  personal  financing  needs;  it  also  does  not  offer  equity  crowd   funding. In 2014  it has raised the largest rewardsbased crowdfunding campaign with   Coolest Cooler at over $13M.       Mobile  Payment  Services    EcoCash11 is  a  mobile  payment  solution  that  enables  its   users to complete simple financial transactions such as sending money and buying and   paying  for  goods  and  services.  It  also  provides  an  option  of  saving  money   earning   interest  and  obtaining  loans   which  range  from  as  low  as  $15  to  $500  depending  on   how  much  customer  saves  with  EcoCash.  The  higher  the  savings  are   the  higher  the   loan limit is. To qualify for the loan  customers need to have an EcoCash Save account   and  to  save  a  minimum  of  $5  or  more  for  3  months.  EcoCash  belongs  to  Econet   Wireless   which  is  a  diversified  telecommunications  group  with  operations  and   investments  in  Africa   Europe   South  America  and  the  East  Asia  Pacific  Rim   offering   products  and  services  in  the  core  areas  of  mobile  and  fixed  telephony  services    broadband  satellite  optical fibre networks and mobile payment.          PeertoPeer Lending – is an onlineenabled lending wherein individual lenders provide capital   directly  to  individual  borrowers  with  further  ability  to  get  higher  yields.  However   unlike   conventional  providers  of  financial  services   most  of  the  onlineenabled  platforms  do  not   guarantee full return of funds to the savers  putting capital into the system (TheCityUK  2013).   In  addition   these  platforms  could  act  as  secondary  markets  by  providing  marketplace  for   existing  lenders  who  want  to  withdraw  their  capital  prior  to  the  loan  term  through  selling   shares of any loans to other investors (ACCA  2014). There are two subtypes of peertopeer   platforms;  those  are  persontoperson  (P2P)  and  persontomerchant  (P2M)  or  personto  business (P2B) platforms.                                                                        9 The Economist  “The fintech revolution”  2015   10 https //www.kickstarter.com   11 https //www.econet.co.zw          9            P2P  Unlike traditional lenders  Kabbage12 approves small business loans by looking at   reallife  data.  It  obtains  borrowers’  consent  to  access  realtime  data  from  their  e  commerce seller’s accounts  PayPal accounts  UPS shipping accounts  as well as from a   variety  of  SMEs  accounting  software  packages  such  as  QuickBooks   Stripe  and  Xero.   Kabbage  offers  advances  of  between  $500  and  $50 000  at  interest  rates  of  between   2% and 7% for a 30day period. For a sixmonth advance  rates range from 10%  18%.          P2B    MoolahSense13 is  a  Singaporebased  platform   where  people  invest  directly  in   local  businesses  (P2B)  for  a  fixed  return  of  interest.  The  portal’s  stated  vision  is  to   cultivate entrepreneurship by empowering businesses and investors with a trusted and   vibrant  crowdfunding  platform   and  to  address  the  structural  impediments  toward   entrepreneurship  with  a  focus  on  SMEs.  MoolahSense  enables  business  loans  from   between  SGD$100 000  to  SGD$300 000  ($74 349  to  $223 048)   and  uses  information   from  official  sources  and  information  providers  to  review  all  applications  before   businesses  (corporates  and  limited  liability  partnerships)  are  allowed  to  list  on  the   platform. Each business' identity  checked and only  businesses with at least 1 year of   audited financial statements or 2 years of trading history are allowed to be listed on   the  platform.  The  loans  made  through  the  portal  are  repaid  by  the  borrowing   businesses in monthly payments of principal and interest. No collateral is pledged for   the  loans  received.  MoolahSense  states  its  benefits  to  SMEs  as  “potentially  lower   borrowing  costs   being  fast  and  convenient   building  a  resilient  longterm  funding   strategy  by  cultivating  a  relationship  with  alternative  pools  of  investors  and  being   empowered to negotiate your own rates”. (ADB  2014)          Online equity financing – is a transaction aimed to raise new equity  where equity is defined as   the  part  of  longterm  liabilities  used  to  fund  a  company  (Moles  &  Terry   1997   p.188).  This   transaction  is  being  fully  done  electronically   mainly  through  the  dedicated  platforms  on   Internet.            Business Angel  Intellecap Impact Investment Network14  which states that it is India’s   first  angel  network  of  highnetworth  individuals  and  institutional  investors  seeking   investments in fledgling enterprises. The use of mobile technology by the I3N—mainly   through  its  website—  is  designed  to  bridge  gaps  of  geography   mindset   and   knowledge  between  angel  investors  and  impact  entrepreneurs.  I3N  also  provides   extensive  consultations   i.e.   entrepreneurs and startups.     in  preparation  of  business  projects  by  applicants        Equity crowdfunding  Seedrs15 is an equity crowdfunding platform for discovering and   investing  in  seedstage  startups   based  in  the  United  Kingdom  but  open  to  investors                                                                     12 https //www.kabbage.com/   13 https //moolahsense.com/   14 http //www.i3n.co.in/   15 https //www.seedrs.com/          10          and entrepreneurs throughout Europe. Minimum threshold of investment is €10  there   is  also  an  option  for  earlystage  startups  and  more  established  businesses  to  raise   investment from friends  family  customers  angels and other independent investors in   exchange for equity in the business. The platform offers three types of campaigns for   investment    equity   funds  and  convertible  campaigns.  Seedrs  is  an  "all  or  nothing"   platform where companies do not receive any funding unless they reach their declared   investment target. In late 2015  Seedrs has expanded to US market. Up to 2015  it has   funded over  270  deals   and  raises  up  to  £3.5m  per  month on average. The company   predicted  that  the  US  would  represent  between  onethird  and  half  of  the  business   over the next two to three years.          Venture capital  Letsventure16 enables startups that are looking to raise seed capital   to create investmentready profiles online and to connect to accredited investors. The   amount of financing ranges between $1 million and $10 million  and is focused on the   internet sector.  Around  750  startups  and 1 200  investors  across 20  countries   375  of   them  Indian   are  registered  on  its  platform.  The  platform  is  free  for  investors   and   charges startups 2 per cent of the funds raised as fee. It invests 1 per cent back into   the  startups  as  equity.  Once  investors  make  a  verbal  commitment  to  the  startup    LetsVenture leads them  through the process of funding closure. In 2015  LetsVenture   has managed to raise $17 million for 53 startups that are under its aegis.          2.  Digitalization  also  facilitates  the  trend  of  big  data   which  leads  to  partial  solution  of   information  asymmetry  problem  through  establishment  of  data  warehouses   i.e.  credit   information  sharing  systems   and  use  of  collected  data  for  further  assessment  through   various screening models.     The information asymmetry is one of the most cited obstacles that supply side refers to when   talking  about  SMEs  financing  (Torre   Martínez   Schmukler   2010).  Growing  digitalization  of   services provides an innovative way not only in delivering those services  but also in collecting   and  assessing  data  on  end  users.  This  opens  new  ways  for  investment  analysis  of  loan   applicants.        Predictive Modelling  Alipay17 is a unit of Ant Financial Services Group  an affiliate of   Alibaba  Group.  Alipay  is  China’s  most  popular  epayment  service  while  its  mobile   application  Alipay  Wallet  is  China’s  top  mobilepayment  service.  Users  can  use  their   Alipay accounts to pay their bills  shop online  transfer money to each other and also   invest their idle cash. By using Alipay Wallet  users are able to participate in offlineto  online promotions  pay for products in stores with smartphones  book transportation   services  and  hospital  appointments   among  other  uses.  At  the  end  of  2013   the   number  of  Alipay  registered  users  reached  300  million  and  the  number  of   collaborating  financial  institutions  exceeded  200  entities.  Alipay  handles  over  80   million transactions daily  45 million of them generated by mobile devices. Alipay also                                                                     16 https //letsventure.com/   17 http //www2.alizila.com          11          uses  the  predictive  models   which  assess  an  individual’s  online  presence   number  of   social  networking  connections  and  how  close  those  connections  are  geographically.   This helps to indicate whether a business that seeks to raise money via a crowdfunding   site will be successful in fundraising from its own friends and family networks (ACCA    2014).          Rating  Modelling    Banco  BAC  San  José 18    Costa  Rica   has  developed  a  new   mathematical model to give credit to  among others  the following groups of clients  (i)   Autocred  Merchants with 18 or more months of continuous sales with BAC credit card   processing company are candidates to receive a credit  based on their monthly billing;   and  (ii)  Suppliers   Clients  constantly  receiving  payments  of  their  respective  clients   through BAC electronic payment platform are also candidates to receive a credit based   on  the  amounts  received.  The  new  mathematical  model  analyses  amount  average    dispersion  total amount trend and other variables to calculate the final credit amount.   Given  the  large  amount  of  clients   BAC  needs  to  check  first  the  previous  payment   record  of  the  client  and  commercial  references  from  the  bank.  Here   BAC  also   developed software that massively checks all the references.       Use of pointofsale (POS) account data  SMEs often operate on a small business scale    do little financial bookkeeping  and own a few liquid assets but very little fixed assets.   As a result  those SMEs normally find it difficult to get credit from banks. Here is where   Chinese  Nanchong  City  Commercial  Bank's19 innovative  POS  account  transaction  flow   rate loan product resolves that problem. This loan product allows the Bank to review   loan  applicants’  POS  account  transaction  flow  rate   analyze  its  business  operation   condition  and other factors such as loan applicants’ business assets  business selling   channels  or  length  of  trading  history.  After  analyzing  all  the  information   the  exact   amount  of  loan  credit  should  be  determined.  This  product  is  a  small  &  micro  loan   product based on a loan applicant’s creditworthiness. Loan applicants will not be asked   to  submit  company  financial  accounts  or  asset  backed  securities.  In  terms  of  risk   control   the  bank  will  investigate  and  analyse  a  loan  applicants  bankcards  usage  and   source of loan repayment from their POS machine transaction records at Bank’s pre  lending period. Moreover  at postlending period  the bank will continue to monitor an   applicant’s  bankcard  usage  from  their  POS  machine  transaction  records.  Thus   the   Bank can oversee their business operation condition. In addition  the bank will perform   postlending  onsite  investigation  for  the  clients   look  for  any  potential  business   problems   prepare  for  business  risk  early  warning  and  fulfill  Bank’s  risk  management   duty.       Psychometric  Assessment    Unlocking  entrepreneurial  potential     in  developing   countries requires a new way for banks to screen clients and evaluate risk. Harvard’s                                                                     18 https //www.bac.net   19 http //www.cgnb.cn          12          Entrepreneurial Finance Lab Research Initiative20 (EFLRI) does this with a psychometric   assessment tool. In tests over four years in seven countries in Latin America and Africa    the tool was able to predict default as well as or better than traditional credit scoring   models. In Africa  the initial research and adaptation of the tool has already started to   catalyze private sector scaleup. Financial institutions on the continent are now lending   out over $1.5 million per week based on these tools to smallscale entrepreneurs that   would have previously been rejected.          3. Growth of financial literacy of  SMEs is fuelled by digital apps and conventional financial   institutions  which are interested in a longterm high capacity of the demand side.     According  to  the  World  Bank  survey  (Torre   Martínez   Schmukler   2010)   conducted  in   Argentina  Chile  Colombia and Serbia  roughly 50% of surveyed banks point at  SMEs specific   factors21 as  one  of  the  main  obstacles  to  serve  the  sector.  One  of  the  ways  to  mitigate  that   obstacle  is  to  build  capacity  of  the  SMEs  sector  itself.  This  goal  is  being  achieved  through   application of such tools as        Financial  literacy  campaigns    after  the  over  indebtedness  crisis  of  2011  both   regulatory  bodies  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  started   admitting  the  importance  of  financial  literacy  of  local  SMEs  and  individuals.  Shortly   after   the  Closed  Joint  Stock  Company  (CJSC)  FINCA  Bank22 launched  its  Financial   Literacy  Project   which  is  a  multiple  level  program  that  includes  various  directions    channels and instruments of distribution. Within the program  a series of educational   materials  and  training  has  been  prepared  and  disseminated  through  training  events    which were conducted jointly with the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. In 2015    the  CJSC  FINCA  Bank  published  the  electronic  version  of  the  manual  on  financial   literacy prepared in cooperation with the KyrgyzRussian Slavic University. This edition   is a basic course  combining 101 theoretical foundations and practical experience.       Financing  blended  with  technical  assistance    Sembrar  Sartawi  IFD23 /  Sembrar  is  a   Bolivian  development  finance  institution  providing  a  variety  of  financial  services  to   micro  and  small  agricultural  producers  since  1989.  There  is  a  need  to  increase   production and productivity of agriculture  particular for net food importing countries   like  Bolivia.  Furthermore   agriculture  is  the  most  important  source  of  income  for   millions of smallholder famers with no access to technology  credit and markets. Here    the  Sembrar  Sartawi  IFD  has  developed  the  ATF  model  (Technical  Assistance  and   Financing).  This  innovation works  on a  platform of  these  two  institutions.  They  were   created to deliver services to smallholder farmers through a comprehensive approach.                                                                     20 http //www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/programs/entrepreneurialfinancelabresearchinitiative   21 These factors mostly refer to low quality balance sheets and/or lack of quality information in overall. In Colombia    for instance  this percentage goes up to 88%.    22 http //www.finca.kg/   23 http //www.sembrarsartawi.org/          13          One  institution  specializes  in  the  transfer  of  knowledge  and  builds  productive   capacities  and the other provides customized financial products to small agricultural   unit.  The  value  for  the  smallholder  farmers  consists  of   (i)  Technical  assistance  (TA)   provides best practices and the farmer can increase yields  (ii) TA helps the producer to   mitigate  risks   this  reduces  the  probability  of  crop  failure  and  an  eventual  credit   default   and  (iii)  Information  and  initiatives  to  reach  markets  allow  farmers  to  find   more stable demand paths.       Financial  literacy  applications    Creation  and  popularization  of  online  applications   aimed at simplifying or teaching bookkeeping  such as Xero24  which is a cloudbased   accounting  solution  tailored  to  the  needs  of  small  to  midsize  businesses.  Features   include account management  billing  invoices  expense reporting  and payroll (this last   is  currently  limited  to  the  United  Kingdom   Australia   New  Zealand   and  20  states  of   United States of America). Xero also integrates with over 400 other applications  which   facilitate  nearly  all  aspects  of  business  operation   including  inventory  management    CRM   and  POS.  Prices  range  from  £9  a  month  for  the  starter  to  £30  a  month  for  a   sophisticated version  with multicurrency options.          4. FinTech is also being used in the area of development financing with the aim to increase   financial inclusion and access to finance by SMEs and individuals in developing countries.     As was stated previously the FinTech companies are truly booming. Today they have proved to   be  leaders  in  finding  new  solutions  for  old  problems  to  such  an  extent   where  even   International  Financial  Institutions  (IFIs)  have  also  started  using  the  financial  technologies  in   the process  of  their  programs’  delivery.  However   application  of  financial  technologies  is  not   the only innovative instrument being used in the area of development finance.      Listed  below  are  the  innovative  instruments   which  embrace  the  social  financing  of  SMEs  in   developing countries as a part of development finance        Finance through FinTech  Mobile Money for the Poor25 is a global programme funded   by  the  United  Nations  Capital  Development  Fund   the  Swedish   International   Development  Cooperation  Agency  and  the  Australian  Government   Department  for   Foreign Affairs and Trade. The programme provides support to branchless and mobile   financial  services  in  a  select  group  of  Least  Developed  Countries   particularly  Benin    LaoPDR  Liberia  Malawi  Nepal  Senegal  Uganda and Zambia to demonstrate how the   correct mix of financial  technical and policy support can build a robust branchless and   mobile  financial  services  ecosystem  that  reaches  low  income  people  in  Least   Developed Countries (LDCs).                                                                     24 https //www.xero.com/   25 http //www.uncdf.org/en/mm4p          14            Social  Success  Note    Yunus  Social  Business 26  in  collaboration  with  Rockefeller   Foundation  launched  The  Social  Success  Note   which  is  a  financial  innovation  that   allows  capital  to  flow  into  underfunded  sectors  (e.g.   low  income  geographies  and   “push” product sectors) deemed traditionally too risky or unprofitable for mainstream   capital.  It  is  an  innovative  payforsuccess  financing  mechanism  that  addresses  the   investment  gap  for  impactoriented  SMEs  and  social  businesses.  Through  a  new   alignment  of   investors   and   philanthropic  outcome  payers   the  SSN  holds  the  promise  of  addressing  the  missing  middle  financing  gap  for  impact  SMEs  by  mobilizing  commercial  capital  into  these   businesses while overcoming the longentrenched tradeoff between social impact and   financial return. It also allows existing social businesses to delve deeper into their area   of  social  impact   e.g.  targeting  a  poorer  customer  segment  than  traditional  IRR   investment  hurdle  rates  would  allow.  Yunus  Social  Business  and  The  Rockefeller   Foundation  are  working  together  to  launch  the  pilot  in  2016  with  one  of  YSB’s   investmentready social businesses.     interests  among  entrepreneurs      incentives  and       Social Venture Capital  AgDevCo27 established in 2009 as a social impact investor and   agribusiness  project  developer.  Incorporated  as  a  nonforprofit  distribution   limited   company in the UK to invest patient capital in the form of debt and equity into early   stage agribusinesses. Operations with locally managed subsidiaries in five countries in   subSaharan Africa (Mozambique  Ghana  Zambia  Malawi and Tanzania). AgDevCo has   developed an innovative Social Venture Capital model to serve the “missing middle” in   the  African  agricultural  sector.  Beneficiaries  are  SMEs  who  are  too  large  for   microfinance  but  too  small  for  private  equity.  AgDevCo  offers   (i)  flexible  risk  capital   with a 510 year time horizon. Mezzanine loans are structured to match the projected   cash  flow   and  (ii)  Handson  technical  support  to  improve  financial  management    governance  agronomy and smallholder support schemes.           Another subcategory of the development financing is the  one   which supports projects  with   sustainable agenda.      include     renewable  energies   energy  efficiency        Such  as  issuance  of  green  bond   this  is  a  debt  security  that  is  issued  to  raise  capital   specifically  in  support  of  climaterelated  or  environmental  projects.  Those  projects   typically   sustainable  waste   management   clean  transportation   biodiversity   sustainable  land  use  and  climate   change  mitigation  and  adaption.  The  green  bond  market  has  grown  exponentially  in   recent years  going from $4 billion in 2010 to over $37 billion in 2014  according to the   World Bank. Private commercial lenders such are also stepping into the sector. Bank of   America  has  issued two  green  bonds  —  one  for  $500  million  in November  2013  and                                                                     26 http //www.yunussb.com/socialsuccessnote/   27 http //www.agdevco.com          15          another for $600 million in May 2015 — to finance renewable energy projects in solar    wind  geothermal and energy efficiency. This financing also covers the SMEs.       Financing  of  energy  efficient  technologies   where  subject  of  investment  is  an   enterprise  or  a  project  that  works  or  plans  to  work  with  the  energy  efficient   technologies  instead of old inefficient ones  also falls into this category. CenterInvest   bank28 was the first Bank in Russia to participate in International Finance Corporation’s   (IFC)  Russia  Sustainable  Energy  Finance  Program  for  SMEs  in  2005.  In  2008   with  a   credit  line  from  Kreditanstalt  für  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)   the  Bank  opened  up  energy   efficiency lending to the agricultural sector. In 2009 the Bank started another program   with IFC on “Energy Efficiency in the Housing and Communal Services Sector”. In 2011   CenterInvest Bank launched a loan product to enable its retail customers to purchase   modern   energy  efficient  household  appliances  and  to  carry  out  energy  efficiency   renovations to their homes.          5. Fast growing SMEs using intangible or tangible  assets as a key success factor are served   through more innovative financing ways       As stated by McKinsey  “software and online services are in a period of dizzying growth”29. A   small startup can easily become a billiondollar giant. The latest example of such companies is   Airbnb  which was valued at $25.5 billion30 and Uber  which has a valuation of $62.5 billion31.   Traditionally  one of the main obstacles for financing of  SMEs engaged in the area of ICT was   the absence of the tangible collateral. The introduction of intangible asset based financing has   partially solved that problem.                Intellectual Property (IP) Auctions  Patentauction.com32 is an online free marketplace   designed only for selling or licensing patented inventions. PatentAuction.com is a non  commercial  and  not  for  profit  initiative   only  designed  to  help  inventors  get  more   exposure  for  their  patents.  PatentAuction.com  provides  potential  buyers  with  the   opportunity  to  contact  the  inventors  and  to  have  a  private  conversation  within  the   site. When that happens  it is up to the parties to come to an agreement and seal the   deal outside the platform.     IP Collateral Enhancement  MCAM Global Holdings33 is a global  financial services and   collateral management firm with specialized expertise on capital risk management.  In   2000  it introduced the Certified Asset Purchase Price tool  which allowed the process   of  IP  collateral  enhancement  to  become  commercially  viable  and  secure.  MCAM   provides  lender  with  a  Property  &  Casualty  Insurance  policy  that  provides  a                                                                     28 http //www.centrinvest.ru   29 McKinsey  “Grow fast or die slow”  2014    30 Fortune  “Airbnb raises $1.5 billion  valuing it at an eyepopping $25.5 billion”  2015    31 Bloomberg  “Uber Raises Funding at $62.5 Billion Valuation”  2015    32 http //patentauction.com/   33 http //www.mcam.com/          16          predetermined purchase price in the event that a lender forecloses on the borrower’s   collateral.  This  insurance  product   backed  by  an  Arated  counterparty   provides  a   lender with a decreasing price over time that MCAM will pay for the collateral assets.          IP Backed loans  Paradox Capital Partners34 provides intellectual propertybased loans    second lien loans  and mezzanine investments for mediumsized companies. Paradox is   specialized  in  financing  nonroyalty  and  royalty  generating  IP  using  a  wide  variety  of   credit structures  including loans and securitizations. The firm has established itself as   the de facto financing partner to IPcentric businesses. In conjunction with its parent    Babcock  &  Brown  Limited   Paradox  Capital  has  established  a  $280  million  fund  that   provides  financing  to  companies  with  strong  patent   trademark   and  copyright   portfolios.     Another  subcategory  of  innovative  asset  based  financing  is  one  where  movable  assets  are   used as the collateral. This instrument is widely used particularly in the agricultural sector.            Equipment Finance  Equity Bank of Tanzania35 provides Kilimo Biashara (Agribusiness   Small Scale)  A credit product for the procurement of agricultural tools and equipment   for  smallholder  farmers  cultivating  grains  and  other  crops.  The  product  targets  Self   Help  Groups  and  provides  seasonal  loans.  Loans  are  given  at  an  interest  rate  20   percent with a payback period of 24 months.      Infrastructure Finance  Jain Irrigation Systems LTD36 (JISL) is the largest manufacturer   of  microirrigation  systems  (MIS)  in  India   and  the  second  largest  globally.  In  120   districts with a total workforce of 7 000  JISL focuses on small farmers with holdings of   less than 10 acres. JISL prefinances farmer microirrigation system purchases against   the  “collateral”  of  a  government  subsidy  payment.  Farmers  who  buy  irrigation   equipment from Indian MIS producers such as JISL obtain a subsidy of 50–70 percent   of the equipment purchase price  with the national Government supplying 40 percent   and  the  state  Government  providing  the  remaining  10–30  percent.  The  JISL  dealer   prepares the cost estimate  and the applicant farmer submits a subsidy application to   the   Implementing  Agency  (IA).  After  approval   subsequent  MIS   installation  and IA inspection  the subsidy release requires a 180–360 day processing   period (IFC & GPFI  2012).      local  subsidy       Warehouse  Receipts  Financing    Origo  Commodities37 is  a  collateral  management   company based in India  which allows farmers to make deposits of their products in its   warehouses  and  obtain  pledge  financing.  It  currently  operates  over  350  warehouses   on  a  lease  basis  and  has  over  3.5  million  tonnes  of  commodities  valued  at  around   United States Dollar (USD) 1.4 million under management.                                                                     34 http //www.paradoxcapitalpartners.com/   35 http //ke.equitybankgroup.com/   36 http //www.jains.com/   37 http //origoindia.com/          17               Leasing    Development  Finance  Uganda  Leasing  Company 38 (DFCU)  specializes  in   providing  finance  leases  to  SMEs  for  agricultural  machinery  —  particularly  tractors    milk equipment  harvesters  and agroprocessing equipment. Typically  DFCU finances   60 percent of the asset purchase  while the client finances the additional 40 percent.   The  client  share   however   may  range  between  10–50  percent.  DFCU  retains  full   ownership during the life of the lease  though the asset is transferred to the client or   sold  to  a  third  party  after  the  lease  terminates.  Although  DFCU’s  interest  rates  are   similar  to  those  of  banks   their  leases  are  more  attractive  to  SME  s  because  they   typically offer longer payment periods (3–5 years as compared with around 2 years)    provide  flexible  lease  payment  schedules  that  match  enterprise  cash  flows   and   recognize the leased asset as primary collateral. Additional security is only requested   in specific circumstances. (IFC & GPFI  2012)          6. Growing use of accounts financing to manage cash flow problem in SMEs     Accounts  financing  is  a  type  of  financing  against  collateral  where  funds  are  provided  against   the firm’s accounts. There are different types of accounts financing  these are                 Invoice  trading    MarketInvoice39 is  offering  a  new  type  of  invoice  finance   built  for   savvy  growing  businesses.  Their  online  platform  gives  clients  access  to  funds  in   outstanding invoices  otherwise tied up for between 30 to 120 days. They are entirely   different  to  traditional  factoring.  Businesses  can  sign  up  online   sell  an  invoice  and   draw  down  funds  on  the  same  day.  There  are  no  contracts   hidden  fees  or  personal   guarantees.  MarketInvoice launched in 2011 and they have already helped hundreds   of  growing  companies  overcome  their  fluctuating  cash  flow.  Over  £300m  has  been   funded already. Their clients use the finance raised to launch new products  hire more   staff and expand internationally.      Invoice  financing  –  The  Fundbox 40  is  helping  business  owners  and  freelancers   overcome  cash  flow  gaps  by  advancing  payments  for  their  outstanding  invoices.  The   companies  are  not  charged  interest  and  get  100%  of  the  value  of  the  invoice.  The   Fundbox  however  charges a small fee for each week of an outstanding balance (equal   to approximately 0.5% of the invoice value). The fee varies slightly  depending on the   invoice.  However   on  a  $1 000  invoice  the  company  pays  ~$60  in  fees  over  the  12   week  repayment  period    this  equates  to  ~$5  per  week.  Advances  are  automatically   paid  back  over  12  weeks   but  there  is  a  choice  to  repay  early   at  any  time   without   penalty and all remaining fees will be waived.                                                                          38 https //www.dfcugroup.com/    39 https //www.marketinvoice.com   40 https //fundbox.com/          18            Savings account linked input financing  National Microfinance Bank of Tanzania41 has a   specialized NMB Kilimo Account which is a tailor made saving account for farmers. It   offers  bonus  interest  rate  for  farmer  savings  from  realized  sales  proceeds  after  crop   harvest and sold through warehouse receipt system or other market channels.          Value chain finance  Go Finance42 provides shortterm working capital loans to micro    small  and MSMEs that work in business value chains  such as consumer goods value   chains (for example  the soft drinks industry) in Tanzania. Go Finance augments their   credit offering by collaborating with complementary financial services providers  such   as  health  and  business  insurance  providers  to  provide  a  range  of  relevant  financial   solutions  to  the  target  market.  Go  Finance  is  pioneering  the  use  of  data  (such  as   payments & historical sales data from large consumer goods and telecom companies)   in  combination  with  data  from  credit  bureaus  etc.  as  a  satisfactory  innovative  to   assessing credit worthiness in absence of traditional options such as audited financials.   Go Finance secures its loans primarily through guarantees based on the business and   social  relationships  that  exist  within  a  value  chain  as  the  main  form  of  collateral  as   opposed to requiring hard collateral such as title deeds. The value proposition is to use   existing  data  and  social/business  relationships  within  a  value  chain  to  assess  and   extend  credit  in  a  manner  that  is  convenient  and  flexible  to  the  SMEs.  Go  Finance’s   approach is unique in the region because of the collaterallite approach and the use of   innovative data to screen potential clients.       Supply chain finance  Aztec Exchange43 is an online platform launched in May 2013 to   enable  SMEs  in  the  developing  world  and  credit  constrained  developed  markets    particularly in Europe  to sell invoices that they have issued to large overseas buyers   and those buyers’ local subsidiaries and that have been approved for payment. Aztec   aims  to  expand  global  supplier  access  to  simple  lowcost  invoice  finance.  Company's   technology and Global Institutional Investor capital pool enables it to offer systematic    invoice discounting globally to supplychains  einvoice networks and suppliers at a low   cost  and  without  the  credit  scoring  and  the  application  process  of  traditional  trade   finance solutions. Suppliers simply register once on Aztec’s ‘PaymeNow’ portal  select   the  invoices  they  want  paid   at  a  single  transparent  discount  rate  available  to  all   suppliers  and click submit. Aztec is available to corporations and einvoice networks as   a full thirdparty invoice finance solution extending coverage to 100% of the suppliers   in the supplychain  complementing existing finance providers.       Purchase  order  finance    Crimson  Finance  Fund44 (CFF)  targets  the  large  number  of   SMEs in developing countries that cannot obtain the financing they need to grow and   become  competitive.  Banks  in  Kosovo  view  SMEs  lending  as  risky  and  costly  and  the   underwriting requirements of most banks make loans out of reach for many  SMEs in                                                                     41 http //www.nmbtz.com/   42 http //www.gofinanceco.com/   43 https //www.aztecexchange.com/   44 http //www.cffkosovo.com/          19          the region. CFF's main lending instrument is Purchase Order Finance (POF)  which is an   innovative  working  capital  finance  instrument.  In  POF   the  SME  obtains  a  verified   purchase  order  from  a  buyer  and  estimates  the  total  cost  required  to  complete  the   order.  The  financier  reviews  the  order   the  cost  breakdown   and  the  operational   history of the SME. If the loan is approved  the financier advances a percentage of the   total order value to the SME  equal to the exact amount the SME needs to complete   the  order.  The  SME  then  produces  the  good  and  invoices  the  customer.  The   receivables  are  assigned  to  the  financier  and  the  customer  is  instructed  to  pay  the   financier  directly.  When  the  financier  receives  the  payment   it  deducts  the  amount   advanced and interest or fees  and remits the balance to the SME.          SUMMARY      The topic of financial innovation is quite a controversial one. It has many opponents  as well as   allies. However  whatever the outcomes of the innovations in the financial sector are  it is very   clear  that  there  is  an  obvious  need  for  it.  One  of  the  arguments  for  this  statement  is  the   existence of a financing gap and a high percentage of unserved individuals and SMEs.      The FinTech companies  true disruptors of the financial sector  are at the leading centre of the   innovation  movement.  Nonetheless   the  conventional  players   i.e.  banks   still  dominate  the   sector. According to the Economist  the “Lending Club has arranged $9 billion in loans through   its  marketplace   small  change  compared  with  $885  billion  of  total  creditcard  debt  in   America45”. However  as seen from the cases provided above banks are also stepping into the   field of innovation through the creation of tailored products and the adoption of new financing   instruments.      It is also important to note that as Schumpeter stated the “defining characteristic of innovation   is simply the doing new things or the doing of things that are already being done in a new way”   (Schumpeter  1934  p.153). That is the criteria that the research was guided by when selecting   cases  upon  which  the  trends  were  identified.  Therefore   we  also  list  instruments  that  could   seem  to  be quite traditional in one region of  the world but very innovative in  another. Such   instruments  as  financing  blended  with  technical  assistance   financial  literacy  campaigns  or   mobile payment services.      It  also  can  be  suggested  that  the  SME  financing  niche  is  narrowing  down  thanks  to  the   emerging  innovative  financing  instruments  applied  in  the  given  area  by  various  financial   institutions. The availability and application of those instruments vary greatly on a countryto  country  basis.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  influence  of  different  factors   where  degree  of   development of financial and legal systems is among the major ones.                                                                               45 http //www.economist.com/node/21650546/print          20          REFERENCES     ACCA  2014.
