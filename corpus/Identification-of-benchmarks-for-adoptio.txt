Introduction     In India  Cold Chain Industry is developing at a faster pace because the focus has tremendously shifted from increasing the   production to make storage facilities and transportation better. The cold chain has now become an integral part of the supply   chain industry comprising of refrigerated storage and refrigerated transportation. The cold storage facilities have the ability to   maintain the shelf life of perishable goods by maintaining suitable temperature of the products from the farm to folk. Owing   to the rising needs of the cold storage for reducing the wastage  this industry is anticipated to grow at a CAGR of 19% dur ing   20172022.      The cold chain storage industry in India is still at a growing stage and despite production of perishables at a large scale; the   major  challenges  include  high  initial  investment  (despite  government  subsidy)   lack  of  supporting  infrastructure   lack  of   knowledge  for  managing  perishable  produce   etc.  Also   increasing  urbanization  and  growing  of  organized  retail   food   servicing and  food processing sectors are helping  in  boosting the growth of cold chain  industry  in India. The trend  is  now   shifting  towards  establishing  of  cold  storages  for  multipurpose  and  providing  endtoend  services  to  control  parameters   throughout  the  value  chain.  The  research  seeks  to  demonstrate  the  future  of  cold  chain  storage  in  India.    This  empirical   research shall examine and focus on the crucial role of cold chain storage in reducing the agricultural losses.      We shall initially carry out a critical literature review in the field of supply chains management for cold chain in India. This   will  help  understand  the  current  practices  and  relevant  characteristics  applicable  to  SMEs  in  this  sector.  Next   through  an   empirical  study   survey  SMEs  to  identify  gaps  and  finally  suggest  benchmarking  parameters   such  as   renewable  energy    innovative technologies  etc.  for future development of coldchain infrastructure.        2.  Literature Review     Supply chain of perishables things is a "cold chain" (Bishara  2006). A cold chain ensures wide assortment of food  medicines   and substance items from debasement and prevent them from inadequate exposure to the temperature  dampness  or specific   items  by  keeping  them  chilled   frozen  and  fresh.  As  Indian  economy  depends  on  horticulture   improvement  of  cold  chain   outline will assume an  important part in reducing the troubles and wastage's   increasing the  farmers  income  creating work   open  doors  for  the  neighbourhood  individuals   and  enhancing  the  occupation  of  the  farmers  and  agriculturists  to  prompt   building up the Indian economy and becoming a worldwide pioneer (Negi and Anand  2015).     Cold storage plays vital role in reducing postharvest losses of edible commodities by enhancing their storability and shelf  life. Timely storage of highly perishable and perishable commodities helps in their regular and continuous supply either for   table  or  processing  purposes.  Food  supply  chains  are  defied  with  expanded  shopper  requests  on  sustenance  quality  and   manageability.  While  updating  these  chains   the  examination  of  nourishment  quality  change  and  natural  heap  of  new   situations is as imperative as the investigation of effectiveness and responsiveness prerequisites (van der Vorst et al.  2009).    The equipment and process used to convey and keep chilled and frozen sustenance‟s in the correct shape and quality in place   is known  as the  “cold chain”. The cold chain  is  a physical  procedure that commands the coordination‟s of certain  handled   nourishments.  Temperature  prerequisites  shift  among  sustenance  things   regardless  of  whether  frozen  or  chilled   and  they   significantly vary over various types of solidified nourishments.      SimchiLevi   Kaminsky  and SimchiLevi (2004) defines SCM as  “an arrangement of  methodologies used to proficiently   incorporate providers  makers  stockrooms and stores  with the goal that stock is created and conveyed in the correct amounts   to  the  correct  areas  and  at  the  perfect  time   to  limit  framework  wide  expenses  while  fulfilling  administration  level   necessities”.  A  key  component of  the  present  business  condition  is  the  possibility  that  supplychains  and  not  organizations   contend  (Christopher   1992).  Managing  supply  chains  effectively  is  a  complicated  and  challenging  task  as  a  result  of  the   ongoing trends of expanding product variety  short product life cycles  increased outsourcing  globalization of businesses and   continuous advances in information technology (Lee  2002).           210      Fifteenth AIMS International Conference on Management     Any mixup in timeseparation or temperature in the chain can easily hinder the net present estimation of the exercises and   their additional incentive exposed to the harsh elements in chain (Bogataj  Bogataj and Vodopivec  2005). In the supply chain   of  nonperishable  items  and  the  supply  chain  of  perishable  items  there  is  basic  difference  as  the  perishable  items  has  the   possibility of degradation in quality and estimation of the thing  which begins from the maker's place till it  is d evoured. The   cold  chain  begins  at  the  homestead  level  (e.g.  methods  of  harvesting   precooling)  and  conceals  to  the  purchaser  level   (cooling  practices  and  conduct).  An  average  cold  chain  foundation  for  the  most  part  comprises  of  precooling   chilly   stockpiles   reefer  trucks   bundling   distribution  centers   retailers   and  shoppers   under  the  aegis  of  data  administration   frameworks (Montanari  2008).     The integrity the cold chain must be safeguarded from producing to processing and through every logistical stage – taking   care of  stacking  unpacking  and storing and it also covers storage at the any household also i.e. refrigerator. Salin and N ayga   (2003)  advocate that an effective and efficient supervision of cold storage is a way to avoid pointless misfortunes. Literature   works on management of cold chain have talked about different methods of performance variables and aspects that impact the   cold chain's proficiency and reliability. Donk  Akkerman and Vaart (2008) has investigated the exact issues of producers who   are searching  for efficient cold chain  and  it  has  been recommended that sustenance supply  chains  are  in the  bleeding edge   concerning  inventory  network works on  organizing of the chain  and  furthermore utilizing of the  ideas  like Electronic Data   Interchange  Vendor Managed Inventories and Collaborative Forecasting & Replenishment techniques..      Fearne  and  Hughes  (2000)  examined  the  advancements  of  production  network  in  the  UK  perishables  industry  and  have   identified achievement factors  such as change  in the cost control and development  etc. Bogataj et al. (2005) and Valeeva et   al.  (2006) have studied the steadiness of perishable items in the logistical chains at the farm level. In this regard  Jahre and   Hatteland (2004)  Blanco  Masini  Petracci  and Bandoni (2005) and Berger (2007) all have focused on the standardizing of   the packaging and distribution of perishable items. Government  nongovernment  industry  the educational institutes and the   communities should work intently to make the entirety of cold chain from "farmtofork".     Researchers  such as Sahin  Babaı  Yves and Renaud (2007)  Blanco et al.  (2005)  Mangina and Vlachos (2005)  Jahre and   Hatteland (2004)  jointly talk about the multiple challenges the cold chain is getting confronted from either the producer  or   the  processor   or  the  distributor  or  the  retailer.  Their  perceptions  are  that  the  cold  chain  is  broken  at  a  few  places  in  the   connecting link which eventually decreases its execution. In this regard  Fearne and Hughes (2000)  has said that the supply   chain advances in the perishable industry of UK and has recognized a few achievement factors like change in the cost control   and development  etc. Bogataj et al. (2005) have considered the solidness of fresh produce in supply chain and examined the   unsettling  influences  which  diminish  the  cleanliness  and  nature  of  produces.  For  perishables   keeping  up  the  cleanliness    security  and expectedness of value and freshness requires proficient hardware with ensured warm attributes  fitting working   modes and appropriate data framework (Amjadi  2005; Manning  Baines  and Chadd  2006). Montanari (2008) had identified   the  basic  constraints  influencing  sustenance  superiority  and  wellbeing  and  measurement  through  an  orderly  demonstrating   methodology will permit checking the quality and security status of nourishment items all through the cold chain.     Chan  Chan  Lau  and Ip (2006) stresses that keeping in mind the end goal to enhance execution of the whole cold chain it   is  needed  to  investigate  the  factors  form  which  the  execution  of  item   administrations  and  processes  can  be  assessed.   Productivity  is  the  conventional  execution  factor  and  all  cold  chain  members  might  want  to  get  a  worthy  profit  for  their   speculations  in  the  wake  of  barring  different  expenses  (Da  Silva  and  Filho   2007).  For  the  agricultural  food  chains   both   making and value dependability influence sustenance security. In this manner  the capacity to give enough items to ensure a   sufficient supply to address sustenance issues is additionally a critical execution (Manning et al.  2006; Da Silva and Filho    2007).  There  is  need  to  answer  suitable  performance  factors  whether  the  customers  receiving  the  cold  storage  items  are   adequate quantity  good quality  timeliness and prices (Fearne  Barrow and Schulenberg  2006; Beamon  1999).     The traceability issues were taken by numerous analysts (Kelepouris  Pramatari  and Doukidis  2007; Regattieri  Gamberi    and Manzini  2007; Folinas  Manikas  and Manos  2006; Joshi  Ban wet and Shankar  (2009) and they all have expressed the   need for solid IT framework for cold chains. In supplement to this  Rijswijk and Frewer (2008) explored that traceability is   connected to nourishment wellbeing as well as to the nature of sustenance. Taylor and Fearne (2006) have watched that most   vital  test  in  cold  chain  administration  is  steady  unevenness  amongst  free  market  activity  which  is  bolstered  by  Gorton    Dumitrashko   and  White  (2006)  while  discussing  the  issues  vanquishing  the  stock  system  frustration  in  agrinourishment   division. At retail level keeping up the cold chain  stock control and return or trade approaches of perishable things are a few   issues which have been suggested in the writing.     Luo  Zhu  Ye  Hou  Chen and Bulysheva (2016)  talks about the future of cold storage where the structure and information   platform design mechanism are introduced. The key part of this system is a wireless sensor network built on Zigbee. Wireless   sensors located in cold storages or refrigerated trucks are able to collect and transmit live data quickly and efficiently.       As we know that India is the world‟s largest milk producer but none of Indian dairy is listed in top dairy companies of the   world (Banerjee  2007; Brouwers  2006). Also estimates that around 3540 percent of the aggregate generation of new foods   grown from the ground is wasted in India which is equivalent to the aggregate creation of the Great Britain (Khan  2005). At   the present level of creation cultivate deliver of about Rs 70 000 million (US$1 400 m) which is wasted each year it is on the   grounds that as there is no sufficient cold storage facilities  reefer trucks  cool chain offices and absence of other framework   underpins  (Viswanadham   2006).  The  cold  storage  system  in  India  is  very  complicated  as  there  are  more  small  players  or   stakeholders  like  agriculturist   distributer   processor or  producer   and  retailer.  Each  accomplice  works  in  remoteness  to the   other.  Indian  items  have  the  lower  yields   and  the  insufficient  preservation  methods  increases  the  final  result  costs          Fifteenth AIMS International Conference on Management     211     significantly  with  absence  of  reasonable  handling  status  assortments.  There  are  many  inhibitors  which  influence  the   productivity of the cold chain as well as impact each other fundamentally.      Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) plays an important role in the economic growth of any country. India has 30 million   SMEs and they contributed around 17 percent to India‟s GDP in 2017. In India  the units are basically classified on the basis   of their investment in plant & machinery.  Below is the classification         Description     Manufacturing      Service     Micro      Small     Up to USD 62 500     Up to USD 25 000     Above USD 62 500 and up to USD 1.25 million     Above USD 25 000 and up to USD 0.5 million     Medium     Above USD 1.25 million and up to USD 2.5 million  Above USD 0.5 million and up to USD 1.5 million     Source  Small & Medium Business Development Chamber of India  2017        As we know there is need to process perishable items  fruits  vegetables etc. in order to increase their storage or shelf life   considerably. The process of the supply chain of fresh produce from the farm to the fo lk (end point of consumption) is highly   complex. Post harvest management activities include from cooling  handling  storage  processing  packaging  transport and   making  fresh product available  in  market. It is  necessary to have adequate cold  storage  facility to prevent perishable  items   from getting waste. It has been noted that nearly 40 percent of the fruits and vegetables are wasted yearly due to lack of co ld   storage. We can say that there are numerous challenges  involved related to  cold storage facilities  like ownership  by SMEs    huge  investment   institutional  issues   high  energy  costs  and  temperature  variability  adding  to  the  corrosion  of  the  fresh   produce.      Due  to  insufficient  cold  chain  facilities   logistical  infrastructure  and  postharvest  handling  activities  Indian  cold  chain   industry  is  still  on  developing  stage.  Still   there  are  opportunities  to  develop  the  cold  chain  sector in  India.  The  paper  will   explore the future of cold chain  it tells us about the current scenario of cold chain in India. So that that current perspective   should be kept in mind while designing future cold chain so improvements can be done        3.  Methodology     We  have  conducted  a  survey  based  questionnaire.  This  is  because  a  survey  based  questionnaire  in  our  case  addresses  the   specific research issues related to cold storage facilities. In this research  we have selected primary data because the opinions   to the questions posed in the survey are filled by the MSMEs in cold chain sector. It had addressed the specific research issues   which MSMEs are facing specific to their own situations. Also  we can rely on the data as it has been directly collected from   the MSMEs involved in cold chain sector.      The data collection was done through Primary and Secondary resources.  The primary data  is the  data which  is collected   through  interviews  and  questionnaires  etc.  The  secondary  data  is  the  existing  data  which  is  collected  by  some  other   researcher.  Questionnaires  include  both  openended  aswellas  closedended  questions.  While  the  openended  questions   provided general information the closedended questions shall restrict the answers to the requirement of this research (Ranjit   Kumar; 2014). All data shall be collected during the month of October 2017.      According to (Saunders  M.  Lewis  P. & Thorn hill  A. 2012) convenience sampling has been used as one the method for   collection  of  data.  This  was  done  because  of  limited  number  of  SMEs  into  cold  storage  and  limited  time.  So  a  list  of  21   identified SMEs in cold storage was obtained (Data from Accord Fintech). Convenience sampling  also known as availability   sampling. It is specific type of nonprobability sampling method that relies on data collection from population members who   are  conveniently  available  to  participate  in  study.    Convenience  sampling  is  a  type  of  sampling  where  the  first  available   primary data source will be used for the research without additional requirements. It is the sampling method which involves   getting participants wherever we can find them and typically wherever is convenient. In convenience sampling no inclusion   criteria identified prior to the selection of subjects (Saunders  et. al.  2012). Some uses of convenience sampling are sampling   are ease of availability of data  time saving  money saving and also it is useful  in pilot study as these findings can serve as   pointers  and  we  deciding  further  line  of  action.  It  also  has  limitations  as  data  can  be  biased  as  some  groups  are  over  represented and  some groups are underrepresented  there can be  high possibility of sampling error and  result also can‟t be   generalized as the respondents are not representative of entire population. (Deepa Karnadikar  2016)     The  analysis  of  the  data  collected  through  the  survey  questionnaire  helped  us  in  knowing  the  wastage  that  happened   because of inadequate cold chain facilities and helped us in identifying gaps and finally suggest benchmarking parameters    such as  renewable energy  innovative technologies  etc.  for development of coldchain infrastructure..         4.  Results and Discussions     In India  there are around 6 300 cold storage facilities which are unequally present across the whole country. Most of the cold   storages are used for storing of potatoes around 75%. But today we can see that the market is progressively getting organized.   Also  more than 50% of cold storage are currently situated in Uttar Pradesh (UP) and West Bengal (2017). Some facts about   Indian cold chain industry are   •  Only 8 to 10 percent of cold storages are in the Organized sector.   •  Capacity of Most cold storages around 36% have capacity below 1 000 MT   •  According to current capacity of cold storages around 11% of produce can be stored.          212      Fifteenth AIMS International Conference on Management     •     From the survey  we were able to identify 21 companies in SMEs category which are into cold storages.     Response was collected from 31 Cold Storages; 21 SMEs and 10 MSMEs which are on border line of SMEs and MSMEs.   In  the  response   we  came  across  the  ownership  factor.  Each  company  owns  a  cold  storage  it  was  possible  because  of  the   subsidy factor in investment by Ministry of Food processing  National horticulture board etc.     Also  a major question was asked regarding to capacity utilization of cold storage. Majority of them answered with full and   100%. After a telephonic conversation with these 31 identified SMEs it was noticed that they utilize their capacity more than   full  i.e.  around  130140%  as  there  is  lack  of  cold  storage  in  some  areas.  Today  government  have  taken  various  steps  for   reduction  of  waste  that  happen  due  to  lack  of  cold  storage  facilities.  For  this  government  has  started  encouraging  private   sector to develop the cold chain industry by implementation of the latest and most efficient refrigeration equipment solutions   available today.      For  the  construction  of  cold  storages  initial  investment  requirement  is  high  which  is  the  biggest  challenge  today.  Now   government is trying to solve this problem by giving various subsidies  schemes on construction of cold storages. Some of the    initiatives are           Easy funding options     Establishing National center for cold chain development     Also  many tax incentives and tax holidays are being favored to cold storage companies.     100% FDI through government route   3540% Subsidy of project cost.     It  is developing  economies such as India  it  is  more difficult to operate. As there is back support of healthy  infrastructure   and there are limited or no uncertainties in the logistical chain in developed countries. Logistical chain has to face number of   challenges in emerging  economies due to uncertain environment  poor infrastructure and ambiguity in accessibility of some   basic requirements like water  power etc. So well applied strategies and policies cannot be applied in developing economies   as  they  have  to  be  modified  accordingly   this  is  also  the  reason  why  strategies  fail  when  they  are  applied  to  emerging   economies the same way. McDonald  can  be a good example  for cold chain as  it  has an  efficient and developed  cold chain   facility in the USA but after entering India it took around 4 years and 450 cr. to set up its cold chain network.        5.  Conclusions     This  empirical study  has  made  an attempt to identify the crucial  factors that are  hindrances  in the  development of the cold   chain  sector in India It were watched that the absence of satisfactory  framework alongside  high  cost for establishment and   operation are the greatest disadvantage for strong and efficient cold chain. In India  logistics cost is evaluated around 1525   percent as compared to logistics cost in USA and UK which is around 79 percent (Swami Nathan  2007). The main reason is   lack the absence of required infrastructure. In India operating expenses for cold storages is twofold when contrasted with cost   of cold storages USA and UK. Additionally  High import duties and excise duty make setting up cold storages troublesome    unviable and uneconomical. The Government needs to support cold chain players in their initiatives and provide for a more   encouraging environment by continuing to upgrade infrastructure and other facilities needed in development of cold storage.   Some tax incentives like tax holidays for investing  in cold chain infrastructure sector should be given. There should be 100   percent depreciation on freezer cabinets and other cold chain  equipment‟s. Also  import duties on all capital equipment‟s of   cold chain sector should be reduced to 4%. (Khan  2005)     The research was conducted for SMEs in cold chain sector. The study has mainly concentrated on the initial investments    various government subsidies  capacity of cold storage and other constraints involved in cold storage operations. Only SMEs   who are into cold chain have been taken into consideration. The study throws light on different problems faced by the cold   storage units in maintenance and farmers/traders in stocking their produce in the cold storage units.     The study has limitation of less data available as there were only 21 SMEs who were into cold storage. Also  the owners of   the cold storages were generally suspicious of the motives of any investigation because of fear of taxation. So  the research   had to face some drawbacks in getting the accuracy data‟s. Quantitative data was collected from various cold storage units in   a very limited period of time and for a limited sample size. Hence  generalization of the results was attempted carefully.         6.  Acknowledgement     The study has limitation of less data available as there were only 21 SMEs who were into cold storage.
