Introduction   This  research  was  conducted  to  establish  the  relationship  between  business  strategies   towards  corporate  governance  practices  and  structures   incorporated  by  organizational   capacity elements and information technology strategy of Islamic micro finance institutions   in Indonesia. Because of poor corporate governance  which led to a decline in public trust and   also  equity  market  values  per  share  during  the  financial  crisis   19971998   the  issue  of   corporate governance has become a major concern of stakeholders (DavisFriday  Eng  & Liu    2006). Moreover  the impact this condition will be felt by its main stakeholders. Therefore    corporate governance is a study that is always considered as long as the company survives. A   study by Ho and Williams (2003) provides findings which show that the need for  corporate   governance is different in various companies under different economic conditions (Ghezzi    2013).     The public still have a big trauma situation due to of weak corporate governance  such   as the collapse of large companies  such as Enron Corporation in late 2001 and the collapse   of  Global  Crossing  and  WorldCom   and  Tyco  International  in  the  United  States  (US)   have   increasingly contributed to serious issues of corporate governance. (Thomas  2000) The same   conditions are currently being faced by companies in Indonesia.      The  Indonesian  Financial  Services  Authority  said  that  on  a  macro  industry  scale    companies in Indonesia only place 2 companies from the list of the 50 best issuers in good   corporate governance practices in ASEAN. This achievement is still very far behind compared   to Thailand which is able to place 23 issuers  followed by the Philippines with 11 issuers. While   Singapore  and  Malaysia each  place  8  and 6  issuers  respectively  (OJK   2018).  It  means  the   companies in Indonesia still have many problems regarding good corporate governance.     By  using  agency  and  stewardship  theory   many  studies  have  examined  business   strategy and corporate governance. In some findings it was found that there was an impact   of board independence and leadership structure on company performance (Mahmoud Abu  Tapanjeh   2006).  The  findings  of  this  study  indicate  that  the  company's  performance  is   influenced  by  the  independence  of  the  board  and  the  leadership  structure.  Nevertheless    business  strategy  must be  a  trigger  and  right  direction for the running of  business for  the   organization. Business strategies become intrinsic references that contain various company   values.  Business  strategies  can  also  be  a  differentiator  compared  to  competitors.  For  this     2          reason it would be very interesting if this study read the success of a company from another   perspective  namely the business strategy through corporate governance.     The  business  strategy  will  provide  broad  and  clear  horizons  for  the  running  of   corporate governance. For example  a study in New Zealand by Prevost et al (2002) showed   that  the  improvement  in  results  and  performance  efficiency  were  extraordinary  when  the   board of directors  part of corporate governance  was associated with the company's business   strategy.      In addition  the findings of Gani and Jermias (2006) reveal that the consideration of   the  company's  competition  strategy  is  very  important  for  a  better  understanding  of  the   relationship between board independence and business strategy. In terms of the leadership   structure   a  study  by  AbuTapanjeh  (2006)  found  that  CEO  duality does  not  lead to better   company performance on the Amman Stock Exchange than companies registered in Jordan   due to the inability of the business strategy implemented. Studies using these explanatory   variables contribute to the field of corporate governance by providing findings on the impact   of business strategies on corporate governance.     The link between business strategy and governance in this study will be tested using   moderating variables. This variable is to examine the level of consistency of business strategy   and  governance  relationships.  That  is   whether  these  two  variables  are  able  to  be   strengthened  by  other  variables.  This  study  will  use  2  moderating  variables  namely   organizational  capacity  and  information  technology  strategies.  These  two  variables  are   important to study because they have a very important role. Organizational capacity shows   how  strong  software  and  soft  skills  companies  have  to  compete.  Organizational  capacity   contains various elements of value that differentiate between competitors. This is part of the   uniqueness of the company. Moreover  the organizational capacity determines how strong   the company is in carrying out the rhythm of the organization.     A resourcebased view from a corporate perspective (RBV) has been recognized as the   right theory to enlighten the problem of the influence of organizational capacity on corporate   governance.  Corporate  governance  is  recognized  through  organizational  resource  capacity   that has unique competencies and organizational values  which in turn  leads to competitive   advantage  which is also known as the company's core competencies.      While the information technology strategy variable is used as a measure of company   sensitivity to dynamics and changing times. In the era of  industrial revolution 4.0  business   organizations are constantly looking for technology to improve their core competencies and   gain  competitive  advantage  in  diverse  and  rapidly  changing  markets  (Yayla  &  Hu   2012)).   Information Technology (IT) is believed to be one of the most important strengths needed by   business  companies  to  improve  their  efficiency  (Lusthaus   Adrien   Anderson   Carden   &   Montalvan  2002)  competitiveness (Chao & Chandra  2012)  and innovation (King  Cragg  &   Hussin  2000).      Explicitly   IT  significantly  promotes  efficiency  by  reducing  the  costs  of  acquiring    processing  and transmitting information  creating competitive advantage by lowering costs    increasing  differentiation  and  quickly  circulating  advanced  knowledge  in  the  company   (Dewett & Jones 2001)  and facilitates innovation by creating a large and rich collection of   knowledge  for  employees  to  draw  from  when  they  are  involved  in  problem  solving  and   decision making (Dewett & Jones  2001).     In the era of globalization  business enterprises in the developing countries have to   compete both domestically and internationally to survive and hence prosper. Unlike  macro   financial institution such as banks which have deep pockets to hire experience employees      3          and  implement  uptodate  technologies to  sharpen  their  competitive  edges   micro finance   institution  especially  in the developing countries can only utilize their limited resources to   optimize their efficiency  profitability  and competitiveness.      Having noted the potential benefit of IT in improving the efficiency of an organization    the alignment between business and IT strategies is believed to be the most effective solution   for  Islamic  microfinance  institutions  to  survive  and  prosper  in  the  ever  competitive   environment. Futhermore  IT related issues in Islamic microfinance institutions are financial   technology (Fintech). Fintech is one of the technological innovations in the financial sector   (Chao & Chandra  2012). In this modern era  all aspects of people's lives are very close to IT.   The  existence  of  Fintech  is  expected  to  provide  various  solutions  in  the  field  of  financial   transactions for the community  for example the ease of the community in accessing financial   products and making it easier for them to transact. Until January 2016  the Indonesian Fintech   Association  noted  that  domestic  Fintech  actors  operating  in  Indonesia  reached  165   companies or grew four times compared to Q42014 as many as 40 companies. (Nazirman    2017)     Fintech's rules in financial institutions have been regulated by the financial services   authority  no  77  /  PJOK.01  /  2016  (OJK   2018).  Technologybased  lending  and  borrowing   services in financial services are bringing together among debitors and creditors in order to   make agreements directly through electronic systems using the internet network. Indeed  the   usage of Fintech in Islamic microfinance institutions is expected to hint users and operators.   However   in  accordance  with  Islamic  vocabulary   it  must  return   especially  in  Islamic   transactions  to  be  in  accordance  with  the  guidance  of  the  Koran  and  prophetic  tradition   (Nasirman  2007) . For this reason  Islamic microfinance institutions are also required to carry   out innovations and new breakthroughs in their business  for example  IT must also consider   the principles of sharia which are the basis.     Fintech  for  Islamic  microfinance  institutions  will  provide  a  good  and  digitally   controlled  picture  and  service.  This  situation  provides  great  benefits  for  the  running  of   corporate governance. Everything that runs within the company is controlled by a measured   and  precise  system.  The  end  result  of  the  implementation  of  the  information  technology   strategy  is  the  achievement  of  corporate  governance  that  runs  effectively  and  efficiently   without reducing the level of stakeholder satisfaction.          Literature Review     The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  assess  the  relationship  between  business  strategy  and   corporate  governance   moderated  by  organizational  capacity  and  information  technology   strategy Islamic micro finance institutions in Indonesia. The introduction of the ICGI  which   stresses  on  accountability  and  transparency   is  expected  to  result  in  better  company   performance (UNESCO  2015). Companies that comply with the recommendation of the ICGI   are  expected  to  perform  better than  others.  Prior  studies  have  examined the  influence of   corporate  governance   organizational  capacity  and  information  technology  strategy  on   company  performance.  However   none  has  investigated  the  moderating  effect  of  the   organizational  capacity  and  information  technology  strategy  on  the  association  between   corporate governance and corporate performance.     While  there  have  been  significant  empirical  studies  focusing  on  identifying  the   association between business strategy and corporate governance  this study investigates the   relationship  between  business  strategy  and  corporate  governance  with  the  presence  of   organizational  capacity  and  information  technology  strategy  as  moderators.  Initially   this     4          study tested the impact that  corporate governance has on the performance of companies.   There  is  some  empirical  evidence  regarding  the  capacity  of  asses’  organizations  in  the   performance  of  companies  regarding  the  relationship  between  business  strategy  and   corporate  governance.  Meanwhile   the  relationship  between  organizational  culture  and   company performance and the relationship between organizational capacity and company   performance has been carried out independently.     For instance  the findings of a study by TzeYu and Andre (2010) imply that acquiring   companies having controlling shareholders  who own shares of between twentyfive per cent   and thirty per cent  enhances their postacquisition operating performance over three years   after dealing in the business (Klouwenberg  Koot  & van Schaik  1995). In addition  the findings   of  other  studies   such  as  by    Yuliansyah  et.al  (2017)  found  evidence  that  better  corporate   governance is associated with higher operating performance and market valuation  such as   return on assets (ROA) and Tobin's Q (TO) (Yuliansyah  Gurd  & Mohamed  2017).      While the issue of corporate governance in other countries globally was given specific   attention  much  earlier  compared   studies  on  corporate  governance  have  largely  emerged   subsequent  to  the  1997/1998  Asian  Financial  Crisis.  Several  recent  studies  suggest  that   corporate governance factors  such as independent directors  CEO duality  size of the board    family members on board and ownership structure  are strong determinants of performance   of companies (Ghezzi  2013; Yuliansyah  Rammal  & Rose  2016).     Both the agency theory and the stewardship theory are in the current study. However    the  agency  theory  is  the  leading  theory  used  in  this  study  with  respect  to  corporate   governance. The classic agency theory explain how to organize the relationship between the   party that identifies the work (the principal) and the pasty that takes the responsibility and   apparently acts on behalf of the principal  knows a the agent. The agency perspective has the   notion that the nearest of the owners and managers may not coincide (Abdolmohammadi &   Owhoso  2000). Thus  the agent principal theoretical timeworks emphasizes that companies   can employ a variety of mechanisms to align the interest of owners and agents. The agency   does so have the same view as the stewardship theory that protects and shareholder's wealth   in accordance with the objectives of this partials (Klouwenberg et al.  1995). Contrary to the   agency  theory  that  motivates  agents  through  awards   such  money   promotion  and   authorization  the stewardship theory inspires and urges agents through intrinsic or native   rewards  such as affiliation opportunity to get promoted and achievement       A company is a social system in which members of a company usually have a certain   influence in the decision tool to get involved in the system during working (Yiing & Ahmad    2009). The essence of the organizational culture theory act and make decisions not only based   on the facts of a case but also in response to the culture of the organization. This theory is   used as the main theory in explaining the relationship between organizational culture and   company  performance  Studies  linking  organizational  capacity  and  company  performance   have been carried out in the past half a decade with the emergence of the discussion involving   the resources of a company. Various studies appeared to debate organizational capacity and   the importance of resources to company performance (Gani & Jermias  2006; Lusthaus et al.    2002) .     Due  to  the  mixed  and  inconclusive  findings  with  to  corporate  governance  and   corporate performance  the current study is motivated to examine the impact of corporate   governance  on  company  performance  with  the  inclusion  of  the  moderators.  Hence   the   reason  for  examining  the  issues  simultaneously  is  to  provide  explanations  concerning  the   moderating  the  effects  of  the  organizational  capacity  elements  and  IT  strategy  on  the     5          influence of corporate governance (Aida & Imen  2014; Sivathanu & Pillai  2018). The current   study examines the issues of corporate governance  organizational capacity and information   technology  strategy  together  because  the  gap  in  the  literature  concerning  corporate   governance   organizational  capacity  and  information  technology  strategy  have  not  been   taken into consideration. Organizational capacity and information technology strategy have   diverted the impact on company performance in which such impact is the reflection of the   decisions  made  on  corporate  governance  (Yayla  &  Hu   2012).  As  such   the  current  study   provides a breakdown of the impact of corporate governance on corporate performance by   specifically  showing  that  organizational  capacity  and  information  technology  strategy  are   designed to accommodate the board decisions made through corporate governance.      Acknowledging  the fact that  researches  on  the alignment  between  business  and  IT   strategies have largely emphasized on large business companies (Cragg  King  and Husnayati    2002; Chao & Chandra  2012)  especially among the developed nations (Yayla & Hu  2012)    further studies needed to be extended to SMEs in the developing nations. Besides  having   acknowledged the significant role of the organization culture in the effective adoption of IT in   an organization  further explorations on the impact of organization culture on the business  IT strategic alignment are greatly needed.     However   given  the  definition  of  corporate  governance  as  a  process  and  structure   used to manage a business in achieving the objectives of a company and the description of   organizational  culture  as  a  factor  that  affects  individuals  in  an  organization   this  study   explores the link between these two variables. Previous studies have shown that the value of   organizational culture is connected with corporate overcame if it is shared among corporate   members. In addition  it depicts the way problems with regard to managerial issues. Hence    organizational culture emerges as a function that can assist in consolidating the organizational   behaviour patterns whereby corporate governance is described as a driver of  culture in an   organization (Conclusions & Academic  n.d.) (Llopis  Gonzalez and Gasco  2010).      Abe  and  Iwasaki  (2010)  provide  evidence  that  there  are  different  impacts  on   managerial turnover in their study which focused on the CEO dismissal and renewal in Russian   firms due to the differences in behavioural patterns between domestic and foreign investors   (Abe & Iwasaki  2010). This finding shows how organizational capacity could have affected the   performance  of  companies   and   consequently   has  led  to  an  increased  interest  in   investigating  the  issue  in  the  Malaysian  context  In  respect  of  the  organizational  capacity    which is understood as developing the resources and capabilities of an organization that are   valuable  rare  imperfectly imitable and non substitutable  the current study is also interested   in exploring the link between the corporate governance and capabilities of a company. This is   because organizational capabilities form part of the organization's environment that affect its   performance (Lusthaus  Adrien  Anderson  Carden and Montalvan  2002).      The relationship between corporate governance and organizational capacity can be   explained  by  the  systems  of  organizational  capacity  that  represent  incentives   influence   patterns   and  norms  of  legitimation  that  generate  particular  organizational  tendencies  to   create  competitive  advantages  and  disadvantages  (Carney   2005).  Drawn  from  several   sources of competitive advantage  this study intends to show the possibility of relating the   governance approach with the resourcebased view of the firm (RBV) perspective Previously    studies have been conducted separately on each of the three areas (Lee and Ahmad  2009)   to determine their respective impact on corporate performance.     Therefore  the researcher is inspired to conduct an additional test by looking at the   moderating  effects  of  organizational  capacity  and  information  technology  strategy  on  the          influence  of business  strategy on  corporate  governance  with the  expectation to  offer  new   findings in Indonesia.     6          Research Methods   Population and Data Collection     Data  can  be  obtained  in  a  variety  of  ways  and  depends  on  the  type  of  source   availability of a researcher (Sekaran  2003). The current study utilizes data collection method   comprising analysis of annual reports and a questionnaire. The questionnaire survey has a   different purpose compared to which is to test the moderating influence of organizational   capacity  and  strategic  of  information  technology  on  the  relationship  between  business   strategy and corporate governance. The population for the questionnaire survey in this study   is about one hundred (100) Islamic micro finance in Indonesia. The target respondents were   the  managers   of  each  company.  The  reason  for  this  is  because  these  groups  of  people   comprise working people from specific career backgrounds  who  in their path of their job    come  across  and  are  exposed  to  the  corporate  governance  surroundings   organizational   capacity and also financial management experience. Hence  their participation was expected   to contribute meaningful responses as the questionnaire survey was focused on the business   strategy   corporate  governance   organizational  capacity  and  strategy  on  information   technology.  Although  the  respondents  are  from  different  groups   selection  of  the   respondents  was  made  based  on  their  broad  range  of  functions  to  ensure  proper   representation  of  the  business  strategy  and  corporate  governance  and  that  the  resources   used are comparable across companies (Lee & Yu  2004).           Statistical Data Analysis   The choice of statistical analysis depends upon the research question  design of research or   nature of the data to be tested (Kinnear and Gray  2008). Data in this study were analysed   using two different estimation approaches from the Statistical Package for the Social Sciences   (SPSS)  program   the  multiple  regression  analysis  and  hierarchical  regression  analysis.  The   multiple regression analysis has extensively been used in the literature to test the relationship   between  corporate  governance  organizational  culture   organizational  capacity  and  various   explanatory variables  such as corporate performance  earnings management and disclosure.   Meanwhile   a  number  of  prior  studies  have  applied  the  hierarchical  regression  analysis  in   assessing  the  influence  of  moderating  variables  on  the  association  between  independent   variables and dependent variables. On the statistics provide summary statistics of variables    such as mean and  standard deviation. The SPSS program further highlights the correlation   between the variable as presented by the Pearson correlation output. Prior to all the above   mentioned analyses and statistics tests  the current study will conduct the factor analysis on   the data obtained.      Hierarchical Regression Analysis     A variety of statistical analyses have been developed and introduced to measure the   continuous variable from a number of independent variables. Each has its advantages and   drawbacks. The hierarchical regression analysis allows the researcher to see the main effect   of the independent variable on the outcome variable with the presence of the moderating   variable.  In  other  words   the  association  of  the  independent  variable  and  the  outcome   variable  depends  on  the  value  of  the  moderator.  Several  sequential  steps  are  required  in   performing the hierarchical regression.     7          The normal procedure in hierarchical regression is to enter the moderators and the   independent variables into the analysis in a sequence of blocks  or groups that may contain   one or more variables. The hierarchical regression specifies the order in which the variables   are  added  to  the  regression  analysis.  In  the  first  step  of  the  regression   the  moderating   variable is entered into the model to predict the dependent variable. In the following step    the independent variable is entered as the predictor of the dependent variable. Finally  the   interaction term (the deviation from the mean value of both the independent variable and   moderating variable  following the new value of the independent variable multiplied by the   new value of the moderating variable)  which represents the joint relationship between the   moderator and the independent variable is entered in predicting the dependent variable. The   interaction  term  accounts  for  additional  variance  in  the  explanatory  variable  beyond  that   explained by single variable alone. If the interaction term explains a statistically significant   amount of variance in the explanatory variable there is an existence of the moderating effects      Bibliography          Abdolmohammadi  M.
