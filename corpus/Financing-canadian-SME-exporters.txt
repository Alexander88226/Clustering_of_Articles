Theory suggests that exporter firms might be relatively   disadvantaged. This is found to be true for new firms (international new   ventures)  but no differences were identified between established   exporter and nonexporter firms.      Introduction             In Canada  small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) comprise 97 percent of all firms that sell     goods and services abroad (Halabisky  Lee and Parsley  2005) and SME exporters contribute far more   than their proportional share of job creation.1 Given such strong links between export growth and   Canadian economic welfare  it is important to understand the obstacles that may limit SMEs’ growth.    One potential barrier is access to financial capital. To the extent that exporter firms are relatively   disadvantaged with respect to debt financing  their ability to engage in market development and to   compete internationally is potentially compromised. Financing is an essential ingredient in the growth and   survival of businesses. However  commercial lenders typically treat small loans as personal loans to the   owner(s) of the business and such loans are increasingly adjudicated through credit scoring methods.    Lenders also often require security  either in the form of collaterizable assets of the business or of its   owners (or from loan guarantee programs such as the Canada Small Business Financing Program). For   exporters  both inventories and accounts receivable may be held by offshore clients or suppliers    potentially increasing exporter firms’ risk exposure. Therefore  the primary goal of this study is to   examine empirically the extent to which Canadian SME exporter firms face disproportionate difficulty in   accessing debt financing from commercial lenders. Accordingly  the results described here report on the   analysis of two related research questions         1.        2.     To  what  extent  do  market  failures  and  imperfections  limit  access  to  capital  by   Canadian SME exporters?     What  is  the  nature  of  any  such  imperfections  and  what  form  of  remediation  is   best suited to redress such failures?              To answer these questions  this paper is organized as follows. The first part provides a summary     of previous related research  leading to development of the study propositions. This is followed by an   outline of the data and methodologies employed. The paper provides breakdowns of salient attributes of   Canadian exporter SMEs. Empirical findings are then detailed and the paper closes with a discussion of   the findings  implications and limitations of the work  as well as suggestions for future research.                                                                  1 Halabisky  Lee and Parsley (2005) report that 47 percent of all jobs created in Canada between 1993 and 2002   were attributable to the 6 percent of firms that exported.      3          Canadian SME Exporters           Previous Research             Decreasing telecommunication costs  integrated transportation  expanded information networks     and increasing globalization of trade (among other factors) are enabling even the smallest firms to export.   According to Statistics Canada (2005)  8.3 percent of Canadian SMEs2 export and  on average  Canadian   SME exporters derive 33 percent of sales revenues from exports.3 The vast majority of Canadian firms   have fewer than five employees  yet approximately 7 percent of even these microfirms reported revenues   from export sales. The propensity to export increases with the size of the enterprise  among firms with   5 to 19 employees  13 percent reported export sales; one quarter of companies with 20 to 99 employees   exported (Statistics Canada  2005).          It is widely understood that goodsproducing firms are more likely to export. To examine this     belief  Table 1 provides a breakdown of the Canadian population of SMEs by North American Industry   Classification System (NAICS) sector and exporter status. It is true that firms in the manufacturing and   knowledgebased sectors were especially likely to be exporters (31 percent of manufacturers and   17 percent of knowledgebased firms reported revenues from export sales during 2004 (Statistics Canada    2005)). The proportion of exporters among services firms is lower than that in manufacturing. Table 1   shows that because of the sheer size of the services sectors  however  services firms account for more than   40 000 of Canada’s 104 000 exporter SMEs  with another 24 000 exporter firms in the retail and   wholesale sectors. Exporters in the manufacturing sector represent less than 20 percent of all SME   exporters.             Financing Gaps and Canadian SME Exporters           Conceptually  the presence of financing gaps  especially to small and mediumsized enterprises    has been the subject of extensive research and debate for the last several decades (see Cressy (2002) and   Parker (2002) for comprehensive reviews of this literature). Gaps in the capital market have traditionally   been ascribed to information asymmetries  typically situations where the borrower is assumed to hold   more information about the future of the enterprise than the lender. As Parker (2002  163) states the case         “Information about [small] firms may be limited and asymmetric  stacked on the side of   the  borrower  at  the  lender’s  hazard.  This  has  led  many  influential  academics  and   politicians to claim that these problems can be so severe that the supply of finance may   disappear altogether. Banks  it is argued  may ration credit to new enterprises  strangling   new  dynamic and innovative future industrial giants at birth.”                                                        2 For the purposes of this study  small and mediumsized enterprise exporters are defined as businesses with fewer   than 500 employees and less than $50 million in annual revenues that sold goods or services outside Canada during   2004. This definition excludes nonprofit and government organizations  schools  hospitals  subsidiaries  co  operatives  and financing and leasing companies.   3 Halabisky  Lee and Parsley (2005) report that approximately 2 percent of small businesses (firms with 1 to 99   employees) and 12 percent of mediumsized firms (100 to 499 employees) export; however  this estimate is drawn   from Statistics Canada’s Exporter Registry and includes only merchandise or goods exporters. Also  Statistics   Canada’s Exporter Registry does not count as exporters establishments that export less than $30 000 of exports in at   least one year.     4          Table 1      SMEs and SME Exporters by Sector        All SMEs      % of Total     % of Total     Exporter SMEs        Sector   Professional Services   Wholesale and Retail   Manufacturing   Other Services   Primary   Transportation and   Warehousing   Other     Total   Source  SME Financing Data Initiative  Statistics Canada  Survey on Financing of Small and Medium Enterprises  2004.

The presence of a capital market gap suggests an imperfection in the marketplace and may justify   intervention. However  Brierley (2001  75) also notes that there are dangers inherent in interventions that   are not founded on clear evidence of gaps      “… in the absence of market failure  such initiatives may themselves cause distortions by   subsidizing  at considerable public cost  nonviable firms which are not attracting enough   capital because they do not offer good investment opportunities.”      To the extent that SME exporters comprise an identifiable group that is less able to obtain     financing than nonexporters  a capital market gap may be implied and intervention warranted.    Conceptually  one could argue that exporters’ asset structures comprise accounts receivable due from   foreign clients and inventories that may be in transit  both situations that might arguably increase the   informational asymmetry between borrower and lender and thereby contribute to the concerns of lenders   that systemically assess exporters as facing relatively greater risk.          Among SME exporters  a subgroup of particular interest is that known as “international new     ventures (INVs).” INVs are important because they defy the widely accepted “stage theory” of   internationalization whereby firms are thought to evolve to exporting after starting locally  expanding   regionally and nationally  and only then gaining the economies of scale necessary to enter international   trade. Oviatt and McDougall (1994) and Knight and Cavusgil (1996) were among the first to note that   some small firms exported virtually from inception. Although rapid internationalization of small firms   was identified as early as the 1970s  it was largely overlooked by researchers. Zahra (2005) adds to this   discussion arguing that INVs face three types of liability  any of which “can increase the risk of INVs’     5          potential failure” and thereby reduce firms’ access to debt financing. These liabilities include newness   and inexperience  which  according to Zahra  limit access to resources (including financial resources);   size in that many INVs are small firms with few slack resources (constraining their ability to compete);   and “foreignness of INVs ” requiring them to work especially hard to overcome barriers to entry.        In addition to the conceptual arguments that newness  size and dependence on foreign clients may     exacerbate information asymmetry  there appears to be some suggestive empirical evidence that SME   exporters may face greater difficulty accessing capital relative to nonexporters. Recent results from the   SME Financing Data Initiative (SME FDI) indicate that loan applications from exporters  at least at first   glance  appear to have been turned down more often than loan applications from nonexporters.4   Although the difference in turndown rates between the two categories of firms was not statistically   significant  no allowance for size or other attributes of firms was made. As noted above  exporter firms   are systematically larger than nonexporters and because of the larger size they ought to be more   creditworthy. Hence  the stated difference in turndown rates may potentially understate the underlying   difference once size (and perhaps other factors) is controlled for. Therefore  the extent to which turndown   rates differ  after controlling for other determinants of access to credit  remains unclear.5 This study seeks   to test empirically the extent to which exporter SMEs face disproportionate access to commercial loans   after accounting for size and other potential determinants of creditworthiness. To accommodate this task    the following research propositions are employed as a framework.      Proposition 1   After controlling for firm size  sector and other salient measures of     creditworthiness  exporter SMEs experience relatively less access to  and worse   terms associated with  commercial loans.        Proposition 2   Among exporter SMEs  international new ventures experience relatively less     access to  and worse terms associated with  commercial loans.     Data and Methodology                           Sources of Data           Data for this study were obtained from the Survey on Financing of Small and Medium     Enterprises  2004  a joint initiative of Statistics Canada  Finance Canada and Industry Canada. It is part of   a program that seeks to help inform public policy through collection and analysis of financing data   representative of the population of Canadian SMEs. The sampling frame for the survey comprised   34 509 enterprises drawn randomly from Statistics Canada’s Business Register. The survey was   conducted between September 2004 and March 2005 and comprised two parts.6 The first part consisted of   a computeraided telephone interview of primary owners of businesses in the sampling frame. This   portion of the survey collected extensive firm and owner demographic information as well as data                                                        4 SME Financing Data Initiative  Statistics Canada  Survey on Financing of Small and Medium Enterprises  2004    Table 7. In addition  Table 32 shows that exporters were significantly more likely to identify access to financing as a   barrier to growth than nonexporters.   5 Also  surveys of members conducted by the Canadian Federation of Independent Business (CFIB) report that a   disproportionate number of “younger  highgrowth firms” were among those businesses that were unable to obtain   the financing they sought (Bruce  2001).    6 Financing and leasing companies  cooperatives  subsidiaries  nonprofit organizations  government organizations    schools  hospitals and other public sector organizations are not covered by this survey.     6     regarding the firms’ most recent application for financing. Eligible enterprises had gross annual revenues   of less than $50 million  had fewer than 500 fulltimeequivalent employees and were operational during   the reference year. Estimates of loan outcomes were generated from responses obtained from 13 042   SMEs  a response rate of 45 percent of inscope businesses. Estimates related to the second part of the   survey (financial statement information) were generated from faxback responses to a paper questionnaire   obtained from 3500 of the 13 042 respondents. Sampling weights were applied in compiling estimates in   order that individual enterprises in the sample were weighted according to their representation in the   target population.       Methodology           Comparison of financing experiences between the two sets of firms (exporters and nonexporters)     needed to be conducted  to the extent possible  on a ceteris paribus basis by controlling for those factors   that are reasonable determinants of financing outcomes and that may also vary systematically between the   two groups of firms. Accordingly  it is essential to identify and measure factors that suppliers of capital   normally and reasonably consider in their financing decisions. The empirical challenge is to determine the   impact of two types of factors associated with access to  and terms of  credit. The first set of factors   includes those that are generally considered to be legitimate determinants of financing decisions    determinants of creditworthiness such as owners’ track records  firms’ attributes  etc. The other type of   factor is that across which a gap has been hypothesized; in this study  whether or not a firm is an exporter   business. Analysis must evaluate the impact of exporter propensity on access to credit while allowing for   the effect of legitimate determinants of credit.         The first step in the analysis is essentially the estimation and validation of the equivalent of a     “credit scoring model” that provides a reliable estimation of the actual lending decisions contained in the   data. The approach used here is to estimate logistic regression models of the determinants of outcomes of   term loan applications and (separately) outcomes of new applications for operating loans (lines of credit)   based on data from the Survey on Financing of Small and Medium Enterprises. This approach is similar   to credit scoring in that the dependent variable  whether or not a loan application was turned down  is   statistically related to a set of independent variables that reflect attributes of the borrower firm  its   ownership and measures of creditworthiness. Therefore  the scoring model derived here is a replication of   commercial lenders’ decisions based on loan decision outcomes revealed in the survey data.        The second step is to examine the extent to which the accuracy of the model is improved by     adding a variable that connotes whether or not a firm is an exporter (or INV). Findings of a credit market   gap would be consistent with a result that export propensity is a statistically and materially significant   factor in a credit scoring model of loan decisions that already controls for other determinants of credit.         To estimate a model of lenders’ credit decisions  variables were identified on the basis of two     sources. The first source was the academic and professional literature. Finance textbooks and bank   training materials have long stressed the “5 Cs” of commercial lending (see  for example    www.smallbusinessfinancetips.com/establishingbusinesscredit.html). According to this standard    determinants of credit outcomes include the firm’s ability to service the loan (“capacity”)  the firm’s   reliance on debt (“capitalization”)  the firm’s sensitivity to economic “conditions ” the “character” of the   principal owner(s) and the borrower’s “collateral.” In addition  the literature on credit rationing identified   potential determinants of credit decisions that included the firm’s relationship with the lender  the size of   the borrower firm  the human capital of the owners and the collateral available.                        7          The second source was contained in responses to the survey itself. Question D.6 of the survey   asks those respondents whose loan applications were turned down to identify “what reasons were given   to the business by the credit supplier for refusing to provide [the loan]?” The most frequent reasons   respondents reported were that the applicant firm had insufficient income or sales revenues or that   the firm or its owner lacked the necessary track record or credit history    (www.smefdi.gc.ca/epic/site/sme_fdiprf_pme.nsf/en/01561e.html  Table 10).        These two sources of potential criteria are synthesized in Table 2 and broken down between     exporter firms and nonexporters. Analysis of loan turndowns needs to take these factors into   consideration in order to determine if exporters and nonexporters differ after accounting for potential   systemic differences in the key determinants of access to credit. As shown in Table 2  the SME FDI   survey data allowed for measurement of many of the factors that influence lenders’ credit decisions.          Inspection of Table 2 suggests that some of the measures of these factors are likely to be     correlated with others. Given this potential for collinearity  it is appropriate to use principal components   analysis to reduce the number of variables in the data (Stevens  2002). The use of principal components   analysis also allows a determination of the extent to which the logical dimensions under which the   variables are categorized in Table 2 hold up empirically. The results of applying principal components   analysis to measures of the potential lending criteria in Table 2 are presented in Table 3.         Inspection of the factor solution reveals five principal components for which the eigenvalues all   exceeded 1.0. The principal components identified in Table 3 generally correspond well with the logical   dimensions outlined in Table 2. As Stevens (2002  p. 389–390) notes  blind use of the eigenvalue   criterion “can lead to retaining factors which may have no practical significance … [yet] blind use [of the   scree test] might lead to not retaining factors which  although they account for a smaller amount of   variance  might be practically significant.” Here  the first factor appears to be associated with the age of   the firm and the second factor expresses firm size. The third factor relates to lenders’ collateral demands.    The fourth factor links to the number of account managers with whom the firms had dealt.          The final factor shows that firms’ debttoasset ratio is correlated with research and development   (R&D) intensity. For these data  the debttoasset ratio is measured following financing and is  therefore    correlated with the loan decision. Accordingly  it ought not be used as a potential explanatory variable.   Conversely  R&D intensity is  according to the literature  related to export propensity (Doutriaux and   Chamberlin  2006). Accordingly  the variables chosen to represent this factor structure were R&D   intensity  collateral requirements and the number of fulltimeequivalent employees.           8          Table 2      Lending Criteria      Criterion     Character     Capacity     Measure   (n = 13 042)     Length of relationship with   financial institution (years)       Age of firm (years)     Age of owner (years)     Total revenues     Direct expenses     Fulltimeequivalent     employees   Total assets   Total equity   Industry sector     Capital      Conditions   Collateral  Availability of personal assets     for collateral (%)       Availability of commercial     assets for collateral (%)       Cosignature requirements (%)     Nonexporters     Exporters                        11.3     20.2   49.2     3.5     41.80     39.60     6.80                        9.8     20.4   50.0     7.8     42.30     46.20     8.20           The analysis focuses only on formal applications for term loans and new lines of credit.7 Also  it     seems reasonable to expect that lending criteria differ across the type of loan application. For example    mortgage loans would arguably depend mainly on the value and liquidity of the underlying asset being   financed. Likewise  decisions on term loans and operating loans may reflect different weightings of   decision criteria. Thus  the models of loan outcomes estimated here are specific to each type of loan. This   accounts for the possibility that exporter firms may face different challenges getting term loans compared   with those they might face when they seek operating loans. This investigation is limited to these two   types of loan because  in spite of the large number of respondents to the survey  there were too few   exporter applicants to other forms of debt financing to permit reliable model estimation.                                                                   7 Wynant and Hatch (1991  p. 289) noted that from a borrower’s perspective  loan applications are often declined on   the basis of an initial discussion between a loan account manager and a potential borrower client. Wynant and Hatch   estimated that 19 percent of informal inquiries resulted in a perceived loan turndown and that a further 35 percent   were deferred by the banker until the client provided further information. Because information on informal   turndowns is nebulous  this work considers only those applications that were sufficiently “formal” that   documentation was involved. For this purpose  formal applications were defined as those in which the borrower   submitted documentation to the lender in support of the request for financing. This is evidenced by respondents’   answers to Question D.15 of the survey  “What documents were requested by the credit supplier as part of the   application process?”     9          Table 3        Principal Components Analysis of Lending Criteria        Factor Loadings     (for ease of interpretation  loadings of less than 0.4 are suppressed)   4           1   0.75   0.73     3           2           Variable   Experience of primary owner   Length of relationship with    financial institution   Age of owner   Year started trading (1 if after 2002)   Fulltimeequivalent employees   Total revenues   Collateral  Personal property required   Collateral  Commercial property required   Cosignature required   Number of loan account managers   Debttoassets ratio   R&D expenditure >20%     0.71   0.64                               0.86   0.86                                                          0.76   0.62   0.52                                    0.87     5                                     0.78   0.63        Potential explanatory variables were based on the variables available from the SME FDI survey   listed previously. In addition to these variables  binary variables corresponding to industry classifications   were also employed. As a first approach  the logistic regression models were estimated using all of the   variables  but with sequential deletion of those variables that appeared to be nonsignificant at a 10  percent level of significance. This approach resulted in models that explained a statistically significant   proportion of the variation in loan turndowns.          The leftmost columns of Tables 4 and 5 report  for operating and term loan applications    respectively  results of the estimation of the base logistic regressions that seek to relate turndown   frequencies with attributes of the firm. In both cases  the models displayed statistically significant   goodnessoffit measures. Hosmer–Lemeshow statistics are not significant  indicating that the goodness  offit is at an acceptable level for insample predictive purposes. The pseudorsquare measures are not as   high as one might hope; however  they are reasonable for crosssectional data where data such as Beacon   scores are not available.          In order to test for possible differential access to credit between exporters and nonexporters and     to take into account the impact of earlystage firms with respect to both access to credit and the role of   INVs  a categorical variable was introduced into the analysis that connoted four types of firms      o     o   o     o     firms that started trading since January 2003 (startups) and also reported exporting    (these are consistent with the definition of international new ventures);     firms that started trading since January 2003 (startups) but did not report exporting;     firms that started trading prior to January 2003 (nonstartups) and also reported    exporting; and     firms that started trading prior to January 2003 (nonstartups) but did not report   exporting.     10          The rightmost columns of Tables 4 and 5 display the logistic regression models for operating and   term loan applications  respectively  when expanded by the addition of the categorical variable mentioned   above. In the case of operating loans  the addition of these variables added significantly (pvalue < 0.000)   to the explanatory power of the regression. This implies that the likelihood of being turned down for an   operating loan depends  to a statistically significant extent  on the category. Specifically  Table 4 shows   that earlystage firms (those started since 2002) are significantly more likely to be turned down for   operating loans than established firms  after allowing for factors such as firm size  sector  collateral  etc.    Specifically  interpretation of the exp(β) column reveals that nonexporter startup firms are 1.63 times   more likely to be turned down for operating loans than nonexporter established firms after allowing for   the other factors in the model. More importantly  startup exporters (INVs) are 2.6 (= 4.27/1.63) more   likely to have loan applications rejected than nonexporter startup firms. This difference is statistically   significant  again after accounting for the determinants of credit decisions used here. For term loan   applications (Table 5)  a similar pattern was identified; however  the difference was not as strong   statistically  with the difference in turndown rates between startup exporters and other firms being   significant only at a pvalue of 0.16.          These results confirm that  after allowing for other determinants of credit decisions  earlystage     firms face relatively greater difficulty obtaining operating loans. Compared with established non  exporting SMEs  new nonexporting SMEs are 63 percent more likely to be turned down. Evidence that   earlystage nonexporting firms also face difficulty obtaining term loans is not as strong; however  this   may be understandable because term loans are often secured by the asset that the loan is financing.          Among exporter SMEs  the evidence is even more compelling. Earlystage SME exporters are   more than four times as likely to be turned down for operating loans as established firms (whether the   established firms are exporters or not). In addition  there is suggestive evidence (pvalue = 0.16) that   earlystage exporter firms are more likely to be turned down for term loans than established firms.       11          Table 4       Logistic Regression Results  Applications for Operating Loans        Operating Loan     Applications Variable      Coefficient  Estimate     Base Model     p    Expanded Model               Coefficient   Estimate          value  Exp(β)   0.181   0.179   0.444   0.782   0.178   0.863   0.171   0.384   0.732   0.007   0.822   0.000   0.107   0.128   0.058   0.017     0.41   0.65   0.86   0.48   0.82   0.47   1.71   0.83   1.90   1.06   3.61   1.63   0.68   2.03   0.97          1.15   0.53   0.16   0.90   0.32   0.79   0.33   0.33   0.60       1.39         0.44   0.72   0.03                   0.15                       1.45   0.32   0.49   1.52     0.17   0.10          0.001          0.000          0.844     p    value   0.145   0.075   0.360   0.771   0.100   0.784   0.153   0.596   0.545   0.011     0.000     0.086   0.058   0.023     0.004   0.004   0.390   0.064   0.003          0.000          0.475     Exp(β)          0.32   0.59   0.85   0.41   0.72   0.45   1.39   0.72   1.82     4.00     0.64   2.06   0.97     4.27   0.72   1.63   0.22                                                 0.844                    0.88   0.44   0.15   0.73   0.20   0.75   0.54   0.18   0.64   0.06   1.28   0.49   0.38   0.71   0.03     1.90     0.15   0.09          0.84     Industry Sector     Primary    Construction   Manufacturing   Wholesale   Finance  etc.   Professional Services   Accommodation  Food  etc.   Other Services     Personal Collateral   Commercial Collateral   CoSignature   Urban Location (vs Rural)   No R&D Investment   Intensive R&D Investment   FullTimeEquivalent   Employees   Firm Category     Startup/Exporter   Established/Exporter   Startup/Nonexporter     Constant           Nagelkerke R2   Cox & Snell R2   Hosmer–Lemeshow   InSample Prediction   Accuracy        12          Table 5      Logistic Regression Results  Applications for Term Loans        Term Loan Applications     Variable     Industry Sector     Primary    Construction   Manufacturing   Wholesale   Finance  etc.   Professional Services   Accommodation  Food  etc.   Other Services     Personal Collateral   Commercial Collateral   CoSignature   Urban Location (vs Rural)   No R&D Investment   Intensive R&D Investment   FullTimeEquivalent   Employees   Firm Category     Startup/Exporter   Established/Exporter   Startup/Nonexporter     Base Model     Coefficient   Estimate           0.16   0.78   1.54   1.49   18.67   0.75   2.14   0.56   0.14   0.31   0.52   0.17   0.36   0.59   0.03     p          value  Exp(β)   0.000   0.794   0.207   0.006   0.008   0.999   0.213   0.000   0.366   0.606   0.268   0.213   0.554   0.198   0.225   0.006     0.85   2.19   4.66   4.45   0.00   2.12   8.50   1.75   0.87   0.74   1.69   1.19   0.70   1.80   0.97                                                           Expanded Model               Coefficient   Estimate     Exp(β)     p    value   0.000   0.886   0.175   0.007   0.006   0.999   0.170   0.000   0.315                               0.007     0.471   0.160   0.712   0.640   0.000           0.09   0.85   1.55   1.57   18.61   0.83   2.17   0.63                                     0.03     0.98   0.16   0.15   2.26           0.92   2.33   4.72   4.80   0.00   2.30   8.78   1.88                                     0.97     2.66   0.85   1.16   0.10                                         0.11     2.22     0.000     0.000                           0.166   0.088     Constant       Nagelkerke R2   Cox & Snell R2   Hosmer–Lemeshow   InSample Prediction   Accuracy         Terms of Credit      Table 6 compares terms of credit for both term loans and operating loans between exporters and non  exporters.

The   analyses reported here do indeed show that commercial lenders reject applications for operating loans   from earlystage SME exporters unusually often. Earlystage nonexporting firms are approximately   63 percent more likely to have loan applications turned down than established firms (even after allowing   for several plausible determinants of creditworthiness). Earlystage exporter SMEs are more than four   times as likely again to have applications for operating loans rejected. Although results are not as strong   (from a statistical point of view) for term loan applications  a similar pattern was noted.        Financing is an essential ingredient in the development  growth and survival of businesses.     Technological change and globalization have better enabled INVs to exploit opportunities in international   markets; however  this study has found that startup exporter firms are relatively disadvantaged with   respect to debt financing. This potentially limits these firms’ ability to engage in market development and   to compete internationally. To the extent that Canadian INVs are financeconstrained  it will be   increasingly difficult for such firms to prosper within Canada’s relatively small home market. Constraints   on INVs’ ability to grow through export market development potentially compromise their ability to   contribute to job creation and national prosperity. Brierley (2001) argues that “intervention should be   targeted at those areas where market imperfections can be identified.” To this end  many nations and trade   associations have undertaken initiatives that seek to redress perceived imperfections. Typically these   involve support for financing of operating loans or steps to stimulate the formation of risk capital.         The literature on capital rationing and capital gaps suggests that for a market gap to exist  an     imperfection in the financial marketplace must be present. This study has found that a particular category   of firm  earlystage exporters  appears to face relatively greater difficulty in accessing commercial loans.   This result is consistent with  but not proof of  a financing gap according to the second criterion adopted   by the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD); however  this is not definitive     14          evidence of a gap because one could argue that such firms face additional risk. Even when compared with   other startup firms  earlystage exporters may be perceived as risky because important assets  such as   accounts receivable and portions of inventory  may be offshore and held by clients in countries from   which realizing on the receivables may be risky. However  further research is required to investigate   this point.        Although SME FDI data have allowed new insights into the financing of SMEs and SME     exporters  gaps in our understanding remain. As noted earlier  future work might investigate the impact of   country of destination of exports with respect to lenders’ loan decisions. Further research is also required   to study the impact of lending decisions on business owners’ export decisions  To what extent do loan   turndown decisions deter business owners from exporting? Other areas of research could include further   examination of INVs and the types of financing they need to grow and survive in the global economy.   These INVs are more innovative (have higher expenditures on R&D activities than other SMEs) and thus   their demands for equity financing are higher. Although the research presented in this report focused on   access to debt  a subsequent study could focus on the request for  and potential turndown of  informal and   formal forms of risk capital financing. These and other research directions could be explored through   modifications to future iterations of the SME FDI survey process.         Other topics for future research pertain to the interactions of SME exporter (or prospective     exporter) firms and financial institutions. For example  this study does not  and cannot  examine lending   decisions in the context of established firms that are seeking to undertake international trade. It would be   useful to understand better the role of lending decisions made at the point that established domestic firms   seek financing to fund development of export markets. It would also be of interest to understand better the   extent to which business borrowers decide to forgo exporting out of a belief that they may not qualify for   financing. Also  it remains to ascertain the difficulties and barriers (financial and nonfinancial)   encountered by established firms that are at the point of exporting. Is there a minimum threshold level of   production required for export and how might this threshold vary across types of enterprise? These are   among the dimensions for future research  the findings of which would help provide better information on   which to base policy decisions.              References     Brierley  N.  2001.
