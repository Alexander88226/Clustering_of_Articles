SMEs can play a major role in job creation and economic development. They   constitute a large share of private sectors across the globe.  More important   than  their  share  in  the  overall  economy   however   is  their  potential  for   transformation and growth.     2.  SMEs face severe financing constraints  with the credit gap estimated to be   over  $2  trillion  globally.  SME  access  to  finance  in  developing  countries  is   particularly significant due to the risk management challenges of financial   institutions and the high transaction costs involved in lending to SMEs.     3.  Development partners have used a wide variety of tools (both financial and   through broader market enabling initiatives) to bridge the SME finance gap.     4.     There is much we can learn from the experiences of developed countries.       South Korea has shown us the benefits of a comprehensive SME policy     approach as well as the importance of market compatibility.       The  UK  has  taught  us  that  not  only  supply  but  also  demandside     constraints matter and that innovation is critical.     5.  Credit  Guarantee  Schemes  can  help  manage  risk  by  guaranteeing   repayment of part of the loan in the event of default. They help overcome   lack  of  collateral  faced  by  SMEs  and  compensate  for  banks’  low  profit   margins when lending to SMEs.     6.  Credit and equity lines to financial institutions can support the funding of a   bank’s loan portfolio and allow donors to channel money through a market   focused decisionmaking entity.     7.     Lease  finance  allows  SMEs  to  obtain  equipment  without  collateral  and  is   particularly well tailored to smaller and agribased SMEs with no collateral.     8.  General equity funds can help support midsize enterprises in their growth     process and development partner involvement in this field is growing.     9.     Financial  benefits  for  SMEs  are  a  widely  used  part  of  government  fiscal   policies.  These  benefits   including  tax  holidays  or  deductions   require  a   careful costbenefit analysis and should be transparent.     10.  Challenge funds can have an important role in fostering innovation in the   market place encouraging product development and new delivery channels.     11.  Blended finance is a key mechanism through which private sector funding   can be leveraged to achieve both developmental and commercial objectives    as long as it does not crowd out market funding.     12.  Innovative and technology based solutions (FinTech) bring a lot of promise      but also new challenges and their impact is too early to assess.     13.  For  SME  support  programmes  to  work  properly   an  appropriate  enabling   environment  is  necessary   including  conducive  informational   contractual    macroeconomic and regulatory frameworks.       1                                                                                                                Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To          1  Introduction     Purpose of this Guide     This topic guide focuses on the financial instruments available to help bridge the financing   gap for SMEs  reviewing existing financing programmes and their impacts and drawing out   lessons learnt. It will        Explore how governments and development partners have stepped in to address   complementary  market     instruments      through     market   infrastructure  and regulatory initiatives.      financial     failures       Provide  an indepth  review  of  specific financial  sector instruments  (ranging  from   the traditional to the innovative) and will consider what works and why  with whom   and under what conditions; and       Make recommendations as to how SME financing programmes could be structured     including sequencing and preconditions for success.     Role of SMEs1     SMEs can play a major role in job creation and economic development. Private sectors in   most developing countries are dominated by SMEs  often disadvantaged by uneven playing   fields  in  terms  of  the  institutional  infrastructure  and  business  environment.  The  vast   majority  of  people  are  either  employed  by  SMEs  or  run  small  enterprises  themselves.   There are approximately 365 to 445 million formal and informal MSMEs in the developing   world   80  to  100  million  of  which  are  formal.2    The  prominence  of  SMEs  in  developing   countries’  private  sectors  and  the  growth  obstacles they face  justify  the  focus by  policy   makers and donors.     In this  context  it is important  to  distinguish  between  two  different types  of  enterprises   and entrepreneurs.     1.  Subsistence entrepreneurs have tiny businesses  based on selfemployment and   informality and are almost exclusively microentrepreneurs. A large share of MSME   owners are running their business to make a living while they are looking for a wage   job  and may not have plans for expanding their business. There is evidence that the   majority of microenterprises are managed by this type of subsistence entrepreneur.3      2.  Transformational entrepreneurs who are leading enterprises that create jobs and     have growth ambitions.      Distinguishing  between these two  groups  is  critical  for  purposes  of  job  creation  and  for   tailoring support  especially financing mechanisms for them. This guide will focus on the   latter group.     It is  however  important to note that the role of SMEs in modern market economies and   economic  development  has  been  controversial.  While  there  is  a  positive  correlation   between  the  share  of  SMEs  in  manufacturing  and  GDP  per  capita  growth   there  is  no   evidence  that  this  relationship  is  causal   i.e.  that  having  a  high  share  of  SMEs  helps   countries grow faster or reduces poverty at faster rates.4   Successful economies thus have               1 For further insights on the evidence around the contribution we can expect SMEs to make in terms of jobs   and transformational economic development  DFID’s RED2 note on Finance for SMEs serves as a useful guide.   2 Stein  Goland and Schiff (2010). “Two Trillion and Counting  Assessing the credit gap for micro  small  and   mediumsize enterprises in the developing world” McKinsey & Company and IFC   3 For example  Hsie and Klenow (2009) show that 90% of all enterprises in India never grow. De Mel    McKenzie  and Woodruff (2009) show that only 30% of microenterprise owners in Sri Lanka have   characteristics like large firm owners  whereas 70% are similar to wage workers. Bruhn (2013) finds that about   50% of a sample of Mexican micro entrepreneurs are similar to wage workers.   4 Beck  DemirgucKunt and Levine (2005). "SMEs  Growth  and Poverty " Journal of Economic Growth     2                                                                                                                     Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To     more SMEs  but their success is not explained by having many SMEs. More important is   the potential for growth and transformation of the SMEs within the sector.     Access to Finance for SMEs     Expansive research has shown that SMEs face higher operational and growth constraints   than large enterprises  which can undermine resource allocation within the economy and    ultimately  the growth process.  Among these constraints  access to and cost of external   finance loom large.  The significance of financing constraints for firm growth is inversely   related  to  firm  size  and  such  constraints  are  stronger  in  countries  with  less  developed   financial  systems.    This  can  also  explain  the  diverging  firm  size  distribution  in  many   developing countries  resulting in a ‘missing middle’. Trying to quantify the global financing   gap of SMEs and using enterprise surveys  the total credit gap has been estimated at $2   trillion5 as illustrated in the figure below. While SMEs  especially smaller enterprises  rely   extensively on informal sources of finance  including friends and family  limited information   is available to quantify the importance of these sources. It can also be argued that these   sources  are  typically  not  as  efficient  as  formal  finance   given  that  they  are not  market  priced6.      Figure 1  The Financing Gap.            Source   Stein et al (2010)                  5 While such efforts are to be applauded for putting the issue of SME finance on policy makers’ agenda and can   serve  as  input  for  quantitative  indicators   they  have  several  inherent  shortcomings.  First   credit  demand  by   enterprises is not the same as commercially viable demand. Second  firm size distribution and the firm population   itself arise as a result of financial development. Identifying a credit gap based on current firm size distribution   and use of financial services is therefore necessarily a static rather than a dynamic exercise.    6 Ayyagari  DemirgüçKunt and Maksimovic (2010)  find that for the average SME formal finance is associated   with higher firm growth while informal finance is not. Degryse  Lu and Ongena (2013) find that informal finance   is associated with a higher sales growth rate for small SME firms but not large SME firms.      3                                                                                                                Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To          1.1     Definitions     For the purpose of this guide  SMEs are defined as small and medium businesses with an   annual turnover of up to $5 million and/or less than 100 employees.  We focus only on   formal sector companies recognising that in some countries the distinction is somewhat   blurred  and  that  there  are  many  different  shades  of  formality  (for  example   firm   registration  tax registration  land registration etc.).     Given that the literature available on SME financing is vast  it is also important to highlight   what  the  topic  guide  will  not  cover  in  considering  instruments  to  promote  SME   development.  This  includes  microenterprises   household  or  familybased  enterprises;   microfinance institutions; capacity building / skills development of SMEs; formalisation of   SMEs;  mentoring;  cluster  creation;  policies  to  address  information  failures  (e.g.   establishment  of  Credit  Information  Bureaus);  capital  market  development;  or  an   evaluation of the institutions delivering these instruments.     The study will  however  consider at a highlevel how SME financing best sits within the   broader policy agenda.          1.2     Research methods     This review was undertaken as a desk review by Nathan Associates London Ltd. The guide   largely  depends  on  secondary  data  sourced  from  donors   practitioners   development   partners and academic papers as well as DFID strategy documents.     Where possible the authors have considered the extent to which credible data is available   and lessons have been drawn from programmes with robust evaluations of their results   and impacts. The authors have not attempted to review all literature on this topic but have   chosen selected programmes to review on a case study basis. Crosscomparison studies   of specific financial instruments are limited  however  we will highlight where broader data   sets can be found and draw out relevant data from these to support our analysis.     In addition  the team has gathered information through telephone interviews with selected   programme  managers  and  practitioners.    These  interviews  have  focused  on  individuals   with  handson  experience in implementing the  financial  tools  reviewed in  order  to  draw   out real life lessons on what works and does not work.  Specific attention has been paid   to what contributes to the success or failure of a particular instrument.        2  Conceptual Framework     Why are SMEs more constrained? Transaction costs and different levels of information   available on potential borrowers are the main reasons for the variation in access to finance   across firms of different sizes. Fixed transaction costs in credit assessment  processing    and  monitoring  mean  that  unit  costs  decrease  as  the  size  of  the  loan  increases   which   makes  lending  to  SMEs  costlier.  In  addition   SME  lending   more  than  other  lending   products  is affected by challenges in managing risks. Compared with large firms  SMEs   are generally more opaque  less likely to be able to post collateral  and often do not have   audited  financial  statements  that  can  provide  a  better  picture  of  the  enterprise  and  its   projected profits. Compared to retail clients  financial institutions are also less able to rely   on the law of large numbers to exploit scale economies and diversification benefits.      Government  and  donor  interventions  are  frequently  designed  to  overcome  these  two   constraints. It is important to realise  however  that there are not only supply  but also   demandside  constraints.  Such  demandside  constraints  can  refer   firm   characteristics that exacerbate supplyside constraints  such as the lack of proper financial     to     4                                                                                                                     Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To     management  and  the  refusal  to  register  the  company  or  assets  even  where  reasonably   feasible.  Such demandside constraints can also refer to the lack of financial literacy and   necessary business development skills. On a broader and more aggregate level  this can   also relate to the absence of profitable investment projects.     Finally  it is important to keep in mind that finance – although often considered as a major   constraint to firm growth – might not always be the binding constraint.      that     evidence     is   Disadvantaged  Groups   There   some   additional   entrepreneur  groups  are  more  affected   than  others.  Female  entrepreneurs   often  face  higher  growth  obstacles   than  male  entrepreneurs  which in  many   countries link to legal and cultural issues   (see  box  1).  However   there  is  also   evidence that access to finance might not   always be the binding constraint7.  On the   other hand  there is some evidence that   minority  groups  might  suffer  from   discrimination  and  lower  access  to   external  funding8   which  might  result  in   lower access to credit and thus negative   effects  on  overall  resource  allocation  in   an economy.     Box 1  Can the gender gap in     entrepreneurship be explained by a lack of     access to finance?     Women  entrepreneurs  outnumber  men  in  many   parts  of  the  world.  Despite  this   womenled  SMEs   tend  to  lag  behind  men  in  terms  of  the  turnover    profitability  and  growth  performance  of  their   businesses.  The  barriers  for  women  regarding   access  to  finance  and  the  supporting  business   environment  (e.g.  legal  system   property  rights)   result in women receiving a lower share of available   external funding than men. The evidence  suggests   that  this  might  be  less  attributable  to  explicit   discrimination  but  results  from  higher  credit  risk   (perceived or actual) from lack of collateral.       find     that     this      than     the  authors     More   the   concentration  of  women  in  low  capital  intensive   industries—which  require  less  funding  and  at  the   same  time  have  a  lower  potential  for  growth  and   development—might  also  be  driven  by  barriers   against women regarding access to finance.     SMEs  are  constrained  by  both  limited   levels  of  funding  available  and  limited   sources  of  external   funding.  One   important group of providers of external   funds  are  nonbank   nonregulated   entities   which  can  range from  suppliers   providing  trade  credit  to  friends  and  family  to  moneylenders.  These  informal  providers   often  face  lower  costs  and  lower  information  asymmetries  than  formal  financial  service   providers  and thus lower risks. Conversely  informal finance has the disadvantage of not   benefitting from geographic and sectoral diversification and is often unreliable  costly and   violates the privacy of customers.     Source   Klapper and Parker. 2011.      Overcoming  Constraints   To  overcome  the  main  constraints  to  SME  financing    governments and donors have designed and implemented interventions at different levels.   At  the  broadest  levels  are  programmes  that  support  institution  building   such  as  the   establishment  of  credit  or  collateral  registries  or  court  reforms.  These  also  include   regulatory reform programmes  such as  for example  introducing leasing legislation.  We   will  not  discuss  these  here  but  would  emphasise  that  often  there  are  important   complementary  reforms  necessary  within  the  institutional  framework  to  increase  SME   finance  provision  and make  financing  programmes  as  efficient  as  possible.  In this  note    we  will  instead  focus  specifically  on  financing  instruments   be  they  contingent  (such  as   providing guarantees) or involving direct funding.      Delivery Mechanisms  Another important distinguishing factor has been the channel for   implementing programmes – central bank  development finance institutions or commercial   banks  directly.   There  has  been  quite  some  empirical  evidence  on  the limited efficiency   with  which  firsttier  governmentowned  and  managed  banks  support  funding  needs  in   developing  countries.    There  is  much  less  evidence  on  the  efficiency  of  secondtier   development finance institutions that serve as facilitators or conduits for donor funding      7  Aterido   R.

In the developed world  governments and financial institutions have made significant steps   in  providing  services  to  SME  clients   particularly  in  response  to  the  recent  crisis.  In   addition  an emerging and fastgrowing technology sector is promoting new innovations   in financing (such  as  peer  to  peer lending)  which have  circumvented traditional  finance   providers  by  leveraging  lowcost  platforms  and  using  innovative  credit  scoring  and   psychometric  techniques  to  assess  potential  borrowers.  Much  of  this  progress  is  yet  to   make  its  way  to  the  developing  world   but  it  provides  a  unique  opportunity  for   governments and donors to consider the role these can play going forward.           3  Bridging the Gap. A review of current     approaches     Governments   nongovernmental  and  international  organisations  have  long  promoted   initiatives to support access to finance by SMEs.  Early European guarantee funds began   in  the  early  20th  century  with  origins  in  Belgium  (1929)   France  (1917)  and  Germany   (1930). Other nations such as the UK (1981) and much of the developing world introduced   schemes in the latter part of the century.10       The recent financial crisis has prompted a renewed interest in SME financing11 as there is   evidence that SMEs are disproportionately more affected by recessions and financial crises   than large firms. The international community as a whole responded in 2010 as the leaders   of  the  G20  recognised  financial  inclusion  as  one  of  the  main  pillars  of  the  global   development agenda  endorsing a concrete Financial Inclusion Action Plan. As a result of   this  the G20 established the Global Partnership for Financial Inclusion (GPFI)  to serve as   a means for implementation as well as the SME Finance Challenge (in August 2010) aimed   at identifying new ideas for financing small businesses and helping them grow. The GPFI   later  established  the  SME  Finance  Forum  (in  2012)  as  a  knowledge  centre  for  data    research and best practice in promoting SME finance.      Support  for  SME  development  tends  to  be  approached  either  directly  or  indirectly   or   through a combination of the two. Direct investing in individual companies requires local   knowledge  and  sector  specific  skills   and  tends  to  be  perceived  as  costly  and  involving   higher  risk.  Indirect  investing  can   in  some  ways   be  done  more  easily  as  it  involves   intermediaries  such  as  commercial  banks   designated  SME  finance  institutions   SME   focused funds and other types of financial institutions.      In recent years  national and international development finance institutions (DFIs)12 have   been  very  active  in  the  provision  of  funding  to  SMEs   with  the  main  instruments  used   including long term loans and guarantees to financial institutions to encourage onlending   to   and  equity  investments  in   SME  clients  (all  with  or  without  a  TA  component).  Most   support by development partners is provided on the basis that it will be       1)  additional  i.e. only make investments that private investors are unwilling or unable     to make;                9 De la Torre  Gozzi  and Schmukler. 2008. “Innovative Experiences in Access to Finance  Market Friendly Roles   for the Visible Hand?” Stanford University Press and the World Bank.   10 Jonsson (2009). Performance of Credit Guarantee Schemes.  Copenhagen Business School.   11  Governments  responded  on  an  unprecedented  level  to  promote  job  creation  and  retention   support   employment  and  earnings  in  highproductivity  sectors   and  increase  and  create  safety  net  programmes.    Bangladesh  for example  allocated US$14.6 million to provide credit to SMEs through commercial banks.    12  This includes multilateral DFIs (such as  IFC  ADB  IsDB  EBRD  and  EIB) and  bilateral DFIs (such as CDC    KFW  PROPARCO  FMO and Norfund).     6                                                                                                                     Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To     2)  catalytic  crowding in commercial investors by demonstrating the feasibility of such     investment; and      3)  sustainable  schemes should focus on investment in countries  regions and sectors   that are considered to be too high risk by commercial investors and where there is   the potential to ensure longterm sustainability.       These  institutions  can  offer  benefits  in  terms  of  cost  effectiveness   economies  of  scale    consistency  in  approach  and  have  the  ability  to  attract  both  donor  and  private  sector   funding.  Over  half  of  the  IFC’s investments  are in  the  financial sector  and this  sector is   also  the  largest  recipient  of  investments  made  by  European  DFIs.13  While  extensive   involvement can be positive  it also makes for a very crowded space and issues such as   coordination  saturation and duplication are relevant. It is also important to consider that   the motivation of DFIs is not always the same as bilateral donors and this is particularly   significant when considering specific geographies or target segments.     Leveraging private sector investment is an important way of increasing the volume of   development  finance  in  the  context  of  constrained  resources  and  can  enhance  the   effectiveness of aid. Blended finance (the use of public funds combined with private capital   to make investments that deliver both financial returns and development impact) will be   discussed later in this guide. The concept of returnable capital is also being embraced   as a key instrument in delivering aid with DFID  Sida  USAID and other donors all active   in this area. Returnable capital (also known as development capital or impact investing)   refers to investments (not grants) with the expectation of repayment with modest returns    unlike  DFIs’  nearcommercial  returns.  Returns  are  expected  to  be  redeployed  into   development programmes by donors.      Perhaps  the  largest  and  most  significant  recent  development  in  SME  financing  has   stemmed  from  technological  innovation  in  finance.    These  instruments  will  be   discussed  in  more  detail  in  section  4.7   and  it  is  important  to  highlight  the  impact  that   some  of  these  tools  have  had.  Areas  such  as  payments  and  cash  management  do  not   directly result in an increase in financing of SMEs but do address key constraints  leading   to operational efficiencies and ultimately a reduction in the cost of doing business.       Technological  development  has  also  been  key  in   addressing the information constraints that are   so  prevalent  in  developing  countries.  Innovative   approaches  to  obtaining  and  sharing  information   have  huge  potential  to  open  up  markets  beyond   traditional lenders. The Entrepreneurial Finance Lab   (EFL)  estimates  that  90%  of  the  world’s  data  has   been  created  since  201314   and  data  from  online   social  networks   mobile  phone   records  and   psychometrics are helping to illuminate the potential   of borrowers where traditional credit information is   scarce.      Box 2  EFL and Banco     Pichincha  Ecuador     With  support  from  the  IADB   Banco   Pichincha  introduced  psychometric   questionnaires  in  the  consumer  and   entrepreneur  segments.  Over  18   months   Banco  Pichincha  approved   19 000  credit  applications   which   would  have  been  rejected  without   the  EFL  psychometric  score  while   increasing  revenues  and  keeping   delinquency  rates  within  the  banks   expectations. In addition to this  the   project  introduced  an  automated   process  where  applicants  could   undergo   testing   without having to go to a branch.   Source   EFL Website (2015).     Tools  such  as  psychometric  analysis  (see  box  2)   have  implications  for  how  banks  and  other  FIs   assess  risk   potentially  leading  to  a  bigger  pool  of   ‘bankable’  SMEs.  Conventional  scoring  is  highly   predictive  but  also  relies  on  functioning  credit   information  bureaus  (CIBs)  to  gather   store   and   share accurate repayment history. In many developing countries  CIBs do not work or are   absent altogether so lenders are forced to look for alternative sources of data.       psychometric     13  Dalberg  Global  Development  Advisors.

One  solution does  not  apply  to  all  and  this is  reflected  in  the   extensive range of initiatives underway. Often the underlying instruments are the same   but  adapted  for  particular  market  situations.  This  has  led  to  the  rise  in  sectoral  based   approaches to SME financing in areas such as agriculture  energy financing and women  led SMEs (see box 3).     It  is  also  important  to  note  that  most  SME  financing  schemes  form  part  of  broader   regulatory  or  marketbased  programmes  to  support  inclusive  growth.  Enabling   environments will be discussed later in this guide  however it is important to highlight that   knowing your market and its needs is key to the success of any instrument.       Box 3  Targeting Womenled SMEs     Estimates  show  that  over  70%  of  womenled  SMEs  are  either  unserved  or  underserved  financially.    Targeting women entrepreneurs has been a focus of MFIs  however  womenled SME financing is much   less  common  with  many  programmes  focusing  on  capacity  building  rather  than  financial  tools.    Although there is little evidence around which tools to use with women  there is evidence that targeting   women specifically can make a difference to the growth of the SMEs they manage.       In addressing this problem  it is important to consider both supplyside issues (such as policy bias and   discrimination  misconceptions about female credit risk and unfavourable credit terms) and demand  side issues (women’s reluctance to apply for loans given a lack of business training and higher rejection   rates). The few programmes focusing on womenowned SMEs have tended to be of limited scale and   have lacked capacity building support to ensure sustainability.     The IFC has made women one of its focuses aiming to ensure that 25% of its own loans provided to   SMEs through financial intermediaries go to womenowned businesses (IFC  2013). Community banks    cooperatives  and  chambers  of  commerce  can  be  used  as  nontraditional  models  for  increasing  the   reach to womenowned SMEs in need of finance.  Examples include           IDLC  in Bangladesh who through their  Purnota loan product provides a working  capital and   long term financing facility for women owned businesses       USAID signed a DCA guarantee with the Bank of Abyssinia (BOA)  Ethiopia’s third largest bank    to offer loan financing assistance specifically to target womenowned SMEs by guaranteeing   up to US$4.3 million in loans over a 7year period (2008 – 2014).       EBRD has a specific WomeninBusinessProgramme through partner banks in 16 countries.           The  IFC’s  Banking  on  Women  programme  brings  together  financial  institutions  and  women   entrepreneurs   using its investment capital  to help  institutions expand their portfolios  while   helping entrepreneurs strengthen their businesses with new forms of financing     Source  Goldman Sachs (2014). Giving Credit Where it is Due     Developed Country experiences. Much can be learnt from the experiences of developed   countries.  The Euro area provides a good example of where a large spectrum of public   institutions  participate  in  addressing  SME  financing  needs.  Approximately  99.8%  of  all   European  businesses  are  SMEs  employing  approximately  86.9  million  people  (67%  of   private sector employment).15  In the context of quantitative easing the ECB has recently   started  to  provide  cheap  longterm  funding  to  banks   which  comes  in  addition  to  its   provision of shortterm liquidity.      To  support  the  sector   a  number  of  marketbased  initiatives  that  allow  direct  access  to   equity  and  bond  markets  have  been  launched  in  many  European  countries  (led  by   Germany and France)  although the scope of these varies widely. These can help SMEs to   diversify their funding sources by facilitating access to external and costeffective market  based financing. The uptake has been mixed so far and SME funding through the capital   markets  has  yet  to  develop  significantly.  While  the  development  of  capital  markets  is   beyond the scope of this guide  it is important to note their potential.     15 Kaya (2014). SME Financing in the Euro Area.

This is achieved by   creating  tradable  or  collateralisable  securities  linked  to  SME  loans   thereby  transferring   their credit risk to the capital markets in an effective manner.        3.1     The Republic of Korea Experience     The  Republic  of  Korea’s  economic  development  has  been  the  envy  of  many  countries    transitioning from one of the world’s poorest nations in the 1960s  to being the 12th largest   economy (in GDP).16  As of 2012  99.9% of all companies in Korea are SMEs accounting   for  87.7%  of  all  employees.17    The  sector  is  characterised  by  heavy  reliance  on  bank   funding to meet financing needs.     The Korean government has long supported SMEs as an engine of growth in the economy.   Since 1979  it has supplied public funds to SMEs both directly and through credit guarantee   schemes. It has also used moral suasion  for example  in 2009 in the wake of the global   financial  crisis  banks  were  told  to  roll  over  loans  to  viable  SMEs.  Support  for  small   companies has increased following the financial crisis  while large business groups have   been forced  to  restructure.  Public  support  for  such interventions is  strong   as SMEs  are   viewed as disadvantaged in competition with the chaebols.18     Support is delivered through a variety of institutions as illustrated in Figure 2 and focuses   on three main areas – availability  accessibility and corporate restructuring.   Figure 2   Republic of Korea – SME Financing Framework19          Mechanisms for expanding the availability of credit include    1)  the  enforcement  of  a  specified  SME  loan  ratio  –  The  Bank  of  Korea  regulates  the     minimum percentage of SME loans to the total loan book;     2)  the  introduction  of  an  aggregate  credit  ceiling  loan  system  –  The  Bank  of  Korea   supplies a limited amount of short term funds at lower than market interest rates to   FIs with a positive SME loan record;     3)  support to policy development; and       4)  the  provision  of  venture  capital  funding  through  the  Korea  Venture  Investment     Corporation (KVIC).

Corporate restructuring support targets SMEs who have faced liquidity problems following   the financial crisis.     To support these initiatives  the government has promoted the use of exchange markets   for SMEs  originally through KOSDQ (which has now largely become an equity financing   market  for  larger  firms)   and  subsequently  through  KONEX  (established  in  2013  and   specifically designed for SMEs and startups). The Korea Financial Investment Association   (KOFIA) has also launched FreeBoard  a trading system for SME bonds.      Has it  been effective?   While  there is  no  doubt that  the level  of  growth  achieved has   been phenomenal  Korea’s approach to SME development has not been without criticism.   It has been argued that government policies in this area are too interventionist  creating   market distortions  and should therefore be reduced.  Some argue that the incentives for   FIs to improve credit evaluation skills have been reduced  impeding the development of a   market for SME financing. Interventions also allow weaker companies to survive  ones who   would not have done so under normal market conditions. Finally  they can encourage SMEs   to  remain  small  so  they  remain  eligible  for  support   ruling  out  the  efficiency  gains  and   economies  of  scale  associated  with  growth.21  On  the  other  hand   rapid  growth  in  bank   lending to SMEs suggests that policies to promote financing have been effective at least   to some extent. In fact  SMEs received 78% of business loans in 2011  one of the highest   shares among OECD countries with available data.

A costbenefit analysis also suggested that   the scheme justifies its costs.25     Innovation  The UK is a major player in the development of new technological approaches   to SME financing and government is proactively working with providers to determine the   best framework to support this development while maintaining a competitive and sound   banking industry.  Tax beneﬁts for marketplace investments are to be granted as part of   the  Individual  Savings  Accounts  (ISAs).  Furthermore   the  government  is  considering   making  a  referral  scheme  mandatory   under  which  banks  would  be  required  to  forward   declined loan applications to alternative lenders.       Another area where the UK may provide a glimpse into the future for developing countries   is through the development of capital markets and the securitisation of SME loans.   The London Stock Exchange’s AIM is by far the bestknown exchange through which SMEs   can sell their shares to the UK public  however  several smaller markets are also trying to   attract  SME  business.  Securitisation  has  the  potential  to  bridge  the  gap  between  SMEs’   funding needs and the availability of bank loans  by allowing banks to partly offload SME   credit risks and transfer them from their balance sheets to the capital markets.  At present    this segment is still very small and SME understanding of this mechanism is minimal.            Box 5  It’s not just about Supply     A recent study showed that despite UK SMEs being perceived as relatively sophisticated  there   was  still  a  reliance  on  traditional  forms  of  finance  and  a  lack  of  awareness  of  other  financing   options  available.  This  has  implications  for  policy  makers  and  emphasises  the  importance  of   addressing demand side constraints.       •  56% of SMEs in the UK have used external finance in the last 3 years. The types of finance   used are bank overdraft (31%)  credit card finance (22%)  a loan from an individual (16%)    a bank loan or commercial mortgage (14%) and leasing/hire purchase (13%).     •  Equity  finance  is  less  commonly  used.  Of  those  using  equity  finance  this  was  mainly  from     friends and family or other businesses rather than venture capitalists and business angels.     •  Nonbank sources of finance including mezzanine and peer to peer lending were used by less     than one per cent of businesses.      •  Study on tax incentives generating investment showed negligible effect.     Businesses were cautious about using alternative funding sources. Whilst  49% would consider   leasing or hire purchase  only 23% considered peer to peer lending  16% invoice finance  8%   equity finance from VCs or business angels.

It lowers the risk to the lender by guaranteeing repayment of part of   the loan in the event of default.     Overview.    A  PCG  fund  can  help  diversify  risk  by  guaranteeing  loans  across  different   sectors or geographic areas. Partial (and full) credit guarantee funds have existed at least   since  the  beginning  of  the  20th  century  and  have  become  more  popular  over  the  past   decades.    PCG schemes feature prominently among donor interventions.27  While they also exist on   a  purely  private  basis  (and  increasingly  public/private  schemes  are  becoming  more   common)   governments  and  donors  have  been  aggressively  pushing   for  their   establishment to overcome the limited access to bank credit SMEs face. These schemes   have been put in place with or without supporting technical assistance (TA). By providing   a guarantee  such a scheme can        Help overcome the lack of collateral of most SMEs (and thus the issue of risk);       Compensate for low profit margins due to the high cost of lending to the SME sector;     26 IFC and McKinsey and Company (2010).

The rationale for PCG schemes is summarised in   the simple logic model below.     Figure 4  Simple Results Chain for Credit Guarantee Schemes     PCG schemes can operate on a local  country  regional or even global level and can consist   of  different  types  of  guarantees  covering  a  broad  range  of  financial  products  including   loan   trade  finance  and  cash  flow  management  products.29  Donors  operate  directly  and   through  DFIs  and  NGOs  that  generally  provide  both  funding  and  TA  support.  While   potentially losing  some  autonomy in terms  of  scheme  focus  and  decisionmaking  large   DFI  managed  schemes  can  improve  value  for  money  through  economies  of  scale  and   experience  in  implementation.    A  general  overview  of  the  pros  and  cons/risks  of  PCG   schemes is summarised in table 2.      Table 2   Credit Guarantee Schemes – Advantages and Challenges     Advantages     Risks/challenges      Overcome bank’s risk aversion to lend to   SMEs caused by information asymmetry      Overcome failure of collateral based lending      especially where contract enforcement is   weak      Effective in leveraging large sums of     additional lending      Potential cost reduction for lending to SMEs    Improve the loan appraisal capabilities of the     banks and systems of monitoring       Overcome the risk of innovating new   business models  products  outreach   mechanisms      Achieve financial and economic additionality     and transformation of sector       Demand  side  weaknesses  make  for  high  rates  of  NPLs     without and with the scheme.       Potential low demand for a CGS. Lack of liquidity or better     returns from other asset classes prevent additional SME   lending       Risk of low additionality (the SME lending would have     happened anyway)       Potential abuse of the PCG scheme by the banks and     SMEs (moral hazard risk that excessively risky loans are   placed under the CGS)       Cost of guarantee premiums makes for untenably high cost     of borrowing        Unwillingness of the banks or borrowers to pay for the     guarantee making the scheme underused       Failure of the scheme to change behaviour & business     models results in failure to deliver wider  systemic impacts.     Increasingly donors are using PCG schemes as part of a broader tool kit to address financial   sector market issues (see box 6) and to address specific welfare objectives by using such   schemes to promote the growth of priority sectors such as technology  womenled SMEs   or agribusiness.      Issues of appropriate pricing  funding and the institutional structure are important. While   such  schemes  could  be  run  on  a  selfsustainable  basis   they  often  involve  significant   subsidies and contingent fiscal liabilities to cover losses.   While it is difficult to compute   such  costs  prior  to  operation   it  is  even  more  difficult  to  measure  the  benefits  or   additionality  i.e. the share of borrowers that would not have gained access to finance if it   were not for the PCG. Ultimately  the cost of any government intervention has to take into               28 Financial additionality is ensured through the requirement that guaranteed loans are only issued to borrowers   that  have  exhausted  all  other  sources  of  funding  (Cowling  and  Siepel   2013).    Economic  additionality  can  be   assessed in terms of firm level growth and spillovers.    29 The types of guarantees provided are determined by the nature of the individual scheme but can include loan   guarantees   loan  portfolio  guarantees   portable  guarantees   bond  guarantees   partial  guarantees  or  full   guarantees.  Products  covered  can  include  advance  payment  guarantees   bank  loans   bank  guarantees    commercial paper  contract financing  finance bonds  invoice discounting  loans from NBFIs  letters of credit  pre  shipment receipts  performance and bid bonds  purchase order financing  trade and commercial bills  transaction   liabilities and warehouse receipts.     14                                                                                                                       Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To     the  return  on  each  dollar  of   account   taxpayer’s  money  in  such  an  intervention   compared  to  other  interventions   including   interventions outside the financial sector.      The  extent  to  which  PCG  schemes  can   leverage funding is measured by the ratio of   outstanding guarantees to equity (multiplier)   and  is  one  way  of  judging  success.  In   determining  ideal  levels  of  leverage   the   default  rate  must  be  considered  as  schemes   must  be  able  to  meet  their  obligations  but   ideally  should  not  hold  surplus  funding.   Multiplier  rates  vary  between  3  and  20   (generally  dependent  on  the  risk  of  the   portfolio).  Funds  in  the  MENA  region   for   example   have  a  relatively  low  multiplier  at   3.4 (with average coverage ratios of 68%). At   the other end of the spectrum  Hungary has a   multiplier of 20 (largely due to the high share   of guarantees that are counterguaranteed by   government) with coverage ratios of 90%.30     Box 6  Business Finance for the Poor –     Bangladesh (BFPB)     The  DFID  funded  BFPB  programme   takes  a   market systems approach to ensuring that SMEs   gain access to the financial services from which   they  are  currently  excluded.  The  5year   programme consists of three components      First  it will introduce a sizeable number of new   borrowers  to  Bangladesh’s  private  commercial   banks  by  providing  partial  loan  guarantees  to   qualifying  SMEs  under  the  Credit  Guarantee   Fund. Secondly  the Business Finance Challenge   Fund  is  designed  to  spearhead  innovation  in   financial  sector  products  and  delivery  channels   and to spur development of demonstrably useful   and practical business advisory services aimed at   making SMEs more commercially minded  better   managed   and  better  prepared  to  expand  and   prosper.  Finally   the  Policy  Component  will   actively  engage  with  stakeholders  from  banks   and  other  FIs  to  regulators   academics  and   representatives of donor agencies  to solicit and   promote  ideas  designed  to  strengthen  the   enabling environment for SMEs.     Evidence.  There  have  been  few  rigorous   impact assessments of PCG schemes  though   the few that have been undertaken point to a somewhat positive effect.31 Two separate   studies  suggest  that  the  Chilean  scheme  has  generated  additional  loans  for  new  and   existing  bank  clients  and  that  the  additional  loans  have  led  to  higher  sales  and  profit   growth.32 However  another study questions the additionality effect as approximately 80%   of the firms that benefit from the guarantees had bank loans in the past33. Comparative   evaluations are few and far between due to heterogeneity across schemes. More evidence   is needed in this respect.34          Despite the debate over their impacts  it is generally agreed that guarantee schemes must   be carefully designed and continuously evaluated if they are to stand a chance of delivering   the  desired  public  policy  objectives.  Without  this   guarantee  schemes  can  result  in  the   misallocation  of  resources   the  crowding  out  of  private  collateral  and  unnecessarily   increasing public debt.     Box 7  PCG Schemes vs Loan Subsidies     A 2009 study examining alternative forms of support by government to SMEs found that government   agencies with tight budget constraints are better off providing guarantees rather than subsidising loans.   Guarantees  have  certain  advantages  over  direct  subsidised  government  lending.  Firstly   the  final   lending decision stays with a marketbased  privatesector entity – the bank –  which has the expertise   and the necessary technology to evaluate credit applications and projects. This  is  likely to ensure a   more efficient selection among borrowers than if the task is carried out by a public agency (and  given   that  the  guarantee  is  partial   some  part  of  the  risk  remains  with  the  lender).  Second   compared  to   direct lending programmes  guarantee schemes have much lower initial cash flow needs  and as such    have a leverage component. As a result  they can be used when fiscal constraints are tight.     Source  Arping  Lóránth & Morrisson (2009).                30 Saadani  Arvai & Rocha (2010).

Government   Institution vs   Separate Entity       Where schemes are initially implemented through a public     institution  they should eventually be transferred to a standalone   entity.       There are examples of purely privatesector initiatives  such as     Italy’s network of mutual guarantee schemes  “Confidi”.

Selective vs   portfolio   approach          Individual loanlevel guarantees involve the guarantee agency in   the screening stage to review eligibility and risk profiles. In this   approach  lenders will usually first approve the loans and then seek   a guarantee approval on the borrower’s behalf.        The “portfolio” model allows lenders  to assign guarantees to higher   risk loans or targeted borrowers and inform the guarantors after the   loans are approved or the loan defaults.        While the loanlevel approach might allow for more careful     screening and risk management  it is also costlier for the credit   guarantee fund.

Firstly  it is important to ensure that the SME does not see the   loan as a form of donor assistance. Secondly  banks must evaluate SME risk and not use donor engagement as   a proxy for creditworthiness.

This is not a problem if no overlap exists between the share of   the loan covered by the collateral and the one covered by the   guarantee.       Partial collateralisation can also reduce the borrower’s incentive to     default. However  guarantees clearly do not meet their objectives in   broadening credit supply if they are used as a backup protection on   a collateralised loan.      Caps on the level   of collateral can   be used to ensure   additionality   criteria is   upheld.37       Under a first loss guarantee (also known as a joint and several     guarantee)  the fund is required to pay an agreed percentage of the   outstanding loan at the moment of the default. The remaining is   covered by the lender  which can also retain the proceeds from the   realisation of any collateral provided by the defaulting borrower.        A final loss scheme will consider any recovered monies  which are     shared in a preagreed ratio between the financier and the   guarantor.       Clear division of responsibility between guarantor and lender should     be established with screening and monitoring functions the   responsibility of the lender.

In determining the most appropriate features and characteristics of individual funds the   implementer  should  be  clear  (and  realistic)  about  desired  outcomes.  A  guarantee  is   unlikely to influence the strategic direction of a FI but may increase volumes of lending   (demonstrating profitability of the segment)  may accelerate ventures into new markets   and may encourage new approaches to lending or credit analysis.       37 See Vienna Initiative Working Group on Credit Guarantee Schemes  2014               17                                                                                                                       Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To     It is also important to ensure coordination among schemes to avoid duplication of efforts   and overlap in targeted groups. In some countries (e.g. Kenya)  multiple initiatives are in   place with providers unaware of the existence of each other’s schemes.38 In some cases    FIs have signed up to the schemes but are not using them with some loan officers unaware   of their existence. In particular countries where schemes have failed (be it financially or   due to limited takeup) it is crucial to understand what caused these failures and address   any regulatory or broader financial sector constraints as part of a package of interventions.   The sharing of good practice is encouraged and forums such as the SME Finance Forum   can contribute to this.     Box 8  Financing Women Owned SMEs  Ethiopia     Through  its  Development  Credit  Authority  (DCA)  guarantee  programme   USAID  worked  with  the   Bank of Abyssinia (BOA)  Ethiopia’s third largest bank  to offer loan financing assistance specifically   to target womenowned SMEs by guaranteeing up to US$4.3 million in loans over 7 years (2008  2014).     The  programme  successfully  demonstrated  that  women  are  creditworthy   however   analysis   showed that the guarantee has not influenced BOA’s credit underwriting policies which are standard   across  SME  lending  activities  and  based  on  collateral.  This  has  been  largely  due  to  an  overall   restrictive regulatory environment requiring  for example  85% of loans disbursed by a commercial   bank  to  be  collateralised.  This  demonstrates  the  importance  of  the  regulatory  environment   surrounding the CGS. In addition to this  research has shown that a risksharing mechanism by itself   may be insufficient in convincing bank partners to lend to womenowned SMEs. It is crucial to identify   the full cross selling  customer loyalty  and marketshare benefits that support the business case.

Overview  Providing credit or equity lines to financial institutions in developing countries   is particularly favoured by both bi and multilateral DFIs. In addition to this  loan or equity   funds can be managed by the private sector  governments or donors directly. The largest   funds receive support from multiple donors and can invest in many FIs regionally or even   globally.39  Financial  support  is  often  complemented  by  TA   which  can  lead  to  increased   capacity  in  SME  banking  and  can  contribute  to  both  a  quantitative  increase  in  the  FI’s   business with SMEs as well as a qualitative improvement of the FI’s product offering (i.e.   more accessible and/or longerterm credit). The increased quantity and quality of credit   for  SME  customers  is  expected  to  impact  SME  decisionmaking  with  regard  to  growth   strategies (investments) and employment  and encourage sustainable business models. A   simple logic model for this rationale is illustrated below       Figure 5  Simple Results Chain – Credit/Equity Lines to FIs    38 From interview with Chris August  Credit Guarantee Expert and Team Leader of DFID’s Business Finance for   the Poor  BFPB programme in Bangladesh (January 2015).    39 Examples of funds are numerous but include  (i) European Investment Fund (part of the EIB group)    provides loans and equity to banks as part of its broader portfolio of support to SMEs    http //www.eif.org/index.htm.

In many cases  funding   to  banks is  made  with  the  prime  objective   of  contributing  to  the  FI’s  overall  strategy   and  needs.  This   the   investment  provides  it  with  resources  it   cannot  raise  in  the  local  credit  or  capital   market  which will lead to the growth of all   bank  strategic  portfolios   including  SMEs.   However   without   incentives   attached to the majority of funds provided    funding does not always filter down to the   target  portfolio.    Loans  in  foreign  (hard)   currency  for example  may have the effect   of  increasing  lending  to  larger  corporate   customers  who  have  a  need  for  it  at  the   expense of SMEs. Arguably  however  such   lending  will  also  free  up  other  resources    such as domestic deposits that can then be   lent to SMEs.       specific     19          Concerns  over  the  effectiveness  of  IFC’s  core   model  of  using  financial  intermediaries  were   raised in a recent evaluation by the World Bank’s   Independent Evaluation Group (IEG). A review of   166  IFC  investment  projects  that  target  SMEs   through  FIs  showed  that  only  20%  of  the   projects  deﬁne  SMEs  and  have  provisions   mentioning SMEs as beneﬁciaries.     SMEs     support     through     In  addition  to  this   “for  this  evaluation   IEG   reviewed 82 IFC investment projects that sought   to   ﬁnancial   intermediaries.  Of  these   around  40%  did  not   meet  SME  ﬁnancing  targets.”  Evaluators  found   that   the  macroeconomic  environment  and   changes  in  the  FI’s  strategy   especially  in  the   case of banks  were key determinants of failure.   In  addition   the  IEG  also  state  that  “equally   problematic  in  gauging  eﬃcacy  is  the  secrecy   surrounding  the  clients  of  banks  supported  by   IFC”.  According  to  the  IEG   “it  is  unclear  what   impact these investments are having at the ﬁrm   level  and  there  has  been  no  attempt  to  assess   impact through a systematic study”.

In most cases  the longterm impacts of TA   can therefore be considered to outweigh the risks of distorting competition               20                                                                                                                  Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To          4.3     Lease Finance     Lease Finance allows SMEs to obtain equipment and capital goods even when   they lack the credit history or collateral to access traditional loan products.       Overview  In leasing the provider (lessor) owns the equipment and allows the applicant   (lessee) to use it in exchange for periodic payments.41  Leasing  in effect  separates the   legal ownership of an asset from the economic use of that asset. In this manner the lessee   can access equipment that they would not otherwise be able to purchase while ensuring   that the lessor has the certainty of repossession if the lessee defaults (see figure 6). In   general   leasing  results  in  lower  transaction  costs  compared  to  loans  and  can  be   particularly relevant for rural and agricultural smallscale operators and in countries where   the business environment is weak (i.e. postconflict and fragile states). Generally  leasing   products  are  offered  by  banks  leasing companies  (owned  by  banks)   or  private leasing   companies.      Figure 6  The Leasing Process             In recent years  leasing mechanisms have become much more common in the developing   world as relevant accounting rules and regulation have  been put in place.  This analysis   focuses on leasing itself but it is important to note that there are forms of asset backed   financing which can play a similar role. For example  factoring (the discounting of sales   receivables)   is  attractive  for  SMEs  who  are  supplying  large  creditworthy  buyers   as  it   does not rely on information about the SME itself  but rather on their counterpart buyer.   Alternatively   under  a  factoring  contract   the  finance  provider  purchases  the  seller's   accounts  receivable   and  assumes  the  responsibility  to  collect  repayments.42  The  main   advantages of leasing programmes are summarised in table 6.     Table 6  The Advantages of Leasing Finance     For SMEs     For Providers           Allows SMEs to access/purchase productive assets     they could otherwise not afford       No/low collateral required beyond leased asset.     Cost is competitive with traditional credit  due to     benefits of collateral and low processing and   transaction costs.       Provides access to medium term finance which is          particularly difficult for SMEs to access.     Islamic compliance  leasing is seen as an interest  free product and considered the same as a rental.   “Ijarah” is a kind of leasing relevant within the MENA   region.          The lessor maintains legal ownership of the   asset and can exert greater control over the   investment.       The lessor can monitor assets more easily.     Lessors can actively apply specialised     knowledge  providing the opportunity to extend   product lines.   Increases customer base and provides   additional marketing channels for ﬁnancial   services.   Improved credit scoring and processing systems   that can be applied across finance providers                              41 Both finance and operational leases are available. At the simplest level  under a finance lease all the risks and   rewards incidental to ownership of an asset are transferred to the lessee from the lessor. An operational lease is   a lease agreement in which risks and rewards associated with the asset are not transferred to the lessee and   stays with the owner of the asset. This analysis focuses primarily on finance leases as this is the primary stage   in leasing development in most developing countries.   42 Originally limited to domestic contracts  international factoring has become popular as it eases the credit and   collection burden created by international sales for exporters.       21                                                                                                                       Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To     For Market Development     For the Broader Economy       Contributes  to  the  development  of  overall  domestic          financing market.

Although leasing remains a small part of most SME financing portfolios  it is increasingly   seen as a key way of bridging the gap for the smallest of SMEs and can be a stepping  stone  to  accessing  different  levels  of  finance  within  the  formal  financial  sector.  Donor   initiatives focus on removing the main barriers to the development of a leasing industry   and can consist of a combination of institutional reforms  TA to leasing agencies and banks    and supporting financing through other channels (e.g. PCG schemes).     for     Evidence  Leasing alongside factoring can   be  very  relevant  for  SMEs  and  can  be   particularly  appropriate   targeting   specific areas  such as sustainable energy   and  rural  finance.43  Being  an  assetbased   lending form  it can also serve as an SME   lending  tool  for  foreignowned  and  larger   banks   which  have  a  disadvantage  in  the   relationshipbased  lending  model  used  by   small and regional banks. There are many   examples  where   the   leasing  industry  have  been  particularly   effective (see box 10 and 11).44      interventions     in     Box 10  Case Study  Leasing Provides   Access to Finance Uzbekistan’s SMEs     Uzbek  Leasing  has  partnered  the  IFC  Leasing   Advisory  Program  in  Central  Asia  since  2002.    With  declining  banking  penetration  rates  the   financing  needs  of  SMEs  were  not  being  met.   Without access to term ﬁnance  SMEs were unable   to  implement  investment  plans  and  modernise   existing facilities.

However  this is rarely effective  and   may  actually  even  negatively  affect  the   broader market by distorting competition  crowding out private investment and acting as   a disincentive for new players.

Unlike  some  of  the  other  instruments  discussed  in  this  guide    development partners aren’t usually directly involved in the delivery of the lease finance   instrument.

Leasing can be most useful for agriculture and other equipment   focused sectors such as sustainable energy financing.     The appropriate legal and regulatory system is a vital precondition for   success and sequencing is crucial when considering broader   programmes in this sector. The establishment or upgrading of   collateral registries can be critical in this context          TA can play a key role in ensuring the sustainability of programmes.    Often banks are offering leasing alongside other more traditional   products that bank officers will lean towards as they know them better.     NBFI providers may need support in developing a sustainable funding     strategy that allows them to compete with larger bank providers.

Overview   From an investor’s perspective  an equity investment in a company has the   potential  for  signiﬁcant  capital  gains  if  that  company  is  successful.  From  the  SME’s   perspective  it provides an additional source of capital to grow the business  which is not   subject to rollover risk (i.e the risk that a bank or NBFI will not renew a loan).     As  with  debt   SMEs  find  it  difficult  to  access  the  equity  funding  needed  to  grow  their   business.  The SME equity gap arises when the amount of capital that would be invested   in  a  wellinformed  and  competitive  market is  different  to  the  amount  actually invested.    This  market  failure  can  be  explained  by  imperfect  or  asymmetric  information  between   finance providers and SMEs.      Why do SMEs need equity funding?  In the early stages of SME development  when   cash flow is not yet regular  bank debt is often not available in sufficient amounts making   equity  (through  formal  or  informal  sources)  the  primary  source  of  finance.  Even  well‐  established SMEs face a number of challenges when trying to access local or international   capital markets. The cost of raising capital tends to be considerably higher for SMEs  partly   because  of  the  perceived  greater  risk  associated  with  lending  to  or  investing  in  such   enterprises  and  the  compliance  costs  associated  with  accessing  capital  markets  (where   present). The scale of the equity gap has been exacerbated by recession and by the decline   in bank lending in recent periods.48 The type of equity support generally required depends   on the stage of development of the SME.  Figure 7 summarises these stages.49   Figure 7   Equity Financing needs at different stagese of SME growth     Concept Stage  Initial business   model is developed and product     developed      Type of equity   Seed and Start up     Capital  Angel Investors  Seed     stage Venture Capital  Friends &     Family    Early stage     development  Typically     negative cash flow     Type of equity     Venture Capital  firms      Angel Investors    Established SME with strong     growth potential     Type of equity     Private/Growth equity     (combined with debt and     asset based finance)    Strong growing company with   strong sales & stable cash flow     Type of equity private equity      mezzanine finance  access     capital markets     48 Wilson and Wright (2015).

This  largely  mitigates  a  key   argument against public sector involvement revolving around the crowding out of private   investment.  The  positive  externalities  relating  to  R&D  spend  and  innovation  can  also   provide a rationale for such schemes.       Investment through capital markets aside  there are 3 main types of equity investment        Private equity – the direct provision of longterm ﬁnancing in return for an equity   stake in a company. It can include venture capital  (the seed to expansion stages   of investment)  management buyouts and buyins and angel investment50.            Investment funds – investors pool money and are issued shares (or units if a trust   structure) in the fund itself. The fund then invests in individual companies.        Preferred equity (or mezzanine equity) is a class of ownership in a company that   has a higher claim on the assets and earnings than common equity but does not   carry voting or management rights. This type of equity tends to be used to finance   more sophisticated SMEs who are better equipped to access finance.  As a result    we will not focus on this in this guide.     Over the last decade  development partners have   expanded their participation in SME equity funds   although they remain a relatively small portion of   most  portfolios.  The  instrument  is  considered  to   be one of the riskier forms of SME finance. Despite   this   equity  funds  that  focus  on  SMEs  are  being   recognised   as  potentially  profitable  with   significant   potential.   development   Investing  in  SME  focused  equity  funds  allows   development partners to connect with SMEs that   they otherwise would be unable to reach directly.      impact     Governments  are  also  increasingly  introducing   schemes  to  encourage  investments  in  equity   through  tax  breaks  for  investors  (discussed  in   section 4.5).      Evidence  Equity investment in SMEs is growing   at a fast rate. According to African Private Equity   and  Venture  Capital  Association   private  equity   funds invested $8.1 billion in African companies in   2014  the second highest total ever after the $8.3   billion in 2007. This trend is set to continue.      to     There is evidence that industries in which private   equity funds are active  are better governed and   tend   increase  productivity   output  and   employment more than those without.51 There is    however   a  lack  of  cross  fund  comparisons  on   equity funds and much of what we have learnt is   from individual case study examples (see box 12).   Israel provides a good example of where schemes   to  promote  the  venture  capital  sector  have   resulted in a flourishing industry52.     Box 12  The Evidence     Africa  Agricultural  Capital  (AAC)  is  an   East  African   fund   established  in  2005  and  investing  in   growing SMEs who play a key role in East   Africa’s agricultural markets.     venture     capital     A  2011  evaluation   profiling  5  of  its   investees  who  comprise  around  30%  of   the  portfolio  by  value   found  significant   business growth arising from investment    turnover  across   with   five   total   businesses   increasing  by  30%  since   investment.

These organisations provide   a combination of capital  mentorship  technical support  infrastructure  and other critical   resources. Unlike VC firms  incubators and accelerators are not funds as such and generally   provide only small amounts of financing. Through its focus on startups and early stage   SMEs   evidence  shows  that  careful  planning  of  incubators  may  present  a  pathway  to   stimulate economies particularly in developing countries.53     The growth in angel investment provides a great opportunity for SMEs  however  it is not   without  its  difficulties.  Many  angels  are  focused  on  returns  and  lack  the  organisational   structure  to  efficiently  source  the  best  deals.  In  some  countries  development  partners   have  stepped  in  to  help  formalise  groups  of  angels   resulting  in  cost  and  transactional   efficiency  improving deal sourcing and providing training for the angels themselves (e.g.   USAID Jordan Competitiveness Programme).54     So What Works?  It is clear that equity finance can be a beneficial source of riskfinancing   for SMEs (including highrisk SMEs) in their early stages. It is important to stress  however    that  it  is  more  midsized  rather  than  smaller  businesses  that  will  be  willing  to  accept   outside equity owners and that are large enough to provide the sufficient absolute return   for such equity investors to justify the fixed costs of screening and monitoring. It also has   the  benefit  of  potentially  providing  a  good  return  to investors  and  can  be  a key  way  of   combining  private  and  public  sector  funding  in  sustainable  investment  models.55    In   addition to a supportive legal  regulatory and tax framework discussed in section 5  table   8 highlights best practice in considering programme design.

For example  CDC reported that during 20042008 it   committed $ 7.1 billion to funds that attracted three times the amount   from commercial investors. In their 2008 Report  the AsDB reported an   even higher mobilisation factor  of over $8 for every $1 invested.   SME focused private equity funds  with average investments below $2   million  have generally produced relatively low financial returns56. This   outcome has been a reflection of      high transaction costs       comparatively small overall size of the funds with resulting difficulties     to attract good managers  and       absence of exit prospects in markets without liquid stock markets.       Supply side  Equity fund management requires highly skilled staff     which is often lacking in developing countries.       Demand side  SMEs may not have the skill sets required to access     equity investment or even the knowledge of them.       Developing a pipeline of investment ready SMEs ensures     sustainability of deal flow.       TA can increase chances of success of investments targeting     operational improvements.

Overview   SMEs are often the recipients of preferential tax policies that larger companies   do not benefit from. This is justified as benefits can provide an incentive to grow  innovate   and can offset the high costs to SMEs of tax compliance and administration.  Tax incentives   can  take  many  different forms  and  figure  8  represents  the  prevalence  of  tax incentives   globally.    We  will  discuss  a  selection  of   these below.     for  example      Tax Holidays  occur  when  companies  are   given  a  certain  amount  of  time  during   which they do not have to pay tax or pay   reduced  taxes.  These  are  particularly   relevant  for  small  SMEs  in  their  startup   phase.  Moldova    fully   exempts  newly  created  SMEs  from  profit   tax for a period of three years and provides   a 35% reduction of taxable income for the   following  two  years.  There  is  however    much criticism of tax holidays particularly   in  developing  countries.  The  system  can   provide  an  incentive  for  SME  owners  to   cease  the  operation  of  a  business  just   before  the  tax  holiday  reaches  an  end  to   subsequently  reestablish  under  a  new   name.  The  implications  for  tax  revenue   generation  can  also  be  significant  and   avoiding  openended  tax  holidays  that   erode the tax base indefinitely is essential.   A tax holiday scheme is also not appropriate for highly profitable startup SMEs and this   problem can be avoided by establishing a ceiling for the tax holiday scheme.

Promoting Research and Development (R&D) and investment in capital assets. A   generally more efficient alternative to tax holidays is the design of targeted incentives to   address  specific  operational  challenges  or  to  promote  investments  to  facilitate  growth.   Stimulating R&D and investment in capital assets has been one area in which tax incentives   have proved to be successful.       The provision of tax incentives  can influence   an  SME’s  decision  making  process  as  they   effectively lower the cost of capital (see box   13).  R&D  and  capital  investment  can  have   considerable impact on an SME’s productivity    invention and innovation  and therefore such   incentives  will  ultimately  improve  economic   performance and increase wealth.      In  addition  to  this   the ideal level  of  R&D  in   society  is  usually  higher  than  the  levels   invested  by  the  private  sector  alone.  This  is   because private investors cannot keep all the   beneﬁts  that  their  R&D  generates  although   they  bear  the  full  cost.  Tax  incentives  can   help raise the amount spent on R&D towards   the  desired   to   remember  however  that in countries where   the capacity for carrying out R&D activities is   limited by human capital constraints  the case   for such tax incentives is less compelling  and   other  measures  (such  as  incentives  for   technology transfers61) may be better suited   to boost productivity.     important     level.     is     It     Box 13  Do Tax Incentives influence     R&D Decisions?     that   while     A  2007  study  on  R&D  incentives  in  the  UK   tax  policy  on  R&D   ﬁnds   expenditure  and  R&Drelated   investment   provides substantial incentives for ﬁrms with   small R&D programmes  the costs associated   with  making  tax  claims  absorb  much  of  the   potential  beneﬁt.  These  firms  face  a  costly    complicated   and  timeconsuming  process   that cancels out much of the beneﬁts arising   from the tax policy.      Tax  incentives  can  also  fail  to  influence   behaviour  as  tax  relief  is  claimed  after  the   expenditure and there is a risk that it will not   be allowed. This risk is taken into account in   investment  decisions.  Similarly   if  SMEs  are   cash constrained and they cannot receive up   front  benefits   they  may  not  have  the   resources  required  to  undertake  the  initial   investment  despite  the  fact  that  they  could   reclaim some of this cost after the event.      Source  Derregia and Chittenden (2007).      VAT Exemption. Many governments set a sales threshold below which SMEs are exempt   from paying value added tax (VAT). Raising these exemption thresholds  can reduce the   tax  burden  for  SMEs  and  allow  them  to  invest  the  money  saved  in  business  growth.   Thresholds vary widely. The UK gives a comparatively lenient example whereas Denmark   is at the other end of the spectrum. In Mexico  Sweden and Spain there is no threshold at   all.  The advantages and disadvantages are summarised below      Table 9  Advantages and Disadvantages of VAT Thresholds     Advantages     Disadvantages     •  Allows     increased  expenditure  on  core  business     activities     •  Minimises burdensome and costly compliance with VAT     •  higher thresholds result in a loss in tax revenues   •  tax discrimination   •  provides  an  incentive  for  SMEs  to  stay  below  the     laws and regulations.     threshold      •  From a tax administration point of view SMEs contribute   little  to  the  overall  VAT  yield   while  the  administrative   burden to collect VAT from a large number of SMEs is   high.       •  can reduce business credibility – some businesses     prefer dealing with suppliers with a VAT number     •  Distortion  of  competition  between  registered  and     nonregistered companies.

Cost of tax compliance and administration. It can be argued that the resources that   SMEs  direct  towards  tax  compliance  are  resources  that  could  otherwise  be  used  for   reinvestment  facilitating  future  growth62.  As  a  result   there is  a  belief  that  taxes  and  a   complex  tax  system  put  disproportionate  pressure  on  smaller  businesses.  Cumbersome   tax systems are also one of the main reasons for the prevalence of informal economies in   many countries.     Introducing a simplified taxation system can overcome these issues. The benefits and   disadvantages of a simplified tax system are summarised in table 10        Table 10  Advantages and Disadvantages of a Simplified Tax System     Advantages     Disadvantages     •  Lower compliance costs   •  More predictable tax liabilities   •  Less interaction with tax administration   •  Generally lower tax burden        •  No incentive to improve bookkeeping   •  No relief in case of loss making   •  Potential disincentive to grow   •  Risk of abuse   •  Fairness concerns     Tax relief for investments in SMEs encourages individuals and companies to invest in   small and growing businesses by effectively subsidising the risk they are taking. This form   of  investment  (whether  direct  or  through  venture  capital  or  equity  funds)  can  provide   valuable support to businesses seeking finance to develop and grow.     As part of these schemes  investors can deduct from their taxable income part of the cost   of investment in certain types of companies or venture capital funds. In some countries    like  the  UK   investors  are  given  income  tax  relief  when  they  purchase  new  shares  in   qualifying companies  they are also charged capital gains tax at a lower rate and allowed   to offset any losses on the sale of shares against income tax. Examples of these schemes   include  the  Seed  Enterprise  Investment  Scheme   Enterprise  Investment  Scheme  and   Venture  Capital  Trust  Scheme in  the UK.  To  date the  UK  schemes  have  supported  over   22 000 businesses  with over £17.5 billion of funding provided.63     Investment incentives can be specifically targeted to particular sectors and are particularly   widespread as a means of attracting foreign direct investment in developing countries. An   assessment  of  tax incentives  introduced  in  Malaysia in  1986  concluded  that   while they   succeeded in stimulating domestic investment  foreign investors were primarily influenced   by other factors (including macroeconomic stability and the quality of infrastructure). At   the same time  they came at a very high cost.     So what works? The choice of incentive and how it is structured is key to success. The   design of a complete tax system that encourages SME growth and investment is beyond   the scope of this guide.64 It is clear  however  that welltargeted incentives that directly   reduce  the  cost  of  capital  to  SMEs   such  as  investment  tax  credits  for  R&D   have  been   used with some success. The type of incentive can be tailored for specific sectors or used   to  target  investment  priorities   for  example  increased  wear  and  tear  allowances  for   investment in farming machinery (Zambia) or training and research expenses deductible   from taxable profits (Rwanda).65     In  reviewing  how  governments  can  be supported  in the  design  of  appropriate incentive   schemes  the following should be considered                62 Complex and burdensome tax systems are consistently identified as a barrier to doing business in the World   Bank’s Doing Business Surveys.   63 HM Treasury (2015).

We will first highlight common grant   mechanisms at work in promoting an increase in availability of SME finance (match funding   and  challenge  funds)  and  then  go  on  to  look  at  the  increasingly  complementary  use  of   both loan and grant funding (blending) to achieve development goals.      Grant mechanisms.  Grants are transfers made  in  cash   goods  or  services    for  which  no  repayment  from  the  recipient  is  required.       Overview     There  is  often  a  grant  element  to  donor  and  DFI  funding.  Grants  can  be   financial  for example where funds are supplied at below market rates or with a repayment   holiday   or  can  be  ‘inkind’   through  the  provision  of  TA.  In  addition   specific  grant   mechanisms  have  been  developed  to  promote  innovation  or  stimulate  certain  desired   development outcomes and we will focus on these in the context of addressing the SME   financing gap. While the level of funding to SMEs  whether through equity  debt or direct   funding  is  critical   it  is  also  recognised  that  new  products   services  and  delivery   mechanisms are needed to ensure that these funds are channelled effectively. Stimulating   innovation is one way that these grant mechanisms can play a key role.66     A  matching  grant  is  a  oneoff   nonreimbursable  transfer  to  project  beneficiaries.  It  is   provided for a particular purpose and it is provided on the basis that the recipient makes   an agreed contribution (usually at least 50%).  Grants and matching contributions can be   either in cash or in kind  or a combination of both.67     Challenge funds are a variation of a matching grant allocated on a competitive basis.  The   mechanism allocates financial support to innovative projects  to improve market outcomes   with  social  returns  that  are  higher/more  assured  than  private  benefits   but  with  the     66  It is recognised  that there  are  a plethora of funds available including  adaptation funds  impact investment   funds  innovation funds  managed funds  social funds  research grants  social impact funds.   67 IFAD (2012).

Challenge  funds  aim  to  provide  the  smallest  possible   financial  contribution  to  a  socially  worthwhile  project  to  make  it  less  risky  and  more   financially sustainable to the private promoter.  That is  moving from the bottom right to   the top right quadrant in figure 9.     Figure 9  How does a challenge fund work?      Challenge  funds  can  be  relatively   small  and  single  country  focused   (e.g.  SME  Finance   Innovation   Challenge Fund in Tanzania) or can   be  very   large  and  operating   regionally  or  even  globally  (e.g   Africa Enterprise Challenge Fund).     the     So how can such grants play a role   in bridging the SME financing gap?

Critics   argue that there is no conclusive evidence that challenge funds generate systemic change.    Even worse  these mechanisms may have market distorting effects including        Promoting nonviable or nonfeasible enterprises or projects.       Substituting savings with external grants.       Crowding out financial institutions.       Crowding out private investment.       Misallocating scarce resources.       Supporting asset creation among groups of people  instead of individuals  which may   lead  to  lack  of  care  and  maintenance  of  the  assets  received  or  failure  to  achieve   satisfactory levels of profit.     As  a  result  of  this   possible  distortive  effects  should  be identified  during  project  design    together with suggestions for how these can be dealt with.     31                                                                                                                       Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To     to     as     their     the  DFID     On  the  other  hand   there  is  positive   impacts.   evidence   Evaluations  of   funded   Business Linkages Challenge Fund and   Financial  Deepening  Challenge  Fund    found  that  both  funds  demonstrated   positive  results  in  helping  the  private   sector  to  overcome  the  initial  risk  of   projects.68    Challenge  funds  have  also   been  shown   to  encourage  better   business  practices  among  grantees   because  their  criteria  require  solid   corporate governance and transparent   financial  management.  Evidence  also   supports  the  potential  for  catalytic   effect69.       Box 14  SME Financing Challenge     In  2010   G20  members  agreed  to  commit  $528   million  to  G20  SME  Finance  Challenge.    The   challenge aimed to identify providers  projects and   pathbreaking  models  having  the  potential  to   increase SMEs’ access to financial services at scale.   14 winners were chosen with 13 projects eventually   contracted.      Winning projects ranged from psychometric credit   scoring   equipment  leasing  for  rural  SMEs  and   farms   energy  efficiency  and  renewable  energy   finance and data analysis based risk management   leading to improved credit decisions for SMEs.     A 2014 evaluation found limited evidence about the   development  impact  of  the  projects  at  SME  level.   Attribution of impacts was difficult and only seven   grantees achieved the project targets. Despite this    the  total  of  SMEs  accessing  financial  services   equalled  46 000  with  a  total  loan  value  of  $270   million.  The  differences  in  outreach  performance   are  substantial.  While  one  grantee   a  technology   provider   liability   management  contributed to the funding of 33 000   SMEs by client MFIs  seven of the projects reached   fewer than 500 SMEs each.       So  what  works?  A  recent  study  on   how enterprise challenge funds can be   made  to  work  better  suggests  that   there is not a correct blueprint for fund   design   but  instead  this  will  be  very   dependent on the objective and context   of  the  fund  itself.70    The  available   evidence   the   management  of  the  challenge  fund  is   key.  Although  challenge  funds  are   traditionally  considered  as  a  ‘light  touch’  instrument   sufficient  funding  should  be  in  place  to  ensure  robust  design  and   sufficient  market  system  and  sectorspecific  research  to  maximise  the  potential  for   catalytic effect  without disadvantaging other businesses in the sector71.

Typically   the grant element is provided by donors or other philanthropic funders while DFIs or the   private  sector  supply  the  loan  itself.  Blended  finance  can  be  used  for  a  range  of   development  objectives  with  recent  high  profile  projects  in  the  infrastructure  and  clean   energy sectors. It can be  however  equally as relevant for increasing access to finance for   SMEs.                  68 Irwin  D. and Porteous  D.

Many   donors are further increasing their exposure in this space. The EC  for example  has set   up an EU Platform for blending in external cooperation  dedicated to facilitating the scaling   up of blended resources. There is little evidence to date  however  on how effective this   funding has been in achieving development objectives and  in particular  in addressing the   SME  financing  gap.  As  a  result   consistent  and  transparent  mechanisms  for  measuring   impact should be a focus of implementing partners.       So what works? While it is too early to consider specific features  the following issues   should be considered when designing a programme      Table 11  Blended Finance – What works?

Overview  Over the last few years  we have seen a proliferation of low cost  technology   based financial products and platforms. By addressing some of the key constraints to the   growth of SME finance  Fintech has huge potential to impact SMEs globally.      Largely  emerging  as  a  response  to  the  recent  financial  crisis  and  the  advancement  of   technology   the  FinTech  industry  has  grown  rapidly.76  At  present   representation  in  the   developing world is relatively small  however  based on the speed at which many countries   have adopted advances such as mobile money technology it is expected that FinTech will   play an increasingly important role over the next few years. The core characteristics of the   sector are         Lending  tends  to  be  unsecured   which  benefits  SMEs  who  struggle  to  access     collateral based finance;     Investors have a higher risk appetite than traditional financial intermediaries;          Use  of  innovative  credit  scoring  models  (such  as  psychometric  testing77)   which     benefits SMEs and startups with limited verifiable information;       Speed (transactions approved quickly) and convenience (no need to visit branches   which  catalyses  ﬂows  of  capital  within and  between  communities  irrespective  of   distance);        Low cost base (no branches and less personnel) resulting in competitive rates and     can give providers a buffer against the higher risk loans that they underwrite;       Not  subject  to  the  same  levels  of  compliance  as  traditional  financial  institutions      though this might change as regulatory frameworks catch up;          Innovation  in  payment  systems    the  use  of  mobile  phones  (in  particular)  has   transformed the money transfer and mobile payments sector allowing companies   to make transactions through their phones or tablets and;          Increased competition as new providers challenge the role of traditional banks.     This  analysis  focuses  on  the  key  products  and  platforms  emerging.  Of  particular   importance  to  small  business  are   Marketplace  (peertopeer)  lending;  Crowdfunding;   Merchant and ecommerce ﬁnance; Invoice ﬁnance and supply chain ﬁnance. Technology   has also made a big impact on the collection of information  payment processing and the   credit decisionmaking process and this is considered in section 3.     Marketplace  or  peertopeer  lending  (P2P)  refers  to  the  practice  of  matching   investors and borrowers through online platforms  without going through a traditional FI   such as a bank. In the UK alone  $2.5 billion was issued by more than 40 SME marketplace   lenders  in  2014   with  $4.4  billion  projected  for  2015.  The  largest  originators  in  the  UK   include  RateSetter  ($457  million)   Funding  Circle  ($432  million)  and  LendInvest  ($236   million).78  P2P  allows  SMEs  to  access  funding  quickly  and  usually  more  cheaply  than   through banks. Investors benefit from the ability to diversify their risks quickly and cheaply   across a wide group of counterparties.     In developing countries  marketplace lending is growing  for example  AFB has started to   issue  loans  from  as  little  as  $100  to  both  formal  and  informal  SMEs  in  Kenya   Ghana    Tanzania and Zambia. The World Economic Forum provides estimates that 6080 countries   now have at least one marketplace platform operating or lined up to launch in the near     76 From 2013 to 2014  equity investment into FinTech companies alone has quadrupled from $4 billion to more   than $12 billion and this trend is expected to continue.

However  in spite of this rapid growth  total market share is still less than 1% of   total bank lending on a global scale.79     Crowdfunding  differs  from  P2P  lending  in  that  it   raises  small  amounts  of  money  for  a  project  or   venture rather than for a company itself from a large   number of people  again typically through an online   platform.  Crowdfunding  is  beginning  to  bridge  the   gap  that  traditional  somewhat  riskaverse  venture   capital  cannot  fill  focusing  on  innovative   early  stage companies.80     There are two main types of crowdfunding  reward   based  crowdfunding  and  equity  based  crowd   funding.  Rewards  based  platforms  provide   something in return for the money invested such as   the  first  versions  of  the  product  or  service  being   funded.  Equity  based  platforms  provide  backers   with shares of a company in exchange for the money   pledged.      Box 15  Kenya Climate     Innovation Centre     in     funding     Crowdfunding  has  been  particularly   successful   renewable   energy  projects.  In  2015   the  Kenya   Climate  Innovation  Center  (KCIC)    a   World  Bank  and  infoDev  initiative  —   launched the first support programme   for crowdfunding in East Africa. In its   pilot phase  the programme helped six   cleantech  ventures  design   develop    and  launch  their  online  crowdfunding   campaigns.      KCIC  with  the  technical  support  of   Crowdfund Capital Advisors (CCA)  has   developed  a  set  of  advisory  services   specifically  designed  to  help  local   green  ventures  conduct  effective   crowdfunding  campaigns  and  utilise   the   crowdfunding   platforms focused on African projects.     range  of     Crowdfunding websites have the benefits of creating   transparency and open communication by enabling   investors  to  engage  with  companies  over  time  to   monitor their progress and continue to support their   success as the company grows. The technology also   removes  geographical  barriers  allowing  investors  to  engage  globally  which  may  be   significant considering the large diaspora of many developing countries.

Managing  the  trade  credit  cycle  can  be  challenging  for  SMEs   putting pressure on cash flow management and ultimately liquidity. Delayed payment is a   serious issue for SMEs. The FinTech advances in this area are summarised in table 12.       Table 12  Trade and Supply Chain Finance – A summary of products.   Product     What is it?     Merchant     and e    commerce     finance     Small businesses selling their goods on   platforms such as Amazon  eBay or Alibaba   are now offered working capital lines and   loans by those platforms81.     Einvoice     management     portals     Evidence shows that if invoices are sent out   quickly  it greatly increases the likelihood of   getting paid  regardless of the credit terms.     Invoice   Finance     Online receivable ﬁnance companies now   allow small businesses to monetise   outstanding receivables quickly and easily.   Compared to traditional offline factoring    online invoice ﬁnance is ﬂexible tool and   quick.      How does it work?   Payment processors and ecommerce platforms can be   better placed than traditional lenders to assess the risk   of advancing money as they can view a significant   portion of daily transactions. The collection process is   also simplified as payments ﬂow through their systems   and processers can take repayments directly from   revenue received.   Invoice management portals (e.g. Tradeshift). can help   automise receivables management and streamline the   endtoend process. The timing of the payment    however  still remains at the buyer’s discretion.   Accounting software can be integrated within the   invoice ﬁnance platform allowing SMEs to apply for   loans based on the value of receivables. As the   application is processed mostly automatically  payment   can be received almost instantly. A transaction history is   built up over time making future applications even more   straightforward.     79 The paper produced by the World Economic Forum (2015) provides a detailed overview of the current   provision of FinTech instruments.    80 The World Bank paper (Crowdfunding’s Potential for the Developing World 2013) provides a detailed outline   of the potential of crowdfunding including a ‘crowdfunding readiness’ selfassessment tool.   81 Players in this field include Amazon  Alibaba  Rakuten  Paypal  Square Capital  iZettle  TelMex               35                                                                                                                  Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To          Supply Chain   Finance (SCF)     Unlike invoice ﬁnance  which usually does not   rely on the cooperation of buyer  SCF is   typically initiated by the buyer. Traditional   SCF involves a high degree of cooperation   between the supplier and the buyer. Formal   programmes allow suppliers the ability to opt   for early payment of invoices at a discount.     Traditional SCF programmes involve complex legal   frameworks and are only efﬁcient to operate at larger   scale. A FinTech solution offers efficiency at lower scale    making working capital accessible to the entire supply   chain by linking to an online portal.  SMEs beneﬁt from   cheaper cost of working capital relying on the greater   creditworthiness of their customer.     Evidence   The impact and effectiveness of FinTech as a development tool will become   apparent  over  the  next  few  years.  It  is   however   clear  that  it  has  an  important  and   complementary role to banks as a source of SME finance and has the potential to provide   a  costeffective  way  of  targeting  specific  sectors.  These  platforms have  the  potential  to   drive  economic  growth  by  efficiently  mobilising  and  channeling  savings  towards   investmentready  growthorientated enterprises in key sectors of developing countries.     So what works? In most cases  it is too early to tell. However  we have highlighted areas   below in which development partners could contribute to the growth in this sector        Support  development  of  regulation.  Regulation  is  currently  limited  and  support  to   regulators in this area could be key. In developed countries efforts are underway to   develop a selfregulatory framework through the development of trade associations.   The European Crowdfunding Network  for example  was launched in 2012 with the   goal of creating a regulatory model for Europe.       Direct  funding  of  marketplace  lenders  to  target  specific  areas  (could  be  through   investments or guarantees). For example  the EIB is planning to lend £100m to UK   small business through the popular online lender Funding Circle.       Support development of industry organisations.         Provision of TA. Development partners can support   the  capacity  of  providers.  For  example   young   FinTech  organisations  can  be  advised  on  how  to   scale  up  their  SME  lending  in  a  prudent  way  by   improving   techniques  and   portfolio modelling. TA can also be provided to SMEs   to ensure they are prepared and able to access the   new products available.     risk  management       Provision  of  tax  incentives  for  investment  –  to   encourage  ‘crowding  in’  of  commercial  investors   although this should be balanced with the regulation   requirements  that  this  may  entail.  In  the  UK   for   example  tax beneﬁts for marketplace investments   are to be granted as part of the ISA scheme.       Government  support  mechanisms  for  encouraging   the  take  up  of  alternative  financing.  Government   can  also  play  a  coordinating  role  among  private   stakeholders  and  facilitate  the  dialogue  between   private parties and public institutions.     Box 16  Crowdfunding.      Developed Country Evidence     Current evidence is limited  however    after  seven  years  of  crowdfunding   companies    the  Australian  Small   Stock Offering Board (ASSOB) shows   that 86% of companies crowdfunded   on its platform were still operating in   2012. This  contrasts with a ﬁgure of   40%  of  noncrowdfunded   (non  ASSOB)  companies  that  fail  after   three years.     Debt  crowdfunding  in  the  UK  has   demonstrated successes in providing   returns  to  investors.  Since  2007   investors in companies listed on U.K.  based Funding Circle have completed   ﬁnancing totalling over £156 million    achieving  an  annualised  return  of   5.8% with a 1.6% default rate.

In order for these instruments to work  access to reliable internet or mobile   data networks must be widespread.       Pilot Concepts. Donors could assist in piloting new concepts at the grassroots level      and help to scale workable solutions into larger projects that support innovation.       Explore  how  existing  development  oriented  structures  such  as  climate  investment     innovation centres may benefit from the platforms and products developed.       Provision of further research including specific analysis on how these instruments can     support specific sectors or countries.     36                                                                                                                  Topic Guide  SME Financing – How To          4.8     Summary Table     Financial   Instrument     Types of SMEs   effective for     Credit Guarantee   Schemes     Growth oriented but   collateral constrained   SMEs who have   struggled to access   formal finance     Credit/Equity lines   to banks/FIs for   SMEs     Growth oriented SMEs   in underserved or   illiquid financial   environments      Partner FIs committed to     SMEs.      Appropriate pricing to ensure     sustainability beyond donor   support.      Informed loan officers and   development of products   relevant to SME segment   (supported by TA).       Establishment of separate     legal entity after pilot stage.      Strong management team          Choose appropriate FI     partners       Ensure incentives in place to     channel funds to SME   portfolio       Ensure additionality criteria     upheld.

An  extensive   academic  and  policy  literature  has  pointed  to  socioeconomic  and  institutional  pre  conditions for sustainable financial deepening.     Macroeconomic stability  Lenders and borrowers are only willing to agree to longterm   financial  contracts  in  a  stable  monetary  environment.  In  the  absence  of  such   contract   parties  often  resort  to  foreigncurrency  lending   which  brings  its  own  problems  with  it    especially  in  the  case  of  borrowers  with  limited  or  no  foreign  currency  earning.  In  the   absence of such a stable environment  donors often step in with direct longterm funding   or guarantee schemes.  High monetary uncertainty  however  renders the proper pricing   of guarantees or lending rates difficult and ultimately prevents such donor funding being   replaced with marketbased funding.      Contractual framework  Creating  perfecting and enforcing contractual claims is at the   core of financial transactions. Institutions such as collateral registries (for both immovable   and movable assets) are critical  as is the ability to enforce claims effectively and speedily   through  the  court  system.  Many  of  the  interventions  discussed  above  depend  on  a   minimum  standard  of  contract  enforcement   including  leasing  contracts   which  rely  on   assets claims being enforceable in court.      Informational framework  Minimum standards of accounting and auditing practices can   reduce  assessment  and  screening  problems  faced  by  lending  institutions.    Similarly    sharing of borrower information through credit registries or credit bureaus can reduce non  performance  of  loans  and  increase  competition   as  it  allows  borrowers  to  accumulate   “reputation capital” in the form of good loan performance history.82 Effective information   sharing is also important for the entry of new players in the financial system.     Regulatory and supervisory framework  Designed primarily to foster the stability of   banks  it also has an important impact on the efficiency and competition of financial service   provision. Effective regulation and supervision can minimise the risk of bank failure and   the  costs  of  such failures  for  nonshareholders  and  the  broader  economy.  On the  other   hand  restrictive entry conditions and restrictions on activities can undermine competition   and reduce efficiency  with these effects falling mostly on SMEs.      The  effectiveness  of  the  different  interventions  discussed  above  rely  on  these  pre  conditions.  While  many  of  the  interventions  aim  at  reducing  risks   they  still  leave  (and   should do so) a residual risk with the FI  which will price it according to the environment   it  works in.  In  addition  to  this   demonstration  and  catalytic  effects  depend  on other  FIs   and new entrants being able to offer similar products and services.      The macroeconomic and institutional frameworks  however  also impose an upper limit in   terms  of  impact  that  one  can  expect  from  these  interventions.  Longterm  financial   deepening  is  related  to  the  underlying  fundamentals  in  an  economy.  While  donor   interventions  and  funding  can  provide  bridge  options   only  a  marketbased  financial   system can contribute in the longterm to the development of the local private sector and   economy. The ideal intervention is one that combines bridge funding with an impact on   institution building  as illustrated in the example programme in Section 6.      Having  a  high  share  of  SMEs  operating  in  the  informal  sector  can  also  undermine   interventions such as tax holidays or credits  as only formal companies can benefit from   them. In addition  these different constraints also undermine access to finance  as they   increase  the  (perceived)  riskiness  in  the  eye  of  lenders   making  access  effectively   impossible or prohibitively expensive.      82 There is an extensive literature on this – see among others Brown  Jappelli and Pagano (2013).                40          EPS PEAKS Helpdesk  Draft Topic Guide SME Financing        6  Recommendations and Conclusions     The financing instruments discussed are as diverse as the SMEs they serve.  As a result    there is no onestop solution for identifying the ideal financing mechanism.  Even within   countries  diversity between geographical area  industry sector and stage of SME growth   results  in  the  need  for  a  tailored  approach  that  addresses  specific  need  and  aims  to   overcome the key constraints faced by the target segment.  Any intervention should be   provided on the basis that it will be additional  catalytic and sustainable  thus minimising   market  distortions  and  donor  dependence.  The  broader  enabling  environment  is  also   critical to consider and any programme must work within the development of the market   system as a whole (see figure 11)      Figure 11  Market System for Financial Systems Development.83     This section will focus on the issues to be considered when designing a comprehensive   SME financing initiative and will go on to provide an example financing programme.     Know  your  market     In  the  context  of  the  broader  market  environment   the  initial   analysis should build on inclusive growth diagnostics to determine the key constraints in   the target sector. In many countries  for example  there is plenty of liquidity in the system   so funding itself is not the constraint and  in fact  additional funding will not help.  As a   result  the preliminary analysis must conclude that the intervention is justified.  Specifically   key steps in any diagnostic exercise should include                Identification of target segment highlighting differences within this segment (e.g.   industry type  stage of growth  management characteristics);   Identification of vulnerable stakeholders (e.g. women  youth) and issues faced;            Analysis of needs of target segment and key constraints to accessing finance (e.g.          availability of collateral  availability of financial information etc.);   Identification of key market failures that the financing tools need to address and   that might undermine the effectiveness of additional funding;     83  An  illustrative  example  of  what intervention  using  a  market systems  approach  might look like  and  a  more   detailed discussion on what works for market development can be found in Sinha  Holmberg and Thomas (2013).

Selection  and  design  of  appropriate  instruments  and  supporting  initiatives.    In   terms of the financial instruments themselves  we have highlighted best practice for each   in earlier sections and this should be considered when planning the specific design features   of financing programmes (an example financing programme is given in box 17).84     Questions to ask in this process include        Choice  of  instrument.  Would  a  combination  of  instruments  be  appropriate?  (e.g.   credit  guarantee  scheme  supported  by  a  policy  component  to  consider  broader   regulatory and supervisory issues).       Demand side issues. Is usage the issue rather than access? Is there a demand for   this  financing  instrument?  Does  it  address  the  shortterm  or  longterm  needs  of   the sector?       Partner identification. Are the proposed PFIs committed to and capable of working     in the SME sector?       Product development. In addition to increasing the availability of finance  will the   chosen  mechanism  encourage  the  development  of  products  and  services   appropriate to the sector?       Process development. How will the programme support delivery mechanisms and     process improvements such as improvements in risk management techniques)?         TA requirements      o  Supply side. Does the programme consider the training needs of FIs?   o  Demand side.  Will supporting TA or business development services to SMEs     enhance the effectiveness of the financial instrument?       Role  of  technology/innovation.  Are  the  target  segments  better  served  by  non  traditional  financing?  How  can  the  programme  encourage  innovation  and   development in this area?       Market distortion. Will the intervention meet additionality criteria? (i.e. will it only     make investments that private investors are unwilling or unable to make)?       Exit strategy. What are the plans for exiting the investment once the programme   has achieved the desired demonstration effect and private investors are ready to   supply substitute funds?       Cost effectiveness. How costeffective is the proposed instrument? In general the   greater the level of intervention the greater the cost and standalone projects can   be less costeffective than investment through larger programmes.       Coordination amongst donors. What are other donors doing? Is the planned scheme   targeted  effectively?  Is  there  the  potential  for  working  with  other  development   partners?     84 It is important to note that this a very simplified analysis and the real world will clearly be more nuanced   and complex. It does  however  illustrate how issues can be considered to develop a comprehensive initiative.               42          EPS PEAKS Helpdesk  Draft Topic Guide SME Financing          Sustainability  issues.  Is  there  the  potential  for  sustainability  beyond  the     intervention?       Working with the private sector. Is there the potential for leveraging private sector     investment?  How can the programme best encourage this?       Buy in from government.  Does the programme have government support?     There  would  be  significant  benefits  to  further  research  in  this  area  to  enhance  our   knowledge  on  the  impacts  of  SME  financing  tools  leading  to  improvements  in  the   effectiveness  of  support.  A  common  approach  to  measuring  the  success  of  these   instruments could be developed  (including a greater number of cross comparison studies)   allowing us to identify best practice in catering for the needs of specific target groups in   particular  (for  example  womenled  SMEs).  This  could  include  the  development  of   standardised M&E frameworks with specific milestones and benchmarks for different types   of  interventions.  The  coordination  of  donors  and  initiatives  such  as  the  SME  financing   forum  go  some way in  allowing  us to learn  from  the  sharing  of  best  practice   however    there is more that can be done.      Finally   the  adoption  of  technology  and  recent  high  levels  of  innovation  in  product   development has huge potential to revolutionise the SME financing sector particularly with   regards  to  the  supply  of  finance  to  SMEs   risk  management  techniques  available  and   mechanisms for accessing finance. As a result  development partners should consider how   they can add value in this area and work with governments and providers to determine   how these instruments can sit within the broader market system.      Box 17  Example Financing Programme     Country situation   Fragile state  underdeveloped financial sector  heavy reliance on agriculture    poor regulatory and legal structure  limited donor involvement in SME financing.     Focus market   Rural/agricultural market  banks and NBFIs have limited but growing presence in   SME financing market  MFIs present  no capital or debt markets  limited private sector investment.     SME characteristics   Small but growing SMEs (formal and informal). Lack of collateral resulting   in limited access to formal financial markets so heavy reliance on internal funding  womenled firms   prevalent  lack of financial management capacity or awareness of financial products available.       Key financing constraints   Access to finance particularly medium to long term to allow purchase   of capital equipment.       Proposed  solution   Strengthen  leasing  sector  and  provision  of  working  capital  finance.    The   following financing tools should be considered        Credit guarantee fund to FIs – targeting rural SMEs and encouraging FIs to expand product     range to include leasing products (with support of TA)       Direct loans/equity to leasing organisations combined with TA – strengthen the financial and   operational  capacity  of  young  leasing  organisations.  Encourage  development  of  sector   focused products.  Ensure competition between bank and NBFI providers in the market place.       Challenge Fund – to encourage innovation in the sector.  Challenge could be to banks and     NBFIs to develop new products or delivery mechanisms to increase access to finance.        Capacity Building – both demand and supply side TA to support capacity of FIs and ability of     SMEs to access finance.     Enhance  regulatory   legal  and  accounting  structure  –  programme  could  work  with  relevant   authorities to design and implement laws and regulations governing leasing transactions.  Or  could   tackle tax issues that can impact the effectiveness of leasing programmes.     Justification  Support will meet additionality criteria and has potential to have a catalytic effect   on the industry encouraging the crowdingin of private sector investment if successful. Enhancing   the  strength  of  banks  and  NBFIs  and  appetite  for  working  in  sector  also  improves  chances  of   sustainability and the likelihood of success of the exit strategy.                    43          EPS PEAKS Helpdesk  Draft Topic Guide SME Financing        References     Accenture (2015). “The Future of Fintech and Banking  Digitally disrupted or reimagined?”   http //www.ﬁntechinnovationlablondon.net/media/730274/AccentureTheFutureof  FinTechandBankingdigitallydisruptedorreima.pdf      AFD  (2012).    “Assessing  Credit  Guarantee  Schemes  for  SME  Finance  in  Africa”.
