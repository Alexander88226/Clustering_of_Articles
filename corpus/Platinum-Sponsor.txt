Morgan       Refuel  Morning break     Defining Digital the Treasury Way   Treasury has always been about data and much of that data has been digital   for years  so what exactly does it mean to talk about treasury digitalisation?   For  some   it  is  the  use  of  better  technology  (e.g.  Cloud)  to  integrate  or   replace  legacy  systems  with  realtime   straightthrough  processes.  For   others it is the application  of emerging technologies in robotics  and  real   time banking solutions to deliver the next level of efficiency and strategic   insight. And for others  the truly digital treasury is one fully integrated into   the  wider  business  information  ecosystem  in  the  company   enabling   enhanced decisionmaking not just around the core treasury mandate  to   optimise  financial  assets  and  liabilities   drive  cash  flow  improvements    process cash transactions and manage financial risk  but across the whole   company.

These are the areas of work whereby there are many inefficiencies   in  work  processes   much  paperwork   long  processing  lead  time   staff   performing nonvalueadd activities etc. The incentive for collaboration is   huge  for  these  players  as  this  is  part  of  their  digitalisation  journey.
