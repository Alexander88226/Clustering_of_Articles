Urban  data   business  models  are  not  well  understood  due  to  such   factors  as  the  maturity  of  the  market  and  limited   available research within this domain. Understanding   the  barriers  and  challenges  in  urban  data  business   types  of   model  development  as  well  as   opportunities   for   incumbents  and  new  entrants.  Therefore   the  aim  of   this paper is to develop a framework for understanding   and classifying Urban Data Business Models (UDBM).   This  paper  uses  an  embedded  case  study  method  to   derive the framework by analyzing 40 publicly funded   and  supported  business  model  experiments   that   address  pressing  city  challenges  under  one  initiative.   This research contributes to the scholarly discourse on   business  model  innovation  in  the  context  of  smart   cities.       1. Introduction      is  essential     The  paradigm  of  ‘Smart  Cities’  as  a  response  to   increasing  urban  population   environmental  pressures    budgetary  restraints   legacy  IT  systems   ongoing  city   developments  and  renewal   as  well  as  policy  and   rationales   for  bottom  up  city  engagement  and   participation  has  opened  up  new  possibilities  for   innovative  business  models  propositioning  urban  data   focused  solutions  as  a  response  to  pressing  city   challenges  and digital transformation imperatives  [1].   Here  we define ‘urban’ as ‘relating to a town or city’   [2]. Reviewing existing definitions of ‘Urban Data’ [3]   and  ‘Urban  Big  Data’  [4]   we  define  Urban  Data  as    data  concerning  one  or  more  town  or  city  spatial   region(s)  physical   social   cultural   political  or   economic  environment.  Thus   urban  data  is  about  a   town  or  city  region(s)  citizens   its  infrastructure   its   businesses   government  and  natural  environment  etc.   For  example   ‘Citymapper’  offers  wayfinding  across   several  European  cities  leveraging  such  sources  as   open urban transport data  in order to offer its mobile        app  based  solution.  In  recent  years   business  activity   has  focused  on  developing  pilots   demonstrating   prototypes with some offering commercial solutions to   cities.  However   the  sustaining  and  scaling  of  an   ecosystem  of  urban  data  business  models  has  proved   slow  and  in  some  cases  fraught  with  difficultly.   Compared  to  previous  Data  Driven  Business  Models   (e.g. through open data from the  public [5] or private   [6] sector   or  other  data  marketplaces)  the  context of   urban  data  heralds  specific  technical   sociopolitical    ethical  and  economic  challenges  etc.  Urban  data  may   be existing data that can be purchased  reused for free    or  even  generated  though  development  of  sensing   technology  or  crowdsourcing   initiatives.  These   processes  create  value  networks  comprising  of   different actors [7] which significantly add complexity   to  business  model  creation  [8].  Digitization  and  data  driven  innovation  or  ‘datification’  [9]  in  an  urban   context   to  overcome  additional   challenges.     therefore  needs     flavored     As  ‘data’  becomes  seen  as  the  ‘new  oil’  and  a   critical  source  of  new  insight  for  cities   policy   translating to research efforts in the EU has focused on   developing  a  marketplace  and  supporting  social   innovation  through  the  use  of  urban  data  through   various  capacity  building  exercises.  Thus   the  EU  is   playing  a  central  role  in  promoting   fostering   and   facilitating  economic  development  and  new  business   creation.  Some  of  the  most  popular  examples  include   federated  Living  Lab   like   OrganiCity  to  support  innovation  [10]  and  SBIR   (Small  Business  Innovation  research)  precommercial   procurement  mechanisms  to  promote  innovation  and   collaboration  among  entities   sectors   businesses   and   across  cities   regard    Governmental  funding  and  support  to  ‘market  make’   new  urban  data  ecosystems  by  funding  research  to   interoperability  and  encourage   address  standards    experimentation   to   exponential  growth  of  innovative  value  propositions.   In  this  regard   vendors  have  struggled  in  developing   sustainable business  models due to continuing lags in   standards    interoperability   data  models   IoT  and     innovation;  may     themselves     initiatives     [11].     lead     this     for     In          for     and     logic     suppliers     customers;     stakeholders;     the  major  benefits     Section  5  concludes  by  comparing  the  framework  to   existing work and identifying future research work.      2. Related Work          Weill  and  Vitale  [18]  describe  a  business  model  as   “the description of the roles and relationships among a   firm’s consumers  customers  allies  and suppliers that   identifies the major flows of product  information  and   money   and   to  participants”.   Osterwalder  et al. [19]  defined  a business model  as a   “conceptual  tool  that  contains  a  set  of  elements  and   their  relationships  and  allows  expressing the  business   logic  of  a  specific  firm”.  Despite  the  presence  of  a   myriad  of  business  model  definitions   there  are  few   central tenets that are common across definitions  such   as  value  creation   the   consideration  of  crucial  value  creating  activities   performed by parties external to the company such as   complementors    a   comprehensive approach to explain the value creation   logic  of  a  company  [20].  However   business  model   definitions  are  static  and  often  fail  to  give  a  sense  of   firms in action.       Analysis  of  business  models  gives  us  a  more   dynamic  sense  of  firms.  The  dynamic  perspective  is   key to identify a firm’s journey towards establishing a   sustainable  competitive  advantage.  However   the  two   widely accepted views – industry positioning view and   dynamic  capability  view  discuss  the  conditions  for   competitive  advantage  but  do  not  elaborate  on  the   journey  towards  it  [21].  Industry  positioning  view   proposes  a  truly  differentiated  position  within  an   industry  that  can  be  defended  to  achieve  competitive   advantage  [22].  Dynamic  capability  view  argues  that   such an advantage can only be attained by developing   competencies that are hard to replicate [23]. Moreover    McGrath  [21]  argues  that  business  model  innovation   moves for competitive advantage can neither be strictly   categorized as positional moves nor capability moves.   Also   in  the  dynamic  setting  of  technology  based   businesses  it is impossible to visualize the constraints   that eventually prove to be competitively important at   the  time  decisions  pertaining  to  business  model   innovation  need   In  such  cases    experimentation  is  the  preferred  strategists’  tool  of   choice   than  analysis.  Further   business  models’   evolution is path dependent – early experiments often   shape the future business model [21].   We also draw from the business ecosystems’ literature   for  this  study.  The  evergrowing  interconnectedness   associated  with the networked economy prompted the   research community to refocus on business ecosystems   [24].  Moore  [24]  explains  business  ecosystems  as  an   allegory  of  natural  ecosystems in order  to present the     to  be  made.     telecommunication  network  maturity   as  well  as   budgetary constraints by cities etc.     It  is  hoped  that  a  critical  mass  of  differing  urban   data  types  and  sources  will  unlock  new  opportunities   for urban data focused business models by establishing   network synergy in an urban data ecosystem. ‘Scaling’   is a crucial factor in realizing these opportunities as a   minimum  viable  business  case  for  a  vendor  could   depend on multicity/country takeup of an offering. In   this   and  multicountry   experimentation  by  vendors  is  needed  to  develop   solutions compatible across differing politicalcultural  environmentalsocial contexts.     regard   multicity     Despite  academic  debate  on  how  to  conceptualize   business  models   there  is  agreement  that  Business   Models  articulates  value  creation  [12].  Within  the   existing  literature   there  have  been  some  efforts  at   formulating business model dimensions  classifications   or  taxonomies  of;  datadriven  digital  services  [13]    concept  definitions  across  the  data  value  chain  [14]    business  models  for  open  data  [15]  and  data  driven   business  models  [16]   [17]   though  no  study  has   developed  a  framework  that  can  apply  a  consistent   language  and  lens  to  organisations  focusing  on  urban   data  solutions.  Such  a  framework  can  be  fruitful  for   researchers as an analytical lens in (1) identifying and   understanding  challenges  across  the  value  network  in   developing urban data business models  (2) identifying   opportunities for value propositions  and  related  urban   data   (3)   substantiating commercially successful types of  urban   data  business  models  out  there.  Thus   we  pose  the   following research question       business  model     combinations      and        RQ   What  are     the  related  value  generating   elements  that  inform  differentiated  value  propositions   and related urban data business models?        To address the research question  we case study the   EU  H2020  project  OrganiCity  [10]  and  the  40   experimental  cases  it  has  funded  and  supported  to   derive  an  Urban  Data  Business  Model  Framework.   These  cases  are  addressing  city  prescribed  urban   challenges   by  developing   innovative  urban  data   business  models through  open innovation   cocreation   and   in  some  cases  multicity)   experimentation methods.     realworld     The remainder of this paper is organized as follows    Section 2 overviews the related literature on Business   models   business  model  experimentation  and  existing   frameworks  and  taxonomies  of  data  driven  business   models.

[27]     Design science research  To develop a framework that captures specifics     of IoT driven ecosystems     companies     should  do  business        way   together.   Ecosystems  comprise  of  multiple  actors  working   together  that  contributes  to  the  ecosystem’s  core   purpose  despite  having  seemingly  unrelated  value   propositions.  Hence   the  business  ecosystem  view   includes  a  network  of  actors  unlike   that  of  a   conventional  value  chain  view  which  focuses  on   delivering  a  single  value  proposition  to  the  end   customer [25].  From an ecosystem point of view  we   next  review  frameworks  that  map  actors  of  business   ecosystems that are closely connected to the urban data   ecosystem. Table 1 has a snapshot of related studies in   domains where data plays a vital role. Hartmann et al.   [16]  framework  deals  with  data  driven  business   models.  Their  study  defines  data  driven  business   models as the  businesses with data as a  key  resource.   Though   Hartmann  et  al.  [16]  acknowledge  that  this   criterion  used  for  determining  whether  a  business   model  is  data  driven  or  not  is  ambiguous   given  the   ubiquitous  importance  of  data  to  all  the  business   models.  Moreover   despite  the  use  of  multiple  case   studies  to  cluster  business  models   the  framework   development   study  based   reasoning  to  develop  the  framework.  Moreover   the   framework’s  characterization  of  various  second  order   elements  leave  scope  for  redundancies  which  in  turn   translate in to multicollinearities between explanatory   variables  during  cluster  analysis.  Schmidt  et  al.  [16]   have  developed  a  similar   taxonomy  for  Fintech   business  models.  However    study  used   Hartmann’s  [16]  framework  for  representing  195   Fintech business models that were further clustered to   derive  6  clusters   when  put  together  represent  the   Fintech ecosystem.      Turber et al. [27] proposed a framework to map IoT   business  models  on  to  a  3D  space  with  dimensions   representing  the  who   where  and  why  of  a  business   model.  While  the  study  represents  an  interesting  way     inductive  case     lacks     their          and     (consumer/organization)     of mapping value creation across the ecosystem  it does   not  focus  on  capturing  various  intricacies  associated   with  value  creation   capture   configuration  and   delivery.       Engelbrecht et al. [17] too map data driven  business   models on to a 3dimensional decision tree. The three   dimensions (1) Data source (user/nonuser)  (2) Target   audience   (3)   Technological  effort  (high/low)  derived  from  a  study   involving ‘expert interviews’. The decision tree is used    to  map  33  data  driven  business  models  into  8   categories.  Like  Hartmann  et  al.  [16]   Engelbrecht  et   al.  [17]’s  work  helps  us  to  identify  the  higher  order   dimensions  central  to  a  data  driven  business  model.   However   unlike  Hartmann  et  al. [16]   Engelbrecht  et   al.  [17]  do  not  represent  the  granularity  of  sub   dimensions  composing    data  driven  business  models.   Final  Aya et al. [13] study on data services focuses on   service  interactions  between  customers  and  service   providers.  The  study  focuses  on  the  key  activities   necessary to understand data driven digital services  as   ‘Data  Acquisition’    ‘Insights   Utilization’ and ‘Service Interaction’ [13].      Based  on  the  review  of  related  literature   we’ve   identified the higherorder dimensions of an urban data   business  model  with  which  to  investigate  cases  to   derive a framework.  Although various Business model   ontologies  [19]   Matrices  [28]  etc.  identify  various   dimensions of a business model  we follow Hartmann   et  al.  [16]  approach  (which  has  been  utilized  by  IS   researchers  [26]) by focusing on the most commonly   cited dimensions of a business model [16]. Hence  the   higher  level  dimensions  of  the  framework  to  explore   consist of;  ‘Key  Resources’   ‘Key  Activities’   ‘Target   Customer’   ‘Revenue  Model’   ‘Value  Proposition’  &   ‘Cost Structure’.      We  have  adopted  a  value  proposition  focused   definition   the  business  models  empirically     ‘Data  Exploitation      for               Figure 1.             3.2 Case      OrganiCity  is  a  crossEuropean  funding   support   and  IT  capability  mechanism  for  experimentation  of   new  urban data  driven  solutions that  address pressing   city challenges. Its model is an ‘Experimentation As A   Service’  facility.  In  essence  it’s  a  federated  ‘Living   Lab’ infrastructure across several European cities (e.g.   London  Santander  Aarhus) with the goal of enabling   and supporting innovative urban data solutions ranging   from environmental pollution monitoring to new forms   of citizen engagement. It works with cities in defining   city  challenges  to  fund   with  a  core  principle  of  ‘Co  creation’ and ‘Real World Experimentation’ in funding   and supporting the defining of problems and reaching   solutions.  The  rationale  for  its  federated  multicity   support  and  ‘living  lab’  flavoured  principles  are  to   encourage  the  sustainability  and  scalability  of  the   solutions   supports   experimenters  with  a  toolkit  of  both  IT  capabilities   that can aid experimentation as well as privacy  ethical   and  methodological  guidance   in  carrying  out     emerging.  Furthermore      it     examined for this study. For instance  a company that   produces  sensors  to  measure  urban  data  may  not   qualify  unless they  include  data management services   in  their  offering  portfolio.  Thus   we  define  an  Urban   Data Business Model as a business model where urban   data is central to the value proposition. This implicitly   implies urban data is a key resource.      3. Methodology       3.1   Research Design       In the UDBM context  given its nature  we argue the   conventional  dichotomy  between  the  social  and  the   technical is problematic as technical and social choices   are constantly negotiated and socially constructed [29].   Therefore   also  given  the  exploratory  nature  of  this   study   an  interpretivist  approach  has  been  chose  to   address  the  RQ  [30].From  an ontological  perspective    this means that we investigate UDBM development as   a  complex  phenomenon  that  is  contingent  on  several   social  actors  and  activities.  In  order  to  capture  this   richness   inductive  qualitative  interpretive  case  study   method was found to be suitable [31].      Although  there  are  numerous  definitions   Yin  [32]   defines  the  scope  of  a  case  study  as  follows   “a  case   study  is  an  empirical  inquiry  that  (1)  investigates  a   contemporary phenomenon within its reallife context    especially  when   the  boundaries  between   phenomenon and context are not clearly evident” [32].   Hence  Case Study Research is a qualitative approach   in which the investigator explores a bounded system (a   case  in  a  specific  setting/context)  over  time   through   detailed  indepth data collection [33]. A ‘holistic’ case   study is shaped by a qualitative approach focusing on a   single  unit  of  analysis   whereby  an  ‘embedded’  case   study  involves  subunits  of  analysis  which  focus  on   different  salient  aspects  or  levels  of  the  case.  These   subunits  are  specific  and   for   answering the overall research questions [32]. Analysis   of  each  subunit  is  completed  ‘withinlevel’  before   ‘betweenlevel’ analysis occurs [32].      Inductive  qualitative  case  study  researchers  usually   combine  multiple  data  collection  methods  [32]  and   keep   the  data  collection  and  analysis  processes   flexible.  Multiple  sources  of  data  were  leveraged  to   “provide  stronger  substantiation  of  constructs”  [34]    i.e.  the  elements  of  the  framework.  In  interpretive  IS   case  studies   as  an  outside  observer   Walsham  [35]   argues  that  interviews  are  the  primary  data  source    “since it is through this method that the researcher can   best  access  the  interpretations  that  participants  have   regarding  the  actions  and  events  which  have  or  are   taking  place   and   the  views  and  aspirations  of   themselves and other participants” [35].     relevant  aspects     (2)               10%  mobility       Over half of the cases (52%) related to environmental   solutions  (i.e.  Education   Air  Quality   Vegetation    Sound   Water   Waste   Health)   12%  Social  welfare   (Housing   Security   Disabled   Health)   12%  multi  domain    (Parking   wayfinding    carpooling)   5%  tourism   3%  urban  planning   3%    Government procurement and 3% sport.    Forty  three  percent  had  an  IoT  based  experimental   element  (most  of  these  sensor  based)   whilst  the   remainder concerned mobile apps  web platforms  data    or innovation in hardware based data interaction. Many   relied  on  API’s   whilst  some  drew  on  social  media   platforms.      4. Validated Framework          In this section  we describe the validated framework   derived  from  an  analysis  of  the  cases.  We  use   examples from the variety of cases where necessary to   illustrate inclusion of the  subdimensions  though this   has been restrained due to the need for brevity. Details   of all the cases can be accessed through the OrganiCity   website  at  www.organicity.eu  [10].  The  framework   (Figure 2.) is presented as an appendix at the bottom of   this paper.       4.1 Key Resources        4.1.1 Data       In terms of ‘Key Resources’  both Engelbrecht et al.   [17]  and  Hartmann  et  al.  (2016)  distinguish  ‘Data   Sources’  as  the  ‘Key  Resource’.  For  Hartmann  et  al.   (2016)   this  is  classified  as  ‘internal’  and  ‘external’   data   whereby  ‘internal  data’  concerns  data  generated   through crowdsourcing  sensing or tracking  or existing   sources of internal data repurposed to deliver the value   proposition. ‘External’ data is data acquired externally   and  further  differentiated  by  such  factors  as  ‘freely   available’  data    ‘web   tracked’  data   ‘open  data’  or  ‘social  media’  data  etc.   On   the  other  hand   Engelbrecht  et  al.  (2016)   differentiated data source as ‘User data’ and ‘Non User   Data’.  However   we  argue  that  sourcing  the  data  is  a   key  activity   and  not  a  key  resource   whereby   Hartmann  et  al.   ‘data   generation’  and  ‘data  acquisition’  as  an  activity.   Instead   we  argue  ‘data’  as  the  key  ‘resource’  should   focus on the nature of the data the company generates    repurposes or procures through the activity. The nature   of the data as a ‘key resource’  can then be looked at in   terms  of  its  characteristics  for  delivering  the  value   proposition.  For  example   ‘open’  data  comprising  of   realtime  geospatial  pollution  data  may  be  procured   from the city and overlayed with geospatial mobility     ‘customer  provided’  data      (2016)  already  captures     experiments.  In  this  regard   OrganiCity  has  gone   through  two  open  calls  to  fund  and  support  over  40   European  ‘experimenters’  ranging  from  StartUps    SME’s  to  grassroots  movements  in  ideating  and   developing prototypes that acquire and leverage urban   data  to  deliver  a  urban  data  driven  ecosystem   thus   contributing  to  realising  the  ‘Smart  City’.  Many  of   these experiments develop or leverage IoT  mobile and   web apps  soft sensing interfaces and open data.     The  first  open  call  was  open  to  individuals    associations   organisations  or  businesses   legally   registered  and awarded funding for each experiment of   up  to  60k  euro  as  well  as  support  and  resources.   Evaluation  of  proposals  for  ‘experimentation’  was  by   the  ‘OrganiCity  Experiment  Evaluation  Committee   (EEC)’.  This  committee  consisted  of  two  external   experts   an  OrganiCity  Technical  team  member  and   one  representative  for  each  cluster  city  (Aarhus    London  Santander). Proposals were evaluated in terms   of  the  novelty   impact  and  feasibility  of  the  idea  and   the  experimentation  proposed   with  cocreation   expected   experimentation.   ‘Experiments’ or ‘experimentation’ was understood in   terms  of  planning   staffing   cocreation  activities    testing  prototyping and evaluation and reporting. Each   Experiment Group had an appointed Experiment Lead    who  coordinated  the  group  and  was  responsible  for   providing feedback to OrganiCity [10].     pillar     the     as     of          the  40  experimenters      3.3 Data Collection      In casestudying OrganiCity  we’ve interviewed over   30  of   interviewed  city   stakeholders  across  London  (N  =  8)   as  well  as    collected  and  analyzed  experimenter  documents    reports   blogs   and  publicly  available  information   as   well  as  city  policy  strategies  and  OrganiCity  reports.   This helped us to understand both (1) OrganiCity and   (2) the ecosystem of organisations and their journey of   experimentation in developing the solutions.  The data   collected and thematically analysed contributes to our   understanding  of  a  European  urban  data  driven   ecosystem  and the development of urban data business   models.     Upon  initial  analysis  of  the  experimental  cases   we   identified 27 of the 40 experimenters were SME/Start  up’s  and  the  rest  related  to  NGO’s   grassroots   initiatives   academic  projects  or  multistakeholder   partnerships. We included all cases as they could offer   us insights into the data resources being leveraged  the   technologies  being  developed   and  the  key  activities   undertaken to deliver solutions. Furthermore  although   some  of  the  experiments  were  notforprofit  social   innovation  focused  organisations   they  still  wished  to   sustain the solution.               to     the     levels      traffic      realtime     airpollution     resources  suggest     ‘Data  on  Site’  proposes  new  ways  for  citizens  to   interact and submit data  about the city.  ‘Government’   data relates to data about city governance and council   activities  and  processes   as  was  the  case  for  ‘Spend   Network’ who drew on open data to offer insight into   public  sector  sending.  ‘Cultural’  data  refers  to  data   about  history   events  social  activities  etc. in the  city    such  as  for  ‘Walks  in  the  City’  developed  a  map  to   recommend  places  and  spaces’  for  senior  walkers.   Finally   ‘Mobility’  relates   travel  and   wayfinding  related  data  in  the  urban  context.  For   example   ‘Traffic  controlled  by  air  quality’   which   aimed to improve movement  of traffic to  improve air   quality levels.      4.1.2 Hardware and Software     Not only will the nature of data needed to deliver the   value  proposition  have  implications  for  resources  and   activities  of  an  organization   but  the  hardware  and   software   type  of  value   proposition  an  organization  offers   whether   in   capturing  data  and  delivering  data  or  insights.  For   example  to offer a city and its citizens ‘analytics as a   service’  of   an   organization may require; (1) installing IoT (Internet of   Things) ‘hardware’ ‘sensors’ on assets across the city   in  order  to  ‘capture’  data   (2)  a  ‘hardware’  ‘user   interface’  combined  with  ‘app  based’  ‘software’   installed   to  ‘deliver’   ‘descriptive’  insights  to  citizens   as  well  as  (3)   ‘browser  based’  ‘software’   to  ‘deliver’   ‘predictive’ insights to city officials.          Thus   we  further  differentiate  ‘Key  Resources’  in   terms  of  ‘Hardware’  and  ‘Software’  needed   to   ‘Capture’  data   and  ‘Deliver’  data  and/or  insights   through the value proposition. Whilst Engelbrecht et al.   (2016)   in   distinguishing data driven business  models  this study   proposes both ‘Key Resources’ (in terms of Hardware   & Software)  and Key Activities elucidates how urban   data business models are identified. Therefore  in terms   of hardware  a ‘Sensor Device’ such as an IoT device   may be used to capture ‘objective’ noise levels across   the  city   such  as  with  the  Belgium  organisation    ‘Sensifai’. A ‘User Interface’ may be installed for the   public to capture ‘subjective’ views of sound levels by   citizens  and then aggregated  analyzed and visualized   in  delivering  prescriptive  recommendations  to  city   officials  through  a  hardware  ‘User  Interface’   and   delivered  to  citizens  through  an  ‘App  Based’  mobile   software  program.  For  example   ‘Research  X  Design’   (Data  on  Site)  developed  a  toolkit  solution  for  public   participation   whereby  voting  hardware  and  software   devices are installed on city assets. ‘Empati’ designed     identify  ‘technological  effort  required’     in  public  places     in  order     in  order     to      ‘Verocity’   whether     data  generated  by  IoT  sensors   in  order  to  deliver   descriptive  insights  about  the  relationship  between   traffic and pollution. Importantly  the characteristics of   the data has a bearing on such aspects as the resources   and capabilities needed to leverage the data  as well as   wider sociopolitical  factors on its collection and use.   For  example   generating  real  time  data  may  require   greater  storage   could  have  higher  telecommunication   costs   additional  processing  and  analyzing  capability    and  may  not  be  suitable  to  generate  through  low   powered  sensor  devices.  Auditory  or  visual  data  may   involve additional privacy and security considerations    whilst open data may have sustainability concerns if a   business  is  reliant  on  data’s  updating  and  longevity   [36]  etc.  In  all  we  found  data  could  be  characterized   according   ‘Real  Time’   streaming  data  or  near  ‘Real  Time’  data  (data  sensed   and  uploaded  very  frequently)   and  ‘Historical’  data    all  other  data.  For  example   several  experiments   provided near ‘Real Time’ data by using low powered   sensors   rather  than  ‘Real  Time’  streaming.  The   ‘Variability’ of data was also a consideration  whereby   ‘Static’  data  refers  to  data  unlikely  to  change  over   time. For example  data on the location of assets in the   city  or ‘Dynamic’ data  which is data that is likely to   change  and  thus  requires  frequent  measurement.  For   example   Spendnetwork  drew  on  both  ‘Static’  and   ‘Dynamic’ open data to offer insights to city councils.   Data  may  also  have  variety   term  of  being   ‘Subjective’ or ‘Objective’. ‘Subjective’ data refers to   ‘user  input’  based  data  such  as  with  the  case  of   ‘Tranquil  City’  where  citizens   identified  tranquil   spaces in the city  or ‘Objective’ data such as ‘iCycle’   (IoTee lab) which use IoT to measure the fill levels of   bottle  banks.  The  type  of  data   ‘Auditory’   ‘Textual’    ‘Visual’  or  ‘Numerical’  was  also  an   important   distinction  in  the  proposed  solution  offered   and  the   resources and activities needed to capture and the data   and  deliver   the  solution.  For  example   citizens   ‘Textual’ annotation of  IoT sensed ‘Numerical’ data is   used  by   ‘Objective’  and   ‘Subjective’  air  quality  levels.  Finally   we  distinguish   the ‘Domain’ of urban data in terms of ‘Environment’    ‘Mobility’    ‘Citizens’    ‘Infrastructure’    example    ‘Infrastructure’ data relates to urban spaces and places   and  facilities  in  the  city  including  buildings   parks    power supplies etc. This may relate to unused or vacant   spaces  in  the  city   such  as  is  the  solution  from  the   social  enterprise   ‘Space  Engagers’.  ‘Environmental’   data refers to data about the natural environment of the   city  such  as  air  and  water   wildlife   or  even  soil  and   grass  such  as  the  case  of  experimenters  ‘Green  Roof   Monitoring’.  ‘Citizens’  data  refers  to  any  data  about   citizens  or  communicated  by  citizens.  For  example      ‘Government’.     to  combine     ‘Business’      ‘Cultural’      ‘Camon’     For     in               and     and/or     (cleaning      ‘Analysis’     structuring     abstraction.     ‘preparing’      report  patterns  &     ‘transforming’(converting        ‘Data  Exploitation’  aims     mobile flower pot style interfaces to place in city parks   to gather subjective feelings of citizens.      4.2 Key Activities          Following Rizk et al. (2018)  we propose that ‘Data   Acquisition’ is a key activity whereby an organization   draws on; (1) hardware or software  resources such as   ‘sensors’  ‘trackers’ or ‘User based input’ interfaces to   ‘generate’  data   (2)  software  resources  to  ‘procure’   either ‘Open’ or ‘Proprietary’ data  or (3) existing data   resources internal to the organization  i.e. ‘Repurpose’.     We  further  distinguish   ‘Data  Exploitation’  [13]  and   ‘Data  Visualization’  as  subdimensions  of  ‘Key   Activities’.   to  create   additional  value  from  the  data  through   ‘processing’    ‘analyzing’ and ‘simulating’ data. By ‘processing’ we   mean   etc.)    ‘aggregating’ (combining datasets or different types of   datasets)   or   modifying) data [37]  which is a lower degree of data   exploitation   and   ‘Simulation’ are  a  higher level  of  ‘Data  Exploitation’   aiming at extracting knowledge i.e. insights (Rizk et al.   2018).  These  can  be  classified  as  ‘descriptive’   (summarize  or   relationships)    ‘predictive’  (analyses  data  to  make  predictions)   ‘or   ‘prescriptive’  (identifies  options  or  recommends)   insights [16]. ‘Simulation’ refers to the recreation of a   complex system to run various ‘what if’ scenarios  and   assess the behavior of the actual system.         Finally   ‘Data  Visualisation’  [38]  concerns  the   activity  with  which   the  exploited  data  may  be   presented   the  end  use.  Converting  complex   information into visually engaging charts and images is   a very niche value proposition few firms specialize in.   Usually  firms couple the visualization capability with   other  key  activities  such  as  analytics  rather  than   offering it  standalone.  ‘Edinburgh  CitySounds’ is  one   such  experiment  selected  for  the  second  phase  of   OrganiCity.  The  experiment  captures  sounds  by   installing  ‘Auditory’  data  ‘Sensor’  Devices  (AASs)   across the city. These AASs will capture short clips of   ultrasonic  and  audible  noises  of  bats   birds  and  other   wildlife  traffic  and human activity in real time. These   sounds inturn are combined with other data sets such   as  light   temperature   humidity   pollution  to  answer   questions pertaining to the impact of human activity on   animal  behavior   changes  in  human/animal  behavior   with  exogenous  variables  etc.  It  is  imperative  for   Edinburgh  CitySounds  to  develop  visual  standards  to   represent  these  seemingly  unstructured   inconsistent    incoherent  data  sets   in  doing  so  greatly  enhance  the   utility of the final offering.         to          as     for     and     seen     other     citizens      citizens      businesses     businesses      stakeholders.  Often     4.3 Target Customers      The basic premise of an OrganiCity experiment is to   tackle  an  urban  challenge.  Consequently    the   experimenters  would  look  to  deliver  to  any  one  or   more  stakeholders  in  an  urban  setting.  Stakeholders   such   city   councils/governmental  organizations  could  all  be  the   key  customers  for  experimenters.  Moreover   unlike   traditional  businesses   that  mostly  focus  on  one   customer  segment  at  a  time   business  models  in  an   urban setting have a more complex interwoven nature   with   are   various   experimenters   that  deal  with  multiple  customer   segments at the same time. This is also seen as a way   of  achieving   larger  market  needed  for  eventual   viability of the business model.   Green  roof  monitoring   an  Oslo  based  experiment   is   an  example  for  operating  in  multiple  target  customer   segments.  It  offers  multisensorial  monitoring  of   vegetation   the   municipality.  Another  experimenter   ‘Leapcraft’   a   sensing  platform  to  measure  air  quality  has  the  city   council as a target customer.       4.4 Revenue Models   As  discussed  earlier   most  of  these  experimenters  are   still  in  the  process  of  discovering  stable  revenue   streams.  Some  of  these  experiments   in  their  current   state   only  lend  support  to  the  experimenting  firm’s   other  businesses  without  generating  any  revenues   themselves.  Moreover   revenue  models   like  other   business  model  components   are  prone  to  frequent   changes. We have observed 6 different revenue models   adopted  or  planned  by  experimenters  to  extract  value   from  their  offerings   Asset  sale   Usage  fee   Leasing    Licensing   Subscription   fee  and   Advertising fee.  For instance   ‘Wayfindr’  provides its   customers consultation for setting up audio navigation   services and charges a (usage) fee. While  ‘Airpublic’   provides insights on the air quality to the city councils   that subscribe to its services. FSTR licenses the use of   its  carpooling  application  to  businesses  which  in  turn   make it available for their employees.    Further into each of these revenue models is the actual   pricing  mechanism  for  services  and/or  products.   Osterwalder’s  (2004)  three  broad  characterizations  of   pricing  mechanisms  –  fixed   differential  and  market   based  have  been  used  by  experimenters.  Predictably    most  of  the  experimenters  that  deal  in  the  B2B  and   B2G  segments   owing   lack  of   bargaining power while dealing with larger businesses    have  been  playing  the  role  of  price  taker  rather  than   price maker. It has also been observed that the only a   handful of experimenters with IP protected assets were   able to take the lead and set prices.      fee   Brokerage     their  relative     to          that  most  of        4.5 Cost Structure      On the continuum of value driven to cost driven  we   have  observed   the  OrganiCity   experimenters  are  aligned  closer  to  value  driven   extreme. It could be due to an emphasis on innovative   and novel solutions rather than cost effective solutions   by  the  reviewers.  Having  said  that   there  are  a  few   experimenters who are focused on delivering solutions   in a costeffective way.       Empati  and  Leapcraft  are  examples  of  cost  driven   experimenters.  Each  one  of  them  deliver  solutions   seeking  to  capture  a  market  by  offering  a  lower  cost   solution.  For  example   Leapcraft  seeks  to  lower  the   cost of measuring air pollution and increase spread by   developing  mobile  based  air  quality  sensors  that   traverse  the  city  on  vehicles.  Besides   OrganiCity  is   created  as  a  platform  to  facilitate  experimentation.   Facilitating  experimentation   includes  minimizing   overheads  needed  to  run  these  experiments.  By   providing  technical  expertise   a  legal  framework  and   access  to  data  sets   the  platform  has  provided  a   frictionless  environment  for  innovation.  However    since  all  the  experimenters  have  common  access  to   these  facilities   we  have  not  delved  deep  in  to  these   provisions/factors  as  they  do  not  distinguish  between   experiments.      5. Conclusion & Future Work          This study has presented a framework of Urban Data   Business  models   defined  as  a  business  model  where   urban data is the central to the value proposition. We   analyzed  40  urban  data  focused  experimental  cases   under  the  umbrella  of  the  EU  H2020  OrganiCity  to   inductively  derive  the  framework.  The  framework   composes  5  higher  level  dimensions  based  on  the  6   dimensions  we  identified  from  the  literature  review.   Through the exercise of developing the framework  we   determined that ‘Value Proposition’ will logically flow   from other higher level dimensions of the framework    and  thus  was  not  included  in  the  final  framework.  In   otherwards  ‘data’ or resulting ‘knowledge’ or ‘insight’   is reflected through the activities a business undertakes   to  exploit  and  visualize  the  data   and  thus  captured   through  the  framework.  This  also  avoids  the  problem   of  multicollinearity  which  would  affect  subsequent   clustering of business model types  when applying the   framework.       Through  the  analysis  of  cases   we  determined  that   ‘Key  Resources’  should  compose  of  both  urban  data   capturing  and  delivering  hardware  and  software   as   these  were  a  core  offering  of  many  of  the  cases  we   explored.  Comparing  the  existing  literature  this  is          thereby  making     implicitly to referred by [13] as product or application   based ‘Service Interaction’  by [17] as ‘Technological   effort’   and  by  Hartmann  et  al.  [16]  through  sub  dimensions of ‘data sources’ and ‘data generation’.      As  a  result  of the literature  review   the  variables in   our framework have carefully been identified to avoid   inter  variable  redundancies    the   framework  amenable  for  developing  a  taxonomy  of   urban  data  business  models.  For  example   we  argue   that sourcing the data is a key activity  and not a key   resource   whereby  Hartmann  et  al.  (2016)  already   captures  ‘Data  Generation’  and  ‘Data  Acquisition’  as   an  activity  in  addition  to  capturing  these  through  the   ‘key sources’ that he distinguishes.       As  touched  on  in  the  introduction   we  believe  the   framework can  be  useful  for researchers  allowing the   applying  of  an  analytical  lens  in  (1)  understanding   challenges  across  the  value  network  in  developing   urban   identifying   opportunities for  value propositions and  related  urban   data   (3)   substantiating the types of urban data business models.   Furthermore   the  Framework  may  be  drawn  on  by   practitioners  in  assessing  proposals  for  funding  and   support   including  viability  in  the  context  of  the   funding  and  the  challenges  with  which  to  develop  a   solution.      The  next  stage  of  the  study  will  be  to  apply  the   framework  to  OrganiCity  supported  cases  to  cluster   and  classify  business  models  types.  We  furthermore   plan  to  apply  the  framework  to  existing  businesses   which have  already  established  a  sustainable  business   model to identify trends in the industry.
