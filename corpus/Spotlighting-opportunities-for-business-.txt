Rubenstein Fellow Africa Growth Initiative Brookings Institution Chairman Global Network for Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ProsperityAfrica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s potential as a growth market for business remains both underestimated and misunderstood\\xe2\\x80\\x94as does the potential for business to play a transformative role in solving the continent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s biggest challenges. Consider one question How many companies in Africa earn annual revenues of $1 billion or more? Most global executives and academics we speak with guess there are fewer than a hundred. Many answer \\xe2\\x80\\x9czero.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The reality? More than 400 such companies exist\\xe2\\x80\\x94and they are on average both faster growing and more profitable than their global peers. Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fastgrowing population and markets present important opportunities for business in an environment of slowing global growth. At the same time greater innovation and investment from business is essential to meet Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unfulfilled demand for goods and services close the gaps in its infrastructure create jobs and decrease poverty. Here we describe the extent of the African business opportunities in key sectors and suggest steps investors can take to translate that opportunity into profitable sustainable enterprises.1  Five bold business opportunities Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s real GDP grew at an average annual rate of 5.4 percent in 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x932010 1 Acha Leke et al. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfrica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Business Revolution How to Succeed in the World\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Next Big Growth Market\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Harvard Business Review Press 2018) Landry Sign\\xc3\\xa9 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCapturing Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s High Return\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Brookings Institution.

After a slowdown prompted by the shocks of the Arab Spring in 2011 and the collapse of oil prices in 2014 Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth has recovered and its future prospects look buoyant. Two indicators from the World Bank underline the continent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promise. First of the 10 fastestgrowing economies in the world in 2018 six were in Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x94with Ghana at the top of the world ranking. Secondly in the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 2019 Doing Business index five of the 10 most improved countries are in Africa and onethird of all reforms recorded globally were in subSaharan Africa. The economic acceleration and improving business environment are underpinned by five longterm trends each of which is unlocking transformative growth in key economic sectors.Opportunity 1. A population that is fast growing and urbanizingAfrica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current population of around 1.2 billion people is projected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030. More than 80 percent of Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population growth over the next few decades will occur in cities making it the fastesturbanizing region in the world. At the same time incomes are rising across much of the continent generating new business opportunities in the consumer market.2 In total we expect annual spending by African consumers and businesses to reach $6.66 trillion by 2030 up from $4 trillion in 2015. These trends are spurring growing markets in a range of sectors where Africans have unmet needs including food beverages pharmaceuticals financial services healthcare and education. Opportunity 2. Africa is industrializingAn African industrial revolution is underway as manufacturers ramp up production of everything from processed food to automobiles.3 We calculate that African industries have the opportunity to double production to nearly $1 trillion within a decade (Figure 5.1). Threequarters of that growth is likely to come from manufacturing to substitute imports and meet burgeoning local demand. But there is also an important opportunity to grow manufacturing exports and make Africa the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s next great manufacturing center as industries shift away from China to lowercost regions. The ongoing revolution among industries without smokestacks such as tourism4  agroindustry and some information and communications technology based services can serve as a development escalator as these industries share three key characteristics of traditional manufacturing\\xe2\\x80\\x94exportability higher productivity and high labor intensity (See John Page\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Essay on Page 45).5 Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s current population  of around 1.2 billion people is projected to reach 1.7 billion by 2030.2 Landry Sign\\xc3\\xa9 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfrica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Consumer Market\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Potential Trends Drivers Opportunities and Strategies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2018.

Africa is pushing to close its infrastructure gap Poor infrastructure is one of the key impediments to investment and growth in Africa. For example nearly 600 million Africans lack access to the electricity grid. But while Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infrastructure still lags behind that of other developing regions significant progress has been made Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual investment in infrastructure has doubled to around $80 billion a year since the beginning of this century. That represents a big opportunity for investors and entrepreneurs with the imagination to help solve Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infrastructure challenges. Opportunity 4. Innovations to unleash agricultural and resource wealth Africa has long been known for its resource abundance in both agriculture and mineral resources. To date though Africa has struggled to translate these resources into shared wealth and sustained economic development. New innovations and investments promise to change that picture and create exciting growth opportunities for business. For example in oil and gas Africa is rich in unexplored highpotential regions and the continent has huge unmet demand for energy. We estimate that the domestic gas market in Africa will grow by 9 percent a year to 2025 by which time the continent could use up to 70 percent of its own gas.Opportunity 5. The potential of increasing digital and mobile accessSubSaharan Africa saw the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fastest rate of new broadband connections between 2008 and 2015 and mobile data traffic across Africa is expected to increase sevenfold between 2017 and 8 02022. Africa has more than 120 million active mobile money accounts over 50 percent of the global total; this has leapfrogged many people over traditional banking products (See Njuguna Ndung\\xe2\\x80\\x99u\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Viewpoint on Page 36). This trend will allow companies to improve productivity speed up transactions and access wider markets and could add $300 billion to the continent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP by 2025.Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual investment  in infrastructure has doubled to around $80 billion a year since the beginning of this century.Mapping the opportunities across Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s diverse countries and cities Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 54 countries are diverse in terms of population development levels growth rates and stability. While Nigeria has nearly 190 million people and Ethiopia and Egypt have over 90 million people each most African nations have populations below 20 million. Likewise nine countries make up threequarters of Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP and in 2030 three countries will represent almost half of the household consumption on the continent Nigeria (20 percent) Egypt (17 percent) and South Africa (11 percent). Many smaller countries however are growing quickly and increasing their share of continental GDP and consumption. We expect East \\x0cFigure 5.2 McKinsey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s African Stability Index pinpoints countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99  growth and risk profilesComparison of historical GDP growth rates to country stability rankings.1HIGH10Vulnerable growers make up 33%Stable growers  make up 31%EthiopiaHIGH8C\\xc3\\xb4te d\\xe2\\x80\\x99IvoireDemocratic Republic  of the Congo6MozambiqueTanzaniaRwandaReal GDP growth 2012\\xe2\\x80\\x9317 % CAGR3Burkina FasoTogoGhanaKenya SenegalCameroonMali420LOWSudanEgyptGabonAngolaNigeriaTunisiaEquatorial Guinea4Libya4BotswanaUgandaZambiaNamibiaMoroccoMadagascarMauritiusAlgeriaGLOBALSouth AfricaSlow growers make up 36%008162432VulnerableRelative stability ranking 20171 Bubble size represents country GDP estimate 2016.2 The index covers 30 economies accounting for 97% of GDP.3 Compound annual growth rate.4 Equatorial Guinea and Libya are plotted manually because of negative growth rates over this period.Source MGI African companies database; McKinsey Global Institute analysis.LOWStable8 1\\x0cAfrica and Francophone Central and West Africa to increase their share of Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall consumption significantly.  To serve a sizeable market companies must therefore shape a coherent geographic portfolio with prioritized countries and cities of operation. We designed one tool McKinsey\\xe2\\x80\\x99s African Stability Index to support businesses and investors to balance their portfolios (Figure 5.2). Three distinct groups of countries emerge from this analysis each accounting for around a third of Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP  Stable growers. These economies are relatively less dependent on resources for growth and are progressing with economic reforms and increasing their competitiveness.Vulnerable growers. These countries each have at least one of three types of vulnerability. Some such as Angola and Nigeria are heavily dependent on resource exports. Other countries such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo face security or governance challenges. Finally countries such as Mozambique are vulnerable to macroeconomic difficulties. For investors vulnerable growers offer promising growth potential but they also pose risks that need to be properly assessed and understood.Slow growers. This group includes Libya and Tunisia countries affected by the Arab Spring and Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s secondlargest economy South Africa. Investors will need to assess growth opportunities at the sector level or use their activities as a base from which to expand into other parts of the region.We also encourage investors to think about Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cities not just its countries as they construct their African portfolios. By the end of the next decade Africa will have nearly 90 cities with at least a million inhabitants (Figure 5.3). Rapid urbanization6 is one good reason why companies should make cities a central focus of their African growth strategies. Just as important though is the fact that per capita consumption in Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s large cities is nearly double the average of these cities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 host countries. By the end of the next decade Africa will have nearly 90 cities with at least  a million inhabitants.6 Eyerusalem Siba \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe New Urban Agenda and Demographic Dividend Investments for Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Youth (Brookings Institution 2018).\\xe2\\x80\\x9d8 2\\x0cFigure 5.3 By 2030 Africa will have 17 cities with more than 5 million inhabitantsAfrican cities by population in 2030 millions of people201520305 million  10 million>10 millionAlexandriaCairoDakarKhartoumOuagadougouKanoAddis AbabaNairobiAntananarivoBamakoAbidjanIbadanLagosYaound\\xc3\\xa9KinshasaAfrican cities by population number1+ million89545+ million1762015203010+ million352015203020152030LuandaGreater Johannesburg11 Greater Johannesburg includes the City of Johannesburg Ekurhuleni and the West Rand.Source United Nations World Population Prospect June 2014 revision U.N. population division; MGI Cityscope; McKinsey Global Institute analysis.8 3\\x0cWinning in AfricaAlthough Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s successful firms differ widely in their geographic and sector focus what they have in common is the imagination to see the continent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unmet needs as opportunities for entrepreneurship and the longterm commitment required to build businesses of meaningful scale. Indeed the fastestgrowing and most profitable businesses in Africa typically see challenges as a spur for innovation. Successful African innovators are also deeply conscious of the barriers to their businesses\\xe2\\x80\\x99 success and careful to build longterm resilience into their business models. Consider the example of Nigeriabased Dangote Industries which manufactures commodities in massive volumes and has made founder Aliko Dangote Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s richest person. Dangote has built a shockproof manufacturing model through vertical integration of the supply chain onsite power generation robust engagement with government and an internal manufacturing academy (see his viewpoint on his experience on Page 86).African innovators are often driven by a deeper purpose. They look at Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s high levels of poverty and its gaps in infrastructure education and healthcare and they do not see barriers to business but human issues they feel responsible for solving. Strive Masiyiwa chairman of the panAfrican company Econet Group remarked \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfrica is a continent with extraordinary challenges and it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a copout just to wait for governments to deal with them. If you see a problem then think about how you can solve a piece of it.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d For entrepreneurs ready to solve problems and innovate to meet Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unmet needs there is tremendous opportunity for growth. One example is Paga a Nigerian mobile money startup that has signed up more than 8 million users in less than a decade\\xe2\\x80\\x94and today processes $2 billion a year in payments. Other innovative problem solvers include Viola Llewellyn (see Viewpoint on Page 88) Joe Huxley (see Viewpoint on Page 91) and Adam Grunewald (see Viewpoint on Page 53). Africa has room for many more such entrepreneurs and investors. We hope you will be one of them.For entrepreneurs ready to solve problems and innovate to meet Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s unmet needs there is tremendous opportunity for growth.8 4\\x0cFigure 5.4 Global middle class growthAfrica is poised to be the next frontier for a thriving middle class with the region experiencing a 66 percent growth in its middle class by 2030 only falling behind to Asia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tremendous 140 percent growth fueled by South Asia.100%50%0% cificaP& aisA%04124%5%%5%6639%A fric aMiddle East  &Caribbean LatinAmericaNorth Americape  &  n tral  A siaEu r oeC500 000100 00020152030Source Brookings calculations.8 5\\x0cV I E W P O I N TDoing business in Africa My experienceAliko Dangote @AlikoDangote  President Dangote Group01.As an entrepreneur I have traversed the length and breadth of Africa from Cape Town South Africa to Cairo Egypt exploring the huge potential often hidden throughout the continent.The business potential of the continent is tremendous in various sectors including energy infrastructure agriculture natural resources and information and communications offering opportunities for entrepreneurs. For example with about 65 percent of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s uncultivated arable land Africa has the potential to ensure its own food sufficiency and be a major supplier in global food markets. Similarly the continent has the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest reserves of vanadium diamonds manganese phosphate platinumgroup metals cobalt gold aluminum and chromium offering opportunities for entrepreneurs in the mining sector.Africa presents many challenges to doing business but to those who are willing to learn and understand the intricacy of the region there are massive opportunities for growth and success. For example while infrastructural deficits look despairingly challenging to many I am inspired by opportunities and not discouraged by the challenges. The $30 billion of annual investment in power and energy needed in Africa may seem like a halfempty risky situation but I see a glass halffull of opportunity to meet unmet needs. Similarly the energy of youth bursting at its seams portends a binary action for good or for bad. I see a ray of hope in the former.The perception of risk often exceeds real risk and the doing business environment is improving rapidly in several countries. Real opportunity is based on how you perceive the risk as a halffull or halfempty glass. Understanding the local context will help to better realign actual and perceived risk. There is also progress on reforms to improve the business environment with countries such as Mauritius Rwanda Botswana Nigeria South Africa and Kenya all offering ease in doing business through conducive environments and incentives. Mauritius now ranks 25th in the Doing Business rankings compared to its former 49th rank and remains the highest ranked economy in subSaharan Africa. Rwanda ranks 41st Kenya 80th Botswana 81st and South Africa 82nd. According to the World Bank Rwanda ranks among the best globally in the Doing Business areas of Registering 8 6\\x0cProperty (ranking second) and Getting Credit (ranking sixth). In registering property Rwanda has an efficient land registry where it takes seven days to transfer property and costs only 0.1 percent of the property value the same as in New Zealand. Mauritius has among the least cumbersome business regulations in two Doing Business areas Dealing with Construction Permits (ranking ninth) and Paying Taxes (ranking 10th).That said policy uncertainty and regulatory inconsistency must give way to transparency and accountability in governance backed by political will to ensure and promote regional integration and backward integration.In sum Africa offers the world the biggest deal now and the continent is open for business but the mindset of entrepreneurs and businesses is important to appreciate and seize opportunities. It is time to refocus the lens through which we see the continent.Figure 5.5 Biggest business obstacles for small and mediumsized enterprises  in subSaharan AfricaAccess to finance remains the largest obstacle for small and mediumsized enterprises in subSaharan Africa. Among these almost 75 percent of the SMEs surveyed were financed by internal funds and only 10 percent used traditional banking loans. ot sseccAecnafinCourts0%%621%17%ElectricityoP r a c tic e s  o f ce  in f o r min  t he tit o rs al s e c t o rmp%119%8%7%%45%%4CPolitical instabilityTax ratesLabor regulaeducated workforceInadequately  Crime theft and disordertions1%2%nes i n g    li csn d   p e r m i tes i nB ussa2 %3 %Transportnsd nms aulatioustoe reCdtragorruptionAccess to land noitartsinmda xaTiNote Survey size N=13722 (number of enterpriseyears).

This is especially true in most of Africa. Ovamba which is often referred to as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfintech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d platform specializes in trade and technology. It was founded in 2013 and launched a successful pilot in Cameroon in 2014. Ovamba\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strategic focus is to offer businesses in the formal and informal sector shortterm capital for the importation of wholesale/retail goods and to support exportation of commodities such as coffee cocoa and cashews. The inspiration came to us when we observed how the underdeveloped business ecosystem was compounding the problem of access to capital. Applied technology especially in the finance and trade sectors brings the creative freedom of innovation to markets and demographics where traditional solutions are restricted by regulation leadership or understanding of the changing needs of businesses.Having noticed that banks and microfinance institutions were not closing the credit gap nor creating sustainable wealth we were inspired to take a multitrack approach and offer a combination of capital and business support (such as logistics and warehousing) deep analytics and alternative risk assessment algorithms. Ovamba specializes in culturally attuned innovations that respond to Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s varied ecosystem to fund businesses with the capital they desperately need to grow. We do this via mobile apps and online platforms that efficiently meet the demands of fastmoving small and mediumsized enterprises in ways that banks cannot. As one of the few providers of what we refer to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctradetech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d solutions in the market we have had a long honeymoon and have now expanded beyond Cameroon into C\\xc3\\xb4te d\\xe2\\x80\\x99Ivoire with more markets coming online.To date Ovamba has funded approximately 270 small businesses with over 22 million euros ($25.4 million). Some of Ovamba\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customers are on their seventh transaction. Some customers have seen their businesses grow almost 450 percent over an 18month period. Access to global suppliers has brought new diversity of products to the wholesale space. Demand for cocoa financing is up by more than 25 percent. New funding partners have been identified to satisfy this pipeline. Looking ahead 2019 and 2020 look very promising indeed. 8 8\\x0cWe have great optimism that small and mediumsized enterprise development in commodities exportation will continue to grow requiring banks to provide more than basic services. At present banks do not seem to be able to keep pace with the needs of these businesses. Ovamba believes this is an opportunity to innovate alternative risk models and financial services such as shariacompliant financing. These innovations are key to unlocking this new asset class. New asset classes along with capital velocity will go a long way to closing Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business credit gap which by some World Bank reports has continued to increase past $360 billion.  An improved investment environment and private sector performance will attract foreign direct investment into regions with a thriving trade economy. Excited as Ovamba is about having a head start in this new asset class we realize that illinformed policies heavyhanded regulation and prohibitive taxation could slow our progress and quell the inflow of much needed capital from external investors.Over the next few years we will focus on improving literacy and financial awareness in the informal sector because bettereducated business owners are a better investment risk. We have created a natural language chatbot that uses African languages to teach business efficiencies to customers who are not \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclassically\\xe2\\x80\\x9d trained in business in order to drive financial inclusion. Designing a paradigm shift for Africans to see finance as a tool for success is the prize and promise of fintech. Solutions such as ours that use artificial intelligence and behavioral metrics will have the most impact.In considering areas of risk instability in Central Africa is of great concern. Cyber security and corruption in Cameroon and its bordering neighbors such as Gabon will require constant vigilance. Also access to a steady source of blended capital will be required. Our main challenge is and always will be politics and the governments that are afraid of technology afraid of change and lack appreciation of the value of Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s private sector and growing middle class.We credit our success to our business philosophy. We do not view Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business challenges as a capital problem but instead as an ecosystem development opportunity. We answer the problem that is rarely articulated How can we build wealth and financial freedom for all Africans? The answer By combining investment trade culture and financial awareness into supply chains and the collective business consciousness.8 9\\x0cFigure 5.6 Africa tech hubs landscapeIn 2018 there were 442 active tech hubs in Africa.

The theme persists across all 26 fragile and conflictaffected states in subSaharan Africa as defined by U.K. aid. There are two big picture consequences. First development agencies and their partners with a focus on private sector development can neglect to deliver services where they are needed most. According to a 2016 CGAP survey of 19 financial inclusion donors in subSaharan Africa the highly fragile states of Chad Central African Republic and Somalia had only one active donor each.2 This means some countries regions and communities remain trapped within a humanitarian crisis paradigm. Second development financiers commercial investors and business leaders can misprice risk\\xe2\\x80\\x94adding a premium based on perception rather than the reality. This means capital is not being efficiently allocated. According to World Bank figures in 2017 excluding Ethiopia Kenya and Nigeria just 3.23 percent of all foreign direct investment in subSaharan Africa reached fragile states.3 This mean that in fragile states many investmentready firms are left without the longterm finance they need to survive and grow.This is not to say fragile states are not difficult places to invest and do business. Since 2016 FSD Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own increasing fragile states footprint in the DRC Sierra Leone Zimbabwe and for forcibly displaced people has had to weather a cycle of instability political (e.g. military coups new central bank governors) environmental (e.g. Ebola outbreaks mudslides) and economic (e.g. currency depreciation inflation). But the people entrepreneurs and investors in Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s fragile states are resilient and resourceful. The FSD Africa team has witnessed numerous examples of smart practices which help to mitigate risk. On the investor side locally born nationals who are better able to price risk accurately are particularly active; many accept that there will be arid periods when deploying capital is too risky and so switch to running their own enterprises; and many deals rely on financial innovation to hedge against risks.On the donor side some build a presence\\xe2\\x80\\x94people and platforms\\xe2\\x80\\x94which lays dormant when things are difficult but which springs into action when pockets of opportunity present themselves. Others complement their flyin flyout model with a permanent local lead who provides a depth of relationships and market intelligence to build and maintain momentum in good times and bad. As the world grows more prosperous international development practices will only increase in concentration in the leftbehind nations regions and communities. As a result the fragility agenda may slowly become the international development agenda. 2 Interactive Data on International Funding for Financial Inclusion in 2016.

We need to continue to challenge the prevailing humanitarian discourse that predominates in fragile states\\xe2\\x80\\x94that food shelter and security must be directly delivered by donors and that there is little room for private sector enterprise to deliver welfareenhancing products and services. By challenging perceptions of risk in fragile states we can start to build a more balanced approach to aid delivery for those people and places most in need.

Entrepreneurship needs to be nurtured which should start with diagnosing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cscarcest resource\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for enterprise development to maximize impact. Reliable funding is the lifeblood of any startup yet indepth knowledge of and experience in both domestic and international markets and managerial capability to run a firm of substantial size may well be far more important success factors than basic technical production knowledge.2 So how are the continent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s young populations and underrepresented groups supposed to acquire these muchneeded entrepreneurial skills?Africa is also home to one of the highest rates of necessity entrepreneurs in the world.3 Views on how to support necessity entrepreneurs are varied ranging from giving the poor money to make use of their existing skills to building firm capability to overcoming sectoral and spatial mismatches to help necessity entrepreneurs transition out of existing enterprises or change the sector and location of current employment.4 The chosen tactic needs to be based on effective diagnosis of the scarcest resource and the market failures to be addressed. In many cases microcredit and the provision of basic business trainings on technical skills can fail to generate meaningful impact on business performance of SMEs notably for womenowned businesses. While SMEs may have helped lift millions out of poverty through employment provided first time employment to youth and improved the wellbeing of SME owners they have failed to create the largescale and high quality jobs that Africa needs.5 At the core of the challenge to SME development in Africa lies failed labor market policies and skill investment strategies to match the skill needs of growing industries. If growth of small firms into medium or largescale enterprises is a measure of success most of these targeted microinterventions would best be viewed as extensions of livelihood support programs. Within these programs Africa needs the right mix of private sector development and labor market and social protection policies with clarity on which objectives are being promoted to improve targeting. 2 Based on in depth interviews with successfully large companies in Ethiopia Ghana Mozambique Tanzania and Zambia.

This priority should be reflected in governments\\xe2\\x80\\x99 procurement policies budgeting and engagement with social entrepreneurs and innovators as well as in the private sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s participation in inclusive business models to advance both economic and social returns to investment. Notably for communities of stakeholders who chose to support a segment of underrepresented populations such as women and youth a focus on the entrepreneur helps to identify binding constraints leverage key strengths and direct effective support. It is worth noting that women bring different sets of skills to labor markets; face different challenges within and outside their enterprises; and thrive in settings where a web of institutions and range of stakeholders promoting inclusion forming an essential component of women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cempowerment capital\\xe2\\x80\\x9d safeguard and promote their interests and address their specific challenges. The crucial ability here lies in identifying which skills and resources a woman needs to thrive in her given empowerment capital and in expanding and enriching the latter.Emerging evidence from psychology and experimental economics has advanced our understanding of effective pathways to best support womenowned SMEs. Notably for successful interventions to be transformative they need to move beyond basic access to financial and human capital and address central psychological social and skills constraints that women entrepreneurs face. Interventions which saw more transformative effects for female entrepreneurs have expanded capital and skillcentric programs with the provision of softer skills; agency leadership and mindset considerations; marketfocused programs such as training to identify new market opportunities; and genderlens investing to accommodate women participants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 schedules and provided free or affordable child care.  Finding lasting solutions to development challenges and creating a generation of entrepreneurs requires tapping into existing capabilities while filling gaps and scaling up successful pathways.6 Identifying costeffective pathways should be an agenda of high priority to guide policies and inclusive and sustainable investments.6 Ndidi Okonkwo Nwuneli (2016).
