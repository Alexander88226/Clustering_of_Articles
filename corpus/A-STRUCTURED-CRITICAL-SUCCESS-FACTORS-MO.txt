Accordingly Small and Medium Enterprises that make up the largest business sector of world economy need to be protected from  disruptions  and  provide  fast  and  uninterrupted  recovering  system. However while BCM has been in Malaysia for decade most of the SMEs have low  level  of  knowledge  towards  the  existence  of  BCM  and  its  importance towards their business organisations. They are also confronting difficulties in implementing BCM systemically. The success factors for the implementation of  BCM  in  SMEs  in  the  current  academic  resources  are  limited.  There  are objectives of this research intended to determine the CSFs and to describe the structural  relationship  between the  successful  BCM implementation on Malaysia SMEs. Based on literature review 16 CSFs were identified as Top Management Commitment and Support Industry Focus Key Stakeholders  Human  Resources  Cultural  Changes  Ownerships  BCM Organisation Financial and Budget Effective Communication Education and Training  of  BCM  Legislation  Participation  of  Facilities  and  Staff  BCP Committees  Awareness  Campaign  Leadership  and  Input  of  BCM Programme.  Expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  opinion  interview  through  Interpretive  Structural Modelling were sought to confirm the literature findings. The expert\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinion were also sought to develop the relationship between the CSFs by converting the  opinions  into  an  ISMbased  model  through  a  stepbystep  procedure  of developing  ISMbased  model.  The  model  revealed  that  Top  Management Commitment  and  Support  is  the  major  driving  factor  followed  by  Industry Focused Key Stakeholders Human Resources Cultural Changes Ownership and  Financial  Budget  respectively.  Input  of  BCM  Program  is  the  most dependent  factor  followed  by  Effective  Communication  Participation  of Facilities and Staff BCP Committees Awareness Campaign and Leadership accordingly. The BCM Organisation and Education and Training of BCM were deduced  as  unstable  for  having  strong  dependency  and  driving  power. Legislation was found to be disconnected because it does not influence other factors  much  for  the  successfulness  of  BCM  implementation  in  Malaysia SMEs.  A  feasibility  study  was  then  conducted  to  compare  the  ISMbased model with  the actual implementation  in  the aspects  of social technical and economic  aspects  hence  empirically  confirmed  the  established  ISMbased structural model. In summary this research has accomplished its objectives by providing  the  lists  of  CSFs  required  and  consequently  developing  the structured relationship model between the CSFs that is essential in developing the strategies for the successful BCM implementation in Malaysia SMEs.     \\x0c 10 ABSTRAK   Pengurusan  Kesinambungan  Perniagaan  (PKP)  adalah  alat  strategik penting  di  dalam  Pengurusan  Fasiliti  yang  dapat  membantu  dalam mengekalkan  kelangsungan  perniagaan  dan  memastikan  kemandirian perniagaan  semasa  bencana  berlaku.  Oleh  itu  industri  kecil  dan  sederhana (IKS) yang membentuk sektor perniagaan yang paling besar di dalam ekonomi dunia  perlu  dilindungi  daripada  bencana  dengan  satu  sistem  yang  dapat memulihkan  keadaan  sesuatu  perniagaan  dengan  cepat  dan  tanpa  gangguan. Walaupun  PKP  telah  wujud  di  Malaysia  hampir  sedekad  majoriti  IKS Malaysia mempunyai tahap pengetahuan yang rendah terhadap kewujudan dan kepentingan BCM kepada organisasi perniagaan IKS. Mereka juga mempunyai masalah  dalam  melaksanakan  BCM  secara  sistematik.  Kekurangan perbincangan ilmiah di dalam bidang akademik berkaitan PKP terutama yang menjurus  kepada  Faktor  Kejayaan  Kritikal  (FKK)  bagi  perlaksanan  PKP  di dalam  IKS  telah  mendorong  bagi  menyiapkan  kajian  ini.  Objektif  kajian  ini pula adalah untuk menentukan FKK yang terlibat dan untuk menggambarkan hubungan antara struktur FKK bagi mejayakan perlaksanaan PKP untuk IKS di  Malaysia.  Berdasarkan  kajian  literatur  menyeluruh  yang  telah  dibuat  16 FKK telah dikenal pasti bagi melaksanakan PKP di IKS Malaysia. Oleh yang demikian  sesi  temubual  telah  diadakan  bersama  dengan  pakar  PKP  melalui kaedah \\xe2\\x80\\x98Interpretive Structural Modelling\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (ISM) bagi mengesahkan dapatan kajian  literatur  yang  telah  dibuat  dan  seterusnya  membangunkan  hubungan struktur di antara FKK yang telah dikenal pasti. Hasil temubual telah diubah kepada  satu  model  yang  berasaskan  ISM  melalui  beberapa  prosedur  untuk membangunkan model berasaskan ISM. Berikutan hasil temubual Komitmen dan  Sokongan  Pengurusan  Tertinggi  merupakan  faktor  penggerak  utama diikuti  oleh  Industri  Fokus  Pihak  Berkepentingan  Utama  Sumber  Manusia Perubahan  Budaya  Pemilikan  dan  Anggaran  Kewangan.  Manakala  Input Program adalah faktor yang paling bergantung dengan kuasa kebergantungan dan  diikuti  oleh  Komunikasi  Berkesan  Penyertaan  Kemudahan  dan Kakitangan  Jawatankuasa  BCP  Kempen  Kesedaran  dan  Kepimpinan. Terdapat  dua  FKK  iaitu  Pertubuhan  PKP  dan  Pendidikan  dan  Latihan  PKP telah  disimpulkan  sebagai  tidak  stabil  kerana  mempunyai  nilai  yang  sama terhadap  nilai  penggerak  dan  kebergantungan.  FKK  Perundangan  tidak mempunyai  kaitan  di  dalam  sistem  kerana  faktor  ini  tidak  memberi  banyak pengaruh  terhadap  faktor  yang  lain  bagi  memastikan  kejayaan  perlaksanaan PKPdi  Malaysia.    Kajian  kebolehlaksanaan  kemudiannya  dijalankan  untuk membandingkan model tersebut dengan keadaan sebenar dalam aspek sosial teknikal dan ekonomi justeru mengesahkan secara empirikal model berasaskan ISM itu tadi. Secara ringkasnya kajian ini telah mencapai objektifnya apabila senarai FKK telah ditemui dan seterusnya dibangunkan satu model hubungan berstruktur  FKK  bagi  membangunkan  strategi  yang  berkesan  untuk perlaksanaan PKP di IKS Malaysia.    \\x0c 11   TABLE OF CONTENTS   CHAPTER TITLE PAGE   DECLARATION   DEDICATION   ACKNOWLEDGEMENT   ABSTRACT   ABSTRAK   TABLE OF CONTENT   LIST OF TABLES   LIST OF FIGURES   LIST OF ABBREVIATIONS   LIST OF APPENDICES   1  INTRODUCTION   1.1 Introduction   1.2 Research Background   1.3 Problem Statement   1.4 Objectives of the Research ii iii iv v vi Vii xii  xv Xvi xvii  1 1 2 9 12 \\x0c   1.5 Scope of Research   1.6 Research Methodology   1.6.1 Literature Review 1.6.2 Experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Opinion Interview   1.7 Significant of Research   1.8 Organisation of the Thesis    2  LITERATURE REVIEW   2.1 Introduction   2.2 Overview of Facilities Management   2.3 Extreme and Disaster Events 12 12 13 14 14 17 18  20 20 21 26   2.3.1  Definition  and  example  of  Extreme 28 Events 2.3.2  Definition  and  example  of  Disaster 30 Events   2.4 Business Continuity Management (BCM)     2.4.1 Crisis Management (CM) 2.4.2 Disaster Recovery Planning (DRP) 2.4.3 Business Continuity Planning 2.4.4 The Evolution of BCM   2.5 Critical Success Factors   2.5.1 Nature of CSFs 2.5.2 Techniques for CSFs Identification 30 31 32 35 40 46 48 53 \\x0c 13  2.5.3 Benefits of CSFs for Managers 54   2.6 Implementation of BCM in Malaysia Small and 55 Medium Enterprises (SMEs) 2.6.1 The Definition of SMEs 56 2.6.2  Preliminary  Findings  of  CSFs  for 58 BCM Implementation on Malaysia SMEs 2.6.2.1 CSFs Literature Compilation 59 2.6.2.2 Analysis of BCM 68 Implementation Literature 2.6.3 The Importance\\xe2\\x80\\x99s of BCM to SMEs   2.7 Conclusion   3  RESEARCH METHODOLOGY   3.1 Introduction   3.2 Methodological Overview     3.2.1 Research Design 3.2.2 Paradigms 3.2.3 Research Approaches 3.2.4 Research Methodology   3.3 Investigation One Literature Review 3.3.1 Content Analysis 73 78  82 82 83 83 88 90 93 94 95 3.3.1.1 Content Analysis Procedures 96 a) Step 1 Level of Analysis 96         \\x0c 14        b)  Step  2  Decision  on 98 coding steps c)  Step  3  Coding for 98 frequency of a concept d)  Step  4  Distinguishing 98 concepts e)  Step  5  Developing  rules 99 for coding texts f)  Step  6  Decide  on 100 irrelevant information g) Step 7 Coding the texts 100 h) Step 8 Results Analysis 100   3.4  Investigation  Two  Experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99  Opinion  and 101 Formation of ISMbased Model        3.4.1 Comparisons of structural relationship 101 evaluation models 3.4.2  Interpretive  Structural  Modelling 106 (ISM) 3.4.2.1 The Collection of Data 109 3.4.2.2 The Questionnaire 112 Distribution and Interview Conduct 3.4.2.3 The Analysis of Data 113 Steps involved in ISM 114 Methodology a)  Identification  of 114 CSFs \\x0c 15            b)  Structural  Self115 Interaction Matrix c) Initial 119 Reachability Matrix            d)  Final  Reachability 121 Matrix   e)  Classification  of 123 Factors f) Level Partitions 124 g)  Formation of 127 ISMbased model 3.4.3  Feasibility  Study  and  Respondent 129 Validation of ISMbased model 3.4.3.1 The Collection of Data 130 a)  The  Feasibility  Criteria 130 and Determinants 3.4.3.2 The Analysis of Data 132 a)  The  Design  of the 132 Feasibility Evaluation Form   3.6 Conclusions 133 4  ANALYSIS AND RESULTS ON THE BCM 134 IMPLEMENTATION   4.1 Introduction 134   4.2 Experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Opinion and Formation of ISMbased 135 Model \\x0c 16            4.2.1 Structural SelfInteraction Matrix 139 (SSIM) 4.2.2 Comparison of the Experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Opinion 145 on the CSFs for BCM Implementation on Malaysia SMEs 4.2.3 Initial Reachability Matrix 4.2.4 Final Reachability Matrix 4.2.5 Classification of Factors 4.2.6 Level Partition 4.2.7 Formation of ISMBased Model 4.2.8 CSFs Model Validation 155 155 158 161 167 170 4.2.8.1 The Feasibility CSFs for 173 BCM Implementation in terms of technical aspect 4.2.8.2 The Feasibility of CSFs for 175 BCM Implementation in terms of Operational Aspects 4.2.8.3  The  Feasibility  of  CSFs  for 177 BCM  Implementation  in  terms  of Economic Aspects   4.3 Summary 5  DISCUSSION FINDINGS AND VALIDATIONS   5.1 Introduction 179 181 181   5.2 Objective I To Determine CSFs for Successful 182 BCM Implementation on Malaysia SMEs \\x0c17   5.3  Objective  II  To  describe  the  Structural 188 Relationships  between  the  CSFs  for  successful BCM Implementation on Malaysia SMEs   5.4 Validation   5.5 Summary  6  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS   6.1 Introduction   6.2 Main Conclusion 191 196 197 197 198   6.3 Implications and Significant Contribution of 199 the Research   6.4 Theoretical Implications   6.5 Managerial Implications   6.6 Thesis Limitations   6.7 Directions for future research   6.8 Summary 199 202 203 204 206 REFERENCES APPENDICES AC 207216 217237        \\x0c 18  LIST OF TABLES   TABLE NO.

Evolving from the above matters as mentioned by  Haris  et  al.  (2008)  FM  in  some  Asian  countries  such  as  Japan  has  been accepted  as  an  important  area  in  business  and  the  techniques  of  FM  are increasingly being used.  This is due to the facts mentioned by Hill & William (2013) that organisations of all kinds and different economies around the world recognised  the  rising  costs  of  occupying  buildings  providing  services  to support  business  operations  and  improving  working  conditions  as  important factors in profitability and success depends upon reducing the costs of being in business.  The range of FM services is widely accepted as being broad and highly inclusive  of  a  number  of  functions  and  roles  performed  by  practitioners (Waheed & Fernie 2009) thus making it difficult to determine the boundaries and  to  what  extend  they  overlap  with  each  other.    According  to  Tay  &  Ooi (2001) in (Waheed & Fernie 2009) practitioners themselves struggle to find agreement on just exactly what constitutes FM.   Throughout the years researchers and practitioners alike have provided many definitions that explained and specified the objectives and scope of FM.  This  can  be  seen  in  the  sample  of  definitions  in  Table  1.1  on  page  3  which illustrates that the issues confronting FM are all related to both the core and noncore services that support the primary business of an organisation.     \\x0c Table 1.1 Definitions of Facilities Management 29 Author Definition of FM Tay  &  Ooi FM is  succinctly defined as the integrated management (2001) of  the  workplace  to  enhance  the  performance  of  the organization.  FM also has evolved from an operational noncore business support services function to a strategic FM position which supports and enhances both the core and noncore activities of the organization. Chotipanich  The support function coordinating physical resources and (2004) workplace  and  support  services  to  user  and  process  of works to support the core business of the organization.  Tucker  &  Pitt The integration and alignment of the noncore services (2009) including  those  relating  to  the  premises  required  to operate and maintain a business to fully support the core objectives of the organization.  Royal A discipline that improves and supports the productivity Institution of of an organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s by delivering all needed appropriate Chartered services  infrastructure  etc.  that  are  needed  to  achieve Surveyors business objectives. (2009)    International FM is the  profession that  encompasses  multiple Facility disciplines to  ensure functionality  of the  built Management environment  by  integrating  people  place  process  and Association technology. (2010) British FM is the integration of processes within an organization Institute of to  maintain  and  develop  the  agreed  services  which Facilities support  and  improve  the  effectiveness  of  its  primary activities. \\x0c30 Management (2010)     Based  on  Table  1.1  it  can  be  seen  that  the  common  theme  from  the meaning of FM are; (i) Integrated management (ii) both core and noncore or appropriate services (iii) to support the primary business and can be briefly stated that FM is an integrated management of both core and noncore services that support the primary businesses of an organization.   In order to relate Business Continuity Management (BCM) with FM Pitt  &  Goyal  (2004)  describe  BCM  as  a  new  discipline  that  its  root  lie  in information system protection and has evolved from a focused technical bias to a broader strategic organisational management such as FM.  As to further understand BCM better its definitions are provided below in Table 1.2.   Table 1.2 Definitions of BCM Author Definition of BCM Business The  act  of  anticipating  incidents  that  will  affect Continuity missioncritical  functions  and  processes  for  the Institute organization  and  ensuring  that  it  responds  to  any (2002) incident in a planned and rehearsed manner.  Council on An integrated set of activities and assets that is capable Corporate of  being  conducted  and  managed  for  the  purpose  of Disclosure and providing  either  a  return  to  investors  or  dividends Governance lower  costs  or  other  economic  benefits  directly  and (2005) proportionally to owners members or participants.  \\x0c31 Malaysian Management  process  that  safeguards  the  interests  of Standards its  key  stakeholders  reputation  brand  and  valueBCM creating activities by identifying potential impacts that Framework threaten  the  organization  and  provides  a  framework (2007) for  building  resilience  and  the  capability  for  an effective response.  Global BCM is the process by which an organization prepares Technology for  future incidents that  could jeopardize the Audit  Guide organization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core mission and its long term viability.  (2008)  Business A  holistic  management  process that identifies Continuity potential threats to an organization and the impacts to Institute business  operations  that  those  threats  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  if  realized (2011)  might  cause  and  which  provides  a  framework  for building  organizational  resilience  with  the  capability for an effective response that safeguards the interests of  its  key  stakeholders  reputation  brand  and  value creating activities.      Based on Table 1.2 the common themes from the definition of BCM are;  (i)  integrated  set  of  activities  (ii)  holistic  management  process  (iii) safeguard  the  interests  of  its  key  stakeholders  reputation  brand  and  valuecreating activities (iv) anticipate potential impacts and threats to organisation (v)  provides  framework  for  building  resilience  and  capability  of  responding effectively.   Emerging from the common theme BCM can be defined as a holistic management  process  that  safeguard  the  interests  of  its  key  stakeholders reputation  brand  and  value  creating  activities  by  anticipating  the  potential \\x0c32  threats to organisations and provides a framework for building resilience and capability of responding effectively.  As far as in the case of strategic FM is concerned BCM can be ideally incorporated in FM as an essential FM tool to ensure  an  integrated  management  of  both  core  and  noncore  services  that support the continuity of primary businesses of organisations in the times of disaster.   The  above  statement  is  further  supported    by  the  fact  that  Business Continuity emerged in response to the increased corporate realization that any disruption in the continuity of the business for an extended period of time will seriously affect the overall practicality of an organisation (Foster & Dye 2005).  As  stated  by  Moore  (1995)  he  believe  that  it  was  not  enough  only  by recovering  the  IT  function  the  business  needed  to  resume  as  quickly  and efficiently  as  possible  since  both  functions  of  business  and  organisation nowadays entails into numerous complex corporate objectives such as market share cash flow preservation of customer base and corporate image that need to be constantly met.       Business  strategists  need  to  simultaneously  shape  the  form  of  their organisations  as  well  as  the  working  environment  through  which  that  future can be achieved.  Tay & Ooi (2001) suggested that the facilities managers are best  placed  in  the  organisations  for  this  kind  of  business  reengineering  or strategizing as proven in many cases architects and suppliers of physical space were not able to link the process of designing office space with such strategies.  Hence business continuity plan (BCP) was introduced to assist organization in reengineering  and  strategizing  their  businesses.    The  inevitability  of  crises within the business environment suggests that the majority of the organisations should have a BCP (Pitt & Goyal 2004).   \\x0c33  However BCP is only part of the element that constitutes BCM as a whole.    As  explained  by  Jones  (2011)  BCP  is  part  of  a  BCM  process  that identifies potential risks and vulnerabilities and their impact on an organization as it provides processes and procedures for mitigating the risks and effectively responding  to  a  disruptive  event  in  a  way  that  safeguards  the  interest  of  the organisation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  key  stakeholders  reputation  brand  and  valuecreating activities. The strategic contribution offered by both BCP and FM appears to be  acknowledged  and  understood  by  the  theorists  academics  professional bodies and key stakeholders (Pitt & Goyal 2004).  Nonetheless  a  survey  conducted  on  IT  managers  revealed  that  over 60% of the business surveyed did not have a basic plan to mitigate the effects of disaster.  Furthermore half of all business that are impacted by a disastrous event  are out  of  business for two weeks and two out  of five enterprises that experience a disaster will no longer be in business five  years after the event (Momani 2010).  Thus it is difficult to under estimate the importance of having BCM in organization.   Accordingly like any other organization in the world Malaysia SMEs are susceptible to events of disaster in which can disrupts the normal business operation hours and also will result in loss of productivity loss of revenue and potentially  loss  of  professional  reputation.    As  a matter  of  fact  disaster  that took place in neighbouring countries also has potential to disrupt the Malaysian business organisation.  For instance the earthquake in Taiwan has disrupted internet  connections  in  several  countries  in  Asia  and  had  a  large  impact  on Malaysia too (Nazri 2012).    In fact Everest et al. (2008) highlighted that emergency preparedness is no longer the sole concern of businesses located in earthquake or tornadoprone areas of the world as the preparedness must also take into account for manmade disasters such as terrorist attacks as well as pandemics and natural \\x0c disasters.    Moreover  natural  disasters  represents  only  1%  of  all  serious 34 business jeopardized (Nemzow 1997).  In Malaysia most of the threats towards organizations came from cyber space  such  as  hacking  harassment  forgery  malicious  worms/viruses  and threats on WLAN (NISER 2005).  NISER (2005) also stated that the number of  incidents  reported  was  more  than  12000  cases  and  that  mail  spamming intrusion  and  virus  attacks  are  the  most  common  threat  to  organizations  in Malaysia.  Furthermore a survey on the current BCM adoption status of the Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  (SMEs)  in  the  APEC  region  revealed  that flood fire and blackout were chosen by the respondents as the major potential threats for private sector organizations in Malaysia (Asian Disaster Reduction Centre 2012).   Nevertheless  during  the  Conference  for  the  3rd  Asian  Ministerial Conference  on  Disaster  Risk  Reduction  Ai  Lin (2008) from PriceWaterhouseCoopers (PwC) Malaysia pointed out that the implementation of BCM in Malaysia is not comprehensive as it varies by sector.  Generally sectors  with  comprehensive  BCM  program  only  covers  financial  services telecommunication multinational oil and gas corporations and the airline and aerodrome sectors while other sectors such as SMEs are more adhoc (Ai Lin 2008).  In  fact  in  a  survey  conducted  by  Asian  Disaster  Reduction  Centre (ADRC) and Taiwan Institute of Economic Research TIER (2011) on BCM adoption status of SMEs industry among APEC highlighted that 50% of the respondents from Malaysia answered that they did not know about BCM thus indicating a low level of BCM development and awareness among the SMEs (Asian Disaster Reduction Centre 2012).  \\x0c35  In further supporting the above recent literature review has uncovered the  issues  and  problems  that  lead  to  poor  awareness  and  implementation  of BCM  among  SMEs.    The  issues  stated  are;  (i)  lack  of  top  management commitment and support (ii) complexity of business plan (iii) too costly for SMEs  (iv)  lack  of  understanding  and  coordination  in  organisation  (v) financial performance (vi) lack of BCM knowledge and expertise (vii) lack of information  needed  for  BCM  development  and  lacking  of  commitment  on cultural changes in the organisation. (ENISA 2010; Botha & Von Solms 2004; )    Furthermore  until  today  there  is  no  academic  research  in  Malaysia focussing  on  the  BCM  implementation  in  SMEs.    There  is  only  three  study done  by  Mansol  et  al.  (2014)  that  focused  on  the  success  factors  of  BCM implementation in Malaysia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s organisation.  In realising the research gap that existed there is a need to study on the success factors of BCM implementation in Malaysia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SMEs as BC in SMEs is as important and critical as it is to the big organisations.    Problem Statement 1.3  Ideally BCM is an organisation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s last line of defence when all other controls have failed. BCM may prevent drastic events such as injury loss of life or failure of an organisation.  It ensures that the business will operate prior during  and  after  the  disaster  events  (Gibb  &  Buchanan  2006;  Conrad  et  al. 2012;  ENISA  2010).  BCM  is  also  capable  in  minimising  the  time  of interruptions of business operations reducing the impact of disaster enables rapid recovery and resumptions of critical business functions for the fulfilment of  business  obligations  (Botha  &  Von  Solms  2004;  Garrett  2012;  Syrmoula 2010).  \\x0c36  Nevertheless despite realising the significant of BCM implementations to SMEs in Malaysia and all the effort by related authorities most of the local SMEs still failed to understand what BCM is all about let alone to implement it.    The  reason  behind  the  failure  lies  much  on  the  late  awareness  of  the importance of BCM in Malaysia.  On 2005 Shamsudin Jalil  a certified Cyber Defence Associate with  Cyber Security Malaysia and also  a ABCP certified with DRI Malaysia started to discuss on how to raise the awareness of BCM importance in Malaysia by suggesting five crucial points.  One of the point is to increase the number of certified BCM professional in the country.  Hence as a result DRI Institute of Continuity Management for Malaysia chapter was established  to  promote  BCM  educational  and  certification  programs  in Malaysia.  The second crucial point as suggested by Shamsudin Jalil  was to develop  a fasttrack  BCM national  standards as  a guide by the organisation.  Consequently  in  the  year  2007  the  first  Malaysia  Standard  on  BCM Framework was published by SIRIM.  However the new standard discusses and  provides  the  endusers  with  a  structured  process  of  developing  a  BCM framework but not a guideline on how to implement the BCM framework in organisations.   The  failure  to  understand  BCM  is  further  highlighted  in  a  survey  by ADRC and TIER in 2011 that 50% of the respondents from Malaysia SMEs answered that they did not know about BCM and apart from that recent study also  showed  that  BCM  in  Malaysia  is  seldom  discussed  academically.  Currently  in  Malaysia  there  are  only  three  academic  papers  published  by researchers  from  USIM  that  discussed  on  BCM  academically.  It  focused  on public  organisations  but  not  on  SMEs.  Majority  of  the  academic  papers  on BCM were published by international researchers and focused on the concepts of BCM only. There are 11 international academic papers that discussed BCM in SMEs.   In Malaysia the first out of three studies mentioned above focused on exploring and identifying the success factors of the execution of BCM in the \\x0c37  organisation that had been carried out by Mansol et al. (2014). This study was carried out on local licensed public key infrastructure (PKI) authorities. The findings identified four success factors namely; (i) management commitment (ii)  training  and  skills  (iii)  awareness  and  (iv)  information  and  knowledge sharing.   The  second  study  aimed  to  explore  and  identify  the  effects  of organisational culture on the successful implementation of BCM in Malaysian organisations. It was carried out by Mansol et al. (2015) and 22 Malaysian IT organisations  and  departments  were  selected  as  the  respondents.  The  study highlighted the organisations\\xe2\\x80\\x99 employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 view on the importance and effect of  organisational  culture  on  BCM  implementation  and  the  results  are  very useful  as  guidance  for  organisations  in  Malaysia  specifically  to  monitor security incidents or threats.   As  for  the  third  study  it  aimed  to  present  the  organisational  culture metrics model using GoalQuestionMetric (GQM) approach in measuring the readiness  of  the  organisation  to  implement  BCM  and  its  BCM  compliance.  The findings of this study would definitely help the organisation in terms of their readiness to set up BCM and its BCM compliance in the organisation.   In short the review of the above literatures highlighted several salient points.   Firstly  to  successfully  execute  BCM  in  the  Malaysian  IT organisations the four success factors namely; (i) management commitment (ii)  training  and  skills  (iii)  awareness  and  (iv)  information  and  knowledge sharing must be achieved.  Secondly organisational culture greatly impact and play  an  important  role  to  organisations  in  terms  of  BCM  readiness  and implementation as organisational culture is the control mechanism to guide and bind employees to the organisation through the acceptance of defined standards and rules.  The literatures also highlighted that GQM approach shall help  to assist in developing the organisations so that they adapt to BCM culture and implementation.    Thirdly  it  clearly  shows  that  there  are  no  academic \\x0c researches so far that focuses on BCM implementation in Malaysian SMEs. Hence this proves that the research on the subjects is timely and called for.  38  Accordingly the problem statement laid the foundation for the study to focus on answering the following research questions 1. What are the CSFs for the BCM implementation in Malaysian SMEs?  2. What  are  the  structural  relationships  between  the  critical success  factors  for  successful  BCM  implementation  in  Malaysian SMEs?        1.4  Objectives of the Research  Based on the problem statements and research questions this study focused to achieve the following objectives  (a) To  determine  the  CSFs  for  the  BCM  implementation  in Malaysian SMEs. (b) To develop the structural relationships between the CSFs for the BCM implementation in Malaysian SMEs.   \\x0c 1.5   Scope of Research  39 As the research encircled on the BCM and due to the rarity of BCM implementation  on  SMEs  industry  in  Malaysia  the  research  covers  the following scopes  a)  BCM  Professionals  managers  and  consultants  alike  that  has  been trained  and  credited  with  professional  certification  by  DRI  Malaysia Institute of Continuity Management.  The  reason  of  choosing  such  scope  is  due  to  strong  reason  that  the professional\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  skills  experiences  and  credibility  are  acknowledged  and certified by  nonprofit world organisation  such as DRI Malaysia  Institute of Continuity  Management.  This  is  to  prevent  uncertainty  and  doubts  over  the professional\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  BCM  experiences  and  of  course  the  opinions  that  are  stated during the interview in which will dictate unfavorably over the outcomes of the  research.    Plus  DRI  Malaysia  Institute  of  Continuity  Management certifications and credibility is recognised by BNM SIRIM UNISDR and ISO 27001.    1.6 Research Methodology  In  achieving  the  research  objectives  two  (2)  methodologies  were applied throughout of this study. The two methods are   1)   2)  Literature Review Experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Opinion Interview \\x0c The aims and techniques of each of these methods and consequently the relevant methodological issues on the data collection techniques are briefly discussed on the next page. 40   1.6.1  Literature Review  Literature  review  or  archival  research  exists  to  report  findings  from individual studies or a collection of studies so that it helps readers to appreciate and understand the quality of evidence supporting the research.  It is divided into two whether it is a primary or secondary data (Wayne & Menzer 2003) and  influenced  by  different  paradigms  that  affect  the  way  research  are designed the findings and the claims that the researcher might make (Crossan 2003; Brotchie et al. 2008).   The  objective  of  reviewing  is  to  provides  an  overview  and  a  critical evaluation of related literature within prior BCM or SMEs researches in finding the  literature  gaps  methodology  been  used  and  the  CSFs  of  BCM implementations in SMEs.  Hundreds of articles from dozens of journals and database searches were explored using keywords identified from the literature reviews related with BCM regardless of the types of industry are included. This phase also enabled the researcher to design appropriate strategies in collecting and analysing the data.   1.6.2  Experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Opinion Interview  Interviews can take many forms however as highlighted by Yin (2011) interviews  may  fall  into  two  types;  structured  interviews  and  qualitative interviews.  There are options within these two types on how to carry out the \\x0c41  interviews the researcher is free to conducts facetoface interviews with the participants interview participants by telephone or engaging them in a focus group  interviews  with  six  to  eight  interviewees  in  each  group.    Usually  in qualitative research the samples are purposively selected so that it will be best in helping the researcher understands the problem and the research questions (Creswell 2003). In this study the interactions between the interviewer and interviewee were  carefully  scripted  into  the  ISM  structured  interview.    The  interviewer starts with a formal questionnaire that lists every question to be asked. Then the  interviewer  formally  adopts  the  role  of  an  interviewer  trying  to  elicit responses from the interviewee.  The interviewer then tries to adopt the same consistent  behaviour  when  interviewing  with  every  participants.  Their demeanour will also be scripted usually the result of some earlier and studyspecific  training  aimed  at  conducting  the  data  collection  as  uniformly  as possible.    As  highlighted  by  Yin  (2011)  structured  interviews  also  tend  to favour  certain  kinds  of  questions;  namely  questions  where  interviewees  are limited to a set of responses predefined by the researcher.   Moreover majority of the respondents are not available for facetoface interview thus telephone interviews  Skype interviews  and  email conversations were also employed by the interviewer as to give more flexibility towards  the  interviewee.    The  ISM  structured  interview  was  constructed particularly to obtain the relationship between the CSFs so that the study can achieve its objectives.  The sample was purposively selected from the list of BCM  professional  available  in  DRI  Malaysia  website  and  also  in  LinkedIn accounts.   Generally  experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99  opinion  interviews  were  sought  for  two  main purposes.    The  first  purpose  is  that  the  experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99  opinions  were  sought  to determine  the  structural  relationships  of  the  CSFs  constructs  for  successful implementation of BCM in Malaysia SMEs using the ISM method.  Meanwhile \\x0c for the second purpose  a second interview were done by  gathering experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinion on the validity and feasibility of the CSFs model identified as a result obtained in the completed ISM method. 42   \\x0c The  flowchart  for  this  study  is  shown  in  Figure  1.1  below.Literature review43 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Identify issues regarding BCM BCM elements and CSFs in SMEs industry.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Select appropriate method for data collection and analysis.Pilot Study\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Confirming whether respondents understand  the question item stated.Experts' Opinion Interview\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 ISM interview forms were distributed among the experts'.\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Facetoface telephone Skype and email interviews\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Develop the structural relationships of the CSFs through the SSIM by developing an ISMbased model. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Validating the identified ISMbased model.

Chapter  Two  (2)  will  discuss  the  definitions  of  Extreme  and Disaster Events BCP DRP BCM and SMEs in Malaysia.  The terms that constitute  these  elements  will  also  be  thoroughly  explained  plus  the evolution  of  BCM  will  be  included.    It  then  gives  a  detail  view  of  the current implementation of BCM in Malaysia with the emphasis given on the problems and issues and possible alternatives to overcome them. In this chapter too will be dedicated to discuss on the needs of BCM for SMEs in Malaysia.    In  between  the  cause  of  the  existence  of  the  SMEs  the significant of its existence in Malaysia its point of view from global market perspective on the development of SMEs and other important factors will be included in the discussion.   Chapter  Three  (3)  describes  the  research  methodology  employed for  the  study  and  provides  weight  for  the  potential  of  the  research  to  be conducted  successfully.   A  number  of  data  collections  and  analysis  are discussed and finally appropriate research methods in conjunction with the conditions and environments surrounding the research are selected.     Chapter Four (4) discussed the result of the analysis on the experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99 opinion interview regarding the CSFs of BCM implementation on SMEs in \\x0c46  Malaysia.    The  analysis  focused  on  the  experts\\xe2\\x80\\x99  opinion  upon  the relationships  between the  CSFs identified for  successful  BCM implementation  on  Malaysia  SMEs;  and  the  feasibility  study  result  in checking  whether  the  ISMbased  model  of  the  CSFs  is  technically operationally and economically feasible.   Chapter  Five  (5)  covers  a  comprehensive  analysis  and  highlights the  discussion  on  the  findings  from  the  analysis  of  the  interview  in answering the objectives of the research i.e. to determine the CSFs for the BCM implementation on SMEs in Malaysia and to develop the structural relationships of the CSFs for the BCM implementation on Malaysia. SMEs.   Chapter  Six  (6)  highlights  the  main  conclusions  and  several limitations of the research.  Several points for further investigation are also highlighted.                \\x0c REFERENCES  262 ACI World Secretariat 2012.
