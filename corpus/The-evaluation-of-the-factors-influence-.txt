The  research  evaluates  the  extent  on  how  the  firm  and  the   ownermanager factors impact upon the firms’ access to debt financing were evaluated. This study was conducted in   2012   based  on  a  survey  of  164  Tanzanian  firms.  The  appropriateness  and  the  support  of  the  determinant  factors   impact SMEs’ access to external debt financing were empirically analyzed. The research design was quantitative in   nature involving testing various hypotheses and theories about the associations between perceived constructs. Study   results were then compared with factual indicator data subjected to multiple regression and correlation analysis. The   results  of the  regression  analysis  comply  with  other researches  conducted in  previous studies in  relation to  factors   impact  access  to  debt  financing.  These  empirical  findings  provide  among  the  factors  influence  access  of  debt   financing  by  SMEs  in  Tanzania  include   firms  management’s  education   experiences  of  industry  and  business   operations; furthermore  firm’s location  industry  size  age  incorporation  and availability of collateral and business   information  are noticeable  factors  that  impact  firm’s  access to  debt  financing.

The   emergence  of  SMEs  sector  is  recognized  widely  due  to  their  significant  impacts  on  economic  development   (Reynolds  1991;  Wright  et  al.   1998;  Jackson  et  al.  1999; Lau  &  Busenitz   2001).  It  has  been particularly  evident   that SMEs have contributed significantly to the economic growth of developed and developing countries. SMEs have   a  potential  contribution  socially  and  economically  by  contributing  noticeably  in  job  creation   revenue  generation    innovations; also acts as a catalyst for urban and rural area’s growth (Hallberg  2000; OECD  2004; Williams  2006;   Fatoki  &  Asah   2011).  Large  of  the  industrialized  countries   over  98%  of  all  manufacturing  sector  firms  originate   from the SMEs sector and they are main employment providers (Sanusi  2003). The SME sector employs more than   22% of the productive labor force in the developing countries (Kayanula & Quartey  2000).     This research aimed to investigate empirically the determinants of the factors that impact the access to debt financing   by Tanzanian SMEs. The factors influencing the access to debt financing to firms are many and complex. To find out   the  factors  impact  the  access  on  debt  financing  by  SMEs   this  research  investigated  and  analyzed  the  firm  and   ownermanager characteristics of Tanzanian firms on how they influence the lenders to provide debt to their firms.   The  study  established  the  extent  to  which  the  firm  characteristics  and  the  ownermanager  characteristics  influence   the access to debt financing to impact their firms growth. A research model was developed to test the hypotheses and   theory about associations between constructs. Outcomes were then compared with factual indicator data  subjected to   multivariate regression analysis and correlation analysis. The research analyzed empirically the appropriateness and   support  of  the  determinants  that  affect  SME  access  to  debt  financing.  Recommendations  were  made  for  those   business practitioners who are still trading in businesses with  either high or low  growth expectations  which  can  be   influenced by their access to debt financing from financial institutions.     1     European Journal of Business and Management                                                                                www.iiste.org   ISSN 22221905 (Paper) ISSN 22222839 (Online)   Vol.5  No.7  2013      1.1  The Research Problem     Researches  on  SME  sector  have  attracted  attention  from  researchers   policy  makers   and  practitioners  due  to  their   contributions to economic growth. Despite of the potentials it has on economic development and growth the sector is   facing a serious challenge arising from lack of financing services (Livingstone  2001; Bigsten et al. 2003; Fafchamps    2004).  Financing of SMEs’ viable projects (Note  1) have an important implication on sustainability  and  growth of   the SMEs. In spite of the noticeable significances from SME sector still financing difficulties merging as a problem   weakening the growth of the sector. This study aimed to unveil factors influences access to debt financing by SMEs   and give measures to encounter the problem.     In  spite  of  the  statistical  difficulties  in  defining  SMEs  and  defining  business  failure  in  different  countries   there  is   general agreement that lack on access to debt financing cause difficulties for businesses’ development. Pretorius and   Shaw  (2004)  observed  that  accessibility  to  external  finance  is  essential  to  solve  shortage  of  SMEs  cash  flows.   Financing is required for SMEs’ to set up and enlarge their business operations  human resource development  new   product  development   research  and  development  and  acquirement  of  uptodate  production  equipments  and   technology.  Most  of  SMEs  rely  on  internal  finance  (Note  2)  since  they  can’t  afford  external  finance  easily  only   prioritized  source  become  internal  finance  but  still  internal  finance  is  inadequate  for  SMEs’  development  and   profitability. Failures of SMEs to access debt financing result into an inadequate capital structure. DemirqucKunt et   al.  (2006) pointed out that the main source of external financing for SMEs is equity and debt. Shane (2008) pointed   out that  external  equity  from stock  exchange  (capital markets)  usually  never  exists for  SMEs.  Majed  et  al.   (2010)   and Sorooshian et al.  (2010) pointed out that firm characteristics have an impact on access to debt financing  capital   structure and performance of SMEs. In this study  firm characteristics include attributes such as firm’s location  firm   industry  firm size  firm age  firm legal status  the availability of both firm’s collateral and business information.     Globally SME sector has been reporting difficulties in access to finance (Bebczuk  2004; Slotty  2009; Balling et al.    2009; Irwing & Scott  2010; Yongqian et al.  2012). Access to external finance to SMEs has become more costly and   troublesome  while  their  accessibility  has  sharply  declined.  SMEs’  financinggap  (Note  3)  limits  their  investment   opportunities and stagnant their growth. Access to finance is widely perceived to be an essential factor for firms and   especially SMEs  to maintain their daily business operation as well as to achieve longterm investment opportunities   and development targets. Presence of general limitations on access to capital markets led firms to rely heavily on the   banking sector for credit. Therefore  a wellfunctioning financial system sector plays an important role in channeling   resources to the best firms and investment ventures. Financing constraints crucially limit firm’s growth  availability   of productive resources resulting to sluggish of a  sector  which might pose threat to the sector’s contribution to the   economy.     The  speed  of  innovation  for  high  productivity  led  SMEs  to  require  fund  for  high  technology  employment  in   production  in raising  productivity  and  maintaining  competitiveness  in  recent  years.  SMEs  innovative  products  and   services  great  potentialities’  might  disappear  if  fund  needed  for  investment  to  flourish  the  sector  would  not  be   available. If SMEs lack proper financing they require  brilliant ideas may fall by the edge and this represents a loss in   potential growth for the economy.       Similar research studies on SME sector covering the determinants of factors impact the access to debt financing by   SMEs  by  employing  firm  characteristics  and  ownermanagers  characteristics  are  much  less  common  in  the   economics  literature   particularly  those  with  a  focus  on  the  Tanzanian  SME  sector.  The  aim  of  this  study  was  to   encompass  the  determinants  of  factors  that  impact  access  to  external  sources  of  financing  by  SMEs  which  has  an   important aspect on firms’ growth. Moreover  the real picture of SMEs business activities in Tanzania has not been   unveiled  entirely  in  reflecting  the  determinants  on  factors  impact  their  access  to  external  financing.  The  existing   studies  have  lacked  systematic  empirical  evidence  to  help  policy  makers  and  practitioners  to  solve  the  problem.   SMEs research has been recognized as an important contribution to SME development and dominance in innovation.       Shortage  of  financing  to  SMEs  in  developing  countries  led  the  sector  not  to  provide  enough  support  to  economic   development  and  growth  (Sacerdoti   2005).  Lack  of  debt  financing  to  SMEs  affect  their  perfection  to  fulfill  their   roles. Bigsten et al. (2000) pointed out that the sluggishness growth of the SMEs sector in Africa  are associated with   a  scarcity  of  capital.  Moreover   (Oshikoya   1994;  Fadahunsi   1997)  strengthened  that  lack  of  credit  access  also   lowers  SMEs  investment  in  Africa.  As  a  result   SMEs  are  more  likely  to  be  credit  constrained  and  thus  affect   negatively  their  profitability  and  growth  compared to large  enterprises.  The  aim  of this  study  is to  ensure the  firm     2     European Journal of Business and Management                                                                                www.iiste.org   ISSN 22221905 (Paper) ISSN 22222839 (Online)   Vol.5  No.7  2013      and the ownermanagers’ perceived characteristics provide a link for SMEs access to debt financing. Olomi (2007)   pointed  out  that  most  of  the  SMEs  in  Africa  obtain  their  finance  from  the  informal  sources  (Note  4)  while  large   enterprises  access  finances  directly  from  formal  sector  i.e.  banks.  Presence  of  unequal  access  to  finance  by  SMEs   and large enterprises  has undermined the role of SME sector in the economic development of  African countries at   large.     In  Tanzania   the  government  has  been  attracted  by  SMEs  to  solve  unemployment  problem  which  recently  is   spreading across the country. Over 700 000 job seekers enter the Tanzanian labor market annually but only 40 000   new jobs are created annually within formal sector  as a result those who unable to find jobs in the formal sector end   up in the informal sector whereby SMEs’ dominate (Olomi  2005). Regardless of SMEs’ sector contributions in the   job creation  their operations and development supports has been compromised by the persistent limitations on their   access  to  financing  from  formalfinancial  sector.  An  existence  of  a  finance  gap  in  the  Tanzanian  SME  sector    deteriorate SMEs’ performances  their productivity and contributions to the country’s economy.     The  real  picture  of  SMEs  business  activities  in  Tanzania  has  not  been  unveiled  entirely  in  reflecting  the  firm  and   ownermanager’s characteristics impacts in access to debt financing as it has key significance on SME’s growth. The   purpose  of  this  study  was  to  carry  out  such  an  investigation   with  a  view  to  making  recommendations  for  more   appropriate  business  support  services  at  a  local  level.  Furthermore   government  support  had  promoted  strongly  an   enterprise culture for enhancing further expansion on SME sector. This study recognizing that  the harder economic   environment for SME sector become due to lack of supportive financing services  the less performances and growth   of SME sector. The focus on this study is to unveil how ownermanager and firm attributes impact an access to debt   financing; since debt is one of the internal determinants of business performance.     1.2  Research Objectives and Hypotheses     SME sector is a backbone of many economies in developing and developed countries due to their contributions on   creation  of  employment   competition   economic  enthusiasm  and  innovation.  The  focus  of  this  research  was  to   investigate  the  determinants  of  the  factors  that  impact  the  access  to  debt  financing  by  SMEs  whereby  firm’s  and   ownermanager’s characteristics influence on access of debt financing by SMEs were evaluated. The study aimed to   improve the policies and ways to make debt financing/credit available or delivered to SME sector.       The  research  hypotheses  were  constructed  from  other  studies  which  have  been  conducted  in  different  aspects  on   SMEs to attain  the objective of this study.  The  main aim of  the following hypotheses is to tackle objective of this   research and to fill an existing financing gap on SMEs      The size of a firm has an important influence on the debt ratios as firms with more real assets tends to have greater   access  to  longterm  debt  (Burkart  &  Ellingsen   2004).  Honhyan  (2009)  find  out  that  larger  firms  tend  to  be  more   diversified  and  fail  less  regularly;  consequently  size  can  be  an  inverse  proxy  for  the  probability  of  bankruptcy.   Cassar (2004) argues that it may be relatively more costly for smaller firms to resolve information asymmetries with   debt providers; impliedly led smaller firms to be offered less debt capital.     H1   There  an  existence  of  a  positive  relationship  between  the  size  of  the  SMEs  and  access  to  debt  finance  from     external sources.     Lenders that are geographically closer to their borrowers are better able to use soft qualitative information about their   customers’ credit quality. Geographical proximity to either critical buyers or suppliers produces a form of enhanced   environmental  scanning  that enables  SMEs  to  more  easily  identify  and  exploit  growth opportunities in the  market.   The  geographic proximity  to  banks  and  customers  has  a  relationship  on  a firm’s  use  of leverage  (Berger  &  Udell    2002). Gilbert (2008) points out that the geographical area where the firm is operating has implications for its access   to markets and resources impacting their operations.       H2   The location of a firm has a positive relationship on access to debt finance by SMEs.     Hall et al.  (2000) suggests that the industry in which a firm operates does not directly determine its capital structure   but  may  do  so  indirectly  via  the  nature  and  composition  of  the  firm’s  assets.  The  relationship  between  industry   classification and financial leverage are based on the assumption that industry classification is a proxy for business   risk  (Barbosa  &  Moraes   2004).  The  rationale  for  this  may  be  that  firms  in  the  same  industry  face  the  same   environmental and economic conditions and  therefore  tend to cluster with respect to variance of earnings and sales.     3     European Journal of Business and Management                                                                                www.iiste.org   ISSN 22221905 (Paper) ISSN 22222839 (Online)   Vol.5  No.7  2013      H3   The industry that a firm operates positively impacts access to debt financing by SMEs.     Kitindi et al.  2007) evidenced that creditors  banks and other lenders use financial information provided by firms to   analyze their present performance and predict future performance. Financial information obtained from the financial   statements acts as indicator of borrower’s future prospects and ability to repay back principal and stipulated interest   attached.  Lenders  use  available  financial  information  to  make  an  approvalrejection  decisions;  lack  of  adequate   information leads to information asymmetry and credit rationing (Sarapaivanich & Kotey  2006).     H4   There is a positive relationship between business information and access to debt finance by SMEs from lenders.     Chandler  (2009)  pointed  that  the  longer  existence  of  a  firm   it  signals  that  that  a  firm  can  survive  during  a  tough   economic  conditions. Klapper  (2010)  stated  that  younger  firms  (less than  5  years)  rely  less on  bank  financing  and   more on informal financing.  Ngoc et al. (2009) find out that it is often  difficult and expensive for  young  SMEs to   access bank financing due a large information asymmetry between the banks and firms. Bougheas et al.  (2005) point   out that young firms are more failure prone than older ones.     H5   There existence of a positive relationship between the age of the firm and access to debt finance from lenders by     SMEs.     Cassar  (2004)  pointed  out  that  lenders  may  perceive  incorporation  as  a  good  signal  that  portrays  credibility  and   formality  of  operations.  Abor  (2008)  point  out  that  the  form  of  business  organization  could  affect  the  debtequity   decisions  of  SMEs.  The  shareholders  of  corporations  and  limited  companies  have  limited  liability  against  losses    whereas  general  partners  and  owners  of  sole  proprietorships  have  unlimited  liability.  Coleman  and  Cohn  (2000)   however find evidence suggesting a positive relationship between leverage and incorporation.     H6   It is hypothesized that incorporation positively impacts on access to credit by SMEs.     Bougheas  et  al.  (2005)  argued  that  collateral  is  an  important  factor  for  SMEs  in  order  to  access  debt  finance.   Collateral  reduces  the  riskiness  of  a  loan  by  giving  the  financial  institution  a  claim  on  a  tangible  asset  without   diminishing  its  claim  on  the  outstanding  debt.  Coco  (2000)  point  out  that  collateral  is  the  lender’s  second  line  of   defense. Barbosa and Moraes (2004) argue that SMEs ownersmanagers that invest heavily in tangible assets tend to   have higher financial leverage since they can borrow at lower interest rates if their debt is secured with such assets.     H7   There is a positive relationship between collateral and access to debt finance by SMEs from lenders.     Managerial competencies as measured by education level  managerial experience  industry expertise and knowledge   of  the  business  positively  impact  on  the  performance  of  SMEs  (Hisrich  &  Drnovsek   2002).  Martin  and  Staines   (2008) found out that lack of managerial experience  skillfulness and personal qualities are found as the main reasons   why SMEs fail. Fatoki and Assah (2011) found out that ownermanager’s management competency (education and   experience)  has  an  influence  on  access  to  debt  financing  from  commercial  banks.  Herrington  and  Wood  (2003)   points out that lack of education and training has reduced management capability in SMEs and account for one of the   reasons  for their  high  failure rates.  In that  perspective  management  education  and  experience  do impact  the  firm’s   performance hence ability to access external debt financing by SMEs.       H8   There is a positive relationship between managerial education and access to debt finance by SMEs from lenders.     H9   There  is  a  positive  relationship  between  firm’s  management  experience  and  access  to  debt  finance  by  SMEs     from lenders.     2.0  Literature Review       2.1  The Role and Significance of SMEs     SMEs  play  important  roles  in  many  countries’  economy  and  make  substantial  contribution  to  employment  and   outputs regardless of the level of economic development of a country. SME businesses with less than 100 workers in   the  United  States  represent  onethird  of  domestic  employment  and  sales  revenue  (Velasco  &  Cruz  2001).  SMEs   represent 99.8 percent of all European Enterprises (European Small Business Alliance – The Independent Voice for   Small  Business   2006).  SMEs  in  the  EU  (those  with  fewer  than  250  workers)  account  for  about  onehalf  of  total   value added and twothird of labor force (European Union 2002). SMEs contribute 40% and 50% of manufacturing   output in Chinese Taipei  Japan and Republic of Korea in the 1990’s (UNCTAD 1998). Wattanapruttipaisan (2003)   evidenced  that  SMEs  in  ASEAN  contribute  up  to  90%  of  business  establishments  and  70%  to  90%  of  Domestic     4     European Journal of Business and Management                                                                                www.iiste.org   ISSN 22221905 (Paper) ISSN 22222839 (Online)   Vol.5  No.7  2013      workforce.  Liu  (2007)  acknowledged  SMEs  as  a  major  driving  force  in  economic  expansion  in  China   with  more   than 40 million SMEs and sole industrial and commercial proprietorships (getihu enterprises) are responsible for 59%   of GDP  with 68.65% of imports and exports. They paid 48.2% of taxes and occupied more than 75% of employment   in urban areas. SMEs have become a main driver of economic growth in China.     SMEs  are  expected  to  be  an  important  vehicle  to  address  the  challenges  of  employment  creation   sustainable   economic  development   equality  on  income  distribution  and  overall  stimulation  of  economic  development  in   developed  and  developing  countries.  SMEs  are  also  an  important  source  of innovation  in  the  development  of  new   products   services  and  technologies  (Fatoki  &  Garwe.   2010).  SMEs  in  both  advanced  and  developing  countries   comprise heterogeneous  group  of production units  of diverse size  organization  managerial capacity   technological   level and sophistication. In the advanced countries SMEs tend to be homogeneous (varying mainly in terms of firm   size  and  technology).  In  third  world  SMEs  are  characterized  by  the  coexistence  of  both  very  small  craft  type   enterprises in the informal economy and small and medium businesses in the organized sectors (Bhalla  1992).     SME operators tend to demonstrate greater flexibility in the face of recessions by holding on to their businesses since   they  are  prepared  to  temporarily  accept  lower  compensation  (Olomi   2005).  SMEs  through  business  connections    partnerships  and  subcontracting  relationships  can  enable  them  to  create  great  potential  to  balance  large  industries   requirements.  Strong  developed  productive  industrial  structure  can  only  be  attained  where  SMEs  and  large   enterprises  not  only  coexist  but  also  function  in  a  symbiotic  relationship.  Additionally   SMEs  are  observed  as   training  grounds  for  entrepreneurship  and  managerial  development  and  enable  motivated  individuals  to  find  new   avenues for investment and expanding their operations (Olomi  2005).     2.2  SMEs Financing & Growth     The  role  of  the  SMEs  as  an  engine  of  economic  growth  has  garnered  considerable  public  attention  globally.   Accompanying this heightened popular interest in the general area of SME sector has been an increased interest by   policy  makers   practitioners  and  researchers  in  the  nature  and  behavior  of  the  financial  markets  that  fund  small   businesses. At the core of this sector are questions about the sources of financing for SME growth needs at various   stages of their development  the nature of the private equity and debt contracts associated with this financing and the   associates  and  substitutability  among  these  alternative  sources  of  finance  arise.  The  private  markets  that  finance   SMEs are particularly interesting because they are so different from the public markets that fund large enterprises.       its     the     information  availability;     Berger and Udell (2002) pointed out that the most important attribute in defining SME sector access to finance is to   review   information  comprise  firm  characteristics  and  ownermanagers’   characteristics. Berger and Udell (2002) stipulated that unlike large firms  SMEs do not enter into contracts that are   publicly visible or widely reported publicly; contracts with their labor force  even their suppliers and their customers   are  generally  kept  private.  In  addition   SMEs  do  not  issue  traded  securities  that  are  continuously  priced  in  public   markets.  Furthermore   most  of  SMEs  do  not  have  audited  financial  statements  at  all  that  can  be  shared  with  any   provider of outside finance. As a result  SMEs often cannot credibly convey their quality. Moreover  SMEs may have   difficulty building reputations to signal high quality or nonexploitive behavior quickly to access debt financing from   financial institutions to finance their growth opportunities.       This  study  intend  to  offer  specialized  mechanisms  to  address  these  difficulties  in  which  most  of  SMEs  become   unqualified  to  access  these  sources  of  debt  financing.  The  financial  intermediaries  that  operate  in  these  markets   actively  screen   contract  with   and  monitor  the  SMEs  they  invest  in  over  the  course  of  their  relationships  to  help   resolve these obstacles to access to access debt financing problems.       3.0  Methodology     The study aim of any research is to establish the degree of representation of the sample to the population so that basic   assumptions could  be made. With respect to the  methodological choice for this study  a quantitative approach was   used. This empirical study investigated on how the characteristics of firm(s) and ownermanager(s) impact access to   debt  finance  to  boost  firm’s  growth  in  the  SME  sector.  To  test  the  hypotheses  properly   detailed  survey   questionnaires were prepared and tested  then used to collect data across Tanzanian firms. Data were collected as part   of a larger study of investigation in SMEs. The criterion used for selecting the sample firms was that  they belonged   to  the  any  category  of  SMEs  operating  in  Tanzania.  The data  was  collected based  on  zones   Coastal  zone  (Dar  es   Salaam)   Northern  zone  (Arusha)   Zanzibar  (Unguja)  and  SouthernHighland  zone  (Mbeya)  of  United  Republic  of     5     European Journal of Business and Management                                                                                www.iiste.org   ISSN 22221905 (Paper) ISSN 22222839 (Online)   Vol.5  No.7  2013      Tanzania. This study concentrated on SMEs which are recognized by the Ministry of Industry  Trade and Marketing;   Tanzania Chamber of  Commerce and Small Industries Development Organization (SIDO). Participants  were  asked   to volunteer for a study involving the discussion of specific ways they developed their businesses and how do they   finance  their  needs  on  external  financing.  To  qualify  for  the  study   the  SMEs  have  to  be  Tanzanian  business    registered and genuinely independent  in need and ever applied for external debt finances  not a division  subsidiary    or  franchise  of  a  big  corporation.  The  population  of  SMEs  was  250   whereby  to  establish  the  sample  size  of  this   study  we  opted  for  Raosoft  (Note  5)  sample  size  calculator  to  calculate  the  sample  size.  Even  though  Raosoft   provided a minimum recommended sample size of 152 SMEs to be involved in this study  200 questionnaires were   distributed because of data collection limitation such as non response.     The  study  captured  both  qualitative  and  quantitative  data.  The  collection  of  data  was  conducted  through  a  survey   questionnaire comprising open and closed questions. The questions were comprehensible and constructed easily for   respondents to understand and reply the questions. The collection of data for this research was primary derived from   field survey data collection through interview. All the derived data were analyzed using statistical techniques in order   to detect required answers to the identified research hypothesis. The data were collected ranges for variables required   to  construct  a comprehensive multivariate model on SMEs access to debt financing. In data  analysis the Statistical   Package  for  Social  Sciences  (SPSS)  was  used.  Statistical  analysis  includes  Pearson  correlation   logistic  regression   and  descriptive  statistics  were  also  conducted.  Pearson  correlation  was  used  to  analyze  the  relationships  exist   between  the  variables  and  access  to  debt  financing  as  well  as  establish  if  the  multicollinearity  between  variables   existence.  Multiple  regressions  were  used  to  measure  the  relationships  between  the  independent  and  dependent   variables.  The  dependent  variable  for  SMEs’  access to  debt financing  was  the firm’s  access  to  external finance.  A   comprehensive set of independent variables was derived in this study for the determinants of SMEs access to finance   which  does  impact  firm’s  growth.  Validity  and  reliability  were  guaranteed  by  using  a  statistician  and  a  panel  of   experts to weigh up the research instrument for theoretical clarity  pretesting the research instrument in a pilot study   and in depth reviewing the literature for theoretical constructs and empirical conclusions relating to this study. The   KolmogorovSmirnov test was used to determine the normality of the data.     Econometric model was used to hypothesize the determinants of the factors impact the access to debt financing by   Tanzania SMEs. The firms and ownermanagers’ characteristics were the determinant factors to be tested on access   to debt financing by SMEs in Tanzania in this study’s econometric model. The multiple regression equation with all   of the variables to be associated in establishing a relationship with access to debt financing by SMES was formed as   shown in equation (1)  (2) and (3).

Using the data collected from the field survey 250   firms were stratified and randomly selected to form the population. A sample of 200 SMEs was first randomly drawn   and questionnaires  were  administered  carried out between months April to August 2012. This brought the number   surveyed  firms to 164  out  of 200 questionnaires  administered.  Based on  an  evaluation of  the  characteristics  of the   owners who responded to the survey  it was decided that the sample could be considered to be a reasonably adequate   representation  of the  small  business population  for  this  study.  Fortunately   the nature  of  Tanzania  SME  sector  and   response  usually  associated  with  survey   the  response  rate  was  considered  to  reasonable  representative  of  the   industry. The sample surveyed provided a broad range of services including manufacturing  retail and transportation.   Respondent  firms  were  distributed  within  different  economic  sectors   agriculture  and  natural  resources  sectors   including  food   wood   wood  products  and  furniture   and  nonmetallic  minerals  sectors;    manufacturing  industries   sector include  textile;  machinery  and  equipments;  chemicals;  food processing   metal  and  metal  products  and  other   forms  manufacturing;  and  the  final  sector  comprises  services  and  retail  business  including  garments;  retail;   construction  and  transport  sectors.  As per  Raosoft  (Note 6)  the initial intention  was to  obtain  a  response  rate  of  at   least 152 respondents (76%) of the 250 surveyed questionnaires  however  a response rate of 164 respondents (82%)   was yielded  proving that it was more satisfactory response rate. Using the data from ownermanagers in the industry   reduced heterogeneity and assured adequate numbers of respondents.                 7     European Journal of Business and Management                                                                                www.iiste.org   ISSN 22221905 (Paper) ISSN 22222839 (Online)   Vol.5  No.7  2013        Table 1  Composition of sample     Variables     No. of observation     Percent     Size     Location     Small     Medium     Large     Urban     Rural     Primary     Industrial Type     Secondary     Financial Statements     Age     Tertiary     FS Yes     FSNo     Age 14 years     Age 59 years     Age 1019 years     Age 20 years and above     Private Limited Company       Incorporation     Sole proprietorship     Management Education     Management Experience     Collateral     Partnership     Less than Secondary Education     Secondary Education     Vocational Training Education     Graduate Education     Low (Less than 5 years)     Medium (59 years)     High (1019 years)     Very High (20+years)     Have Collateral (Yes)     No Collateral (No)     91     43     30     116     48     50     37     77     99     65     62     42     32     28     73     61     30     8     39     50     67     38     46     52     28     76     88     55.5     26.2     18.3     70.7     29.3     30.5     22.5     47.0     60.4     39.6     37.8     25.6     19.5     17.1     44.5     37.2     18.3     4.90     23.8     30.5     40.9     23.2     28.0     31.7     17.1     46.3     53.7     Source  Author’s own calculations based on field data    collected in Tanzania     Table  1  report  the  composition  of  the  study’s  sample  according  to  firm’s  characteristics   size   location   industrial   type   availability/management  of  financial  records  (financial  statements)   legal  status  (incorporation)   age  and   collateral availability  as well as ownermanager characteristics  owner manager’s education and experience selected   for the 164 firms responding to the survey questionnaire that they have accessed debt financing.

Medium  and  large  firms  were  treated  the  same  (32.5%)  when   applied for loans but 19.8% and 3.7% of medium and large firms respectively were rejected. Firm located in urban   represent  large  part  of  the  firms  successfully  96.4%  secure  the  loan  from  financial  institutions  but  also  on  the   rejection 93.8%.  Basing  on  industrial type firms under tertiary  sector where most of them are SMEs were  rejected   61.7%. Firms which do not maintain financial records were mostly rejected to access loans (53.1%); this is one of the   features of SMEs as the cost to maintain financial records/information is expensive and cost. Young firms aged less   than 5 years were the most rejected (63%). SMEs are among the firms starts business with hardship on access to debt   finance. Most of the firms which their incorporation (form of business organization) statuses are those which with no   legal  liability  (partnership  and  sole  proprietorship)  60.5%  dominated  with  SMEs  since  costs  for  registration  are   expensive. Under ownermanager’s education influence indicates most of rejections are from those from secondary   and  vocational  training  education  34.6%  and  38.2%  respectively.  Ownermanager’s  experience  indicates  no  big   variances  on  proportions  on  rejections  between  medium  38.3%  and  high  32.1%  experiences.  The  results  also   demonstrated that a firm without a collateral access to debt finance is difficult.

To   establish the relationship between variables the correlation analysis was conducted among to find out the association   exists between the independent variables and the dependent variable as well to establish whether the multicollinearity   problem exists among the independent variables.     The  correlation  analysis  was  used  to  describe  the  strength  and  direction  of  the  linear  relationship  between  two   variables (Pallant  2001). There are a number of different statistics available  depending on the level of dimension. In   this  study   the  procedure  for  obtaining  and  interpreting  a  Pearson’s  correlation  coefficient  was  used.  Given  that   correlations  between  independent  variables  can  cause  problems  with  multicollinearity  in  regression  analysis   examining the significance of the correlation coefficients takes on added importance.

All results indicate variables are correlated with   access  to  debt  finance.  The  study’s  results  indicate  that  accessibility  of  debt  finance  from  external  sources  in   Tanzania is positively impacted by the firm’s size  location  industry  age  incorporation  the availability of collateral   and  business  information.  Some  ownersmanagers  traits  are  correlated  with  access to  debt  financing.  Furthermore    the correlation coefficients show that there is no high correlation among independent variables used in this analysis   and thus  make us to understand that no multicollinearity problem exists among the variables. The study conducted   Field  (2005)  hypothesize  that  multicollineality  is  likely  to  be  a  problem  in  a  data  set  if  the  correlation  coefficient   between predictors is greater than 0.90 (r >0.90).     4.4  The Multiple Regression Results     Several  approaches  can  be  used  by  a  researcher  to  model metric  or  dichotomous  variables; include  probit  logistic   regression and discriminate  function analysis. Mostly  logistic regression is the  best options among all approaches    used to analyze the relationship between dichotomous dependent variables or independent dichotomous variables by   many  researchers  because  of  its  flexibility  and  strongly  on  violation  of  the  normality  assumption  within  a  model   (Agresti  1996). Logistic regression also authorizes forecast of a dependent variable from a set of predictors that may   be  discrete   dichotomous   and  continuous  or  a  combination  of  any  of  these  (Fabowale  et  al.   1995).  Alternatively    while  discriminant  analysis  can  be used to  model dichotomous  dependent  variables  the  analysis is  only  used  with   continuous predictors (Fabowale et al.  1995). Nature of data involved in this study  researcher opted to analyze data   by using logistic regression to establish the extent to which each of the variables play a part in firm’s access to debt   financing.       The variables obtained from the survey were tested for their influence on influence of firms’ and ownermanagers’   characteristics over the access to debt financing. A number of variables were correlated individually with access to   debt finance; then were regressed with access to debt financing. Of the greatest interest are the multiple correlations   of those variables which were correlated collectively and simultaneously with access to debt finance in a statistically   significant manner.     All of the variables in the analysis indicated their direct impact on access to debt financing from lenders. Regression   equations 1 to 5 were reported in section 3.0 of this study  which included all of the statistically significant variables   or subsets of them. Table 9 shows the details of regression results in line with the combined firm and ownermanager   characteristics. The multiple regression equation contains all of the variables found to be associated simultaneously   and significantly with access to debt financing as well as some which were statistically insignificant.     As  an  empirical  examination  of  the  individual  factors  were  analyzed  separately  in  relation  with  access  to  debt   financing. Table 9 shows each of the variables individually in the model which yields some useful insights into the   nature  of  the  interrelationships  between  the  variables  in  the  model.

The data for the dependent and independent variables used in the regression analysis were collected     from the primary data from field survey.     The coefficient of firm’s location was positive and statistically significant and confirms the study’s expectations of   the hypothesis. The odd ratio for a firm situated in the urban location is 7.12 with a pvalue 0.010 while for a firm   located  in  rural  areas  has  odd  ratio  of  1.01  with  pvalue  0.453;  This  indicates  that  access  to  debt  financing  is   positively  related  to  firm’s  location;  study  results  supported  Berger  &  Udell  (2002)  and  Gilbert  (2008)  that  firms   located in urban  areas  have  a  higher  possibility  on  access  to loan  or  debt financing  than  firms located  in  the  rural   area.       The coefficient of industry of the firm was positive and statistically significant and confirms the study’s hypothesis.   The odd ratio for primary firm industry is 1.43 with a pvalue 0.250; odd ratio for secondary industry is 5.82 with a   pvalue 0.038; odd ratio for tertiary industry is 2.85 with a pvalue of 0.210; while odd ratio for quaternary industry   is 1.33 with a pvalue of 0.450. Results implies that access to debt financing is positively related to firm’s industry   whereby  most  of  the  sources  of  financing  prefer  lending  more  to  the  secondary  sector  while  other  sectors  left   unsupported  by  lenders.  Therefore   results  comply  with  Hall  et  al.   (2000)  and  Barbosa  &  Moraes  (2004)  that   industry that a firm operates influence access to debt financing.     The  coefficient  of  size  of  business  (measured  by  the  number  of  employees)  confirms  to  the  study’s  hypothesis  by   carrying a positive sign and significant statistically. The odd ratio for small firms’ is 2.68 with a pvalue 0.325; odd   ratio for medium firms’ is 5.35 with a pvalue 0.043; whilst the odd ratio for large firms’ is 6.33 with a pvalue of   0.012. The  study results comply with Bukart  and  Ellingsen  (2004) and Cassar (2004) that larger  firms have higher     16     European Journal of Business and Management                                                                                www.iiste.org   ISSN 22221905 (Paper) ISSN 22222839 (Online)   Vol.5  No.7  2013      access to debt financing than smaller and medium sized firms because of economies of scale. Therefore  larger firms   find  easier to  borrow  money  from  financial  institutions  for  expansion thereby  enjoy  the  economies  of  scale  which   SMEs can’t. Large firms also manage to purchase in large scale materials and factors of production such as capital    land   equipment   and  machinery  as  well  as  employing  qualified  workers  who  will  ultimately  increase  productivity   and profitability while SMEs can’t as they are referred as risk borrowers by lenders.     Lenders  (i.e.  creditors   banks  and  other  sources  of  finance)  tend to  utilize  financial information  issued  by  firms to   evaluate  and  forecast  the  future  performance  of  the  firm.  The  information  acquired  from  the  firm’s  financial   statements  portrays  the  firm’s  forecasted  financial  capability  and  indicate  whether  their  loan  interest  and  principal   could  be  settled  when  matured.  The  odd  ratio  for firms’ that  maintain  financial information  is 7.85  with  a  pvalue   0.005 while the odd ratio for the firms which do not maintain financial information is 2.85 with a pvalue 0.326. The   result indicates that firms which maintain business information have higher possibility to access debt financing than   those never maintain financial information. Therefore  this study results support Kira and He (2012) and Fatoki and   Assah (2011) studies that there is a positive relationship between the availability of business information and access   of debt financing by SMEs.     The coefficient of the firm’s age indicates a positive association between access to credit loan and age of the firm as   per study’s hypothesis. The odd ratio for firms younger firms (less than 5 years) is 1.12 with a pvalue of 0.532; the   odd ratio for firms between 59 years is 4.58 with a pvalue of 0.032; the odd ratio for firms between 1014 years is   5.26 with a pvalue 0.024 while the odd ratio for aged firms (15 years and above) is 7.01 with a pvalue 0.042; The   result  supported  Klapper  (2010)  and  Ngoc  et  al.   (2009)  that  younger  firms  find  difficult  to  access  debt  financing   from  lenders  while  older  firms  find  it  easier.  Regarding  the  study  results   Tanzanian  business  environment   demonstrates  a  positive  relationship  between  access  of  loan  and  age  of  business  which is  a  burden to  young  firms   whereby SMEs are dominant.       The results supported Coleman and Cohn (2000) findings on the existence of a positive association between the firm   employing  debt  with  incorporation  and  as  per  study’s  hypothesis.  The  odd  ratio  for  limited  firms’  is  4.53  with  a   pvalue  0.043; the odd ratio for the sole proprietorship  and  partnership (Note 7) is 3.01 with a pvalue 0.321.  This   study finds out most of the firms operating as a sole proprietorship or partnership face difficulties in access the debt   finance  from  lenders  as  because  of  high  costs  and  lack  of  trust.  Openness declared in the  financial statements  and   limited liability make limited companies and corporation easy to access debt financing than unlimited liability forms   of organization (partnership and sole proprietorship).           The  availability  of  collateral  coefficient  indicates  a  positive  relationship  with  access  to  finance.  Collateral  is  a   decisive aspect for borrower to succeed in accessibility of debt financing from lenders. The odd ratio for firms’ with   collateral is 8.75 with a pvalue 0.001 while the odd ratio for the firms which do not have collateral is 1.23 with a   pvalue 0.322. The results indicate that lack of collateral by SMEs hinder their access to debt financing. Most of the   firms  rejected  were  those  lack  assets  to  be  pledged  as  collateral.  Therefore   study  results  support  Bougheas  et  al.    (2005) and Fatoki and Assah (2011) that collateral requirement is a key characteristic for SMEs to succeed to access   debt finance from financial institutions.     The results of the regression results ownermanager’s  capabilities to be attributed are  education  (Ownermanagers   with  vocational  level  or  some  university  trainings  (r  =  3.26;  pvalue  =  0.024)  and  graduates  (r  =  6.45   pvalue  =   0.018)  were  more  favored  by  financial  institutions  than  other  levels  of  education.  Owner  manager  working   experience  was  another factor which this study  found  out that financial institutions use to decide on access to debt   financing by firms. Ownermanagers with more than five years and above of experience (medium level to very high)   were more favored compared to less experienced ownermanagers. The odd ratios and pvalues for ownermanager’s   experiences are  medium (r = 4.58  pvalue = 0.032)  high (r =5.01  pvalue = 0.038) and very high (r = 4.36  pvalue   =0.046).  This  study’s  results  comply  with  Fatoki  &  Assah  (2011)  and  Kira  &  He  (2012)  that  ownermanagers   competence influences firms access to debt finance by SMEs.       6.0  Recommendations and Conclusion     SMEs  are  the  core  to solve  unemployment problem  which  is  growing  in  Tanzania  and other developing  countries.   However   SMEs  still  have  reported  acute  problems  of  access  to  external  finance.  This  study  results  explores  the   factors  impact  the  access  to  external  debt  financing  which  will  enable  policy  makers  and  planners  to  formulate   proper measures to encounter firms’ financing obstacles. The study explores what can determine financing constraint     17     European Journal of Business and Management                                                                                www.iiste.org   ISSN 22221905 (Paper) ISSN 22222839 (Online)   Vol.5  No.7  2013      to  a  firm  by  assessing  firm  characteristics   firm  age   firm  size   incorporation   firm  location   sector/industry  of   economic  activity;  firm’s  management  of  records  and  ownership  of  collateral  to  be  pledged  as  security;   ownermanagers  education and experience as have an influence on access to  debt financing by SMEs in Tanzania.   The  study  find  out  that  most  of  the  firms  experiencing  financing  obstacles  tended  to  possess  SMEs’  features  i.e.   firms  located  in  rural   small  and  medium   young   sole  proprietorship  and  partnership  mostly  operating  in  tertiary   industrial sector. Firms owned or managed by managers with low level of education and experience also encounter   difficulties to access debt financing from lenders.       This research has indicated that there is evidence that SMEs in Tanzania face major barriers to access debt financing   from  lenders  i.e.  banks.  In  this  aspect   actions  to  help  SME  sector  is  required  to  increase  debt  access  by  SMEs.   Policies  strategies and programs have to be modified to adjust with their needs. Harmonization measures to improve   the structural  economic and most important regulatory conditions for the participation of financial intermediaries to   SMEs sector are required. This would have at some stage added the positive outcome of making financial institutions   more relevant and able to attain their true potential of serving SMEs that are insufficiently developed due to lack on   access investment capital.     6.1  SMEs Initiatives to Access Debt Financing from Financial Institutions     In  support  of  development  and  SMEs  survival  access  to  debt  financing  is  very  important  in  their  potential   investments opportunities as well as their routine operations. For access to debt financing by SMEs to happen  SMEs   operators  have  to  play  their  role  to  gain  access  on  external  debt  financing  from  financial  institutions  (lenders).   Without  adequate  finances  from  lenders to  SME  sector   SMEs  cannot  acquire  or  absorb  new  technologies nor  can   they  expand  to  compete  in  global  markets  or  even  strike  business  linkages  with  larger  firms.  Similarly   lenders   cannot  consider  taking  financing  to  SMEs  as  a  viable  option  unless  their  priorities  are  addressed  by  SMEs   ownermanagers.  In  this  regard   SMEs  should  be  ready  to  be  assisted  largely  by  public  initiatives  involving   participation of the lending industry (financial institutions) by struggling to meet their requirements      Advancement on the records management is crucial; SMEs have to appreciate the need to maintain properly records   to build credibility from lenders; financial information systems should be improved by SMEs. This involves a proper   financial  accounting  system  for  SMEs  which  has  to  assure  adequate  disclosure  of  financial  information  at  least  in   three basic components of the budgetary period  the income statement  the balance sheet and the cash flow statement.   This  information  disclosure  may  allow  financial  institutions  to  be  better  informed  on  the  governance  of  SMEs   in   order  to  evaluate  more  adequately  their  credit  risk  that  might  be  involved.  The  support  system  for  SMEs  should   involve support in accessing information storage  processing and retrieval systems. The dissemination of information   and  communication  technologies  has  increased  the  availability  and  affordability  of  dedicated  software  on  standard   accounting programs customized for SMEs. The improvement of better communication with credit providers can be   also achieved by providing support to SMEs on business plan preparations for both startups and for the development   of  existing  firms.  A  wellprepared  business  plan  can  serve  both  as  a  roadmap  for  the  improvement  in  the   management of SMEs and as a means to assure better channels of communication between SMEs and lenders. It is   crucial  then  to  build  up  the  skill  base  of  SMEs  in  financial  analysis  and  business  plan  writing.  This  may  allow   improving  credit  prospects  for  young  small  firms  that  lack  tangible  asset  to  be  pledged  as  collateral  for  capital   security or do not have a credit history.     SMEs have to start saving to be able to own tangible assets that in future can be pledged as security to acquire loan at   low  interest  rates.  Collateral  is  an  important  determinant  factor  for  any  firm  to  gain  access  to  debt/credit  from   financial  institutions.  This  indicates  that  SMEs  without  collateral  will  find  it  difficult  to  obtain  debt  finance  from   lenders i.e. commercial banks  finance companies. Therefore  it necessary for owners of SMEs to start investing on   tangible assets that can be used as collateral when applying for debt financing/credit facilities from lenders in future   needs of capital investments. Consequently  SMEs owners should be investment ready as Clarke et al.  (2006) points   out that investors  look  out for  very  specific  things  when they  assess  requests  for  funding.  SMEs’  ownermanagers   (entrepreneurs)  must  be  made  aware  of  the  needs  and  concerns  of  particular  types  of  investor.  Access  to   consultations  by  SMEs  for  training  and  advises  on  the  requirements  of  financial  institutions  i.e.  banks   finance   companies  trade  creditors  etc.  can  help to  make  SME  owners  to  get  investment ready  and thus improve  access to   debt  financing.  Also   lenders  need  to  create  awareness  of  their  debt  qualifications  especially  the  importance  of   collateral through advertisements and communication with trade fairs and exhibitions.       18     European Journal of Business and Management                                                                                www.iiste.org   ISSN 22221905 (Paper) ISSN 22222839 (Online)   Vol.5  No.7  2013      Study  discovered  that  location  traceability  is  limited  by  most  of  SMEs.  Most  businesses  operate  from  isolated    temporary  informal and even illegal sites or premises. Some businesses operate on location not surveyed  there are   no street names to facilitate traceability and access by service providers also limits their properties i.e. buildings to be   used as collateral by financial institutions. Therefore  ownermanagers have to evaluate their future location of their   properties (i.e. buildings which might be used as debt security) and their business premises as they influence access   to debt financing.       Lack of business expertise and managerial competencies (education and experiences) are also important reasons why   finances are not available to SMEs. For SMEs to improve their access to debt financing  there is a need for SMEs’   ownermanagers  to  develop  themselves  in  the  area  of  business  and  management  skills  through  training  and  where   necessary  they  have  to  hire  consultants.  Most  of  Tanzanian  universities   colleges  and  vocational  training  have   entrepreneurs’  centers  for  SME  short  courses   consultancy  and  incubators  for  practical  trainings  to  educate  SMEs   stakeholders.       6.2  Tanzania Government’s Initiatives to assist SMEs Access Debt Financing from Financial Institutions       Government  should  speedup  the  national  identification  system  to  easy  traceability  of  SMEs  owners  or  reduce   difficulties arise due to lack of proper addresses and trustworthy identities of all people and potential borrowers from   financial institutions. National database of all firms operating is also required to be managed by government for easy   traceability of businesses  management of records and followups on different strategies directed to the SME sector.     However   in  Tanzania  various  public  initiatives  to  promote  finance  to  SMEs  have  not  been  as  successful  as   envisaged  because  there  has  been  some  overlapping  of  regional  and  national  initiatives.  Efforts  to  harmonize  the   standards and practices need to be properly coordinated to facilitate SME finance. Tanzania has good plans to help   SME sector but still not kept in good application. Example MKUKUTA (NSGRP I & II) stipulated how to combat   SMEs  problems  including  how  to  solve  financing  gap  affecting  the  sector  but  still  the  problems  exist.  NSGRP   recognizes  the  need  to  address  SMEs  challenges  in  improving  access  to  finance  by  the  private  sector  including   enhancement  on  access  to  credit  by  SMEs  and  rural  especially  rural  ones.  The  program  advised  about  how  to   improved investment environment by a design and implementation of a program for enhancing access to commercial   courts by  SMEs. On SMEs  sector development  the strategy  provides that  domestic  firms including SMEs will  be   supported and encouraged to be innovative  paying attention to product development  quality assurance and superior   marketing strategies that make them competitive and capable of responding to global market conditions. The factors   putaside  to  be  improved  include   (i)  Addressing  SMEs’  entrepreneurship  development  needs  for  rural  and  urban   private  producers  on  all  sectors  including  agricultural  based  industries   formal  and  informal  enterprises;  (ii)   Guaranteeing access to technological and managerial skills including marketing  market information and contacts; (ii)   Facilitating linkingup of domestic producers with local and foreign R&D institutions; (iii) Developing infrastructure   such  as  utilities   transport   power     water  and  ICTs  at  competitive  prices  in  rural  and  urban  areas  (Note  8).   Implementation of the MKUKUTA is through sector policies  strategies and programmes  which have been designed   to  address  the  SMEs  issues  during  strategy  implementations.  More  effort  is  required  by  ministries   government   agencies and local governments to play their role in empowering the SME sector as it was declared in the NSGRP so   that the benefits generated from the sector to be harnessed fully and for the development of our Tanzanian economy   (Note 9).       Further researches analysis particularly using timeseries variation  microeconomic data and country case studies are   needed to explore in more detail the policies and financing tools that can help SMEs overcome financing constraints   and expand their access to external finances. Future study also is relevant in lenders context  it important to focus on   financial  institutions  that  are  important  for  SMEs’  access  to  finance  as  well  as  going  along  with  searching  for   alternative financing tools that can work around financial institutional deficiencies to help SMEs to have permanent   access to debt financing.
