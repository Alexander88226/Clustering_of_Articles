Introduction   In  recent  years   along  with  the  development  of  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises   SMEs  are  playing   animportant role in the development of China  and become a significant part of propelling economic and social   development.  At  present   there  are  over  10  million  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  in  China   and  99%  of   enterprises in China are SMEs  which have created 60% of China's total economic output and 50% of tax revenue    and  offered  more  than  80%  jobs.  Moreover   SMEs  represent  an  indispensable  force  for  achieving  the   technological innovation and adjusting industrial structure in China.   Accelerating the development of SMEs has been widely recognized by Chinese society. Consequentially  people   begin to pay more attention to financing difficulties  which restrict the development of SMEs. In order to resolve   the  problem   the  Chinese  government  and  some  financial  institutions  have  made  great  efforts  in  reducing  the   pressure faced by SMEs. However  the problem and hurdles still exist. Getting funds from banks is the first choice   for  many  SMEs.  By  the  survey  conducted  by  Shusong  Ba  (2013)   66.7% SMEs  have  chosen  to  rely  on  loans   borrowed from banks. Very  few SMEs chose  other financing channels  including borrowing from their friends   and usurious loans. Lacking of appropriate financing channels is one of the hurdles. In addition  Chinese banks   are short of incentives to help SMEs  because the SMEs’ financing scales are not large enough.    The financing difficulty of SMEs is a worldwide issue. The adverse selection problem and moral hazard caused   by  asymmetric  information  usually  happen  to  formal  financial  institutions   because  SMEs  cannot  provide   complete  financial  information  and  effective  mortgages.  And  by  the  survey  conducted  by  Shusong  Ba  (2013)    there are about 41.4% SMEs had problems in getting loans from banks due to the absence of effective mortgages.   Moreover  during the process of economic and political reform  Chinese SMEs are restricted by several factors    including the government intervention  weak legal system  and the incompleteness of financial system. Facing the   difficulty of receiving formal financing  SMEs have to pay attention to the informal financial market. However  it   not only has increased SMEs’ financial cost  which will have a negative effect on the development of SMEs  but   also will raise the potential risk of the whole financial system. Therefore  this paper has a significant meaning in   exploring the causes of financing difficulties of Chinese SMEs.    2. Literature review and theoretical analytical framework   The major obstacle to the effective operation of credit market is that there exists asymmetric information between   lenders and borrowers. Asymmetric information will lead to adverse selection and moral hazard problems. Thus    with  the  increase  of  credit  risk  and  the  failure  of  interest  rate  tools   credit  rationing  phenomenon  takes  place   because financial institutions aim to increase profitability and reduce risk (Stiglitz and Weiss，1981). Compared   with large firms  SMEs lack of valuable mortgages  and have asymmetric information problems. Therefore  SMEs   are relatively easily controlled by banks and their credit rationing policy.    300                    © Center for Promoting Ideas  USA                                                                                                www.ijhssnet.com      The  development  of  financial  sectors  could  help  improve  financial  system’s  allocation  efficiency   decrease  the   level  of  information  asymmetry  between  lenders  and  borrowers   help  investors  evaluate  projects   and  finally   facilitate SMEs’ financing. Cetorelli and Strahan (2006) analyzed the effect brought by the local banking market   structure on the development of real economy. They found that a highlevel competition market structure will lead   to rapid growth of SMEs. Beck et al.（2005，2008a，2008b）proved that the development of financial sectors   plays a significant role in promoting the development of SMEs. The research shows that though SMEs utilize less   external  financing   the  development  of  financial  and  political  systems  would  alleviate  the  influence  on  the   development  of  SMEs  and  help  SMEs  get  external  financing  much  easier.  In  the  countries  with  highlevel   financial development  SMEs have relatively more accesses to credit funds  and thereby enhancing its proportion   of the total economy. The effect is still significant even if asymmetric information  industrial concentration and   development opportunities are controlled.  Based on the analysis above  it is clear that the scale of enterprise and   financial development are two main factors about financing difficulties of SMEs. By establishing a model  it will   be helpful to reveal the inherent logic of financing difficulties for the Chinese SMEs in the credit market.       Suppose that there are several capital suppliers and capital demanders in the credit market. In order to do a project   with R expected profits  funddemanders would need to receive K dollars from fundsuppliers to start operating   the project  and the interest rate of the loan is r  which is smaller than R（ R r ）. When the bank refuses to   provide demanders with funds  the expected profits of both sides are zero. When banks choose to offer funds to   enterprises  banks and enterprises will form a principalagent relationship. However  since there are asymmetric   information problems in the principalagent relationship  the moral hazard issues will be more likely tohappen to   enterprises.  In  other  words   the  owners  will  deliberately  evade  returning  their  debt.  When  enterprises  return   money  to  banks   enterprises  will  have  (Rr)*K  expected  profits   while  the  expected  profits  of  banks  are *r K.   However  when enterprises are unable to return the loans on time  enterprises will have (1+R)*K expected profits    while the expected profits of banks are ( K ). Hence  we have the payoff matrix below.           Table 1 The payoff matrix for banks’ choices and enterprises’ choices             Enterprises        Enterprises     Return   Default        Banks     Banks     Offer loans     (Rr)*K， *r K   (1+R)*K， K      Refuse     0，0   0，0     1  1+r       Based on the analysis above  banks should pay special attention to the credit factors of enterprises before offering   P C F， 1   and  then  the   loans.  Suppose  that  the  probability  of  returning  loans  is  described  as  the  function (  P C F  probability of dodging is1  (   ，  . Banks will only choose to offer loans if their expected profits are greater   than  or  equal  to  zero   that  is     which  can  also  be  seen  as  P C F ，  (    )] 0  .Otherwise  banks will not provide enterprises with funds.      )  r K P C F  *  ，    P C F  (  ，    * (    [1    K                )    )    )    )       P C F，   we know that compared with SMEs  large firms are   From the definition and property of the function (  able  to  get  enough  funds  from  financial  institutions   because  they  have  larger  probability  of  returning  loans.   Along  with  the  development  of  financial  system   the  level  of  asymmetric  information  between  SMEs  and   financial  institutions  will  be  lowered   and  the  probability  of  returning  loans  will  increase  a  lot.  Hence   the   financing difficulty will be relieved.                                                                  1The independent variable C represents the type of enterprise. C will equal to 1 if the enterprise is large and equal to 0 if it is   SME. Compared with the large enterprises  SMEs are harder to offer valid mortgages or complete information. Hence  the   probability  for  large  enterprises  to return  loans  on  time is higher   thatis  ， ;  the independent  variable  F   represents the level of financial development. Since the financial system has the ability of sharing risk and the function of   information  searching   then  it  could  solve  asymmetric  information  problem  for  debtor  and  lender.    Along  with  the   development of financial system  the probability for returning loans will be higher and higher and tend to approach 1  that   is       (cid 2986)(cid 2900)(cid 2986)(cid 2890)>0 (cid 1853)(cid 1866)(cid 1856)(cid 1864)(cid 1861)(cid 1865)(cid 1842)=1 (cid 1853)(cid 1871)(cid 1832)→+∞.

Analysis of the causes of current SMEs’ financing difficultiesin China   3.1 SMEs’ own problems   Firstly  the scale of SMEs limits their borrowing capacity in the financial market. Generally  the production scale   and owning capital of SMEs are relatively small. Thus  SMEs cannot get enough funds due to lacking of effective   mortgages. In addition  most of SMEs are still influenced by the traditional familyown management mode. Some   SMEs  are  short  of  necessary  financial  management   information  openness  and  highlevel  credit   which  cause   banks  to  have  a  huge  cost  of  supervising  SMEs.  Besides   during  the  process  of  expanding   SMEs  often  face   problems such as lacking of management experience  and uncertainty of technology and market. Therefore  SMEs   usually have characteristics of high birth rates and high mortality  and the loans offered by banks will face high   risk.    Comparatively   large  enterprises  have  obvious  advantages  in  several  aspects   including  financial  information    credit  rating   and  accessible  mortgages.  Hence   banks  will  have  a  relatively  low  cost  forsearching  the  fund  receivers’   theoretical  analysisabove   ，  large firms’ probability of returning loans is obviously greater than the probability of SMEs.   P  (1  ，  In other words  banks will face a relatively low risk if they choose to provide large firms with funds. In order to   lower the risk of offering funds  banks will choose to reduce the amount of funds SMEs request. The risk is raised   from asymmetric information. Due to the existence of asymmetric information  adverse selection will appear in   the financial market. Once the adverse selection appears  in order to eliminate negative effect  banks will refuse to   determine interest rates according to the level of risk. Rather  banks will establish lending conditions according to   the  information  they  have  for  enterprises.  It  is  clear  that  under  the  formal  financial  system  arrangement   the   relationship between banks and enterprises changes into the situation that banks will prefer to provide large firms   with funds and refuse to offer loans to SMEs. Quitting from the SMEs credit market becomes a rational choice for   banks  because in this way banks are able to avoid risk and achieve profit maximization.       3.2 The situation of China’s financial development   Moral hazard and adverse selection  caused by asymmetric information  are considered as the primary causes of   Chinese SMEs’ financing difficulties (Lin and Li  2001). And financial development could improve the efficiency   of financial system  reduce significantly the level of asymmetric information that exists between banks and SMEs    help  financial  institutions  process  credit  evaluation   and  identify  potential  investment  opportunities.  From  the     definition  of  function  above   it  is  clear  that(cid 2986)(cid 2900)(cid 2986)(cid 2890)>0 (cid 1853)(cid 1866)(cid 1856) (cid 1864)(cid 1861)(cid 1865)(cid 1842)=1 (cid 1853)(cid 1871) (cid 1832)→+∞.However   the  laggard  financial     large  enterprises.  Based  on     development  causes  the  probability  of  returning  loans  to  become  lower  and  lower   while  the  risk  of  providing   enterprises  with  capital  becomes  larger and  larger.  Hence   the  credit  constraints  phenomenon  is  obvious  in  the   SMEs credit market.       3.2.1The reform of Chinese financial institutions still has the characteristics of financial restraint. It is confined to   strengthen  internal  management  and  pays  less  attention  to  the  institutional  transformation.  Nowadays   Chinese   financial reform mainly focuses on the extension  such as establishing new branches  introducing new financial   instruments  and  opening  up  new  markets.  However   facing  with  more  serious  problems  that  may  impact  the   existing  institutional  framework  and  financial  order   such  as  the  admittance  and  development  of  small  and   mediumsized private financial institutions  the government is unhelpful  and avoids giving out specific plan on   this  area.  Although  there  are  some  new  financial  arrangements  already  released   there  are  no  meaningful  and   substantial  changes  happened  in  the  content  of  these  arrangement.    At  present   the  monopoly  situation  among   stateowned banks still exists. The control of interest rate and the business pattern of financial institutions have   not changed radically.    First of all  the four major stateowned banks have comparative advantages on the share percentage of deposit and   lending market. Small and mediumsized commercial banks  which can provide SMEs with financial service  only   make up a small portion. And it is still difficult for these banks to make a difference in the deposit and lending   market (see table 2).The financial system  which is dominated by major stateowned banks  has the responsibility   of managing the national macroeconomy. The ownership discrimination and credit preference problem still exist    and banks have preference of providing large enterprises and projects with financial aids. Meanwhile  due to the   inherent  shortages   SMEs  lack  of  viable  financial  channels  even  though  they  have  plenty  of  investment   opportunities.    302          © Center for Promoting Ideas  USA                                                                                                www.ijhssnet.com      According to statistics  the loans borrowed by Chinese SMEs only account for 16% of financial institutions loan   scale at present. And the financing difficulty of SMEs has not yet been alleviated.

However   due  to  the  control  of   interest rates  banks make considerable profits because of the large interest rate spreads between loan interest rate   and deposit interest rate. Hence  banks will be satisfied with their situation and pay less attention to improve their   own competitiveness. Due to the existence of large interest rate spreads  although China’s economic growth was   slow  in  2011  and  SMEs  faced  credit  squeeze   the  net  profits  of  Chinese  banking  industry  were1.0412  trillion   RMB   which  increased  277.5  billion  than  last  year.  The  growth  rate  reaches  36.3%.  The  average  profits  per   daywere2.85 billion RMB. Furthermore  statistics shows that the interest rate spreads is the most important source   of profits for the banking industry. In 2011  80% profits of commercial banks came from interest revenue  and net   interest  rate  spreadswas2.7%   which  increased  by  0.2%.  Banks  are  more  willing  to  support  large  firms  and   construction projects that make significant contribution to the economic growth of China in the last period.       However  banks are hesitant to help SMEs  which will become a large part of force that makes contribution to the   Chinese economic growth in the next period. In addition  regional small and mediumsized financial institutions    which should devote to the development of SMEs  also begin to have preference to serve large firms rather than   SMEs  because with the attraction of large interest rate spreads between loan interest rate and deposit interest rate    these  small  and  mediumsized  financial  institutions  do  not  want  to  spend  time  and  money  on  searching  the   internal  information  of  SMEs.  And  SMEs  have  to  turn  to  informal  financing   because  they  cannot  get  enough   funds from formal financial institutions. However  the lending rate of informal financing is over 20%  and some   private financing is even as high as 140%. Usurious loans suddenly become popular in certain areas  SMEs face   with a more serious situation in financing. Many SMEs’ owners cannot afford such expensive operating cost  and   they run away with borrowed funds.       Although the Chinese  government already canceled the  loan interest rates bottom  limit  in July 2013  it is only   helpful  for  large  stateowned  enterprises  to  bargain  with  commercial  banks   there  will  not  be  any  substantial   positive  influence  on  SMEs’  financing  in  short  run. Overall   the  competition  among  banks  is  not  enough   and   credit market is dominated by banks. If the relationship among financial institutions is perfect competition  then   enterprises  will  have  more  choices  of  choosing  financial  institutions  to  get  capital.  For  the  current  financial   institutions  in  China   the  competition  among  financial  institutions  is  imperfect.  Under  the  absence  of  effective   competition  banks can ignore the needs of SMEs and maintain the monopoly situation  and financing difficulties   of SMEs still exist. Meanwhile  credit rationing leads a difficult situation for SMEs in financing. Facing with the   financial  requirement  from  SMEs   banks  are  reluctant  to  raise  interest  rates.   They  would  rather  to  reduce  the   amount of offered loans  and in this way a part of financing demanders quit from the lending market.       3.2.2The  government  attaches  great  importance  to  improve  financial  intermediaries  and  pays  less  attention  to   financial market. And the government is prudent to develop capital market. Hence  the multilevel capital market   cannot be established.  The direct consequence of this type of industrial structure is that Chinese financial service   functions and risk management function are both weak. Meanwhile  social financing structure becomes single and   relies more on bank loans. Consequently  enterprises have to raise funds mainly by indirect financing channels.         303               International Journal of Humanities and Social Science                                                  Vol. 3 No. 15; August 2013      In the development of capital market  a series of arguments  which are related to the topic “Give service to state  owned enterprises or all kinds of enterprises”  have profound impact on the direction of relevant policies and the   formation  of  relevant  laws  and  regulations.  At  present   Chinese  capital  market  is  still  unenlightened   financial   transaction  is  simple  and  hard  to  satisfy  needs  of  different  scale  enterprises.  Additionally   it  is  pretty  hard  for   SMEs  to  get  the  right  of  issuing  public  stocks  and  enterprise  bonds.  Though  China  has  experience  of  western   developed countries for reference and established SMEs’ board market that provide SMEs with financial service    especially for SMEs’ financing  the market’s listing requirements are too rigorous for SMEs to enter the market.   Hence   for  most  SMEs   they  are  unable  to  enter  the  market   because  they  cannot  meet  the  requirements  for   operation scale  information transparency and operating capability. From the enterprise bond market  we can see   that  SMEs  are  hard  to  get  opportunities  to  issue  enterprise  bonds   because  issuing  enterprise  bonds  is  strictly   controlled by the  government. Lacking of  multilevel  capital market causes SMEs to rely on indirect financing   channels such as bank loans.   3.3 The problems of the financial system’s external environment   For a long time  China's economic marketization reform is mainly controlled by the Chinese government. After   implementing the tax reform  the local government’s ability of controlling resources shows an increasing trend.   Local  government officials not only pay attention to the  increase of fiscal revenue  but also focus  on the GDP   growth  to  get  promotion  (Zhou，2004，2007).  In  order  to  get  enough  fiscal  revenue  and  get  advantages  in   political  promotion   government  officials  only  care  about  the  shortterm  economic  growth  during  their  tenure.   Hence  large  enterprises and projects become preferences of the  local government. The local government often   chooses to offer land as mortgages  and provide enterprises with implicit guarantees to control the allocation of   financial resources and support their preferences  which  makes SMEs face a more difficult financing situation.   Besides   the  local  government  will  put  a  large  number  of  resources  in  economic  construction  fields  under  the   drive  of  fiscal  revenue  and  performance  examination   but  put  fewer  resources  in  credit  construction  and  legal   environment   which  help  maintain  a  healthy  environment  for  economic  development.  Therefore   it  is  no  doubt   that SMEs face a difficult situation in financing.       4. Countermeasures and Suggestions   4.1The government should regard helping SMEs and employment as the main objective instead of caring about   the  GDP  growth  only.  Moreover   the  government  ought  to  establish  a  better  financial  environment  for  SMEs’   financing  SMEs’ credit guaranty system and policybased financial institutions to support SMEs’ development.    Many developed countries have successful experience in solving SMEs’ financing difficulty  which is worth for   our  reference.  For  example   there  is  Small  Business  Administration  (called  SBA)in  the  United  States.  SBA   provides SMEs with financial support through various methods  such as direct loans  coordinate loans and loan   guarantees. In Germany  there is KFW Bankengruppe  which is the biggest government financial institution that   provides SMEs with loans in Germany. In Britain  the government has “Small Businesses Security Plan” to help   those  SMEs  that  have  potential  ability  but  cannot  get  enough  loans.  France  has  established  a  credit  guarantee   group  which  is  similar  with  mutual  funds.  Chinese  government  should  promote  the  development  of  guarantee   industry. According to Shusong Ba (2013)  due to the absence of efficient precautionary measures to credit risk   and  antirisk  system  to  immoral  behaviors   many  credit  guarantee  corporations  face  unstable  environment  and   thus have restrictions on the development. It is clear that the market failure could be remedied if the government   establishes guarantee institutions.    4.2China should continue deepening marketization reform of commercial Banks  and establish various financial   institutions coexisting commercial banking system to promote competition and improve operation efficiency of   financial institutions.    First of all  the government should formulate relevant policies to encourage commercial banks to help SMEs  and   set up new financial institutions that aim to help SMEs’ financing only. For example  according to the law of the   United  States   the  local  commercial  banks  must  put at  least  25%  of  the  total  financing  amount  to  help  SMEs.   Meanwhile  there are many small and mediumsized financial institutions that are controlled by the government to   serve SMEs’ financing  such as DZ Bank and NationalBank AGin Germany and BDPME of France.    Secondly  the government should set standards for informal financing as soon as possible  remove obstacles that   prevent private capital from involving in setting up financial institutions.       304                         © Center for Promoting Ideas  USA                                                                                                www.ijhssnet.com      In  addition   the  government  should  develop  private  commercial  banks   which  have  flexible  operation   strong   adaptability  low transaction cost and informational advantages. In this way  China can realize the diversification   of China's commercial banks and institutions.       Thirdly   the  government  should  gradually  improve  interest  rate  formation  mechanism   which  is  determined  by   supplydemand relation. The operation of interest rate marketization will help correct and eliminate distortion of   credit  funds  price   optimize  financial  resource  allocation  efficiency   and  force  stateowned  banks  to  enhance   competitiveness.       4.3The  government  should  set  standards  and  develop  the  multilevel  financial  market.  In  the  current  Chinese   Security  Markets   the  government  needs  to  transform  the  financing  function  into  capital  allocation  function  as   soon  as  possible   and  regards  capital  allocation  optimization  and  enterprise  institutional  innovation  as  stock   market’s  primary  function.  Meanwhile   by  developing  the  multilevel  financial  market  and  continuing  the   construction  of  Growth  Enterprise  Market   the  government  is  able  to  provide  SMEs  which  have  high  growth    small scale  and weak ability for resisting risk  with more financing opportunities. The government should prepare   and improve positively regional and local securities trading center  allowing some normative private companies   with good profits to trade at the counter and establishing overthecounter market. To provide SMEs with plenty   of financing opportunities  the government should strive to develop corporate bond market  and allow some SMEs    which have good operating conditions  to enter the bond market for financing.      Venture  investment  is  also  a  choice  for  SMEs’  financing.  The  United  States  has  the  most  developed  venture   investment company  which aims to help those SMEs with innovation abilities to get rid of financing difficulty.   4.4SMEs  should  strength  themselves  and  improve  their  overall  quality.  At  present   it  is  common  that  Chinese   SMEs  have  several  universal  problems   such  as  having  unsound  corporate  financial  system  and  inaccuracy   financial  reports.  SMEs  should  build  modern  enterprise  institutions   and  improve  the  standardization  of  the   enterprise's  financial  system  and  enterprise  information  transparency.  Moreover   SMEs  should  offer  effective   financial  reports  with  high  authenticity  to  help  commercial  banks  make  judgments.  Besides   SMEs  should  pay   more attention to the credit consciousness and set up a good credit image to financial institutions. When the credit   level  of  enterprise  has  risen   financial  institutions  will  change  their  impression  toward  SMEs   and  banks  will   change their credit orientation. Hence  the financing difficulty issue will be handled completely.    4.5There are some other issues that Chinese government should consider. Chinese government should consider   reducing the tax imposed on SMEs. According to another survey conducted by Shusong Ba (2013)  there are more   than 60% SMEs owners regard the tax reduction as the most helpful policy that the government should employ.   With tax reduction  owners believe that the development of their enterprises will be promoted.       References      Beck   T.   DemirgüçKunt A. Laeven L.   &  Levine R.
