To tackle these issues  many developed countries have switched to cashless economy. This paper     seeks  to  examine  the  possibility  of  converting  India  from  a  cashbased  to  a  cashless  economy     through  the  intervention  of  Fintech  Innovations.  The  major  challenges  posed  include   the     dominance of the agricultural sector  unorganized markets  nonexistence of proper infrastructure     and regulatory risks. Further  the country houses many MSMEs which would face impediments     in  the  implementation  of  technological  innovations.  This  is  likely  to  hamper  the  growth  of     Fintech  Innovations.  However   with  rapid  urbanization   prolific  use  of  internet   mobile  phones     and  increased  reliance  on  cyber  security  this  paper  observes  that  it  would  not  be  long  before     Fintech  Innovations  brings  in  an  astounding  revolution  in  the  financial  services  industry.   The     paper also observes the transition from cash based to cashless economy buttressing the vision of     India.

These  new  firms  have     been quicker than banks to take advantage of advances in digital technology  developing banking     products that are more userfriendly  cost less to deliver and are optimized for digital channels.     This  relative  success  is  unsurprising.  These  new  players  are  less  burdened  by  the  demands  of     regulatory  compliance  which  banks  are  subject  to.  They  are  unencumbered  by  complex  and     costly legacy systems. They can focus on creating singlepurpose solutions  designed to offer an     improved experience within just one product or service.           The  entire  world  revolves  around  cash  transactions.  85%  of  transactions  are  in  cash  across  the     world.  This  trend  can  be  attributed  to  few  apparent  reasons   opaqueness  of  cash  related     transactions   inability  to  trace  the  source  of  its  origin  and  a  sense  of  security  for  the  holder     (Mazzotta  B. C. 2017  October 05)          The  disadvantages  of  cashbased  system  have  lead  many  countries  to  adopt  digital  payment     modes; which in entirety is called as cashless economy. A cashless economy is one in which all     the  transactions  are  done  through  electronic  channels  such  as  debit/credit  cards   Immediate     Payment  Service  (IMPS)   National  Electronic  Funds  Transfer  (NEFT)  and  Real  Time  Gross     Settlement (RTGS) (Garg  Preeti  and Manvi Panchal 2016).           The benefits of cashless economy are eradication of black money or unaccounted money and an     elimination  of  all  the  disadvantages  of  cash  based  economy.  Cash  based  economy  increases     corruption   as  cash  economies  have  high  liquidity  leading  to  increased  money  supply  in  the     financial  system.  This  makes  the  system  less  reliable  and  less  accountable.  There  are  issues     related to the transparency of these transactions which renders it practically difficult to sift and     locate  the  fraudulent  activities.  The  less  accountability  of  the  transactions   results  in  loss  of     revenue to the government.          Fintech has been in the forefront of the technology based innovation across the world in the last     decade or so. Fintech has emerged since 1990s and has gained significance only of late. One of     the research papers suggest that fintech technology has been initiated only due to Governmental     insistence and regulation for economic development (Arner  D. W.  Barberis  J.  & Buckley  R.     P.  2016)  Fintech  is  a  semblance  between  Finance  and  Information  technology.  Financial     Technology has helped as well as transformed financial system. It is posing a challenge as well     as a threat to the existing system ( Zavolokina  Liudmila  et al.  2016)  and it is set to transform     not only the business world  but even the way consumers transact (Pollari  2016).  Further it can     connect  even  the  lower  income  classes  which  do  not  have  bank  accounts  (Michael  Zucarro      2016).          India is a unique country with organized and unorganized sectors due to which the usage  depth     and  spread  of  fintech  in  India  is  a  challenge.  Around  40  companies  have  been  formed  in  2016     alone  that  cater  to  fintech.  Fintech  concept  has  been  in  force  in  many  leading  economies     especially in UK. However India being a developing economy  it is  yet to witness potentials of     fintech  in  the  future.  In  Countries  like  Belgium   Canada   etc.  90%  of  the  consumers  make     cashless  payments   while  in  US   Australia  80%  of  transactions  are  made  through  digital  mode     (Smrity Baiju  Radha Kumari 2017).          One  hallmark  event  has  increased  the  awareness  about  the  use  and  convenience  of  fintech  in     India.  It  was DEMONETIZATION. The implications of demonetization were so extensive that     public especially the educated mass embraced fintech with open arms. Although apprehensive in     the  beginning   it  certainly  set  the  ball  rolling  after  few  months  and  was  welcomed     wholeheartedly once they saw the convenience of Fintech. India’s backbone is agriculture where     70%  of  the  households  depend  on  agriculture.  India  also  houses  many  street  vendors  whose     livelihood  depends  on  cash  based  selling.  The  main  focus  is  that  India  is  a  country  which  still     depends on cash payments for most of the transactions (Ayash Yousuf Shah 2017).     Statement of problem     Traditionally  complying financial institutions in India  suffer from major issues like overlapping     regulatory  requirements   changing  mindset  of  the  growing  population  of  the  country   skill  sets     required for dynamically adapting to the newer technology  data privacy and cyber security  lack     of  stringent  intellectual  property  rights   lack  of  awareness  about  norms  and  technological     innovations across the globe that could help in widening the horizons of innovative practices in     the country.         Need for study     The  evolution  of  financial  services   information  technology  and  market  regulations  has  led     financial institutions  business organizations  government and various stakeholders to determine     how best  to  drive fintech innovations  in their respective domain  which can bring them fruitful     outcomes.  It  further  aims  at  reducing  the  existing  risks  with  innovative  business  models  and     strategies.      Objectives     To explore the opportunities of sustenance and growth of Fintech in India     To identify the challenges that would hamper its growth     Methodology     The study is based on the literature review from various sources.     Analysis          Chart  GDP annual growth rate of India          From the above chart it can be seen that until Jan 2016  the GDP annual growth rate has been the     highest  at  9.2%.  But  after November 2016   we  can see that GDP has seen a downturn  and has     been on a nosedive since. The chart apparently depicts the immediate effect of demonetization.           Table  Status of Mobile payments in India      Mobile payments( Billion transactions)     Mobile payments value (Trillion USD)     1.0     0.2     Mobile payment percentage of overall non cash (vol)  5.0%     Mobile payment percentage of overall non cash (val)  0.2%     Source  (KPMG India 2016).     However the good effect of demonetization is that it has lead to a surge in the usage of fintech by     the  urban  population.  The  major  investors  who  have  invested  in  fintech  in  India  are  Paytm      Billdesk   Freecharge   Mobikwik   Policybazaar.  The  major  business  categories/areas  where     fintech  is  popular  are  payment  gateways   wallets   mobile  wallets  and  insurance  (KPMG  India     2016).                                                                                                                    (in percentage)               Fig.1 Comparison between cash & noncash transactions in India projected till 2025.     Source  http //www.dnaindia.com/analysis/columncashlessbutnotmoneyless2275390     From  the  above  chart  it  is  evident  that  over  the  years  India’s  noncash  usage  is  going  to  be     almost equal to cash usage. And this is possible only through robust fintech.                                       Discussion     Fintech  innovations  have  enabled  financial  and  technological  inclusion  in  developing  countries     like Brazil  China  India  Mexico  etc.  The supply side innovation of these economies are slow     and have mammoth potential for growth. The startup culture in these developing nations are also     seen as a conducive environment for investing in fintech based services (Soule  2016). A fintech     revolution  is  expected  to  streamline  the  traditional  financial  services  operations  and  bring  in     innovations  in  the  way  investors  exchange  value.  Studies  reveal  that  phased  introduction  of     technology  especially mobile technology for banking activities can be a harbinger for financial     inclusion  (Guild   J.  2017).   Financial  services  industry  would  be  transformed  to  the  extent  of     exchange of value and data over mere exchange of services.  The Indian Government’s economic     and  fiscal  reforms  via.   Demonetisation   Digital  India   UPI  based  digital  banking  payment     systems   etc.   have  paved  way  for  the  digitization  of  transactions.  These  innovations  and   the     paradigm  shift  in  the  way  value  transactions  occur   act  as  a  catalyst  to  distort  a  corrupt   non    transparent   cash  based  economy  and  transform  it  to  a  self  sufficient  and  self  reliable  cashless     economy.  Fintech  companies  leverage  on  groundbreaking  technologies  and  breakthrough     processes   thus  creating  optimal  and  economic  solutions  and  transparency  in  the  digitized     transactions. Fintech innovations improve efficiency of financial services and achieve increased     scalability  in  the  financial  market.  These  innovations  can  build  sustainable  businesses  by     reshaping  the  way  traditional  economies  work   making  a  transformational  shift  from  agile  to     cloud based technology. One undeniable contribution of fintech to the financial world is its fight     against  cybercrime.  The  Fintech  industry's’  ever  growing  promise  to  provide  seamless     transactions in a secure environment is being tested by central banks of various countries in the     areas of fund transfers and payments  consumer banking  general insurance  smart contracts and      cross  border  payments.  Governments  across  are  collaborating  with  technology  innovation     partners  like  IBM   Accenture   etc.   through  Distributed  ledger  technology  or  Block  chain     technology  thereby decentralising the regulatory framework and reducing the reliance on market     intermediaries. Market intermediaries would be forced to be more competitive and less intrusive     in  the  way  businesses  are  handled.  The  exchange  of  value  across  service  industries  at  low     transaction cost  in least possible time  is the key driver for Fintech innovations to be touted as     the next big wave of technology disruption gamechanger. Algorithmic and network security and     advanced data protection features will be appraised to make transactions remotely secure  thus      safeguarding the interests of stakeholders.      Risks and Challenges of Fintech Innovations     Fintech  innovations  have  potential  risks  and  challenges  that  need  vigilant  scrutiny  and     overhauling for the long sustenance of the technology and for the successful implementation of     the  same.  These  innovations  can  disrupt  the  infrastructural  framework  behind  which  the     traditional  financial  institutions  and  regulatory  bodies  were  formed.  The  rapid  transformation     from  a  traditional   centralised  system  to  a  digital   decentralised  system  can  pose  multitude  of     risks.  Although  digital  payment  technology  heralds  a  transformation  in  the  way  payments  are     made  it requires a culture change especially in a country like India where people are accustomed     to  cash  based  payment  (Skinner   C.  M.  2016).  The  lack  of  awareness  about  the  technological     innovations amongst the policy makers and the general public and  the impediments in enforcing     these  innovations  in  the  financial  market   present  greater  challenges  than  the  disruptive     innovation  itself  (Chiu   Iris  HY   2016).  There  is  a  widespread  threat  for  the  semiskilled  and     unskilled  category  of  human  workforce  as  the  fintech  innovative  services  require  specific     technical  skills  which  can  be  garnered  only  by  improving  the  skill  ability  of  the  workforce  in     stellar proportions. Due to the less reliance on the regulatory bodies  there can also be a possible     increase  in  technologically  advanced  criminal  activities   which  becomes  difficult  to  trace  and     thus  may result in losing confidence among the various stakeholders. Thus  regulatory risk is an     issue  to  be  weighed  by  Fintech  companies.  These  innovations  attract  continuous  research  and     development  activities  in  the  field  of  technology  that  leads  to  huge  investment  in  R&D  and     infrastructure  implementation  costs.  This   in  essence   negates  the  foundational  principles  of     prudency and cost optimisation  upon which Fintech companies base their discrete comparative     advantage.  SMEs  and  small  business  houses  might  face  competitive  redundancies  due  to  the     huge cost of implementation of these technologies.          Conclusion     This  article  concludes  after  analysing  the  existing  financial  institutions  and  infrastructure  for     payments  that  authoritative  settlement  based  on  central  bank  support  is  seen  as  being  essential     for both large value and retail payment systems and in developed countries like UK  EU and US     the  fintech  innovations  are  working  smoothly  and  successfully.  In  the  wave  of  technological     revolution where IoT is going to rule the roost  Fintech cannot be far away from this revolution     (Stich  A. 2017). It is suggested that  the transparent and complete accountable transactions at all     levels  is  likely to  bring  social benefits  through commercial developments.  It  is  also  understood     that  fintech  is  likely  to  increase  competition  and  improve  financial  inclusiveness   which  could     reduce the cost  of financial intermediaries.    The paper has analysed the  various benefits   risks     and challenges of fintech innovations in the economy.          References     Arner  D. W.  Barberis  J.  & Buckley  R. P.
