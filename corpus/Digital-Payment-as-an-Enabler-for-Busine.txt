Several Indonesian digital   payment systems  exist  namely  GoPay  Tcash   Paypro  Ovo  Mandiri ecash  XL Tunai  and   Sakuku. Digital payment is becoming increasingly popular in Indonesia  among which Go Pay is   currently the market leader. Opportunities are derived from the attributes of industries within   which business owners are contemplating action. Financial inclusion is a vital entry point for   inclusive  growth   and  GoPay  can  help  micro   small  and  medium  enterprises  which  were   previously from the underserved market to transition into the formal system.This study intends   to illustrate how digital payment enables business opportunities by using a descriptive approach   method and data collection techniques from existing literature. Results show that GoPay enables   business opportunities by fulfilling its mission as a digital payment solution and by opening up   new economic opportunities. In addition  GoPay enables consumers and merchants to tap into   a wide market and provides access to various   solutions and services.

INTRODUCTION   The  Asian  social  and  economic  landscape  is  being  transformed  by  the   proliferation of mobile technology and the digitalisation of financial services  which        Copyright  2020 GMP Press and Printing (http //buscompress.com/journalhome.html)   ISSN  23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)              Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research  Vol. 9  Supplementary Issue 1          320     have  built  and  enhanced  digital  connections.  These  connections  are  driving  e  commerce and social commerce across the region  which are also partly enabled by   digital payments. The digitalisation of Asia  coupled with a relatively young population   and rising income levels  present a unique growth opportunity for the sector (APAC    2018).     On 14 August 2014  the governor of the Bank Indonesia encouraged citizens to   reduce cash dependencies through the National NonCash Movement. The National   NonCash  Movement  aimed  to  build  public  awareness  of  noncash  payment   instruments  thereby gradually fostering a lesscash society. The central bank devised   the annual National NonCash Movement as a form of commitment to expand the use   of  noncash  instruments  and  to  support  various  activities  that  enriched  public   understanding of noncash payment methods. Compared to other ASEAN countries  the   development  of  electronicbased  payment  instruments  in  Indonesia  have  remained   relatively limited despite geographical conditions and the large population which serves   as an untapped potential for expanding access to payment systems (Segara  2014).     Digital payment services have dramatically increased around the world. This   rapid growth has largely been driven by technological innovations and the willingness   of  regulators  to provide opportunities to new specialist payment service providers to   operate without banking licenses. Moreover  it has also been aided by the continued   economic recovery of mature markets (Mas & Buckley  2016). The digital payment   growth driven by the trust in the transaction; the research by Paripunyapat & Kraiwanit   (2019)   showing  that  respondents  who  accept  transactions  made  through  financial   technology within the system of financial institutions’ safety measures; the service system   provides safety and reliability. This findings inline with Kaitawarn (2015) that stated the   privacy policy should increase trust and confident amongst the customer to accept and use   the Mobile Payment..      Digital  payment  is  becoming  increasingly  popular  in  Indonesia;  however    according  to  the  management  consultancy  McKinsey  and  Company   99%  of   transactions  by  volume  are  still  being  carried  out  using  cash  (Tay   2019).  As  a   comparisson  with much higher population  78% of all consumer payments transactions   happen through cash in India (Nahata  2018).  According to Metra Digital Innovation   (MDI)  Ventures  and  Mandiri  Sekuritas  Online  Trading  (2018)   the  proliferation of   smartphone devices since 2010 has helped the advancement of digital payment services   in Indonesia. The massive upgrade in operating systems and user interfaces  coupled   with reliable mobile internet connectivity  have enabled the significant transformation   of mobile payment services. Several digital payment systems exist in Indonesia  namely    GoPay  Tcash  Paypro  Ovo  Mandiri ecash  XL Tunai and Sakuku.

GoPay  processes  three  quarters  of  all  mobile   payments  in  Indonesia   and  GoPay  transactions  reached  US$6.3  billion  in  2018.   Moreover  electronic money (emoney) has become the most popular digital payment   platform in Indonesia  with more than 240 000 online and offline merchants.     The purpose of this paper is to discuss digital payment as an enabler for business   opportunities  that  benefit  business  owners   particularly  Micro   Small  and  Medium   Enterprises (MSMEs).   2. LITERATURE REVIEW   2.1 Digital Payment     Based  on  the  study  by  Asia  Pacific  Accreditation  Cooperation  Incorporated   (APAC)  (2018)   approximately  two  in  five  consumers  have  issues  using  and   withdrawing cash  including not having enough cash on hand (40%)  long queues at   banks/ATMs  (39%)   faulty  ATMs  and  inadequate  number  of  ATMs  nearby  (36%).   Consumers are accustomed to having instant access to most things  courtesy of highly   advanced and increasingly powerful smartphones. This innovation has created a shift   in mindsets and has raised the bar of expectations  and consumers have less patience   for long queues and faulty ATMs. Increasing digital access has presented considerable   opportunities for innovation in digital payment across Asia.     Payment  at its most basic level  is the transfer of money  wealth or value from   one person or entity to another (Fonté  2013). Digital payment is defined as payments   made or enabled through digital mobility technologies via handheld devices  with or   without  mobile  telecommunication  networks.  Although  not  necessarily  linked  to   financial  institutions  or  banks   these  payments  are  considered  as  digital  financial   transactions  (Diniz  de Albuquerque  & Cernev  2011). In line with Fonte (2013) that   stated numerous services offered by nonfinancial institutions are ‘disintermediating’   the traditional banking relationship and creating the potential for a fundamental shift in   how individuals conduct daytoday purchases and interact with their finances; Nahata   (2018)  stated  that  in  India  primarily  dominated  by  mwallets   payments  based   companies and lending aggregators. The public at large in India is primarily exposed   to the fintech industry through these Prepaid Instruments. They allow users to make   payments towards utilities  flight/train ticket purchases  remittances and many other   things.          2.2 GoPay     GoPay   which  was  created  by  the  ridehailing  application  GoJek   is        Copyright  2020 GMP Press and Printing (http //buscompress.com/journalhome.html)   ISSN  23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)              Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research  Vol. 9  Supplementary Issue 1          322     Indonesia’s first decacorn after its valuation hit US$10 billion. According to Azzuhri   et al (2018)  Gojek is an online courier company which uses creative and innovative   motorcycle fleets because it is not only a transportation business  but also covers almost   all the scopes of people's needs.      GoJek   which  was  founded  by  Nadiem  Makarim   has  obtained  capital   injections from a number of companies  including Google  Tencent Holdings  Temasek   Holdings   Astra  International  and  Meituan  Dianping.  The  company  reportedly   collected a capital injection of $1.5 billion from numerous investors in 2018 and $1   billion during the first quarter of 2019. GoJek used this capital to expand to numerous   countries in Southeast Asia and to optimise its GPay digital payment feature (The   Jakarta Post  2019).     GoJek gathers numerous features and services under a single application. Users   can  select  different  services  according  to  their  needs  and  moods   namely   1)  ride   hailing  such as GoRide  GoCar or GoBluebird; 2) food delivery  such as GoFood;   3) grocery buying  such as GoMart or GoShop; 4) medical needs  such as GoMed; 5)   movie or event ticket bookings  such as GoTix!; 6) logistical needs  such as GoSend   or GoBox; 7) phone credits or mobile data package purchasing  such as GoPulsa; 8)   bills payment  such as GoBills; 9) general payment  such as GoPay and 10) other   features and services  such as GoMassage  GoClean  GoAuto and GoGlam.     GoJek serves over 8 million users and has facilitated transactions which in   turn  have  helped  create  more  than  500 000  jobs  for  service  providers   including   motorcycle drivers. Go Pay and three addition companies  namely  Kartuku  Midtrans   and Mapan  laid the foundation for the GoJek financial service ecosystem  and GoPay   will continue its role as an emoney wallet. In addition  it will fulfill its mission to   leapfrog  Indonesia  to  the  digital  era   bringing  financial  inclusion  to  260  million   Indonesians. Customers prefer using GoPay on their GoJek application owing to its   promotions  ease of use and hasslefree transaction which has eliminated the need to   fumble  for  small  change.  Furthermore   GoPay  is  a  secure   trusted  platform  with  a   certified license from the Bank of Indonesia. By October 2017  GoPay transactions   contributed 30% of the overall emoney transactions in Indonesia. In 2017  Go Jek was   awarded as the most proactive Fintech company that supported the National NonCash   Movement.   2.3 Business Opportunity     Opportunities are derived from the attributes of industries (or markets) within   which  an  entrepreneur  (or  a  business  owner)  is  contemplating  action.  Thus   if  an   entrepreneur understands the attributes/structures of an industry  he/she can anticipate   the kinds of opportunities that exist in that industry. Entrepreneurial alertness is not a        Copyright  2020 GMP Press and Printing (http //buscompress.com/journalhome.html)   ISSN  23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)              Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research  Vol. 9  Supplementary Issue 1          323     deliberate  search  but  rather  the  constant  scanning  of  the  environment  by  an   entrepreneur  who  notices  market  imperfections.  While  opportunities  may  exist   independent of economic actors  economic actors  must  act  on  opportunities  because   they lack agency  and individuals can only earn profits if they recognise opportunities   and their values (Alvarez  2010).     Shane  &  Venkataraman  (2000)  defined  opportunity  as  the  individuals  and   processes  that  lead  to  the  discovery   evaluation  and  exploitation  of  opportunities.   Denrell  Fang and Winter (2003) defined it as the development of a framework for   analysing  strategic  factor  market  inefficiencies   which  suggests  that  strategic   opportunities represent a situation in which prices fail to reflect the value that represents   a resource’s best use. According to Short and Ireland (2010)  one must understand the   temporal dynamics of opportunities to fully understand the opportunity process.     The  opportunity  discovery  and  recognition  perspective  is  believed  to  be  an   entrepreneurial  risk  wherein  entrepreneurs  can  fold  information  about  possible   decisions  to  exploit available opportunities for entrepreneurial success. Meanwhile    entrepreneurial success is the business outcome derived from the exploitation of such   available opportunities (Shamudeen  Keat & Hassan  2017). Small firms are generally   capable of identifying opportunities but less adept at appropriating value by developing   competitive advantages (Ireland  Hitt  & Sirmon  2003)   3. METHOD     This study used the qualitative research method  and data collection techniques   from existing literature were applied on data from the PricewaterhouseCoopers (PWC)   Indonesia report  APAC  the PayPal Inc. report  the MDI and Mandiri Sekuritas reports    GoJek internal media data and reports  the World Bank Group and World Economic   Forum reports  the Jakarta  Post   CNBC  and  the  Lembaga  Demografi  University  of   Indonesia report on GoJek.     Following Lambert and Lambert (2012)  data were analysed using a descriptive   method to discover the nature of the specific events being studied. The data collection   techniques in this study included the observations and examination of records  reports    photographs and documents.   4. RESEARCH FINDINGS     Digital disruption has driven Indonesian banks  including joint venture banks    local banks  stateowned banks and Syariah banks  to consider digital initiatives as part   of their corporate strategies. However  a considerable difference exists between how   large banks and stateowned banks view digital strategies. According to a survey  only        Copyright  2020 GMP Press and Printing (http //buscompress.com/journalhome.html)   ISSN  23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)              Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research  Vol. 9  Supplementary Issue 1          324     38% of stateowned banks and 44% of large banks have incorporated digital initiatives   as part of their corporate strategies. This finding may be an indication that large banks   have started on their journeys towards digital transformation; however  challenges in   developing a common digital strategy view across these banks still exist. Product teams    customer service teams  IT teams and dedicated digital teams hold differing views in   terms of digital strategies (PWC  2018).     The popularity of digital payment has also changed the expectations of bank   clients primarily because of digitisation. Whether in the form of disruption  revolution   or evolution  major changes are taking place in the banking sector mainly because of   new technologies. Established banks  new fintech  supervisory authorities and other   parties are all jostling for positions in the new banking landscape. According to PWC   (2018)  Indonesian bankers investing in such areas are indicating investments in digital   banking platforms in the next two to three years.      According  to  Teima  (2016)   the  development  and  acceleration  of  electronic   merchant payments can help countries advance financial access and financial inclusion.   However  multiple factors hinder the adoption of electronic payments by merchants.   Six obstacles have been identified as significant impediments that hinder the deepening   of these payment systems  especially in developing countries  namely  1) inadequate   value  proposition  for  merchants   including  product  designs  that  do  not  adequately   encourage  migration  from  cash  to  electronic  payments   2)  weak  product  and   stakeholder economics in traditional card models  3) insufficient aggregate customer   demand needed to reach the ‘tipping point’ that drives demand and supply towards an   electronic  payments  ecosystem   4)  inconsistent  technological  infrastructure  and   regulatory  environment  in  developing  markets  to  support  electronic  payments   5)   ineffective distribution models to serve hardtoreach merchants in areas with limited   economic capillarity (i.e. low density of MSMEs and customer populations) and 6)   difficulty in formalising enterprises and the reluctance of merchants to pay full taxes   on sales.     The expansion of Indonesia’s digital economy will have benefits beyond its   impact on the GDP  including creating jobs and formalising informal ones  opening the   export market that the International Trade Centre estimates could be worth as much as   $26 billion and accelerating social development. Digitisation could impact the economy   and  society  which  have  pushed  hard  for  its  rapid  adoption.  In  addition  to  creating   significant  business  opportunities   the  rapid  development  of  digital  Indonesia  has  a   considerable impact on citizens in terms of new jobs  improved access to services and   connectivity with the global society. However  McKinsey and Company (2017) found        Copyright  2020 GMP Press and Printing (http //buscompress.com/journalhome.html)   ISSN  23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)              Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research  Vol. 9  Supplementary Issue 1          325     that there are three fundamental challenges that hinder digital economy in Indonesia    namely   1)  the  extraordinary  talent  shortages  in  the  digital  arena   such  as  digital   professionals  digital facilitators and digitalsavvy leaders; 2) the shortfall of midsize   to large companies that could capture domestic consumption or export opportunities if   the digital economy were unleashed and 3) the insufficient means of tracking the impact   of digitalisation on Indonesian society. (Das et al.  2018).     Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) in Indonesia face numerous   challenges to expand and catch up with big  established businesses; as indicated by   Muhyi (2017) condition of personal entrepreneurial skills of small entrepreneurs based   on his research is moderate; meaning that they are need help to grow. GoJek helps   MSMEs answer challenges and creates a level playing field for MSMEs to spread their   wings. MSMEs can operate efficiently because they can take advantage of the various   services  within  GoJek’s  ecosystem  to  help  reduce  operational  costs  and  expand   businesses  without  excessive  investment.  Moreover   GoJek’s  ecosystem  gives   MSMEs increased access to markets. By joining GoJek  MSMEs can have an online   presence without needing to invest in creating websites. In addition  MSMEs can access   more than 98 million potential customers in Indonesia who have downloaded the Go  Jek application   without significantly investing in market expansion activities. GoJek   has  been  estimated  to  contribute  Rp8.2  trillion  annually  (US$577million)  to  the   Indonesian economy through the income of its driver partners. Furthermore  GoJek   has  been  estimated  to  contribute  Rp1.7  trillion  (US$119 7million)  annually  to  the   Indonesian  economy  through  the  income  of  its  small  and  mediumsized  enterprise   (SME) partners (Wisana et al.  2018).     GoJek accelerates the growth of MSMEs to do business in the digital economy.   It enables consumers and merchants to tap into social media to buy and sell goods and   services. Social commerce  as this trend is called  is helping to improve financial health   across the  region.  GoPay  has  enabled  MSMEs  to  instantly  become  cashless  and   bankable.  Over  65%  of  merchants  currently  using  GoPay’s  QR  code  as  cashless   payments are MSMEs   ranging   from street vendors to small stall owners. Das et al.   (2018)  suggested  the  conversion  to  cashless  payments   allowing  financial  service   providers to help migrate consumers to digital payment and to provide lending to small   enterprises.     According to Medium Corporation (2018)  financial inclusion a vital entry point   for inclusive growth  and GoPay can help MSMEs  which were previously excluded   and part of the underserved market to transition into the formal system by opening SME   bank  accounts  and  equipping  them  with  the  needed  tools  to  access  other  financial   services. By joining Go Food  merchants have improved their bookkeeping (digital        Copyright  2020 GMP Press and Printing (http //buscompress.com/journalhome.html)   ISSN  23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)              Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research  Vol. 9  Supplementary Issue 1          326     and  thus  an  accurate  record  of  transactions)   which  they  can  utilise  to  apply  for   traditional bank loans to scale their business. Robust inclusion requires an endtoend   ecosystem that can only be designed by comprehensively understanding the challenges   faced by MSMEs and by working towards effective solutions to address them.      The GoPay digital payment in GoJek’s ecosystem has helped in the discovery   and in the exploitation of opportunities to access wide market penetrations. In addition    it has helped MSEMs in terms of strategic opportunities that represent the best use of a   resource through the sharing ecosystem to expand the business.     Borrowing from the theory of business opportunity  GoPay has been utilised   by GoJek  which incorporated its digital initiatives as part of its corporate strategy to   tap business opportunities and to help MSMEs to gain access for business success.               Theory of     Business Opportunity   To earn profit by   recognising opportunities   and their values (Alvarez    2010)     Process to lead   discoveries and to   exploit opportunities   (Shane &   Venkataraman  2000)   Analysing strategic factor   market ineffiencies   (Denrell  Fang  & Winter;   2003)   Understanding the   opportunity process and   temporal dynamics (Short   & Ireland  2010)     Business Opportunity Enabled by Digital     Payment     Digital payment solutions open up new economic   opportunities as they enable consumers and merchants to tap   into social media to buy and sell goods and services. Social   commerce  as this trend is called  is helping to improve   financial health across the region.   Digital payment providers have a unique opportunity to   play key roles in improving financial health and inclusion.   GoPay helps in the discovery and in the exploitation of   opportunities to access wide market penetrations and to   expand different markets.     GoPay helps MSMEs in term of strategic opportunities that   represent a resource’s best use through the sharing ecosytem   to expand the business.     GoJek understands the impact of digitisation on the economy   and society  which has pushed for rapid adoption to create   significant business opportunities that have a substantial   impact on citizens as temporal dynamics  by improving   access to services and considerable connectivity with the   global society and by monetising opportunities through Go  Pay.        4. CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION   4.1 Conclusion     The  popularity  of  digital  payment  used  by  the  consumers  have  changed  the        Copyright  2020 GMP Press and Printing (http //buscompress.com/journalhome.html)   ISSN  23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)              Review of Integrative Business and Economics Research  Vol. 9  Supplementary Issue 1          327     expectations of bank clients primarily because of digitisation.     The development and acceleration of electronic merchant payments at a broad   level can  help  countries  advance  financial  access  and  financial  inclusion.  However    factors that hinder the adoption of digital payments exist and should be addressed.     Financial inclusion a vital entry point for inclusive growth  and GoPay can help   MSMEs that were previously excluded and part of the underserved market to transition   into the formal system.     Digital payment solutions enable consumers and merchants to tap into social   media to buy and sell goods and services and to open up new economic opportunities.   4.2 Suggestion     Consumers  and  merchants  are  becoming  increasingly  aware  that  digital   payment  is  starting  to  have  an  impact  beyond  enabling  convenient  and  secure   transactions.     Companies should innovate to cater to the needs of the customer  considering   factors such as smartphone penetration  income levels  user preferences and privacy   and security concerns.     Governments  could  reduce  barriers  and  encourage  adoption  by  leading  by     example by embracing digital payment solutions for governmentrelated fees.
