However despite their importance to the economy   most of   the  SMEs  are  not  able  to  stand  up  to  the  challenges  of  globalization   mainly  because  of   difficulties in the area of financing. With the opening up of the Indian economy  it has become   necessary  to  consider  measures  for  smoothening  the  flow  of  credit  to  this  sector.  This  article   provides  a  cross  country  perspective  in  this  regard  and  highlights  the  Indian  scenario  with   reference to SME lending. SMEs make a major contribution to the growth and employment and   their ability to grow depends on their potential to invest in technology  restructuring  innovation   and  human  resource  development.  Access  to finance  in  time  and  in  adequate measure  has  been   made out as a key factor affecting the healthy growth of the sector.

Over  a  period  of  time   it  has  been  proved  that  SMEs  are          11     International Journal of Financial Management Research and Development (IJFMRD)  ISSN XXXX –   XXXX(Print)  ISSN XXXX – XXXX(Online)  Volume 1  Number 1  January  April (2011)     dynamic  innovative and most importantly  the employer of first resort to millions of people in the   country. The sector is a breeding ground for entrepreneurship. The importance of SME sector is   wellrecognized  world  over  owing  to  its  significant  contribution  in  achieving  various  socio  economic objectives  such as employment generation  contribution to national output and exports    fostering new entrepreneurship and to provide depth to industrial base of the economy.      Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are the backbone of all economies and are a key source of   economic  growth   dynamism  and  flexibility  in  advanced  industrialized  countries   as  well  as  in   emerging  and  developing  economies.  SMEs  constitute  the  dominant  form  of  business   organization   accounting  for  over  95%  and  up  to  99%  of  enterprises  depending  on  the  country.   They  are  responsible  for  between  6070%  net  job  creations  in  developing  countries.  Small   businesses  are  particularly  important  for  bringing  innovative  products  or  techniques  to  the   market.  SMEs  are  vital  for  economic  growth  and  development  in  both  industrialized  and   developing countries  by playing a key role in creating new jobs. Financing is necessary to help   them  set  up  and  expand  their  operations   develop  new  products   and  invest  in  new  staff  or   production  facilities.  SME  finance  is  funding  of  small  and  medium  sized  enterprises  and   represents  a  major  function  of  the  general  business  finance  market.  Banks  are  playing  a  major   role in financing SMEs in India. Nearly 82% of the total SME financing is through banks. And   among  them  the  major  share  is  of  public  sector  banks  i.e.  57%.  Thus  it  is  clear  that  the  most   common source of finance for SMEs is Bank Financing. There are number of banks that assist the   SMEs  for  financing.  The  main  channel  used  by  the  SMEs  via  Banks  is  specialized  loans  by   various banks. The main reason for choosing bank loans by SMEs compared to other sources of   financing like venture capital  PE funding etc is that is only interest to be paid no stake is to be   diluted  thus  the  whole  command  of  the  SME  is  with  the  owner  only.  There  are  a  number  of   Private as well as Public sector banks who assist SME in financing.       Financing  is  one  of  the  necessary  prerequisites  for  SMEs  development  such  as  legislative    marketing  and  research  requirements.  Lack  of  finance  represents  a  major  obstacle  to  SMEs   growth and development. It is undeniable that in both developed and developing countries  SMEs   traditionally lacked access to formal credit  particularly longterm finance. This is because SMEs   are considered of high risk due to insufficient assets  low capitalization and lack of collateral as   well as high vulnerability to market conditions.      Options for Financing SMEs         1.  Equity Financing          Equity  finance  (owners  or  investors)  is  important  for  maintaining  a  sustainable  capital   structure particularly at the early startup and expansion stages. Without adequate equity   there can be a  problem  accessing  debt  financing.  Investors  will  expect a return  on  their   investment  commensurate  with  their  risk  and  they  mostly  would  like  to  have  a  say  in   running  the  business.  Sometimes  raising  startup  capital  requires  sharing  business   ownership among investors who contribute to capital  who may or may not participate in   the day to day operations of the business. Equity finance does not put obligation on the   firm  to  pay  back  to  the  investors.  All  that  the  investors  get  for  their  money  is  the   percentage  of  the  business’  net  earnings   whether  profit  or  loss   liabilities  or  assets   associated with it. Investors can bring in their experience in running the business and also   establish networks that would contribute to the growth of the enterprise.        2.  Hybrid Capital      12          International Journal of Financial Management Research and Development (IJFMRD)  ISSN XXXX –   XXXX(Print)  ISSN XXXX – XXXX(Online)  Volume 1  Number 1  January  April (2011)         Hybrid  capital  invariably  refers  to  a  combination  of  equity  and  debt  with  capacity  to   convert  as  equity  at  a  particular  growth  stage  of  the  company.  In  India   several  SMEs   took this route as it provides comfort for the investor in terms of the debt provider doing   the  due  diligence  and  project  appraisal  to  assure  safe  investment  and  the  debt  provider   derives the comfort of having to look to provision of the required equity from the venture   at the beginning. Sometimes  during the growth of the company  the financing institution   may suggest ways of raising equity and provide comfort to the equity provider over the   safety of the investment.        3.  Venture Capital         Venture  capital  refers  to  independently  managed  and  dedicated  pools  of  capital  that   decides to put in an equitylinked investments in privately held  high growth companies;   it  generally  expects  a  high  return  for  the  risk  it  takes.  Venture  capital  is  generally   synonymous  with  private  equity.  Venture  capitals  may  obtain  some  income  from   dividends from the companies they invest in but they obtain most of their earnings from   capital gain from their investments. Venture capitalists would not generally take part in   daytoday  running  of  the  company   although  provision  of  management  and  technical   expertise can often be a condition of Venture capital funding. They commonly acts as a   mentors and a business partners to see that the company grows and succeeds  which is in   the  best  interests  of  all  concerned   including  the  venture  capitalist.  Several  IT   Biotech   and  Pharmaceutical  companies  have  used  VC  funds  very  successfully  in  their  initial   years. They seek to exit within a period of five to seven years. Exit strategies can differ   and may include being bought out by the company’s principals  a public listing  or sales   of the VC’s shares to a third party at a premium. The strategy needs to be negotiated at   the beginning of the VC investment. Most VCs have a portfolio of investments to spread   their risks evenly.        4.  Angel Funds      Angels pool money and invest in larger deals; they diversify across multiple investments;   they  leverage  network  contacts  and  investments  expertise  (such  as  screening   valuation   and monitoring); and add followon rounds to existing investments unlike the VCs. Angel   funds  have  entered  retail  markets   real  estate  ventures   information  technology  and   biotech industry.        5.  Debt Financing         Smaller firms often find it more difficult to access debt financing than the larger firms for   the simple reason that they do not have acceptable collateral of adequate value. Some of   the common difficulties associated with lending to SMEs include      Insufficient ploughback of profits.     •  Low levels of equity.   •  Undercapitalization and lack of financial strength.   •   •  Nature of security and its valuation on the balancesheet.   •  Poor reporting systems.   •  Poor understanding of financial data.               13     International Journal of Financial Management Research and Development (IJFMRD)  ISSN XXXX –   XXXX(Print)  ISSN XXXX – XXXX(Online)  Volume 1  Number 1  January  April (2011)     ISSUES OF FINANCING SME SECTOR       There are a number of issues in lending to the SME sector  which banks generally face. The key   issues among them are outlined below         (a)  Information Asymmetry           Accurate information about the borrower is a critical input for decisionmaking  by banks in the   lending process. Where information asymmetry (a situation where business owners or managers   know  more  about  the  prospects  for   and  risks  facing  their  business  than  their  lenders)  exists    lenders may respond by increasing lending margins to levels in excess of that which the inherent   risks would require. However  the sheer ticket size of SME lending makes it in viable for banks to   invest  in  development  of  information  systems  about  SME  borrowers.  In  such  situations   banks   may also curtail the extent of lending even when SMEs are willing to pay a fair risk adjusted cost   of capital. The implication of raising interest rates and/or curtailing lending is that banks will not   be able to finance as many projects as otherwise would have been the case.        (b)  Granularity            This  refers  to  a  situation  where  the  risk  grading  system  at  banks  does  not  have  the  requisite   capability  to  discriminate  between  good  and  bad  risks.  The  consequence  is  tightening  of  credit   terms  or an increase in prices  or both. From the borrower’s perspective  this leads to an outcome   where the bank is overpricing good risks and underpricing bad risks. The fact that most banks in   India  have  not  developed  adequate  expertise  in  SME lending  risk  assessment  exercises  leads  to   the problem of granularity when it comes to SME lending.        (c)  Pecking Order Theory           Pecking order theory flows from the above two issues  which makes SME lending highly difficult   for banks. Under this hypothesis  SMEs  which face a cost of lending that is above the true risk  adjusted cost  will have incentives to seek out alternative sources of funding. Evidence suggests   that  in  such  situations  SMEs  prefer  to  utilize  retained  earnings  instead  of  raising  loans  from   banks.        (d)  Moral Hazard          Even when loans are made to SMEs  it may so happen that the owners of these SMEs take higher   risks  than  they  otherwise  would  without  lending  support  from  the  banks.  One  reason  for  this   situation  is  that  the  owner  of  the  firm  benefits  fully  from  any  additional  returns  but  does  not   suffer disproportionately if the firm is liquidated. This is referred to as the moral hazard problem    which can be viewed as creating a situation of overinvestment. The moral hazard problem may    thus  result in SME lending turning bad in a short period of time  a situation that all banks would   like to avoid.          (e)  Switching Costs            SMEs may find it harder to switch banks  when countered with any issue. It is a known fact that   the smaller the business  the more significant the switching costs are likely to be and  therefore  it   is less likely that the benefits of switching outweigh the costs involved. This situation results in   SME lending becoming a seller’s market  which may not be attractive to SME borrowers.     14          International Journal of Financial Management Research and Development (IJFMRD)  ISSN XXXX –   XXXX(Print)  ISSN XXXX – XXXX(Online)  Volume 1  Number 1  January  April (2011)        Steps for Smooth SME Lending      In  order  to  ensure  that  the  above  issues  do  not  stand  between  SMEs  and  Bank  Finance   the   following steps could be taken as remedial measures         (a)  Collateral          Existence  of  collateral  that  can  be  offered  to  banks  by  SMEs  could  be  one  effective  way  of   mitigating  risk.  Banks  could   therefore   look  at  collateral  when  pursuing  the  question  of  SME   lending. It can also be stated that a borrower’s willingness to accept a collateralized loan contract   offering  lower  interest  (relative  to  unsecured  loans)  will  be  inversely  related  to  its  default  risk.   However  not all SMEs would be able to offer collateral to banks. Hence  Reserve Bank of India   (RBI) allows banks  with a good track record and financial position on SSI units  to dispense with   collateral requirements for loans up to Rs. 25 lakhs.        (b)   Relationships          The length of the relationship between a bank and its SME customers is also an important factor   in  reducing  information  asymmetry   as  an  established  relationship  helps  to  create  economies  of   scale  in  information  production.  A  relationship  between  a  SME  and  a  bank  of  considerable   duration  allows  the  bank  to  build  up  a  good  picture  of  the  SME   the  industry  within  which  it   operates and the caliber of the people running the business. The closer the relationship  the better   are the signals received by the bank regarding managerial attributes and business prospects.        (c)  Quality of Information           SMEs  are  required  to  provide  accurate  and  qualitative  information  to  the  banks  for  them  to   undertake  a  reliable  risk  assessment.  Accurate  risk  assessments  obviously  rely  upon  good   information regarding the SME and its prospects. Hence  it is suggested that banks should make   efforts to encourage SMEs to improve the quality of information provided.        (d)  Customer Consideration           The  SME  markets  is  somewhat  different  to  the  corporate  market  in  that  corporate  customers   generally  have  a  wide  range  of  financing  options  to  choose  from  and  are  not  as  dependent  on   bank  financing  as  is  the  case  with  SMEs.  The  extent  to  which  SMEs  can  take  necessary  steps    with  the  aid  of  public  initiatives   to  easily  switch  to  another  bank  is  another  factor  that  can   influence the level of competitive  pressure on banks in the case of SME lending.      Role of Government and Banking Regulator in SME Lending      As is apparent  the above factors are only idealistic solutions and may not be practical for SMEs   to follow because they are faced with several problems such as weak financial strength  inability   to provide adequate collateral and other factors. Hence  the Government and banking supervisors   should  take  a  holistic  view  of  the  SME  Sector  while  considering  SME  financing   taking  into   account the risks faced by banks and the problems faced by SMEs. In this regard  the initiatives   taken up by the Government and Banking Regulators across various countries and in India are as   follows         15          International Journal of Financial Management Research and Development (IJFMRD)  ISSN XXXX –   XXXX(Print)  ISSN XXXX – XXXX(Online)  Volume 1  Number 1  January  April (2011)     (a)  Crosscountry perspectives           Increased  competition  in  financial  markets  in  developed  countries  has  led  several  Governments   and Banking Regulators to encourage banks and other financial institutions to launch a number of   initiatives to serve the financing needs of SMEs effectively. Some of these initiatives (along with   necessary  government  and  regulatory  support)  include  the  promotion  of  venture  capital;   receivables  financing;  leasing  finance;  soft  loans   grants   and  guarantees  for  entry  into  public    tenders;  setting  up  of  special  financing  companies  with  state  participation;  microfinance   programmes   etc.  For  instance   New  Zealand  has  introduced  a  scheme  called  ‘BIZ  Investment   Ready’  which targets innovative businesses and entrepreneurs seeking funds to expand  diversify   or commercialize a new concept. The European Union has devised a scheme to facilitate contacts   between SMEs and banks and other financial institutions  by developing a ‘code of good practice’   for SME lending. The Philippines has instituted a financing programme called SME Force (SME   Financing  for  Organizationally  Competent  and  Excellent  Franchise  Businesses)   which  is  a   franchise  development  financing  facility  that  will  be  implemented  with  the  participation  of   franchiser organization.         (b)  Indian scenario – Government initiatives            Even in India  the financing of the SME sector has received some attention since independence.   Some of the initiatives taken by the Government in this regard are as follows      •  Setting  up  of  the  Small  Industries  Development  Bank  of  India  (SIDBI)   as  the  apex   refinance  institution  in  India  for  the  purpose  of  channeling  of  finance  to  Small  Scale   Industries (SSIs) and SMEs in an organized manner.     •  SIDBI  has  proposed  two  fund  based  initiatives  for  improving  credit  flow  to  the  SME     sector as follows         (cid 1)  A  contribution  of  Rs.  100crore  to  the  Rs.  500crore  corpus  of  the  SME  Growth   Fund  (SGF)   which  shall  make  primarily  equity/equity  related  capital   investments  in  accordance  with  SEBI  guidelines  in  SMEs  operating  in  various   growth sectors such as the life sciences  biotechnology  etc.     (cid 1)  The SME Fund of Rs. 10 000crore to give an impetus to the flow of funds to the   SME sector. This fund has begun operations with effect from April 2004. Under   the  Fund   assistance  is  provided  to  SMEs  at  affordable  rates  of  interest   and   direct  finance  is  extended  to  SMEs  through  SIDBI’s  network  of  branches.   Further   refinance  to  State  Financial  Corporation’s  (SFCs)  has  also  been  made   attractive in terms of low rates of interest.     •  The Government of India has launched the Credit Linked Capital Subsidy Scheme   (CLCSS)  which aims at facilitating technology up gradation of SMEs in specified   products/subsectors.      •  SIDBI  has  recently  negotiated  a  line  of  credit  with  the  World  Bank  for  financing  and   development of SMEs in India  with a view to upscale the credit flow to the sector and   raising resources for the SME Fund.              16                    International Journal of Financial Management Research and Development (IJFMRD)  ISSN XXXX –   XXXX(Print)  ISSN XXXX – XXXX(Online)  Volume 1  Number 1  January  April (2011)     (c)  Indian scenario – RBI initiatives           The RBI  from time to time  has formed several committees and working groups to study the flow   of credit to the SME sector in a comprehensive manner  and has issued detailed guidelines in this   regard.  Recently  it  has  constituted  an  Internal  Group  under  the  Chairmanship  of  Shri  C.  S.   Murthy  to   interalia   consider  the  relaxation  and  liberalization  of  credit  lending  norms  that  are   applicable to the SME sector. The Group has submitted its report on June 6  2005.   The Internal Group  with reference to financing of SMEs  has recommended      •  Constitution  of  empowered  committees  at  the  regional  offices  of  the  Reserve  Bank  to   periodically  review  the  progress  in  SME  financing  and  also  to  coordinate  with  other   banks/financial institutions and the state governments in removing bottlenecks  if any  to   ensure smooth flow of credit to the sector.        •  Opening  of  specialized  SME  branches  in  identified  clusters/centers  with  preponderance   of  SME  units  to  enable  entrepreneurs  to  have  easy  access  to  bank  credit  and  to  equip   bank personnel to develop the requisite expertise.          •  Empowerment  of  the  boards  of  banks  to  formulate  policies  relating  to  restructuring  of     accounts of SME units subject to certain guidelines.        •  Restructuring  of  accounts  of  corporate  SME  borrowers  having  credit limits  aggregating   Rs.10crore or more under multiple banking arrangements to be covered under the revised   CDR  mechanism.  Appropriate  authorities  are  currently  examining   the  above   recommendations of the Internal Group.     ISSUES IN SME FINANCING      The development literature focuses a good deal of attention on issues faced by SME in accessing   finance. Traditionally  the focus is on obstacles created by commercial banks or equity funds  or   on  imperfections  in  the  broader  institutional  environment.  However   SME  also  make  decisions   about  financing  and  display  attitudes  that  have  an  important  bearing  on  financing  decisions.   Therefore  constraints may also appear on the ‘demand side’ of the financing marketplace.      Obstacles to SME Financing      The  economics  literature  on  enterprise  financing  has  identified  three  main  obstacles  that  may   prevent SME from obtaining adequate financing which are as follows      •  The  existence  of  marked  informational  asymmetries  between  small  businesses  and     lenders  or outside investors;      •  The intrinsic higher risk associated with small scale activities;    •  The existence of sizeable transactions costs in handling SME financing.          In  developing  countries   these  problems  are  often  exacerbated  by  institutional  factors.  These   aspects are briefly dealt with below       Informational Asymmetries      Informational asymmetries are always present in enterprise financing transactions. Entrepreneurs   typically  possess  privileged  information  on  their  businesses  that  cannot  be  easily  accessed—or   cannot  be  accessed  at  all—by  prospective  lenders  or  outside  investors.  This  leads  to  two          17     International Journal of Financial Management Research and Development (IJFMRD)  ISSN XXXX –   XXXX(Print)  ISSN XXXX – XXXX(Online)  Volume 1  Number 1  January  April (2011)     problems.  First   the  lender/investor  may  not  be  able  to  differentiate  adequately  between  ‘high   quality’ and ‘low quality’ companies and projects. In that case  price variables (i.e. interest rates)   may not work well as a screening device  because high interests may lead to an excessively risky   portfolio (the ‘adverse selection’ problem). Second  once the lenders/investors have supplied the   funding   they  may  not  be  able  to  assess  whether  the  enterprise  is  utilizing  the  funds  in  an   appropriate way (the ‘moral hazard’ problem). To mitigate these problems  bankers and outside   investors  may  adopt  precautionary  measures   such  as  requiring  that  financing  be  collateralized.   Ultimately   they  may  simply  turn  down  the  request  financing  (‘credit  rationing’).  Informational   asymmetries  tend  to  pose  more  severe  problems  for  SME   than  for  larger  business.  The   information  that  SME  can  realistically  provide  to  external  financiers  (in  the  form  of  financial   accounts   business  plans   feasibility  studies   etc.)  often  lacks  detail  and  rigor.  This  problem  is   often  aggravated  by  the  low  level  of  education  of  small  entrepreneurs   who  may  not  be  in  the   position to adequately articulate their case.   This problem is particularly acute in developing countries. The information supplied to bankers   and outside investors by familyowned SME is often not fully accurate and realistic  and opaque   behavior  may  prevail.  Under  these  conditions   outside  financiers  tend  to  adopt  a  very  cautious   attitude towards SME  and either reduce the amount of financing sought or refuse it altogether.      Risk Profile      Another approach ascribes the difficulties faced by SME in accessing finance to their higher risk   profile.  Suppliers  of  external  funds  regard  SME  as  riskier  enterprises  for  a  number  of  reasons.   Firstly   SME  face  a  more  uncertain  competitive  environment  than  larger  companies  they   experience  more  variable  rates  of  return  and  higher  rates  of  failure.  Secondly   SME  are   comparatively less equipped in terms of both human and capital resources to withstand economic   adversities. Thirdlyss  there is the problem of inadequate accounting systems  which undermines   the accessibility and reliability of information concerning profitability and repayment capacity. In   developing countries  there is the added problem of a more volatile operating environment  which   has a negative impact on the security of transactions. There is a greater risk that lenders/investors   will not get paid  or that assets will not be properly registered.      Transaction Costs      Irrespective  of  risk  profile  considerations   the  handling  of  SME  financing  is  an  expensive   business. The cost of appraising a loan application or of conducting a due diligence exercise in   view of a possible equity investment is largely independent from the size of the financing under   consideration.  For  all  practical  purposes   the  following  costs  are  fixed   (i)  administrative  costs;   (ii) legal  fees;  and  (ii)  costs  related to  the  acquisition  of  information   such  as  the  purchase  of a   credit  profile  from  a  specialized  agency.  In  the  case of  smaller  loans  or investments   it  is  more   difficult  to  recoup  these  costs.  Similar  considerations  apply  to  the  costs  that  outside  financiers   must  incur  after  disbursement   when  conducting  field  inspections   or  attending  board  meetings.   Again  the problem is more severe in developing countries for the following reasons    (i)   (ii)   (iii)     The lack of adequate management information systems in financial institutions;   The undeveloped state of the economic information industry; and    The  poor  state  of  certain  public  services   such  as  the  registration  of  property  titles  and   collaterals.    To  some  extent   the  problem  can  be  solved  by  raising  the  cost  of  financing  through  a   higher  interest rate  or closing  fee. This  is  indeed the approach  adopted  by  many  micro   lending schemes  but it is possible only up to a certain point.     18     (iv)               International Journal of Financial Management Research and Development (IJFMRD)  ISSN XXXX –   XXXX(Print)  ISSN XXXX – XXXX(Online)  Volume 1  Number 1  January  April (2011)     Lack of Collateral      In  the  case  of  debt  financing   lenders  typically  request  collateral  in  order  to  mitigate  the  risks   associated  with  the  ‘moral  hazard’.  The  lack  of  collateral  is  probably  the  most  widely  cited   obstacle encountered by SME in accessing finance. The amount of collateral required in relation   to the loan size is a measure frequently adapted to empirically assess the severity of the financing   gap. In some cases  the enterprise may be unable to provide sufficient collateral because it is too   new and it is not firmly enough established. That problem is closely related to the ‘higher risk’. In   some  cases   the  lender  may  deem  the  collateral  insufficient  in  view  of  the  size  of  the  loan   requested. In other words  the proposed expansion project may be too large in comparison with   the current size of the firm. Again  this is an issue related to the ‘higher risk.’ In other cases  the   collateral may be insufficient simply because the managersowners tend to siphon off resources   from the company for personal or other purposes. Again  this is closely related to the risk profile   and the moral hazard issues. Lack of collateral can be viewed more as a symptom than as a direct   cause of the difficult relations between SME and providers of finance. Whatever the sequence of   causes and effects  it is widely acknowledged that in developing countries the issue of collateral is   comparatively much more severe. The following section examines how the undeveloped state of   institutional  and  legal  frameworks   prevents  the  possibility  of  pledging  the  owned  assets  as   collaterals.      Institutional and Legal Factors      In the case of many developing countries  the above mentioned obstacles to SME financing are   exacerbated by institutional and legal factors.      Firstly  many developing countries still have highly concentrated and uncompetitive banking   sectors.  This  is  often  the  result  of  restrictive  government  regulations.  This  reinforces  the   tendency to adopt very conservative lending policies or to charge high interest rates. If banks can   thrive  with  a  stable  pool  of  wellestablished  clients   they  have  no  real  incentive  to  improve  the   range of financial products and  in particular  no incentive to go down market  to meet the needs   of  small  businesses.  The    same  is  true  if  banks  can  make  hefty  profits  simply  by  buying   government debt as is often the case in Latin American countries which results in the ‘crowding   out’ of smallscale lending.      Secondly  insufficiently developed legal systems effectively prevent the development of certain   financing  instruments   including  the  use  of  collateral as  a  riskmitigating  element.  For  instance    legal  provisions  regarding  security  interests  (how  the  collateral  is  protected   how  the  collateral   priority  is  determined   etc.)  are  of  crucial  importance  in  determining  the  efficacy  of  collaterals.   Likewise   if  company  laws  offer  only  limited  protection  to  minority  shareholders   the   development  of  venture  capital  and  angel  financing  is  inevitably  negatively  affected.  These   problems  were  particularly  severe  at  the  beginning  of  the  transition  period  in  former  socialist   countries  when even the memories of certain fundamental market institutions had disappeared.      Thirdly   even  when  adequate  legislation  is  available   there  are  often  problems  with   enforcement. Today  transitional and developing economies often have cadastres and registers of   movable  assets.  Nevertheless   their  functioning  is  often  less  than  ideal.  Records  are  frequently   missing  or  misplaced.  There  are  lengthy  procedures  for  filing  mortgages  and  pledges   and  for   ascertaining the status of certain assets. There are often cases of corruption among personnel.             19     International Journal of Financial Management Research and Development (IJFMRD)  ISSN XXXX –   XXXX(Print)  ISSN XXXX – XXXX(Online)  Volume 1  Number 1  January  April (2011)     Fourthly   the  “information  infrastructure”  is  still  largely  undeveloped.  There  is  a  lack  of   credit  bureaus  and  other  mechanisms  for  collecting  and  exchanging  information  on  payment   performance. This inevitably exacerbates the informational asymmetries between enterprises and   lenders/ investors. While some of the above institutional constraints apply to all enterprises  it is   clear that small businesses are likely to suffer disproportionately from their presence.         The Critical Challenge of Funding      Flexibility  as  well  as  low  startup  and  operating  costs  have  enabled  SMEs  to  spring  up   to   reposition and adjust themselves quickly in response to market and economic changes. Moreover    they  easily  expand  or  contract  in  a  short  time.  SMEs  have  not  only  survived  the  impact  of  big   enterprises and the law of economies of scale but have carved out niches for themselves  which   enable them to coexist with big enterprises. However  the most common problems for SMEs are   the lack of access to market information and technology  the low quality of human resources and   the lack of access to capital. Despite efforts by financial institutions and publicsector bodies to   close  funding  gaps   SMEs  continue  to  experience  difficulty  in  obtaining  risk  capital.  These   funding  gaps  relate  to  firm  size   risk   knowledge   and  flexibility.  SME  borrowing  requirements   are small and frequently do not appeal to financial institutions. More collateral may be required   than  SMEs  can  pledge.  Financial  institutions  may  lack  expertise  in  understanding  small  and   medium  knowledgebased  business.  The  flexibility  in  terms  and  conditions  of  financing  that   SMEs require may not be available.      SME Funding from Capital Markets      Statements have demanded as much detailed information and forecasting. The increasing pressure   for continuous disclosure places great pressure on small management teams.   Small business markets have not attracted investors; the costs of listing and ongoing compliance   costs  combined  with  requirements  for  continuing  disclosure  have  been  a  disincentive  to  small   growing  companies  with  limited  management  skills.  The  highrisk  nature  of  these  small   businesses  and  the  limited  information  they  can  provide  has  not  attracted  support  from  the   broking  community.  Disclosure  is  essential  for  confidence  in  public  securities  markets.  Best   business practice is crucial to underpin disclosure. Track record is important when investors are   comparing options. At the startup stage  growth and the revenue are important – the demands of   listing too soon may inhibit growth.      The Role of Government      Government  can  affect  the  supply  of  funding  for  SMEs.  It  can  do  so  by  introducing  rules  and   regulations to encourage banks  venture capitalists and capital markets to create uniquely tailored   programs  for example  directing venture capital to seed firms in growth sectors and supporting   pension funds participation in venture capital funds and tax incentives.   Impacts  of  globalization  such  as  global  competition   rapid  changes  in  technology  and  the   evolving market conditions add to the high risk of funding fastgrowing small businesses. R&D   costs  are  rising.  Strategic  alliances  are  increasing   particularly   crossborder  alliances.  Mergers   and  acquisitions  cross  borders.  Information  networks  are  becoming  more  sophisticated   for   example  through development of clusters.              20          International Journal of Financial Management Research and Development (IJFMRD)  ISSN XXXX –   XXXX(Print)  ISSN XXXX – XXXX(Online)  Volume 1  Number 1  January  April (2011)     Policy Recommendations      The following recommendations have emerged from the Finance Forum discussion of the issue of   how to finance the growth of SMEs in the region        Promote  a  flexible  environment  for  the  venture  capital  specific  to  SMEs  to     flourish;       Tailor credit in banks and other similar institutions to the need of small firms;     Give a greater emphasis on training programs to help banks’ staff understand the     unique    requirements of SMEs better;       Harmonization of the financial policy framework across economies will promote   cross  border  strategic  alliances  including  SMEs  and  facilitate  transfer  of   experiences between the regional economies.        CONCLUSION      Without  adequate  bank  finance   SMEs  cannot  acquire  or  absorb  new  technologies  nor  can  they   expand to compete in global markets or even strike business linkages with larger firms. Similarly    banks  cannot  consider  the  financing  of  SMEs  as  a  viable  option  unless  their  priorities  are   addressed  by  SMEs.  In  this  regard   SMEs  should  be  assisted  largely  by  public  initiatives   involving  participation  of the  banking  industry.  In  India  however  the  various public initiatives   for promoting finance to SMEs have not been as successful as envisaged because there has been   some  overlapping  of  regional  and  national  initiatives.  Efforts  to  harmonize  the  standards  and   practices  therefore  need to be properly coordinated to facilitate SME finance further.
