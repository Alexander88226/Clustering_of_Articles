This paper applies fuzzy comprehensive evaluation to design the screening model of   SMEs   in  order  to  deal  with  the  issue  of  information  asymmetry.  The  classical  screening  theory  of   Stiglitz.JosephE and the Z score method of EdwardI.Altman are used in the model designing. The model   originally  builds  multilevel  screening  system   integrated  the  financial  and  nonfinancial  indicators.   Finally  analysis and evaluation of the screening model indicates that it is benefit to establish new order   for the Investment and financing market.   Keywords    Screening  Model Design  Information Asymmetry  Fuzzy Comprehensive Evaluation               1 Introduction      On the  conditions  of  information  asymmetric  more and more  scholars had  focused  on  the  enterprises   financing Since 1980s. Especially to SMEs  by size  transaction costs and other factors  the phenomenon   of poor information transparency is particularly acute. In recent years  Chinese scholars had made more   research in depth. They had reached a consensus in the academic community  the reason of difficulties   for  SMEs  financing  is  information asymmetry.  Scholars had  also  made a number  of  countermeasures    such as advocating the development of small and mediumsized financial institutions from Justin Lin in   2001 and Wang Xiao in 2003; making full use of private capital markets from Guo Bin in 2002 and Li   Wei  in  2005;  the  establishment  of  cooperative  financial  institutions  from  People's  Bank  of  China  on   behalf  of  Mission  in  2002;  improving  the  capital  market  system  from  Wang  Xuanyu  in  2002;  the   development of venture capital from Chen Naixing in 2001; using the thirdparty credit information and   credit mechanisms from Tang Jianxin in 2007  etc. . However  the diversification of financing methods   had not  solved  the  issue  of  information asymmetry  completely.  The  effective  implementation  of  these   measures must be built on the basis of information symmetry and transparency.   Since  1960s   the  credit  assessment  had  become  the  main  method  to  assess  corporate  credit  rating.   Estimationanalysis method had been judged as the mainstream of the international academic analysis    the representative models were Altman bankruptcy prediction models  Chesser creditforecasting model    Bathory  creditanalysis  model   the  operating  assetsevaluation  model.  However   some  SMEs’   accounting system and the accuracy of financial data had not been satisfactory. It was useless to apply   original models mechanically. Therefore  it is benefit to establish SMEs information screening system.      2 Theoretical Bases and Composition of the Screening Model      2.1 Theoretical bases of the screening model   Stiglitz  Joseph E who had won the Nobel Prize in Economics for working on the issue of asymmetric   information   had  proposed  "screening"  originally  in  his  representative  "theory  of  screening   education   and income distribution" (1975)  which was the theoretical base for the further research.   Stiglitz  believed  that  there  were  several  mechanisms  to  make  enterprises’  private  information  become   public information    (1) Selfselection mechanism. This was an important way to access to information. In this mechanism    the  enterprises  had  displayed  the  more  prominent  feature  of  their  own   especially  in  the  system  of   rewards and punishment.      782     (2) Testing mechanism. It had measured the accuracy and reliability of selfscreening  in order to avoid   the noise impact in the screening process.      2.2 Composition of the screening model   The purpose of establishing screening mechanism for SMEs financing was screening out the lowrisk   financier through quality index of information. In this condition  it was benefit for SMEs to extricate a   predicament of "high threshold  trust discount"  to provide a good quality environment for the better   enterprise.   The screening system had included three levels as fig.1    The  first  level  was  initial  screening  based  on  selfselection.  The  enterprises  had  showed  themselves   through the disclosure of private information. And investors could use the financial and non financial   indicators to implement systemic analysis.   The  second  level  was  the  noise  screening.  The  result  of  preliminary  screening  wouldn’t  be  accepted   arbitrarily   for  the  existence  of  noise.  The  enterprises  were  likely  to  make  use  of  their  information   superiority  in  the  transmission  process  to  take  accounting  fraud.  Consequently   evaluation  of  internal   and external monitoring mechanism would minimize the impact of noise. And the noise screening was   necessary amendments to the results of initial screening.   The third level was Characteristic screening. In recent years  the credit system had improved continued    as  well as  people's awareness  of  credit.  Accordingly   we  should  make  full  use  of  these  supplementary   resources in the screening system designing.                                     Screening of Small and Middlesized Enterprises Financing          initial screening                                  noise screening                                Characteristic screening     Financial indicators                      Internal monitoring mechanism                  Allied credit system                                Nonfinancial indicators                External monitoring mechanism              Individual credit system                                Figure 1 Multilevel screening system        3 Designing Steps of Screening Model      3.1 The basic assumptions   (1) Object grouping     Research  had  proved  that  pooling  equilibrium  and  separate  equilibrium  were  coexistence  in  the   balanced  environment.  Pooling  equilibrium  could  not  exist  in  market  of  information  asymmetry   so   different investors have different investment choices. Assuming that Investment program for A{I S}  S   denoted  information  quality  index   I  denoted  investment  probability.  Supposed  there  were  only  two   types of investment programs A1 {I1  S1} and A2 {I2  S2}  S1 ≠ S2.   (2)The selection rule (R)        The possibility and the amount of investment had depended on information quality index.       S    {S1  S2}       (3) Elements   The  model  based  on  the  aforementioned  three  major  levels  and  seven  indexes.  Of  course   there  were   many  other  factors  also  have  an  impact  on  SMEs  financing   such  as  the  potential  development  of      783     ①  ②    ∈    enterprises  screening costs etc.  we had just neglected these factors in this research.      3.2 Model elements   (1) Determining credit risk and credit limit       Preliminary screening had been adopted to identify credit risk and credit limit through the Financial and   nonfinancial  indicators. The research  based  on  wellknown  value  of  Z  score method advanced  by  Dr.   Edward Altman in 1968. He had observed bankruptcy and nonbankrupt enterprises in the United States    and had taken 22 financial ratios for the selection of mathematical statistics. Finally  he had determined   the  5  best  indicators  of  financial  ratios  to  calculate  Z  score  in  order  to  measure  credit  risk  and  credit   limit.                                       Z=0.71X1+0.847X2+3.10X3+0.420X4+0.998X5   X1 = operation capital / total assets;   X2 = retained earnings / total assets;     X3 = EBIT / total assets;     X4 = total stockholders' equity / total liabilities;     X5 = revenue / total assets     In  order  to  evaluate  more  objectively   two  nonfinancial  indicators  had  been  added.  X6  denoted  the   management  capacity   to  be  subjective  judgments  by  team spirit   management  decisionmaking  speed    ability to staff participate and enterprise culture.   X7 denoted the growth of capacity.     X7 = g1 * the growth rate of net assets + g2 * the growth rate of operating profit + g3 * the growth rate of   sales + g4 * the growth rate of total wages     In this model  the seven variable value(X    ) remains unchanged     but new     X    X    X    X    X    X    + a    X    weights(a    a    a    a    a    a    ) would be given when necessary  the formula was      3、    4、    5、    6、    7     + a    X    X    + a    X    1、  7    7    6    2、  7     5、  5    + a    6、  5  6    a    X         X    + a    1、  2、  2  2  3  i              1    X    + a    3、  4、  4  4  3  ）  （    (2) Evaluation of the internal monitoring   Internal control system was an important part of corporate governance  including Board of Supervisors    Audit  Committee  and the  Internal  Audit  Department. This system  could not  only  maintain  balance  of   the  board  and  management   management  and  other  functional  departments   but  also  improve  the   financial system and change the bad habits of information disclosure through evaluation and supervision.   And the internal audit reports would amend the risk degree of obtaining the investment in formula (1).   (3) Evaluation of the external monitoring     The  research  of  risk  degree  in  investment  was  based  on  the  evaluation  of  financial  indicators.  So  the   authenticity  and  accuracy  of  the  financial  indicators  was  essential.  Due  to  the  relatively  objective   position of external audit  what kind of conclusion that the external audit made was significant to reduce   the noise  effect  in  the  financial  evaluation.  In  addition   the credibility  of  external audit  should also  be   taken into account.   (4) Monitoring of allied credit system     The multiinformationsharing system could provide the integrated credibility of the enterprises  which   was very useful for the investors to evaluate the financing and operation status. Meanwhile  it was   necessary to link to personal credit system  because the credit record of managers was an important   supplement to SMEs credit.      3.3 Model frame   Fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method was the method using the idea of fuzzy mathematics to make   an  overall  evaluation  of  the  multifactor  restricted  object.  Screening  model  on  SMEs  financing  was     a    X    Y=a  7    1  1   =∑          i     i=1      784     based  on  the  fuzzy  comprehensive  evaluation  method   combined  with  financial  and  nonfinancial   indicators  used internal and external monitoring system to amend the evaluation factors  and taken the   allied credit system and the credit rating index as the necessary supplement.

Supposed A1  A2 were particular  S1 denoted the maximum to the index of   information quality  S2 denoted the minimum to the index of information quality.   (1)  If  W1  denoted  a  SME   and  the  corresponding  investment  program  for  A1  {I1   S1}   the  process  of   screening was as follows    With  the  private  information  of  W1   in  the  step  of  Initial  Screening   the  calculated  value  of  Y1  was   greater than the threshold  indicating that the enterprise had operated properly. The noise screening had   showed  that  the  enterprise’s  internal  and  external  monitoring  mechanisms  were  efficient   and  the   information was authentic and fair (B=1  C=1). Few noises represented that the results of first step was   more believable. Meanwhile  credit rating system also had shown a higher level of credibility to W1.   Therefore  the three parts of the screening results had proved that W1 was the best quality of the   information  so that the probability of investment acquisition (I1) was the highest.     (2) If W2 denoted another SME  and the corresponding investment program for A2 {I2  S2}  the process   of screening was as follows    In Initial Screening  the calculated value of Y2 was less than the threshold  indicating that the operating   result  was  dissatisfied.  The  external  monitoring  mechanism  had  found  that  the  existence  of  a  more   serious distortion of information and ineffective oversight of the problem (B=0  C=0). In addition  credit   rating system had shown a lower level of credibility to W2.   Considering  the results  of  three  screening  completely   the  index  of  information  quality  to  W2  was  the   minimum  so that the probability of investment acquisition (I1) was the lowest. The unsatisfactory index   was  probably  due  to  inefficient  fund  management   inadequate  governance  structures   poor  reputation   etc.   (3)  It  was  worth  noting  that  the  actual  situation  was  not  as  simple  as  the  assumptions.  In  reality   the     、    ∈  ∈    i    ∈  j     785     financiers' situation would be more intricate  value of S was between the range of S1 and S2  and leading   to more investment programs.   Using 01 mode to reflect the results of several screening  A1 was the ideal program  for all the scores of   threestep  screening  were  excellent.  And  A2  was  the  most  unsatisfactory  program   for  its  poor   performance in all aspects. In actual practice  more situations were between the ranges  which could be   summarized into eight major cases in the table 1.          Program     Table 1      Eight Major Cases of Screening in 01 Mode   Characteristic screening     Noise screening     Initial screening     1     0     1     1     1     0     0     0     1     1     1     0     0     0     1     0     1     1     0     1     0     1     0     0     Composite Index     3     2     2     2     1     1     1     0     Note  Initial screening  1  good financial condition  0  poor financial situation     Noise screening  1  little effect of the noise  0  serious effect of the noise   Characteristic screening  1  better credit standing  0  worse credit standing      For  these  cases   the  former  model  was  still  applicable   and  the  elements  and  steps  of  screening  were   unchanged.  To  the  investors   the  model  could  help  determine  whether  to  invest  and  the  amount  of   investment. To the financiers  the model could be useful to find their own deficiencies and prescribe the   right remedy  in order to make improvements and enhance the competitiveness of financing.      4.2 Model evaluation   Although the  SMEs investment and  financing  market  was  in  the  booming   some  SMEs  still  could not   get  away  from  the  financing difficulties. The reason  was the  selection  mechanism  of  mutualtrust  and   mutualbenefit hadn’t established. The information screening model had built a bridge for the investors   and financiers. It was great benefit to solve the problem of asymmetric information.   (1) For the SMEs of higher index  the screening model was a "rights" model.   First  the financing costs had reduced. In the screening mechanism  SMEs of the higher index could try   to avoid adverse selection  and would not have to raise interest rates for financing as the lower ones. It   was not only a return for the symmetry  but also reduced the financing costs.   Second   credibility  had  been  reflected  objectively.  Most  people  had  the  stereotypes  to  SMEs  that  the   small scale companies would be poor credibility and low index. In fact  plenty of SMEs were not lack of   good business reputation. Therefore  the information screening mechanisms would safeguard the rights   of those enterprises.   (2) For the SMEs of lower index  the screening model was a "relief" model. Under the screening model    chances would be no place  all the SMEs had to find their own deficiencies and make improvements.   For the favor of investors  on one hand  they should enhance the credibility and reduce the default risk.   On the other hand  they should improve the corporate governance structure  and make the necessary   disclosure to avoid reverse choice.   (3) For investors  the screening model was a "dialectical" model.   First  choose transparent. The reason that the investors had taken adverse selection was they faced with     A    A    A    A    A    A    A    A    1   3   4   5   6   7    8   2      786     the  unknown  groups.  While  under  the  screening  model   information  of  different  enterprises  could  be   quantified and compared. For the more transparency information  investors could make a positive choice    according to their own needs and characteristics of the financing.   Second  risk minimization. With the transparency of information  the choice of investors would be much   objective  and  fair.  Generally   the  SMEs  of  higher  index  would  win  the  favor  of  investors.  If  the   financiers  were  competing  to  improve  the  quality  of  the  information   the  probability  of  moral  hazard   would  decline  rapidly.  In  addition   the  performance  capacities  of  higher  index  enterprises  were   satisfactory  and the default risk would also be maintained at a lower level.   In conclusion  application of the screening model would change the original "lemon market". For the   financiers’ accurate and timely disclosure of private information  investors could better grasp the market   and make an objective choice. Due to the improvement of Symmetric information  the original adverse   selection and moral hazard had been reduced probability. In conclusion  the financing of SMEs would   enter into virtuous circle.      5 Conclusion      In this paper  the Model on Screening of SMEs Financing was much operational and innovative. It had   not  only  selected  the  financial  and  nonfinancial  indicators   but  also  brought  Noise  Screening  and   Characteristic  Screening  to  the model.  However   due  to  the  restrictions  of  industry  characteristics and   supervision  standards   it  is  necessary  to  promote  a  widerdepth  research  to  obtain  more  detailed   information  what will be the future research work.        ，    References     Economics of Information  Basic Principles    .Beijing  China     [2].
