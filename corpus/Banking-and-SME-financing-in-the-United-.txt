Background  Commercial banks have been the leading supplier of   debt capital to small firms in the United States. With   the increasing availability of small business lending   statistics and of research on the topic  it becomes   possible to provide an overview of the small busi  ness loan markets in the United States  as well as an   evaluation of the impact of major developments on   the cost and availability of loans to small businesses.     The paper begins with a brief discussion of the   market—the borrowers  lenders  and market orga  nization—followed by a discussion of major devel  opments in U.S. financial markets and the banking   industry. Topics discussed include innovations in   information technology and in financial modeling   and financial products  as well as banking consolida  tion and the growth of interstate banking. The impli  cations of increased competition in small business   loan markets as evidenced by the emergence of a   nationwide market for credit lines and business credit   cards  and the entry of regional and national banks   and bank holding companies (BHCs) into local mar  kets are discussed.    Overall Findings  Loan markets for most small business borrowers in   the United States have become more competitive   over the past decade  evidenced by the emergence   of a nationwide market for credit lines and credit   cards and the entry of large regional banks in local   markets. However  the impact of increased competi  tion on the cost of funds to small firms  as indicated   by the rate spreads between small business rates and   the rates paid by the banks’ best prime customers  is   more difficult to assess because of data limitations.    Highlights    (cid 127) With more than 6 000 banks and BHCs serving     millions of small business owners  the small business   loan markets in the United States are made up of hun  dreds or even thousands of submarkets varying in size   and borrower characteristics. Many of these markets   are segmented  with various degrees of intermarket   connection in the flows of funds.    (cid 127) Competition in different submarkets also varies   significantly—from highly competitive credit card   markets for small businesses at the national level  to   fairly competitive markets in major urban centers    to markets with very limited competition in remote   rural areas and/or for specific ethnic groups.     (cid 127) The emergence of a nationwide market for small     business credit lines and credit cards over the past   decade is a significant development in small busi  ness financing. The number of small business loans   outstanding (loans under $100 000) increased from   about 5 million in 1995 to 14 million in 2004  com  pared with much smaller increases in larger small   business loans  up from 1 million in 1995 to 1.7   million in 2004. Most of the increases came from   15 to 20 multibilliondollar banks and BHCs; they   accounted for more than 50 percent of the number of   loans under $100 000 outstanding. Fourteen banks/  BHCs have extended business loans in more than 40   states  according to the 2003 database of information   submitted by banks as required by the Community   Reinvestment Act (CRA).     (cid 127) The entry of large regional banks into local     markets also increased market competition in local   small business markets. In 2003  of 370 banks/BHCs   that made larger small business loans (loans between   $100 000 and $1 million) in more than one state  34   have lending activities in more than 10 states.

(cid 127) It is more difficult to study the impact of   increased competition on interest rate spreads   between small business loans and loans to the banks’   best customers. The prime rate served as the proxy   for the rates charged to banks’ best customers in   earlier years  but prime customers have generally   been charged rates below prime since the 1990s.  Information on the rate premium over the base (or   the index) in the rate adjustment formula of loan   agreements would be most useful to an understand  ing of this issue.     Scope and Methodology  The databases used for the analysis include Reports   of Condition and Income (call reports)  reports sub  mitted under the requirements of the Community   Reinvestment Act (CRA reports)  and Statistical   Release E.2—the Survey of Terms of Business   Lending conducted quarterly by the Federal Reserve   Board. Studies on small business lending using   these databases  including  for example  the Office   of Advocacy’s annual banking studies (available at   http //www.sba.gov/advo/research/banking.html)    are reviewed and summarized. Time series statistics   were generated for analysis of the trends in small   business lending by banks.    This report was peerreviewed consistent with     Advocacy’s data quality guidelines.

Charles.ou@sba.gov                Introduction          Defined in the broadest sense to include independent businesses with 500 or fewer hired   employees  U.S. small businesses numbered 23 million in 2003  employed about half of   the private sector work force  and produced about half of the nation’s private sector   output.1 Small firms are important to a competitive American economy because they fill   niches in both input and output markets  innovate  and contribute to the dynamism in   American industries and the U.S. economy.          The small business population in the United States   Because of the lack of a nationwide business registration and deregistration system in the   United States  tracking the small business population and its dynamic changes has been a   challenging task. Only recently  a more comprehensive annual national profile of the   business population  and thus the small and mediumsized enterprise (SME) population    has become available.2                                                              1 See U.S. Small Business Administration  Office of Advocacy  The Small Business Economy  various   editions  and “Small Business Frequently Asked Questions” at http //www.sba.gov/advo/research/.   2 While the annual profile of employer firms has been available for some time  the annual profile of   nonemployer firms was made available to the public only in January 2001 for the year 1997. See U.S.   Department of Commerce  Bureau of the Census  www.census.gov/epcd/nonemployer/view/pressrel.html.               5.7 e.   18.0   23.7     27.0   18.9   10.3   5.0        Table 1 Measures of the U.S. Small Business Population  2003 (millions)   SME Measures   Employer firms (nonfarm)    Nonemployer firms     Total       Number of nonfarm business tax returns    Number of Sole Proprietorships (IRS) in 2002    Selfemployment  nonincorporated   Selfemployment  incorporated      e. = estimated   Sources  U.S. Small Business Administration  Office of Advocacy  from data provided by the U.S. Department of   Commerce  Bureau of the Census; U.S. Department of the Treasury  Internal Revenue Service  SOI Bulletin; and U.S.   Department of Labor.      As of 2003  the number of U.S. businesses (and thus small businesses) totaled 23 million    including 5.7 million employer firms and 18 million nonemployer firms (Table 1).3   Employer firms have employee(s) and participate in payroll tax withholding programs   (identified by employer identification numbers or EINs). Nonemployer firms have no   employees but file business tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the   U.S. Department of the Treasury. Other frequently mentioned measures of the U.S. small   business population include the number of business tax returns filed with the IRS and the   selfemployed. Tax return data include filings of subsidiaries of larger companies—a fact   that means large companies are reported numerous times—as well as the individual   business returns of numerous very small business entities. Selfemployment is a work   force population concept. Thus  the two estimates of the business population are not   comparable—for example  the total of 16 million nonemployer firms reflects a universe   that is somewhat different from the 15 million selfemployed owners of incorporated and   unincorporated businesses.4                                                             3 See also op. cit.  “Small Business Frequently Asked Questions ” June 2004 edition.   4 Examples would be an S corporation with five owners or a fiveperson partnership with one or no   employees  etc.           2    While the sheer number of small businesses is huge  a substantial number of these firms   are very small  many generating annual receipts of less than $10 000.5 Even among “full  fledged” businesses with hired employees or selfemployed businesses that provide a   fulltime career to the owner(s)  different types of businesses are observed—from young   dynamic ventures involved in innovative products to established small businesses serving   local or regional markets  and from established subcontractors of large multinational   corporations to “mom and pop” small craft  retail  and service businesses. The business   goals and motivations of these businesses are different  as are their financial strategies   and financing behaviors.           The dynamics of small firms    The relative position of small businesses in the U.S. economy tends to remain constant   over time; that is  they continue to account for 99.7 percent of all businesses and employ   slightly more than 50 percent of private nonfarm workers. Nevertheless  the gross   movements in the number of businesses and employment are huge  with constant flows of   business births and deaths and with expansions and contractions in employment. These   movements demonstrate the dynamics of business change and competitiveness in the   American economy. Only with a continuous flow of new firms entering the market can   an economy assure that an adequate number of “successful” startups emerges to become   “gazelles” or small  nimble  fastgrowing businesses.           In sum  SMEs in the United States6     •  Represent 99.7 percent of all employer firms;   •  Are very small  75 percent having no employees;   •  Are more than 50 percent “homebased;”   •  Employ half of all private sector employees;                                                        5 In 2002  8.6 million of 18.9 million sole proprietorship returns reported receipts of less than $10 000. An   additional 5.9 million had $10 000 to $50 000 in receipts.   6 Op. cit. “Frequently Asked Questions ” and Brian Headd  “Business Success  Factors Leading to   Surviving and Closing Successfully ” U.S. Bureau of the Census  Center for Economic Studies  Working   Paper #CESWP0101  January 2001; also  Analyses of Business Dissolution by Demographic Category of   Business Ownership  Advocacyfunded research by Richard J.

Financing Patterns of Small Firms      Small firms use a variety of financing sources for different purposes. The Federal   Reserve Board’s Survey of Small Business Finances (1998 SSBF and earlier surveys in   1993 and 1987) provides the most comprehensive database on the uses of credit and other   financial services by some 5.3 million small firms in the United States in 1998.8       Percentages of all small firms who used credit    More than 80 percent of all small businesses had used some kind of credit previously  and   thus had outstanding debt on their books at the end of 1998.9 Fiftyfive percent of small   firms used traditional loans  while 71 percent used nontraditional sources  mainly                                                        7 However  many small business failures showed up in the personal bankruptcy courts. See Robert M.   Lawless and Elizabeth Warren  The Myth of the Disappearing Business Bankruptcy. In   www.kauffman.org/pdf/eship_bankruptcy_061505.pdf.   8 See U.S. Small Business Administration  Office of Advocacy  Financing Patterns of Small Firms    Findings from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances  September 2003 (see   http //www.sba.gov/advo/stats/ssbf_98.pdf  1060.2KB ). The Federal Reserve Board has completed the   collection of financial information for 2003. The final edited database for the 2003 SSBF should be   available for public use in spring 2006.    9 Credit extended by a supplier is the debt of the borrower. For example  credit used by a small business   will show up as debt in the firm’s books. The terms “debt” and “credit” are therefore used interchangeably   in this discussion.          4    owners’ loans and credit cards  for their credit needs.10 Among the different types of   credit used  credit cards (both personal and business)  credit lines  and vehicle loans were   the most commonly used types or sources of credit. Fortysix and 34 percent    respectively  of small firms used personal and business credit cards  28 percent used   credit lines; and 21 percent  vehicle loans (Table 2).           Among financial institutions  banks are the most often used credit source for small firms    38 percent of small firms had credit outstanding from commercial banks in 1998.   Owners’ loans were the second most important source  used by at least 14.2 percent of   small firms  an underestimate at that.11 Next  13.3 percent of small firms used finance   companies as a credit source.           The smallest firms have much less access to bank financing than larger firms. Only 17 to   31 percent of firms in the two smallest size categories (with zero and 1 to 4 employees    respectively) borrowed from commercial banks  compared with 53 to 77 percent of larger   small firms (Table 3).      Loans from a firm’s owners are among the most important sources of financing for most   small firms. However  reliance on owners’ loans was not well captured for all firms in the   survey because sole proprietorship owners’ capital was not considered debt financing and   was thus excluded.12 An examination of the borrowing patterns of small corporations   indicated that some 30 percent of small corporations borrowed from their owner(s)    compared with 14 percent of all small businesses.13      The percentage of small firms using credit increases with firm size. The percentage of   firms using any credit increased from 70 to 99.6 percent as the employment size of the   firms increased from 0 to more than 100. This trend is most pronounced in loans supplied                                                      10 Traditional loans are the six types of loans covered in the survey  lines of credit  mortgages  vehicle   loans  equipment loans  leasing  and other loans. Loans from owner(s) and credit cards were covered   separately and thus considered nontraditional.   11 The importance of owners’ loans is underestimated because loans from sole proprietors were not covered   in the survey and were thus excluded.

For example  only 22 percent   of firms with no employees used credit from depository institutions  while 78 percent of   firms with more than 100 employees did so.14       Two distinct patterns were observed in the relationships between firm size and the   percentage using a certain type or supplier of credit. The positive relationship between   firm size and the percentage used is observed for most commonly used credit types and   sources  and seems to reflect their availability to larger small firms. These types of credit   become more available as firm size increases. A flat or even inverse relationship between   firm size and the use of a type or source of credit—as observed with owners’ loans and   personal credit cards—reflects a different phenomenon  the need of very small firms to   use alternative sources because other  usually less expensive  sources of financing are   unavailable.           The relative size of each market  as indicated by the value of debt outstanding  is shown   in Table 4. Lines of credit and commercial mortgages are the two largest markets    accounting for more than 60 percent of the total debt outstanding for these small firms at   the end of 1998.15       In conclusion  a multitude of small business loan markets exist in the United States    serving small firms of varying sizes with different financial characteristics and financing   preferences.16                                                                                                                                                                    13 Op. cit.  Financing Patterns…  Table A 11.   14 Since credit lines are mostly provided by depository institutions  the rising trend in their use relative to   firm size is even more significant. Thirteen percent of the smallest firms use them; 75 percent of the largest   small firms. Ibid.  Financing Patterns…   15 Total debt outstanding was about $700 billion for 5.3 million small firms. Trade credit was not included   in the estimates.   16They range from small local markets to larger national/regional markets for different loans. Also  there   are markets for special groups of borrowers or in special areas—loans for startups  loans for women   owners  loans for small rural communities or central city business owners  etc.          6    Table 4   Share of Total Debt Outstanding for All Small Firms in the United States  by Credit Type  1998 (Percent  except as noted otherwise)    Category    Any Credit    Any Traditional     Loan      Line of Credit Mortgage    Vehicle    Equipment    Lease    Other    Loan Type    Any Non  traditional     Loan    Owner Loan    Any Credit     Card    Amount ($ million)    $700 026    $608 730    $207 383    $213 534    $33 654    $58 545    $35 521    $60 093    $91 296    $86 525    $4 771    Any Firm    Number of Employees  0  14  5  9  10  19  20  99  100  499    100.0    100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0  100.0    87.0    97.8  81.3  86.0  89.0  83.7  93.3    29.6    4.1  21.4  23.5  29.5  28.6  44.0    30.5    80.3  37.4  39.1  28.4  26.7  20.5    4.8    6.3  7.7  5.9  6.0  3.5  3.1    8.4    2.0  3.5  5.6  8.8  10.5  10.8    5.1    1.9  3.3  3.9  8.8  5.8  3.9    8.6    3.3  8.0  8.0  7.4  8.6  10.9    13.0    2.2  18.7  14.0  11.0  16.3  6.7    12.4    0.2  16.2  13.2  10.5  16.2  6.7    0.7    2.0  2.6  0.8  0.6  0.1  0.0    Source  U.S. Small Business Administration  Office of Advocacy  "Financing Patterns of Small Firms  Findings from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finance"  September 2003.    Major Credit Suppliers in the Small Business Loan Markets      The 1998 SSBF also provides a comprehensive profile of financial lenders in the small   business loan markets for some 5.3 million established small firms.17 Table 5 provides a   profile of major participants in different small firm loan markets in 1998.18        •  The credit line market is dominated by commercial banks  which supplied 87     percent of the total debt outstanding held by small firms at the end of 1998.   Finance companies were a distant second  accounting for 10 percent of total   outstanding debt.    In the commercial mortgage markets  commercial banks supplied 57 percent    followed by other nondepository institutions (18 percent)  finance companies    and savings and loans.19      •     •  Banks and finance companies accounted for more than 90 percent of the market     •     for vehicle loans.   In equipment loans  again commercial banks dominated the market  with 59   percent  while finance companies accounted for 26 percent.     •  The leasing market is the only one in which commercial banks ranked second      behind leasing companies—with 39 percent for leasing companies  27 percent for   banks  and 18 percent for finance companies.          To conclude  commercial banks are the most important lenders in most small business   loan markets. However  except with credit lines (and business credit cards)  nonbank   lenders—namely  finance companies  mortgage lenders  and leasing companies—have                                                        17 Again  current information on small business lending by credit suppliers is not available in the United   States  except for bank loan data  which are available only by loan size.    18 George Haynes  Finance Companies and Small Business Borrowers  Evidence from the 1993 and 1998 Surveys of   Small Business Finances  prepared for the U.S. Small Business Administration  Office of Advocacy  April 2005  online   at http //www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs255tot.pdf  347.2KB.   19 Most savings and loan (S&L) institutions converted or merged to become a part of federal savings banks   in the early 1990s after the S&L debacle of the late 1980s.          7    Table 5  Share of Aggregate Value of Traditional Debt of Small Firms Held by Major Lenders  by Credit Type  1998 (Percent  except as noted)    Lending Sources  Aggregate amount ($ million)  Suppliers   Commercial bank  Finance company  Credit union  Savings and loan  Brokerage  Leasing  Other nondepository  Family  Other business  Government  Other individual  Others not identified     Total         Line of credit  207 383    Mortgage  213 534    Vehicle  33 654    Equipment   58 545    86.60  9.74  0.15  1.00  0.31  0.05  0.16  0.00  0.15  0.20  0.05  1.60  100.00    57.36  8.46  0.72  7.69  0.09  0.03  17.06  3.86  0.30  1.24  0.75  2.45  100.00    49.83  39.65  3.39  1.23  0.03  2.08  0.11  0.85  0.31  0.00  0.11  2.42  100.00    59.05  26.44  0.22  0.11  0.07  3.65  0.04  0.39  1.62  1.59  0.00  6.82  100.00    Lease  35 521    27.06  18.15  0.28  0.59  0.94  39.30  0.07  0.99  10.32  0.06  0.06  2.18  100.00    Other loans  60 093          All    608 729.65    51.09  2.49  0.37  1.70  0.75  0.08  0.65  31.27  7.16  3.47  0.26  0.71  100.00    64.68  12.32  0.57  3.32  0.27  2.79  6.11  4.58  1.64  1.00  0.32  2.39  100.00    Source  U.S. Small Business Administration  Office of Advocacy   "Financing Patterns of Small Firms  Findings from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances "  September 2003.    been active players in the markets and have helped maintain competition in many small   business loan markets in the United States.20      Developments in the Banking Sector and Bank Lending to Small Firms in the U.S.       As noted  except in leasing  commercial banks are the most important small business   financing market participants  accounting for 50 to 87 percent of total debt supplied to   various small loan markets. Limited current information about bank lending to small   firms has been available from call reports (June Reports of Condition and Income) since   1994 and from CRA reports (reports required under the Community Reinvestment Act)   since 1997.21       Major developments that have contributed to changes in the performance of the small   business loan markets over the past decade include       •     innovations in the financial markets contributed by technology  especially in   information collection  processing and distribution  and financial modeling;      •  banking consolidation and a decline in the number of banks in the United States;     and      •  globalization in the financial markets among industrialized nations.         Impacts of innovation in financial markets on the sources of funds by financial   intermediaries    Innovations in U.S. financial markets during the past several decades have been   significant. New products and services have been developed by different financial   institutions to collect savings from individual households and businesses to lend to and/or                                                        20 In fact  it is the nonbank lenders that helped maintain competition in small business loan markets in spite   of increased concentration in the banking sector.

Most nondeposit financial   institutions such as finance companies rely on the public markets for funding of their   business lending; most depository institutions—banks  savings banks  and credit   unions—have experienced drastic declines in deposits as the source of funding for   lending.23 Credit scoring  which allows lenders to access their borrowers’ credit profiles    especially their credit history  is one major innovation that should contribute to the   growth of small business loan markets.         Banking consolidation    In spite of a large decline in the number of banks in the United States  in part because of   numerous merger and acquisition (M&A) activities among banks/BHCs of all sizes over   the past 10 to 15 years  the U.S. banking system is still the least concentrated banking   system in the industrialized world.24 As of June 2004  there were some 6 500 banks and   BHCs in the United States.25 The 72 multibilliondollar banks and BHCs with domestic   assets in excess of $10 billion held 75 percent of domestic assets  but accounted for less   than 50 percent of small business lending (business loans under $1 million) as of June   2004. Many of these giant banks maintained vast numbers of retail branches across the   nation  while several were concentrated in wholesale business lending and international                                                      22 The growth of private and public pension funds  mutual fund companies  and other institutional investors    as well as various credit products packaging loans of different risk brackets has encouraged the growth of   public capital and credit markets far exceeding that of financial intermediaries in channeling savings to   investment in the U.S. economy.    23 Innovations that allow depository institutions to access public funding markets through asset   securitization have found very limited success when small business loans are involved because of the   difficulties in packaging small business loans  characterized by widely different risk and loan terms.    24 See discussions on the markets in Japan and the United Kingdom at the conference for which this paper   was prepared  “International Comparisons in the Financing of SMEs in Developed Nations ”   http //www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs/conf/intsmefinance/.   25 See U.S. Small Business Administration  Office of Advocacy  Small Business and Micro Business   Lending for 2003 2004  at http //www.sba.gov/advo/research/rbsbl04.pdf. Call report data were          9    banking.26 An additional 645 mediumsized banks/BHCs (with assets between $500   million and $10 billion) operated in multistate regional space. The remaining 5 600   banks/BHCs with domestic assets under $500 million served local and withinstate   markets (Table 6). As the number of banks decline and many giant interstate or regional   banks and bank holding companies (BHCs) emerge  more products and services are   offered by more banks and nonbank institutions in different markets and locations  and   banking competition in national and regional markets intensifies.27          Trends in bank lending to small businesses  19952004   As of June 2004  a total of 15.3 million loans outstanding of less than $1 million each    valued at a total of $522 billion  were owed by small businesses to commercial banks.   More than 13.6 million of these  valued at a total of $125.7 billion  were in the smallest   loan category under $100 000  and most of these were business credit cardrelated. Table   7 provides an analysis of the changes over the decade.28       One perennial concern about banking consolidation has been its implications for small   business lending  because of the relatively small share of small business loans in the asset   portfolios of most giant banks. Table 8 provides a comparison of the relative importance   of small business lending for banks and BHCs of varying sizes since June 1997. The   following findings are observed      •  Small business lending seems to have kept pace with overall growth in   business lending. The declining share of the amount in the smallest size   category (under $100 000) could be just a statistical phenomenon because of                                                                                                                                                        consolidated for all BHC members to derive a total of 6 423 U.S. banks/BHCs in June 2004 (compared   with a total of 7 678 banks submitting June 2004 call reports to federal financial supervisory authorities).    26 The ratios of small business loans to total domestic assets for these banks  excluding American Express   Centurion  range from 0.0 to 0.194  with a median of 0.06 in June 2004.

Among the possible explanations are  1. giant banks are concentrating on   credit card and credit line markets and thus neglecting the larger loan size   markets; 2. large banks have acquired more nonsmall business lenders  thus   increasing their asset shares without raising their small business loan share; 29   and 3. acquiring banks’ participation in local business markets after a merger   or acquisition is passive rather than active (Table 8).           Loan rates charged by commercial banks on small business loans    Small business loan rates charged by banks are affected by many factors—the size of the   market and thus the level of competition  the credit quality of the borrowers  the costs of   extending and administering small business loans  and the cost of money to the lenders.   The variables affecting the rates include the risk of the loans  loan size  collateral    commitment  and many other loan underwriting terms. The Federal Reserve Board began   collecting information about the loan rates charged by commercial banks in the late   1970s  and has subsequently instituted several major revisions in data collection and   reporting formats. Statistical Release E.2 provides information on the rates charged by   banks to corporate and small business customers for the first week of February  May    August  and November of the year. Small loan rates are used as a proxy for small   business loan rates. Effective weighted rates charged by banks are reported by risk   category of the loan and by repricing period.30 Information about other loan terms—such                                                      29 See Joe Peeks  The Effect of Interstate Banking on Small Business Lending  prepared for the U.S. Small   Business Administration  Office of Advocacy  September 1997  available online at   http //www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs179.pdf  82.4KB.   30 The Federal Reserve Board has reported effective loan rates by risk category since May 1998. Effective   rates by loan size continue to be reported in the E.2 Release  but with no reference to the repricing periods.          11    as the use of collateral  commitment  and the base rate used for adjustable loans—are also   reported for each loan group in the release. It is difficult to generalize about the rate   spreads between loans of different sizes and different risk groups as reported in Release   E.2 because  as discussed previously  small business loan markets are made up of   hundreds or even thousands of submarkets characterized by the size of the geographic   area in which different types of borrowers and lenders participate.31 Table 9 provides an   overview of the loan terms charged by commercial banks on business loans of different   sizes by large and small domestic banks.32       The following observations can be made about the terms of bank loans to small firms 33        1.  Most small business loans are made in adjustablerate loan arrangements—that is    the rates are adjustable over the term of a loan on the basis of changes in the base   or index rate  which adjusts as market rates adjust. What this implies is that the   cost of borrowing to small businesses changes as the interest rates in the capital   and credit markets change. Small firms do not know the precise costs of   borrowing anymore. 34                                                                                                                                                        Special tabulations on the rates by loan size and by repricing period have been made available to the U.S.   Small Business Administration  Office of Advocacy.    31 Moreover  since large loans make up a major share of the overall business loan markets  the estimated   shares  weighted by loan values  as provided in Release E.2  reveal limited information about the   characteristics of small business loans. In fact  it would be most revealing to look at the variation in the   rates charged to small firms.    32 Special tabulations  using a simple average rather than a valueweighted average  were provided by the   Federal Reserve Board to the Office of Advocacy for information on the percentages/share of loans with   collateral  precommitment  and using the prime as the base rate.    33 An econometric estimate for the rate determination would be the only way to identify the significant   factors explaining the difference between rates charged to small and large businesses.    34 This might indicate that they are more sensitive to changes in monetary policy.

The rate spreads and how the base rates change in response to changes in the rates     in the capital and credit markets provide better indicators of the relative costs of   borrowing to small firms compared with large borrowers.35      3.  In general  the rate spreads differ by risk category  loan size  and size of the     lender—with differences of 2 to 2.5 percent between the minimalrisk group and   other groups; 1.5 to 2 percent between the smallest loans (under $100 000) and   the largest small business loans ($500 000 to under $1 million); and 50 to 75 basis   points between large domestic banks and small banks in the United States.      4.  Most small business loans are made with the prime rate as the base rate.36 Since   the prime may not adjust as promptly to changes in the market rates  especially   when the market rates are falling  the rate spreads between small business loan   rates and the prime may differ significantly from the spreads in rates charged to   the bank’s best customers.      5.  It is difficult to estimate the rate spreads over the base rate  the index rate that   changes as the market rate changes. The convention is that most small business   loans have a rate spread (rate premium) of 1 to 3 percent above the base rate.   However  the spreads over the rates charged to the banks’ best customers are   much higher. Chart 2 summarizes the rate spreads between small business loans   (for two loan sizes of under $100 000 and $100 000 to $500 000) and the average   prime rates  as well as the spread over the primecustomer rates (as defined in the   E.2 release). Rates for loans with 230 days repricing periods are used in this   analysis.     i.     The negative rate spreads between larger small business loans   and the prime is a puzzle. It is hard to imagine an adjustableloan   formula with a negative spread over the base stipulated in the   loan contract for this loan size. Several explanations are offered    loans made by larger banks did not use the prime as the base rate                                                        35 It would be revealing to know how the actual rates charged at the time of borrowing compared with the   rates charged on the basis of the formula in the loan contract. There is an incentive for lenders to use   “teaser rates ” rates below the rate based on the adjustable rate formula  when competition for borrowers is   strong. This practice is likely when market rates are rising or are expected to rise in the near future.           13    for their larger loans; prime rates used by larger banks are lower   than the market average during this period of falling interest   rates; large banks used ‘teaser rates ”—rates lower than the rate   determined by the formula.    The rates paid by the prime customers are 200 basis points below   the average prime rates in this period. Fluctuations in the spreads   between the prime and primecustomer rates were also observed   during this period—possibly an indication of rigidity in the prime   rates.   The spread between the smallest loans and the rates paid by   prime customers were 2.5 to 3.5 percent.     ii.     iii.     6.  The repricing periods range from zero to 360 days. Twothirds of small business     loans have a zero repricing period —that is  rates are adjustable as soon as the   base rate changes  as compared with a fixed interval adjustment  such as monthly    quarterly  etc.37 Rate premiums over rates with shorter repricing periods were   observed only for loans with an over360day repricing period.      7.  Most small business loans were made with collateral.38      To conclude  there is still much to learn about the rate spreads between the rates for   small business loans and the prime or the primecustomer rates. Information about the   rate spreads in a loan contract might be more useful than information about the actual   rates paid by borrowers at the time of borrowing. An econometric study on factors   affecting the rates or rate spreads using individual loan data would certainly be most   revealing.                                                                                                                                                                   36 The prime has become more common as the base rate (the index) for small business loans than as the rate   charged to the banks’ best customers  as has been commonly assumed. The rates charged to the banks’ best   customers are usually below prime  especially when money market rates are low.   37 Some 80 percent of the loans have repricing periods of less than 30 days.    38 It is likely that this refers to loans other than business credit cards  which show huge increases in the   number of loans originated  but not in the dollar amount.           14    Competition and Performance of Small Business Bank Loan Markets in the United   States39           The degree of competition in the small business loan markets in the United States differs   widely because of different degrees of participation in local markets by regional and   national lenders. Large national and superregional lenders enter the local markets   through two channels—mass marketing through all public media and relationship lending   through the development of “direct” relationships between bank branch officers and   small business borrowers. The products/services marketed through the former channel   will be generalpurpose loans with limited requirements on how and where the loan funds   are used. Loan applications are evaluated on the basis of the borrower’s and/or the   business’s credit history as well as other business financials. In the latter channel  for   specialpurpose lending  specific knowledge of the borrower(s) as well the loan purposes   and the characteristics of collateral are required. Specific loan covenants might be   required and an effective monitoring process used to assure loan performance. Of course    there are other loan types that use a combination of these two financing channels.       It is difficult to evaluate the performance of small business loan markets in providing   financing to small firms at “reasonable” prices because of the difficulty of defining the   market from the statistical information collected.40 The issue is further complicated by   limited information available for statistical analysis purposes.      Competition and performance in the small business loan markets in the United States will   be briefly discussed under three headings—the emerging nationwide market for credit   lines and credit cards for small businesses  competition in larger small business loan   markets  and interest rate spreads for small business loans over large business loans.   Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) data will be used to investigate the degree of                                                        39 SSBF data have been much utilized to investigate small business lending practices of banks of different   sizes. For a review of all major research using the SSBF files  go to the bibliography of the SSBF section   on the Federal Reserve Board’s website.   40 This explains why complaints that small business credit markets do not work continue to be heard  while   most respondents to small business surveys indicate their satisfaction with the markets’ performance.           15    participation by large banks and BHCs in local markets.41 Two small business loan   markets are identified—the small credit line/credit card market  approximated by the   smallest loans (under $100 000)  and the larger loan market for “special purpose” loans   such as nonresidential mortgages  equipment  and other loans.42 Entry into the local   markets by large regional and national banks provides the major impetus for increased   competition.         An emerging nationwide market for small business credit lines/business credit cards   With a maturing consumer credit card market and accumulated knowledge and   experience in credit scoring and credit card lending  large national and superregional   banks have promoted and exploited small business credit cards over the past 10 years. As   discussed in the previous section  the number of the smallest loans under $100 000   showed a rapid increase in this period. Multibilliondollar banks/BHCs’ share of the   number of loans under $100 000 outstanding increased from 40 percent to 67 percent   between June 1997 and June 2004  as compared with relatively insignificant changes for   other measures of small business lending activities by these banks/BHCs (Table 8). A   study of the CRA data for 2003 indicated that 14 large banks/BHCs have participated in   the nationwide markets; these banks/BHCs had at least 10 loans in each of the 50 states in   200343 (Table 10b). Nationwide banks include such well known credit card banks as   Advanta  Amex  GE Capital  MBNA  and Atlantic Bank  and BHCs such as Bank of   America  Bank One  Citigroup  FleetBoston  U.S.Bancorp  Wells Fargo  etc. Most major   credit card banks participated only in the under $100 000 market  while the giant BHCs   participated in this and other small business loan markets with extensive branch   networks.                                                       41 Only the CRA database provides information about the destination of a bank’s small business lending   activities. Op. cit.  Small Business and Micro Business Lending in the United States for Data Years 2003  3004.    42 The distinction is  indeed  not very precise. The special purpose market also includes the smallest loans   made by smaller banks  which include vehicle loans  lease improvement loans  etc.  to small businesses.    43 While many banks reported loan activities in more than one state in the CRA  many show only one or   two loans in a given state for 2003. Of a total of 1 000 banks/BHCs in the 2003 CRA reports  many had   extended fewer than five loans in a given state. To exclude these “casual lenders ” banks with a significant   small business program in a given state are identified as those with more than 10 loans under $100 000 and   more than 5 loans of $100 000 to $1 million.           16    Table 10a  Number of Banks/BHCs Made at Least Five Loans ($100 000 to $1 Million) in a given state  2003    Number of states a bank extended loans  One state  25 states  610 states  more than 10 states  Total number of banks/BHCs    Number of Banks/BHCs                                                                                                                                                                                                          633  300  33  34  1 000    Table 10b  Number of Banks/BHCs Made at Least 10 Micro Loans ( less than$100 000) in a given state  2003    Number of states a bank extended loans  One state  25 states  610 states  1039 states  More than 40 states  Total number of banks/BHCs    Number of Banks/BHCs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      669  259  31  16  14  989    Note   Many loans under $100 000 may not be credit lines or credit card loans.  Source  Estimates derived from the CRA data for the year 2003.           Chart 1 offers a simplistic illustration of participation by banks/BHCs of different sizes in   these two markets. Two small business bank loan markets in Wisconsin are described—  for loans under $100 000 and between $100 000 and $1 million.44 The number of larger   loans made by a certain bank/BHC is plotted against the number of the smallest loans.   The market for small credit lines and credit cards is indicated on the horizontal axis. Here   the market is dominated by two groups of lenders—a small number of large credit card   banks that made a large number of loans in this market and no loans in the larger small   business loan markets  and several large regional and national banks/BHCs with   extensive lending in this and the larger loan markets.45 With extensive use of credit   scoring and other financial modeling and risk management tools  multibilliondollar   national banks/BHCs have promoted this generalpurpose credit line market to become a   national market for small firms. This is the market in which large regional and national   lenders extend credit lines to small firms across the country.46 Competition in this market   is mostly oligopolistic—characterized by nonprice competition more than by price   competition. To the extent that the emerging credit card/credit line market promoted by   giant banks/BHCs contributes to the provision of new credit products for small firms  the   markets for small business loans and the availability of small business financing have   expanded.           Entry into the local small business loan markets by large national and regional banks   The other small business loan market consists of different submarkets of varying sizes   with different geographical expansion—including markets for very small loans (under   $100 000) extended by small community banks in local markets  large vehicle loan   markets participated in by banks of all sizes as well as finance companies  markets for   commercial mortgage loans also offered by banks/BHCs of all sizes (except very small                                                        44 Some 150 banks/BHCs reported small business lending in the State of Wisconsin in their CRA report in   2003. About 65 banks/BHCs which reported making 10 or more small business loans in Wisconsin in 2003   were plotted for examination. See CRA data in the Office of Advocacy report on Small Business and Micro   Business Lending…  various years.    45 The number of states in which these banks/BHCs have “extended loans” in a given year averages 35 to   45 states—an indication of the national market.    46 This is the market where personal and business finance are integrated with owners’ wealth and payment   history  constituting a major election in the credit review process.           17    banks) (Chart 1).47 Active participation by national and regional banks and BHCs in the   markets is indicated in Table 10a. Thirtyfour national/regional banks and BHCs have   branches and loan offices in more than 10 states and make at least five small business   loans of $100 000 to $1 million in a given state.48 It is true that many of these   banks/BHCs obtained entry to the local markets through mergers and acquisitions of   existing banks and may not have added much to the total number of participating lenders   in a given market. However  by bringing funding sources from the national credit   markets  large banks’ entry into local markets creates a link to the national market.       While there is no good statistical measure of market competition in small business loan   markets  competition in banking markets generally (especially in deposits) has been the   subject of continuous investigation  especially by federal regulatory agencies. A   concentration ratio for the banking markets in the United States  the socalled Herfindahl   index (HHI)  has been computed (using deposit distributions) by metropolitan statistical   area (MSA) and nonMSA county for 2004.49 Overall  banking competition in MSA   markets remained competitive 50 with little indication that banking consolidation has   significantly affected banking market competition. A review of changes in the index over   time also seems to indicate that most U.S. banking markets remained competitive.       To conclude  the markets for most small business loans have become more competitive    especially for some loans  as the markets become regional and national in scope with the   entry of large regional and national banks/BHCs.          Interest rate competition    Another measure of market competition in the small business loan markets is the cost of   borrowing to small firms. As markets become more competitive  the premiums between                                                        47 An examination of CRA data for the $100 000 to $1 million loan market in individual states reveals that   major lenders in this market were banks headquartered in the state and/or neighboring states.    48 As of June 2005  11 banks/BHCs had more than 1 000 branches each  according to the Federal Deposit   Insurance Corporation (FDIC). See “Summary of Deposits—Top 50 Bank Holding Companies.”    49 Thanks to Dr. Wolken of the Federal Reserve Board for this calculation.    50 The HHI measurements for 361 MSAs for commercial banks ranged from 550 to 7 701  with a median of   1 677 and a quartile of 2 100. The index for rural counties ranged from 874 through 10 000 with a median   of 3 350 and a quartile of 5 000.          18    Chart 1  Scatter Diagram of the Numbers of Small Business Loans by Banks/BHCs in     (Smallest loans versus larger small business loans)    Wisconsin  2003     )  n  o    i  i  l  i         m  1     $  <  o  t     k  0  0  1  $  (     s  n  a  o    l     s  s  e  n  i  s  u  b       l  l    a  m  s       r  e  g  r  a  L    6000    5000    4000    3000    2000    1000    0    0    2000    4000    6000    8000    10000    12000    14000    Smallest loans (under $100 000)    rates for small business loans and riskfree loans for prime customers should narrow   because of competition. While it is difficult to evaluate changes in the rate premiums paid   by small firms for bank loans over time  changes in the rate differentials between small   business loans  the prime rate  and rates charged to the banks’ best customers will be   analyzed.51        Rates charged for small variablerate loans (with a 230day repricing period) will be   analyzed. Changes in the rate spreads for small business loans over the prime rates and   the rates charged to prime borrowers (borrowers classified as riskfree) for the first   quarter 1998 through the fourth quarter 2004  are provided in Chart 2 (see also Table   11).52 Tentative findings are         •  Overall  the spreads between small loan rates and the prime rate—the base   rate for rate adjustments in small business loans—range between 0 and 1.5   percent for loans under $100 000 and between 0.5 and 0.5 percent for larger   small business loans  with a slightly declining trend in both sizes over the   period.53      •  The spreads between rates for small borrowers and those for the banks’ prime     customers average between 2 and 2.5 percent for larger small loans and   between 2 and 4 percent for the smallest loans. However  there were wider   fluctuations in the movements and a substantial increase in the spreads over   the last two years of the present recovery.      •  As an index for most loans to small businesses  the prime tends to be rigid.     However  over the January 1998 through December 2004 period  the spreads                                                        51 The cost of funds for small firms is affected by factors such as the terms  collateral  and financial   condition of borrowers  as well as the risk assessment of business lending by banks during different   business cycles. Moreover  with floating rate arrangements  small borrowers are bearing the risk of rate   changes. Furthermore  the relationship between the prime rate  especially the local prime  and rates charged   in the money markets has also changed  at least in the short term.    52 Since May 1997  loan rates have been grouped on the basis of varying degrees of risk and presented in   the Federal Reserve Board’s Statistical Release E.2. The Federal Reserve tabulates original data for use by   the Office of Advocacy to better reflect rates charged small firms (for loans under $1 million). This makes   the comparison of rate spreads for small loans over large loans over time difficult  if not impossible.    53 Overall  the premium over the prime rate rises slightly in periods of strong demand and decreases when   demand is weak and liquidity is ample in the banking sector  as in 20022004.           19    Chart 2.

A look at the spreads between the prime rate and the rates charged to banks’   prime customers (riskfree loans)  is most revealing. Banks have stopped   competing by changing prime rates. The rates paid by prime customers were 2   percent below the prime rate over this period. A comparison of the   movements in the spreads between small loan rates and rates for prime   customers and the spreads between the prime and the prime customer rates in   2004 indicated that banks have not been cutting loan rates to attract small   business borrowing—so  as the rate spreads between small loan rates and the   prime narrowed slightly  the spreads between small loan rates and the rates   paid by the banks’ prime customers rose over the past two years..      •  Although the 19861997 period and the 19982004 period are not strictly   comparable  a comparison was attempted of the rate spreads between the   smallest loans and the prime rates for the two periods.1 Table 9 summarizes   the results. On average  the spreads were higher in the earlier period—  between 1 and 2 percent—compared with 0.5 to 1.5 percent in the later period.   Again  the rate spreads increase about 50 basis points when the economy is   doing well and demand is strong  as in the 19861990 and 19982001 periods.           A brief note on loan rates for small business credit cards.      •  As a national/regional market served by some two dozen large competitors  the     small business credit card market is very competitive.2 Most competition    however  is conducted on nonprice terms—banks compete by offering teaser                                                        54 As discussed  the Federal Reserve Board began in May 1997 to group rates for floatingrate loans on the   basis of “repricing” periods—one day  2 to 30 days  31 days to 365 days  etc. Shortterm rates for loans   reported before 1997 were for loan maturities under one year. No information on the repricing period is   indicated for these loans.   55 Major credit card issuers include American Express  MBNA  Capital One  Citicorp  Chase  Bank of   America  Bank One (before it merged with Chase)  Wells Fargo  Advanta   etc. Many BHCs and financial   services holding companies have established a commercial banking entity or  more recently  a federal   savings bank to conduct credit card operations.      20     rates  different grace periods for no or low interest  airline mileage   advantages  and credit or cash discounts  etc. Consequently  most of the   interest rates charged  after the promotion period  by lenders are 5 to 6 percent   over prime rates  adjustable weekly or monthly. 56 The rates jump   immediately—to 19.99 percent or higher for most lenders—when a borrower   fails to make payments on time.       Conclusion        Small business banking consists of a multitude of markets of varying sizes serving the   different needs of different small business groups. While most small business bank loan   markets are small local markets  large regional or even national markets for small   business credit lines have also developed. Most major small business bank loan markets   in the United States have remained competitive or have become even more competitive in   spite of banking consolidation. The continued presence of a large number of profitable   community banks in many local and regional markets facing the encroachment of large   national and regional banks is testimony to the competition in the small business banking   markets in the United States. This explains why most small firms have indicated little   concern about the availability of credit over the past decade. However  banks continue to   compete on terms other than pricing—that is  competition in the small business loan   markets is characterized by mostly oligopolistic pricing. Declines in the cost of   borrowing to small firms over the past decade are mostly the result of ample liquidity   available to the banking industry and in the overall financial markets in the United States.                                                        56 Obtained from a review of the terms contained in promotion materials sent by lenders.           21    References          Akhavein  Jalal  W.
