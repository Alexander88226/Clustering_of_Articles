BackgroundCommercial banks have been the leading supplier of debt capital to small firms in the United States. With the increasing availability of small business lending statistics and of research on the topic it becomes possible to provide an overview of the small business loan markets in the United States as well as an evaluation of the impact of major developments on the cost and availability of loans to small businesses. The paper begins with a brief discussion of the market\\xe2\\x80\\x94the borrowers lenders and market organization\\xe2\\x80\\x94followed by a discussion of major developments in U.S. financial markets and the banking industry. Topics discussed include innovations in information technology and in financial modeling and financial products as well as banking consolidation and the growth of interstate banking. The implications of increased competition in small business loan markets as evidenced by the emergence of a nationwide market for credit lines and business credit cards and the entry of regional and national banks and bank holding companies (BHCs) into local markets are discussed.Overall FindingsLoan markets for most small business borrowers in the United States have become more competitive over the past decade evidenced by the emergence of a nationwide market for credit lines and credit cards and the entry of large regional banks in local markets. However the impact of increased competition on the cost of funds to small firms as indicated by the rate spreads between small business rates and the rates paid by the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 best prime customers is more difficult to assess because of data limitations.Highlights(cid127) With more than 6000 banks and BHCs serving millions of small business owners the small business loan markets in the United States are made up of hundreds or even thousands of submarkets varying in size and borrower characteristics. Many of these markets are segmented with various degrees of intermarket connection in the flows of funds.(cid127) Competition in different submarkets also varies significantly\\xe2\\x80\\x94from highly competitive credit card markets for small businesses at the national level to fairly competitive markets in major urban centers to markets with very limited competition in remote rural areas and/or for specific ethnic groups. (cid127) The emergence of a nationwide market for small business credit lines and credit cards over the past decade is a significant development in small business financing. The number of small business loans outstanding (loans under $100000) increased from about 5 million in 1995 to 14 million in 2004 compared with much smaller increases in larger small business loans up from 1 million in 1995 to 1.7 million in 2004. Most of the increases came from 15 to 20 multibilliondollar banks and BHCs; they accounted for more than 50 percent of the number of loans under $100000 outstanding. Fourteen banks/BHCs have extended business loans in more than 40 states according to the 2003 database of information submitted by banks as required by the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA). (cid127) The entry of large regional banks into local markets also increased market competition in local small business markets. In 2003 of 370 banks/BHCs that made larger small business loans (loans between $100000 and $1 million) in more than one state 34 have lending activities in more than 10 states.This Small Business Research Summary summarizes one of a series of research papers prepared by the U.S. Small Business Administration\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Office of Advocacy or its research contractors.

The prime rate served as the proxy for the rates charged to banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 best customers in earlier years but prime customers have generally been charged rates below prime since the 1990s.Information on the rate premium over the base (or the index) in the rate adjustment formula of loan agreements would be most useful to an understanding of this issue. Scope and MethodologyThe databases used for the analysis include Reports of Condition and Income (call reports) reports submitted under the requirements of the Community Reinvestment Act (CRA reports) and Statistical Release E.2\\xe2\\x80\\x94the Survey of Terms of Business Lending conducted quarterly by the Federal Reserve Board. Studies on small business lending using these databases including for example the Office of Advocacy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual banking studies (available at http//www.sba.gov/advo/research/banking.html) are reviewed and summarized. Time series statistics were generated for analysis of the trends in small business lending by banks.This report was peerreviewed consistent with Advocacy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data quality guidelines.

Charles.ou@sba.gov    Introduction  Defined in the broadest sense to include independent businesses with 500 or fewer hired employees U.S. small businesses numbered 23 million in 2003 employed about half of the private sector work force and produced about half of the nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s private sector output.1 Small firms are important to a competitive American economy because they fill niches in both input and output markets innovate and contribute to the dynamism in American industries and the U.S. economy.  The small business population in the United States Because of the lack of a nationwide business registration and deregistration system in the United States tracking the small business population and its dynamic changes has been a challenging task. Only recently a more comprehensive annual national profile of the business population and thus the small and mediumsized enterprise (SME) population has become available.2                                                    1 See U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy The Small Business Economy various editions and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business Frequently Asked Questions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d at http//www.sba.gov/advo/research/. 2 While the annual profile of employer firms has been available for some time the annual profile of nonemployer firms was made available to the public only in January 2001 for the year 1997. See U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census www.census.gov/epcd/nonemployer/view/pressrel.html. \\x0c  5.7 e. 18.0 23.7 27.0 18.9 10.3 5.0  Table 1 Measures of the U.S. Small Business Population 2003 (millions) SME Measures Employer firms (nonfarm)  Nonemployer firms   Total   Number of nonfarm business tax returns  Number of Sole Proprietorships (IRS) in 2002  Selfemployment nonincorporated Selfemployment incorporated  e. = estimated Sources U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy from data provided by the U.S. Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census; U.S. Department of the Treasury Internal Revenue Service SOI Bulletin; and U.S. Department of Labor.  As of 2003 the number of U.S. businesses (and thus small businesses) totaled 23 million including 5.7 million employer firms and 18 million nonemployer firms (Table 1).3 Employer firms have employee(s) and participate in payroll tax withholding programs (identified by employer identification numbers or EINs). Nonemployer firms have no employees but file business tax returns with the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) of the U.S. Department of the Treasury. Other frequently mentioned measures of the U.S. small business population include the number of business tax returns filed with the IRS and the selfemployed. Tax return data include filings of subsidiaries of larger companies\\xe2\\x80\\x94a fact that means large companies are reported numerous times\\xe2\\x80\\x94as well as the individual business returns of numerous very small business entities. Selfemployment is a work force population concept. Thus the two estimates of the business population are not comparable\\xe2\\x80\\x94for example the total of 16 million nonemployer firms reflects a universe that is somewhat different from the 15 million selfemployed owners of incorporated and unincorporated businesses.4                                                     3 See also op. cit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall Business Frequently Asked Questions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d June 2004 edition. 4 Examples would be an S corporation with five owners or a fiveperson partnership with one or no employees etc.   2\\x0cWhile the sheer number of small businesses is huge a substantial number of these firms are very small many generating annual receipts of less than $10000.5 Even among \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfullfledged\\xe2\\x80\\x9d businesses with hired employees or selfemployed businesses that provide a fulltime career to the owner(s) different types of businesses are observed\\xe2\\x80\\x94from young dynamic ventures involved in innovative products to established small businesses serving local or regional markets and from established subcontractors of large multinational corporations to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmom and pop\\xe2\\x80\\x9d small craft retail and service businesses. The business goals and motivations of these businesses are different as are their financial strategies and financing behaviors.   The dynamics of small firms  The relative position of small businesses in the U.S. economy tends to remain constant over time; that is they continue to account for 99.7 percent of all businesses and employ slightly more than 50 percent of private nonfarm workers. Nevertheless the gross movements in the number of businesses and employment are huge with constant flows of business births and deaths and with expansions and contractions in employment. These movements demonstrate the dynamics of business change and competitiveness in the American economy. Only with a continuous flow of new firms entering the market can an economy assure that an adequate number of \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuccessful\\xe2\\x80\\x9d startups emerges to become \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgazelles\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or small nimble fastgrowing businesses.   In sum SMEs in the United States6 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Represent 99.7 percent of all employer firms; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Are very small 75 percent having no employees; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Are more than 50 percent \\xe2\\x80\\x9chomebased;\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Employ half of all private sector employees;                                                  5 In 2002 8.6 million of 18.9 million sole proprietorship returns reported receipts of less than $10000. An additional 5.9 million had $10000 to $50000 in receipts. 6 Op. cit. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFrequently Asked Questions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and Brian Headd \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBusiness Success Factors Leading to Surviving and Closing Successfully\\xe2\\x80\\x9d U.S. Bureau of the Census Center for Economic Studies Working Paper #CESWP0101 January 2001; also Analyses of Business Dissolution by Demographic Category of Business Ownership Advocacyfunded research by Richard J.

Financing Patterns of Small Firms  Small firms use a variety of financing sources for different purposes. The Federal Reserve Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Survey of Small Business Finances (1998 SSBF and earlier surveys in 1993 and 1987) provides the most comprehensive database on the uses of credit and other financial services by some 5.3 million small firms in the United States in 1998.8   Percentages of all small firms who used credit  More than 80 percent of all small businesses had used some kind of credit previously and thus had outstanding debt on their books at the end of 1998.9 Fiftyfive percent of small firms used traditional loans while 71 percent used nontraditional sources mainly                                                  7 However many small business failures showed up in the personal bankruptcy courts. See Robert M. Lawless and Elizabeth Warren The Myth of the Disappearing Business Bankruptcy. In www.kauffman.org/pdf/eship_bankruptcy_061505.pdf. 8 See U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy Financing Patterns of Small Firms Findings from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances September 2003 (see http//www.sba.gov/advo/stats/ssbf_98.pdf  1060.2KB ). The Federal Reserve Board has completed the collection of financial information for 2003. The final edited database for the 2003 SSBF should be available for public use in spring 2006.  9 Credit extended by a supplier is the debt of the borrower. For example credit used by a small business will show up as debt in the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s books. The terms \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdebt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccredit\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are therefore used interchangeably in this discussion.  4\\x0cowners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 loans and credit cards for their credit needs.10 Among the different types of credit used credit cards (both personal and business) credit lines and vehicle loans were the most commonly used types or sources of credit. Fortysix and 34 percent respectively of small firms used personal and business credit cards 28 percent used credit lines; and 21 percent vehicle loans (Table 2).   Among financial institutions banks are the most often used credit source for small firms 38 percent of small firms had credit outstanding from commercial banks in 1998. Owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 loans were the second most important source used by at least 14.2 percent of small firms an underestimate at that.11 Next 13.3 percent of small firms used finance companies as a credit source.   The smallest firms have much less access to bank financing than larger firms. Only 17 to 31 percent of firms in the two smallest size categories (with zero and 1 to 4 employees respectively) borrowed from commercial banks compared with 53 to 77 percent of larger small firms (Table 3).  Loans from a firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owners are among the most important sources of financing for most small firms. However reliance on owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 loans was not well captured for all firms in the survey because sole proprietorship owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 capital was not considered debt financing and was thus excluded.12 An examination of the borrowing patterns of small corporations indicated that some 30 percent of small corporations borrowed from their owner(s) compared with 14 percent of all small businesses.13  The percentage of small firms using credit increases with firm size. The percentage of firms using any credit increased from 70 to 99.6 percent as the employment size of the firms increased from 0 to more than 100. This trend is most pronounced in loans supplied                                                  10 Traditional loans are the six types of loans covered in the survey lines of credit mortgages vehicle loans equipment loans leasing and other loans. Loans from owner(s) and credit cards were covered separately and thus considered nontraditional. 11 The importance of owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 loans is underestimated because loans from sole proprietors were not covered in the survey and were thus excluded. See the discussion in a later section.  12 Borrowing from owners by sole proprietorships is by definition equity rather than debt borrowing.  5\\x0cTable 2  Percentage of All Small Firms Using Credit by Credit Type 1998 lanoitidarTyn   naoLAny Credit AtiderC fo eniL82.555.027.770.280.389.694.195.099.632.849.070.176.084.292.112.821.034.849.259.974.9Loan TypeegagtroM13.26.512.515.519.521.118.8elciheV20.512.317.925.131.332.929.8tnempiuqE9.93.97.814.612.922.125.0esaeL10.63.27.514.622.323.328.3rehtO9.85.88.99.315.019.322.7naoLnoNynA  lanoitidart70.759.468.275.784.385.684.5naoL renwO14.20.212.019.329.132.927.6 tiderC lanosrePdraC46.048.246.743.252.238.823.7CategoryAny FirmNumber of Employees0145  910  1920  99100  499Standard Industrial ClassificationMining and constructionManufacturingTransportationWholesale tradeRetail tradeFinance insurance & real estateServicesNote  Owner loans are included for partnerships and corporations only.Source U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy "Financing Patterns of Small Firms Findings from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finance"  September 2003.13.124.718.121.614.014.211.166.858.562.164.354.159.848.884.986.885.488.478.384.381.432.034.229.747.325.226.923.111.67.610.912.117.424.811.538.018.128.827.817.816.616.067.676.776.882.962.370.071.611.116.512.59.87.711.58.88.316.714.910.56.410.011.610.517.212.610.510.18.97.940.848.744.145.841.041.549.9 tiderC ssenisuBdraC34.117.429.344.151.857.962.533.439.345.546.329.936.331.7\\x0c naoL lanoitidarTynAny Credit A  yrotisopeDynA noitutitsnI82.555.042.070.280.389.694.195.099.632.849.070.176.084.292.121.635.555.962.573.577.9CategoryAny FirmNumber of Employees0145  910  1920  99100  499Table 3  Percentage of all Small Firms Using Credit by Supplier of Credit 1998 Depository InstitutionsNondepository InstitutionsNonfinancial InstitutionsLenderknaB laicremmoC yrotisopednoNynA noitutitsnIynapmoC ecnaniF38.219.813.317.331.353.259.070.277.210.816.723.233.234.945.47.111.515.819.724.327.5yrotisopednoN rehtO1.51.51.51.51.21.91.8egarekorB0.40.50.30.30.70.82.2gnisaeL6.82.54.89.614.512.422.7noinU tiderC2.33.02.22.33.31.00.1tfirhT3.32.93.32.83.95.03.4 laicnanifnoNynA noitutitsnI9.66.78.79.513.817.712.4sdneirFdna  ylimaF6.03.65.75.69.410.56.5sessenisuB rehtO3.02.62.43.43.45.64.3Standard Industrial Classification3.7Mining and construction1.9Manufacturing4.7Transportation3.4Wholesale trade0.8Retail trade3.1Finance insurance & real estateServices2.2Note  Owner loans are included for partnerships and corporations only.Source U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy  "Financing Patterns of Small Firms Findings from the 1998 Survey of Small Business Finances" September 2003.50.342.239.346.140.341.631.422.521.027.525.015.016.319.955.446.044.251.242.746.934.984.986.885.488.478.384.381.466.858.562.164.354.159.848.818.512.619.514.610.510.812.86.415.39.510.49.511.39.13.39.16.26.95.48.35.83.49.78.99.63.86.77.91.20.82.11.71.82.91.33.02.72.54.33.35.93.00.70.60.30.70.10.00.52.75.32.82.03.02.92.8 lanoitidartnoNynA tiderCsdraC tiderC lanosrePsdraC tiderC ssenisuBsnaoL renwO70.714.246.034.159.468.275.784.385.684.567.676.776.882.962.370.071.60.212.019.329.132.927.613.124.718.121.614.014.211.148.246.743.252.238.823.740.848.744.145.841.041.549.9 17.429.344.151.857.962.533.439.345.546.329.936.331.7tnemnrevoG1.00.50.70.91.63.22.60.91.50.01.71.70.00.7\\x0cby depository institutions (banks thrifts and credit unions). For example only 22 percent of firms with no employees used credit from depository institutions while 78 percent of firms with more than 100 employees did so.14   Two distinct patterns were observed in the relationships between firm size and the percentage using a certain type or supplier of credit. The positive relationship between firm size and the percentage used is observed for most commonly used credit types and sources and seems to reflect their availability to larger small firms. These types of credit become more available as firm size increases. A flat or even inverse relationship between firm size and the use of a type or source of credit\\xe2\\x80\\x94as observed with owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 loans and personal credit cards\\xe2\\x80\\x94reflects a different phenomenon the need of very small firms to use alternative sources because other usually less expensive sources of financing are unavailable.   The relative size of each market as indicated by the value of debt outstanding is shown in Table 4. Lines of credit and commercial mortgages are the two largest markets accounting for more than 60 percent of the total debt outstanding for these small firms at the end of 1998.15   In conclusion a multitude of small business loan markets exist in the United States serving small firms of varying sizes with different financial characteristics and financing preferences.16                                                                                                                                                      13 Op. cit.

Limited current information about bank lending to small firms has been available from call reports (June Reports of Condition and Income) since 1994 and from CRA reports (reports required under the Community Reinvestment Act) since 1997.21   Major developments that have contributed to changes in the performance of the small business loan markets over the past decade include  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 innovations in the financial markets contributed by technology especially in information collection processing and distribution and financial modeling;  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  banking consolidation and a decline in the number of banks in the United States; and  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  globalization in the financial markets among industrialized nations.   Impacts of innovation in financial markets on the sources of funds by financial intermediaries  Innovations in U.S. financial markets during the past several decades have been significant. New products and services have been developed by different financial institutions to collect savings from individual households and businesses to lend to and/or                                                  20 In fact it is the nonbank lenders that helped maintain competition in small business loan markets in spite of increased concentration in the banking sector.

Most nondeposit financial institutions such as finance companies rely on the public markets for funding of their business lending; most depository institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x94banks savings banks and credit unions\\xe2\\x80\\x94have experienced drastic declines in deposits as the source of funding for lending.23 Credit scoring which allows lenders to access their borrowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 credit profiles especially their credit history is one major innovation that should contribute to the growth of small business loan markets.     Banking consolidation  In spite of a large decline in the number of banks in the United States in part because of numerous merger and acquisition (M&A) activities among banks/BHCs of all sizes over the past 10 to 15 years the U.S. banking system is still the least concentrated banking system in the industrialized world.24 As of June 2004 there were some 6500 banks and BHCs in the United States.25 The 72 multibilliondollar banks and BHCs with domestic assets in excess of $10 billion held 75 percent of domestic assets but accounted for less than 50 percent of small business lending (business loans under $1 million) as of June 2004. Many of these giant banks maintained vast numbers of retail branches across the nation while several were concentrated in wholesale business lending and international                                                  22 The growth of private and public pension funds mutual fund companies and other institutional investors as well as various credit products packaging loans of different risk brackets has encouraged the growth of public capital and credit markets far exceeding that of financial intermediaries in channeling savings to investment in the U.S. economy.  23 Innovations that allow depository institutions to access public funding markets through asset securitization have found very limited success when small business loans are involved because of the difficulties in packaging small business loans characterized by widely different risk and loan terms.  24 See discussions on the markets in Japan and the United Kingdom at the conference for which this paper was prepared \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternational Comparisons in the Financing of SMEs in Developed Nations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d http//www2.warwick.ac.uk/fac/soc/wbs/conf/intsmefinance/. 25 See U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy Small Business and Micro Business Lending for 2003 2004 at http//www.sba.gov/advo/research/rbsbl04.pdf. Call report data were  9\\x0cbanking.26 An additional 645 mediumsized banks/BHCs (with assets between $500 million and $10 billion) operated in multistate regional space. The remaining 5600 banks/BHCs with domestic assets under $500 million served local and withinstate markets (Table 6). As the number of banks decline and many giant interstate or regional banks and bank holding companies (BHCs) emerge more products and services are offered by more banks and nonbank institutions in different markets and locations and banking competition in national and regional markets intensifies.27  Trends in bank lending to small businesses 19952004 As of June 2004 a total of 15.3 million loans outstanding of less than $1 million each valued at a total of $522 billion were owed by small businesses to commercial banks. More than 13.6 million of these valued at a total of $125.7 billion were in the smallest loan category under $100000 and most of these were business credit cardrelated. Table 7 provides an analysis of the changes over the decade.28   One perennial concern about banking consolidation has been its implications for small business lending because of the relatively small share of small business loans in the asset portfolios of most giant banks. Table 8 provides a comparison of the relative importance of small business lending for banks and BHCs of varying sizes since June 1997. The following findings are observed \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Small business lending seems to have kept pace with overall growth in business lending. The declining share of the amount in the smallest size category (under $100000) could be just a statistical phenomenon because of                                                                                                                                                  consolidated for all BHC members to derive a total of 6423 U.S. banks/BHCs in June 2004 (compared with a total of 7678 banks submitting June 2004 call reports to federal financial supervisory authorities).  26 The ratios of small business loans to total domestic assets for these banks excluding American Express Centurion range from 0.0 to 0.194 with a median of 0.06 in June 2004.

Among the possible explanations are 1. giant banks are concentrating on credit card and credit line markets and thus neglecting the larger loan size markets; 2. large banks have acquired more nonsmall business lenders thus increasing their asset shares without raising their small business loan share; 29 and 3. acquiring banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 participation in local business markets after a merger or acquisition is passive rather than active (Table 8).   Loan rates charged by commercial banks on small business loans  Small business loan rates charged by banks are affected by many factors\\xe2\\x80\\x94the size of the market and thus the level of competition the credit quality of the borrowers the costs of extending and administering small business loans and the cost of money to the lenders. The variables affecting the rates include the risk of the loans loan size collateral commitment and many other loan underwriting terms. The Federal Reserve Board began collecting information about the loan rates charged by commercial banks in the late 1970s and has subsequently instituted several major revisions in data collection and reporting formats. Statistical Release E.2 provides information on the rates charged by banks to corporate and small business customers for the first week of February May August and November of the year. Small loan rates are used as a proxy for small business loan rates. Effective weighted rates charged by banks are reported by risk category of the loan and by repricing period.30 Information about other loan terms\\xe2\\x80\\x94such                                                  29 See Joe Peeks The Effect of Interstate Banking on Small Business Lending prepared for the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy September 1997 available online at http//www.sba.gov/advo/research/rs179.pdf  82.4KB. 30 The Federal Reserve Board has reported effective loan rates by risk category since May 1998. Effective rates by loan size continue to be reported in the E.2 Release but with no reference to the repricing periods.  11\\x0cas the use of collateral commitment and the base rate used for adjustable loans\\xe2\\x80\\x94are also reported for each loan group in the release. It is difficult to generalize about the rate spreads between loans of different sizes and different risk groups as reported in Release E.2 because as discussed previously small business loan markets are made up of hundreds or even thousands of submarkets characterized by the size of the geographic area in which different types of borrowers and lenders participate.31 Table 9 provides an overview of the loan terms charged by commercial banks on business loans of different sizes by large and small domestic banks.32   The following observations can be made about the terms of bank loans to small firms33  1.  Most small business loans are made in adjustablerate loan arrangements\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is the rates are adjustable over the term of a loan on the basis of changes in the base or index rate which adjusts as market rates adjust. What this implies is that the cost of borrowing to small businesses changes as the interest rates in the capital and credit markets change. Small firms do not know the precise costs of borrowing anymore. 34                                                                                                                                                  Special tabulations on the rates by loan size and by repricing period have been made available to the U.S. Small Business Administration Office of Advocacy.  31 Moreover since large loans make up a major share of the overall business loan markets the estimated shares weighted by loan values as provided in Release E.2 reveal limited information about the characteristics of small business loans. In fact it would be most revealing to look at the variation in the rates charged to small firms.  32 Special tabulations using a simple average rather than a valueweighted average were provided by the Federal Reserve Board to the Office of Advocacy for information on the percentages/share of loans with collateral precommitment and using the prime as the base rate.  33 An econometric estimate for the rate determination would be the only way to identify the significant factors explaining the difference between rates charged to small and large businesses.  34 This might indicate that they are more sensitive to changes in monetary policy.

The rate spreads and how the base rates change in response to changes in the rates in the capital and credit markets provide better indicators of the relative costs of borrowing to small firms compared with large borrowers.35  3.  In general the rate spreads differ by risk category loan size and size of the lender\\xe2\\x80\\x94with differences of 2 to 2.5 percent between the minimalrisk group and other groups; 1.5 to 2 percent between the smallest loans (under $100000) and the largest small business loans ($500000 to under $1 million); and 50 to 75 basis points between large domestic banks and small banks in the United States.  4.  Most small business loans are made with the prime rate as the base rate.36 Since the prime may not adjust as promptly to changes in the market rates especially when the market rates are falling the rate spreads between small business loan rates and the prime may differ significantly from the spreads in rates charged to the bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best customers.  5.  It is difficult to estimate the rate spreads over the base rate the index rate that changes as the market rate changes. The convention is that most small business loans have a rate spread (rate premium) of 1 to 3 percent above the base rate. However the spreads over the rates charged to the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 best customers are much higher. Chart 2 summarizes the rate spreads between small business loans (for two loan sizes of under $100000 and $100000 to $500000) and the average prime rates as well as the spread over the primecustomer rates (as defined in the E.2 release). Rates for loans with 230 days repricing periods are used in this analysis. i. The negative rate spreads between larger small business loans and the prime is a puzzle. It is hard to imagine an adjustableloan formula with a negative spread over the base stipulated in the loan contract for this loan size. Several explanations are offered loans made by larger banks did not use the prime as the base rate                                                  35 It would be revealing to know how the actual rates charged at the time of borrowing compared with the rates charged on the basis of the formula in the loan contract. There is an incentive for lenders to use \\xe2\\x80\\x9cteaser rates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d rates below the rate based on the adjustable rate formula when competition for borrowers is strong. This practice is likely when market rates are rising or are expected to rise in the near future.   13\\x0cfor their larger loans; prime rates used by larger banks are lower than the market average during this period of falling interest rates; large banks used \\xe2\\x80\\x98teaser rates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x94rates lower than the rate determined by the formula.  The rates paid by the prime customers are 200 basis points below the average prime rates in this period. Fluctuations in the spreads between the prime and primecustomer rates were also observed during this period\\xe2\\x80\\x94possibly an indication of rigidity in the prime rates. The spread between the smallest loans and the rates paid by prime customers were 2.5 to 3.5 percent. ii. iii. 6.  The repricing periods range from zero to 360 days. Twothirds of small business loans have a zero repricing period \\xe2\\x80\\x94that is rates are adjustable as soon as the base rate changes as compared with a fixed interval adjustment such as monthly quarterly etc.37 Rate premiums over rates with shorter repricing periods were observed only for loans with an over360day repricing period.  7.  Most small business loans were made with collateral.38  To conclude there is still much to learn about the rate spreads between the rates for small business loans and the prime or the primecustomer rates. Information about the rate spreads in a loan contract might be more useful than information about the actual rates paid by borrowers at the time of borrowing. An econometric study on factors affecting the rates or rate spreads using individual loan data would certainly be most revealing.                                                                                                                                                     36 The prime has become more common as the base rate (the index) for small business loans than as the rate charged to the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 best customers as has been commonly assumed. The rates charged to the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 best customers are usually below prime especially when money market rates are low. 37 Some 80 percent of the loans have repricing periods of less than 30 days.  38 It is likely that this refers to loans other than business credit cards which show huge increases in the number of loans originated but not in the dollar amount.   14\\x0cCompetition and Performance of Small Business Bank Loan Markets in the United States39   The degree of competition in the small business loan markets in the United States differs widely because of different degrees of participation in local markets by regional and national lenders. Large national and superregional lenders enter the local markets through two channels\\xe2\\x80\\x94mass marketing through all public media and relationship lending through the development of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdirect\\xe2\\x80\\x9d relationships between bank branch officers and small business borrowers. The products/services marketed through the former channel will be generalpurpose loans with limited requirements on how and where the loan funds are used. Loan applications are evaluated on the basis of the borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and/or the business\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit history as well as other business financials. In the latter channel for specialpurpose lending specific knowledge of the borrower(s) as well the loan purposes and the characteristics of collateral are required. Specific loan covenants might be required and an effective monitoring process used to assure loan performance. Of course there are other loan types that use a combination of these two financing channels.   It is difficult to evaluate the performance of small business loan markets in providing financing to small firms at \\xe2\\x80\\x9creasonable\\xe2\\x80\\x9d prices because of the difficulty of defining the market from the statistical information collected.40 The issue is further complicated by limited information available for statistical analysis purposes.  Competition and performance in the small business loan markets in the United States will be briefly discussed under three headings\\xe2\\x80\\x94the emerging nationwide market for credit lines and credit cards for small businesses competition in larger small business loan markets and interest rate spreads for small business loans over large business loans. Community Reinvestment Act (CRA) data will be used to investigate the degree of                                                  39 SSBF data have been much utilized to investigate small business lending practices of banks of different sizes. For a review of all major research using the SSBF files go to the bibliography of the SSBF section on the Federal Reserve Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s website. 40 This explains why complaints that small business credit markets do not work continue to be heard while most respondents to small business surveys indicate their satisfaction with the markets\\xe2\\x80\\x99 performance.   15\\x0cparticipation by large banks and BHCs in local markets.41 Two small business loan markets are identified\\xe2\\x80\\x94the small credit line/credit card market approximated by the smallest loans (under $100000) and the larger loan market for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cspecial purpose\\xe2\\x80\\x9d loans such as nonresidential mortgages equipment and other loans.42 Entry into the local markets by large regional and national banks provides the major impetus for increased competition.   An emerging nationwide market for small business credit lines/business credit cards With a maturing consumer credit card market and accumulated knowledge and experience in credit scoring and credit card lending large national and superregional banks have promoted and exploited small business credit cards over the past 10 years. As discussed in the previous section the number of the smallest loans under $100000 showed a rapid increase in this period. Multibilliondollar banks/BHCs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 share of the number of loans under $100000 outstanding increased from 40 percent to 67 percent between June 1997 and June 2004 as compared with relatively insignificant changes for other measures of small business lending activities by these banks/BHCs (Table 8). A study of the CRA data for 2003 indicated that 14 large banks/BHCs have participated in the nationwide markets; these banks/BHCs had at least 10 loans in each of the 50 states in 200343 (Table 10b). Nationwide banks include such well known credit card banks as Advanta Amex GE Capital MBNA and Atlantic Bank and BHCs such as Bank of America Bank One Citigroup FleetBoston U.S.Bancorp Wells Fargo etc. Most major credit card banks participated only in the under $100000 market while the giant BHCs participated in this and other small business loan markets with extensive branch networks.                                                   41 Only the CRA database provides information about the destination of a bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small business lending activities. Op. cit. Small Business and Micro Business Lending in the United States for Data Years 20033004.  42 The distinction is indeed not very precise. The special purpose market also includes the smallest loans made by smaller banks which include vehicle loans lease improvement loans etc. to small businesses.  43 While many banks reported loan activities in more than one state in the CRA many show only one or two loans in a given state for 2003. Of a total of 1000 banks/BHCs in the 2003 CRA reports many had extended fewer than five loans in a given state. To exclude these \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccasual lenders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d banks with a significant small business program in a given state are identified as those with more than 10 loans under $100000 and more than 5 loans of $100000 to $1 million.   16\\x0cTable 10a  Number of Banks/BHCs Made at Least Five Loans ($100000 to $1 Million) in a given state 2003Number of states a bank extended loansOne state25 states610 statesmore than 10 statesTotal number of banks/BHCsNumber of Banks/BHCs                                                                                                                                                                                          63330033341000Table 10b  Number of Banks/BHCs Made at Least 10 Micro Loans ( less than$100000) in a given state 2003Number of states a bank extended loansOne state25 states610 states1039 statesMore than 40 statesTotal number of banks/BHCsNumber of Banks/BHCs                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    669259311614989Note  Many loans under $100000 may not be credit lines or credit card loans.Source Estimates derived from the CRA data for the year 2003.  \\x0c Chart 1 offers a simplistic illustration of participation by banks/BHCs of different sizes in these two markets. Two small business bank loan markets in Wisconsin are described\\xe2\\x80\\x94for loans under $100000 and between $100000 and $1 million.44 The number of larger loans made by a certain bank/BHC is plotted against the number of the smallest loans. The market for small credit lines and credit cards is indicated on the horizontal axis. Here the market is dominated by two groups of lenders\\xe2\\x80\\x94a small number of large credit card banks that made a large number of loans in this market and no loans in the larger small business loan markets and several large regional and national banks/BHCs with extensive lending in this and the larger loan markets.45 With extensive use of credit scoring and other financial modeling and risk management tools multibilliondollar national banks/BHCs have promoted this generalpurpose credit line market to become a national market for small firms. This is the market in which large regional and national lenders extend credit lines to small firms across the country.46 Competition in this market is mostly oligopolistic\\xe2\\x80\\x94characterized by nonprice competition more than by price competition. To the extent that the emerging credit card/credit line market promoted by giant banks/BHCs contributes to the provision of new credit products for small firms the markets for small business loans and the availability of small business financing have expanded.   Entry into the local small business loan markets by large national and regional banks The other small business loan market consists of different submarkets of varying sizes with different geographical expansion\\xe2\\x80\\x94including markets for very small loans (under $100000) extended by small community banks in local markets large vehicle loan markets participated in by banks of all sizes as well as finance companies markets for commercial mortgage loans also offered by banks/BHCs of all sizes (except very small                                                  44 Some 150 banks/BHCs reported small business lending in the State of Wisconsin in their CRA report in 2003. About 65 banks/BHCs which reported making 10 or more small business loans in Wisconsin in 2003 were plotted for examination. See CRA data in the Office of Advocacy report on Small Business and Micro Business Lending\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 various years.  45 The number of states in which these banks/BHCs have \\xe2\\x80\\x9cextended loans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a given year averages 35 to 45 states\\xe2\\x80\\x94an indication of the national market.  46 This is the market where personal and business finance are integrated with owners\\xe2\\x80\\x99 wealth and payment history constituting a major election in the credit review process.   17\\x0cbanks) (Chart 1).47 Active participation by national and regional banks and BHCs in the markets is indicated in Table 10a. Thirtyfour national/regional banks and BHCs have branches and loan offices in more than 10 states and make at least five small business loans of $100000 to $1 million in a given state.48 It is true that many of these banks/BHCs obtained entry to the local markets through mergers and acquisitions of existing banks and may not have added much to the total number of participating lenders in a given market. However by bringing funding sources from the national credit markets large banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 entry into local markets creates a link to the national market.   While there is no good statistical measure of market competition in small business loan markets competition in banking markets generally (especially in deposits) has been the subject of continuous investigation especially by federal regulatory agencies. A concentration ratio for the banking markets in the United States the socalled Herfindahl index (HHI) has been computed (using deposit distributions) by metropolitan statistical area (MSA) and nonMSA county for 2004.49 Overall banking competition in MSA markets remained competitive50 with little indication that banking consolidation has significantly affected banking market competition. A review of changes in the index over time also seems to indicate that most U.S. banking markets remained competitive.   To conclude the markets for most small business loans have become more competitive especially for some loans as the markets become regional and national in scope with the entry of large regional and national banks/BHCs.  Interest rate competition  Another measure of market competition in the small business loan markets is the cost of borrowing to small firms. As markets become more competitive the premiums between                                                  47 An examination of CRA data for the $100000 to $1 million loan market in individual states reveals that major lenders in this market were banks headquartered in the state and/or neighboring states.  48 As of June 2005 11 banks/BHCs had more than 1000 branches each according to the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation (FDIC).

Changes in the rate spreads for small business loans over the prime rates and the rates charged to prime borrowers (borrowers classified as riskfree) for the first quarter 1998 through the fourth quarter 2004 are provided in Chart 2 (see also Table 11).52 Tentative findings are  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Overall the spreads between small loan rates and the prime rate\\xe2\\x80\\x94the base rate for rate adjustments in small business loans\\xe2\\x80\\x94range between 0 and 1.5 percent for loans under $100000 and between 0.5 and 0.5 percent for larger small business loans with a slightly declining trend in both sizes over the period.53  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  The spreads between rates for small borrowers and those for the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 prime customers average between 2 and 2.5 percent for larger small loans and between 2 and 4 percent for the smallest loans. However there were wider fluctuations in the movements and a substantial increase in the spreads over the last two years of the present recovery.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  As an index for most loans to small businesses the prime tends to be rigid. However over the January 1998 through December 2004 period the spreads                                                  51 The cost of funds for small firms is affected by factors such as the terms collateral and financial condition of borrowers as well as the risk assessment of business lending by banks during different business cycles. Moreover with floating rate arrangements small borrowers are bearing the risk of rate changes. Furthermore the relationship between the prime rate especially the local prime and rates charged in the money markets has also changed at least in the short term.  52 Since May 1997 loan rates have been grouped on the basis of varying degrees of risk and presented in the Federal Reserve Board\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Statistical Release E.2. The Federal Reserve tabulates original data for use by the Office of Advocacy to better reflect rates charged small firms (for loans under $1 million). This makes the comparison of rate spreads for small loans over large loans over time difficult if not impossible.  53 Overall the premium over the prime rate rises slightly in periods of strong demand and decreases when demand is weak and liquidity is ample in the banking sector as in 20022004.   19\\x0cChart 2.

A look at the spreads between the prime rate and the rates charged to banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 prime customers (riskfree loans) is most revealing. Banks have stopped competing by changing prime rates. The rates paid by prime customers were 2 percent below the prime rate over this period. A comparison of the movements in the spreads between small loan rates and rates for prime customers and the spreads between the prime and the prime customer rates in 2004 indicated that banks have not been cutting loan rates to attract small business borrowing\\xe2\\x80\\x94so as the rate spreads between small loan rates and the prime narrowed slightly the spreads between small loan rates and the rates paid by the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 prime customers rose over the past two years..  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Although the 19861997 period and the 19982004 period are not strictly comparable a comparison was attempted of the rate spreads between the smallest loans and the prime rates for the two periods.1 Table 9 summarizes the results. On average the spreads were higher in the earlier period\\xe2\\x80\\x94between 1 and 2 percent\\xe2\\x80\\x94compared with 0.5 to 1.5 percent in the later period. Again the rate spreads increase about 50 basis points when the economy is doing well and demand is strong as in the 19861990 and 19982001 periods.   A brief note on loan rates for small business credit cards.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  As a national/regional market served by some two dozen large competitors the small business credit card market is very competitive.2 Most competition however is conducted on nonprice terms\\xe2\\x80\\x94banks compete by offering teaser                                                  54 As discussed the Federal Reserve Board began in May 1997 to group rates for floatingrate loans on the basis of \\xe2\\x80\\x9crepricing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d periods\\xe2\\x80\\x94one day 2 to 30 days 31 days to 365 days etc. Shortterm rates for loans reported before 1997 were for loan maturities under one year. No information on the repricing period is indicated for these loans. 55 Major credit card issuers include American Express MBNA Capital One Citicorp Chase Bank of America Bank One (before it merged with Chase) Wells Fargo Advanta  etc. Many BHCs and financial services holding companies have established a commercial banking entity or more recently a federal savings bank to conduct credit card operations.  20 \\x0crates different grace periods for no or low interest airline mileage advantages and credit or cash discounts etc. Consequently most of the interest rates charged after the promotion period by lenders are 5 to 6 percent over prime rates adjustable weekly or monthly. 56 The rates jump immediately\\xe2\\x80\\x94to 19.99 percent or higher for most lenders\\xe2\\x80\\x94when a borrower fails to make payments on time.   Conclusion  Small business banking consists of a multitude of markets of varying sizes serving the different needs of different small business groups. While most small business bank loan markets are small local markets large regional or even national markets for small business credit lines have also developed. Most major small business bank loan markets in the United States have remained competitive or have become even more competitive in spite of banking consolidation. The continued presence of a large number of profitable community banks in many local and regional markets facing the encroachment of large national and regional banks is testimony to the competition in the small business banking markets in the United States. This explains why most small firms have indicated little concern about the availability of credit over the past decade. However banks continue to compete on terms other than pricing\\xe2\\x80\\x94that is competition in the small business loan markets is characterized by mostly oligopolistic pricing. Declines in the cost of borrowing to small firms over the past decade are mostly the result of ample liquidity available to the banking industry and in the overall financial markets in the United States.                                                  56 Obtained from a review of the terms contained in promotion materials sent by lenders.   21\\x0cReferences  Akhavein Jalal W.
