Introduction Eight years from the beginning of the economical and financial crisis eight years full of changes  and  challenges  eight  years  full  of  integration  and  disintegration  in  building  a new vision in banking and financial services. The financial crisis made bankers/regulators reflect and try to act better considering short term  and  long  term  approach  and  consequences;  simplicity  of  customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  needs  and complexity/sophistication of banking and financial solutions/alternatives; mix of Human Capital and Technology; financial education that matters both for the staff of the banks and for the customers. During those eight years a lot of efforts have been done for adaptation adjustments in order to screen the new ingredients of a dynamic global society in an interconnected world.  Trust remain the main challenge for a new but sustainable banking business model. Trust should be regained and consolidated. The society as a whole is being transformed so does the banking and financial industry. There are fundamental changes in the way the customers make payments borrow money design financial plans for their future invest make placement of their resources.  By learning and transferring into practice the lessons from the crisis major changes can be performed. Analysing the banking market we may observe different business models different types of  banks  different  interpretations  and  implementations  of  regulations  (e.g.  of  Basel regulations). We will reflect to the main trends connected especially with the external world of a bank but also to several important pillars of a new banking model connected especially with the organization of banking business with the internal affairs of a bank. We will explore the topics mainly from a European perspective.   II. New trends in banking and financial sector The main outputs of the financial crisis represent in fact trends changing the banking business models 1) the digitalisation agenda 2) the regulatory change 3) change in customer behaviour 4) credit deleveraging 5) the development of alternative funding channels.  We  will  refer  to  this  diverse  mix  of  trends  that  is  reshaping  the  banking  model  in  a structural manner. A key point within the digitalisation agenda is the customer that is experiencing different devices for daytoday business and is willing to do the same also for banking operations. Distance banking services applications and platforms offered via mobile and other smart devices  digital  bank  branches  card less  ATMs  smart  Customer  Relationship Management  systems  connected  and  interconnected  with  different  platforms  providing also behavioural analysis of the customers online credit applications and processing are \\x0cNew pillars of the banking business model or a new model of doing banking? 145included within this technological trend having a strong impact on banking business. All the relevant processes within a bank are changed with accent on speed reliability access to interconnected platforms availability 24/7/365 security.  The  relationship  management  activity  of  the  banking  clientele  requires  innovation creativity but also clear procedures and support systems to analyse relevant information about  customers  competitors  markets  as  banking  is  mainly  an  information  business. The  dynamics  in  customer  relationship  management  determines  organisational  and technological developments and changes (Rajola 2012).  On the transactional and operations side banks may buy or develop strategic partnerships with  technology  companies.  Payment  systems  banking  transactions  and  operations  are the  main  beneficiaries  of  digitalisation  determining  reduction  of  costs  and  increase  in transparency  and  tracking  of  data.  Via  cooperation  banks  may  develop  and  operate  a common  technological  infrastructure  where  every  participating  bank  may  develop additional  services  in  order  to  define  competitive  advantages  and  to  deliver  financial solutions to the customers. Mobility of the customers the need to work and travel outside of their home countries the global migration tendencies determines changes in payments and operations systems of the banks.  Manuel Orozco (2013) reflected in his study on migration and remittances the existence of common patterns in behavior of the migrants. Regulations economical developments within specific regions dynamics in the home countries of the migrants are influencing  as  well  the  money  transfer  solutions  involving  directly  or  indirectly  the banking systems.\\t Banks may plan strategically to benefit but also to support via financial services  those  migration  trends  as  remittances  are  representing  important  flows  of capital. Another aspect to be considered is the average length of time ranging from one to seven years during which migrants remit money varying on the specific areas where they are working and sending money (Orozco 2013). Another  significant  trend  is  the  regulatory  frame  that  involves  a  wide  range  of  new regulations starting in 2009 after the G20 meeting. From compliance risk management Know Your Customer to capital reserves of the banks the regulatory trend implies deep reorganisation  of  the  banking  business  e.g.  Solvency  II  the  resolution  mechanisms introduced by the Bank Recovery and Resolution Directive ( BRRD) Single Supervisory Mechanism  (SSM)  Single  Resolution  Mechanism  (SRM)  Capital  Requirements Directive  IV  (CRD  IV)  and  Capital  Requirements  Regulation  (CRR)  Minimum Requirement for ownfunds and Eligible Liabilities (MREL). The reporting performed by the  banks  should  be  done  quicker  and  is  more  complex.  The  organisation  of  bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activity  suffered  changes  revealing  a  shift  from  sales/commercial  towards  compliance and  risk.  The  changes  are  reflected  differently  for  large  systemic  banks  and  for  small banks. In accordance with industry representatives regulations trying to adjust "to big to fail" may induce "to small to survive". Throughout the world the pressure to conserve capital  to  meet  new  regulatory  requirements  caused  the  structural  changes  of  banking business  models.  For  example  universal  banks  abandon  certain  territories  asset  classes and markets and design a new business model. \\t\\t\\x0c\\t146 Dan Costin Ni\\xc8\\x9bescu The trend that determines in fact the transformation of the banking industry is based on promoting innovation and access to new products and services. Security data protection and high levels of customer protection are also parts of the new regulations frame. One frequent  topic  related  to  the  regulations  frame  for  banks  and  for  nonbank  competitors (e.g. financial technological companies called Fintechs) is represented by the condition to assure the same rules for the same service for all players in the financial markets.  Regarding  the  trend  represented  by  the  change  in  customer  behaviour  relevant consequences  are  increasing  importance  of  customer  satisfaction  the  availability  of financial services the competition from other nonbank institutions. Customer satisfaction in banking should be considered more than a simple marketing policy the bonuses of the staff  being  linked  directly  with  customer  satisfaction  indexes  not  with  the  amount  of money  that  the  bankers  are  \\xe2\\x80\\x9eselling\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  via  banking  products  and  services.  Relevant instruments and techniques from other sciences such as psychology sociology economics are  used  more  and  more  in  banking  industry.  Behavioural  analysis  of  the  customers provides indepth knowledge to support cooperation between the bank and the customer.  Blythe and Megicks (2010) analysed the complexity of the planning process regarding the customers and the importance to consider all sets of actions reactions for a given set of circumstances  trends  in  order  to  converge  with  the  customer  expectations  and  to capitalise on them.  The information systems about the customer profile the behaviour of the customer and the  motives  that  drives  the  customer  to  make  deposits  to  invest  money  to  contract  a mortgage  loan  in  order  to  buy  a  house  are  relevant  for  the  strategies  of  the  banks emphasizing that the customer took the lead in driving changes. The dynamic global environment offers complex and difficult choices especially when considering  financial  planning  and  financial  resources  both  for  individuals  and companies. Change in customer behaviour reflected the deviations of the customers from the  standard  models  but  also  the  limits  of  those  models  and  the  need  to  take  also  into consideration relevant emotional and social factors.   The deleveraging trend (identifying assets to hold restructure or sell) is determined by banks that have been lowering their high precrisis leverage levels and are preparing for stricter  regulatory  capital  requirements.  Studies(1)  on  the  deleveraging  trend  reflect basically three ways in which banks can deleverage by raising capital by reducing (risk \\xe2\\x80\\x93 weighted assets) or restricting lending. The regulatory changes in Europe focus on the high levels(2) of NonPerforming Loans (NPL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) in the European Banking system. There are concerns that NonPerforming Loans keeps down credit growth keeps down investors appetite  for  business  perceiving  nonrealistic  estimations  affects  bank  profitability  and reduces overall economic recovery. At the global level in 2014 Eurozone included the highest percent of NPL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as reflected within the following graph. At the European level a strong activity of selling portfolios of loans started in 2014 (as Eurozone had the highest percent of NPLs around 9%) and increased significantly in 2015 (almost doubled) and 2016. UK Italy Ireland and Spain dominates the transactions(3) with NPL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.   \\x0cNew pillars of the banking business model or a new model of doing banking?

The trend represented by the development of alternative funding channels was generated by  the  shrinking  of  banking  sector  activity  and  the  opportunity that  new  forms  to  take over the financial needs of the society. Relevant factors that favours this trend are related to  the  increased  pressure  from  regulators  asking  for  more  capital  and  inducing  higher costs  to  comply  but  also  to  the  efforts  to  regain  back  the  confidence  from  customers. Another  driver  for  alternative  providers  of  services  is  technology  that  is  changing  the transactional banking and relationship banking models. Innovation is also favouring the development of alternative funding channels new solutions such as Peer to Peer lending platforms  payments  ecosystem  automated  investment  advice  crowdfunding  models registering significant progress.   According  to  Andrew  Haldane(4)  of  the  Bank  of  England  PeertoPeer  lending  activity (e.g. equity crowdfunding invoice trading Peer to Peer consumer lending  Peer to Peer business lending others) that was above 1 billion GBP in 2012 increased up to 3 billion GBP in 2014 as per the data at the end of 2014. This trend may contribute to increasing availability  and  convenience  of  finance  as  well  as  reducing  intermediation  costs.  As Haldane presented the unit cost of US financial intermediation seems to be unchanged over  a  century  income  from  finance  simply  rises  and  falls  with  the  value  of  assets suggesting  a  huge  amount  of  rent  extraction.  Technology  and  innovation  might contribute to reduce the costs but also transform the quality of lending using \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig data\\xe2\\x80\\x9d support within the bank analysis processes.  Competition and cooperation are driving the alternative funding channels development. Nonbank  and  nontraditional  actors  startup  technology  companies  giant  global companies  (e.g.  Apple  Google)  are  competing  and/or  cooperating  with  the  banking sector.  New  developments  (e.g.  Bitcoin)  ecommerce  solutions  (e.g.  PayPal)  induce  a mix of threats and opportunities to the banking industry. Global banking strategies have considered economies of scale and the combination of retail investment  and  overseas  banking  as  key  drivers  for  their  banking  models.  Technologies based  on  the  principle  of  decentralization  and  blockchains  and  competition  from  other counterparties  put  pressure  on  banks  to  redesign  their  business  models.  Banks  are \\t\\t\\x0c\\t148 Dan Costin Ni\\xc8\\x9bescu developing  cooperation  with  Technological  Laboratories  Business  Accelerators  are creating venture capital funds in order to benefit of innovation and technological progress. From the Fintech companies banks may expect competition but also cooperation.  The  development  of  alternative  funding  channels  may  support  financing  different segments of banking clientele such as Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs). SMEs that typically do not get funding from banks due to their specificities may get funding from Fintechs. In some countries from the euro area smaller firms find access to bank credit more restrictive than precrisis(5). Considering the above mentioned innovative financing solutions  Fintechs  may  also  contribute  to  making  SMEs  shares  more  tradable developing the capital markets as well.  From a historical perspective European financial system is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbanco centric\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The structure and  business  culture  of  European  societies  are  based  on  banking  sectors.  Post  crisis evolutions  including  the  development  of  alternative  funding  channels  new  forms  of equity participation new nonbank actors new cofinancing solutions enable the system to change and become more sustainable.   III. Pillars for a new banking business model The  main  trends  in  banking  and  financial  sector  derived  from  the  external  world  of  a bank  are  influencing  significantly  the  bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  activity.  We  will  also  present  several pillars from the internal organisation of the bank that could shape a new and sustainable banking  model  a)  Personnel  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  Human  Capital;  b)  ITC  infrastructures;  c)  Internal procedures and workflows; d) Communication policy and protocols. The integration of these  pillars  within  the  activity  of  the  bank  based  on  a  long  term  forward  looking approach will enable further synergies for the banking business.   a)  Personnel \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Human Capital  The  personnel  of  the  bank  should  manage  both  traditional  relationships  and  digital relationships with the customers.  The interaction between Human Capital and technology is changing considerably the way of doing banking. The engineering of a new banking model takes into consideration to mix  in  a  balanced  manner  people  competencies  new  functions  applications technologies  blended  platforms.  Designing  the  right  profiles  and  selecting  the  right people  represent  relevant  aspects  for  a  new  a  sustainable  banking  model.  Banks  are competing  on  talents  with  other  industries  that  are  developing  very  fast.  A  key  point within  a  new  banking  business  model  are  the  clients  internal  clients  of  a  bank  the personnel and external clients of a bank \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the customers. Banks  should  transform  the  personnel  into  valuable  assets  in  order  to  create  really meaning full relationships with customers. People that are working in a bank personalise the  relationships  with  the  customers  contribute  to  rebuilding  trust.  The  answer  to  the question \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat is the value of creating openness via communication technology if we do not trust each other?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is not simple.  \\x0cNew pillars of the banking business model or a new model of doing banking? 149Within the new banking model it is relevant that banks to struggle do the research and answer to questions such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhat are the real issues customers cares about?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Due to the technological developments staff of the banks see their customer less.  Inside the banks the functional shift from controlling to collaborating will add value to the relationships between departments and people.  More  and  more  banks  are  using  hybrid  models  both  human  advice  and  Robo  advice  in accordance  with  the  preference  of  the  customer.  Although  the  principal  benefit  of digitalization is cost we believe that the real driver for a bank is human capital \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrained and transformed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d adapted to the new realities and prepared to serve and to build in a creative and sustainable fashion long term traditional and digital relationships with the customers. b) ITC infrastructures  Banks  have  always  used  ITC  infrastructures  and  systems  to  gather  data  from  the customers  to  analyse  data  and  report  to  provide  services  to  customers  to  make payments to send encrypted messages to process financial transactions.  Digitalisation  electronification  of  financial  services  are  moving  very  fast  shaping  the banking industry. Another strong component linked with the banking activity is the risk component strong evolutions are especially on the cyber risks. Banks must develop risk management policies and tools including the IT risk management framework IT disaster recovery and business continuity planning IT change management. Among the key elements that contribute to a structural change in ITC infrastructures of the banks are speed security availability and cost. Most of the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s top 100 banks have been involved in pilot projects to implement new technologies in order to secure communication  provide  faster  payments  to  the  customers  use  data  mining  in  order  to increase the quality of banking analysis. The new ITC architecture involves deep changes for all the major activities within a bank allowing knowledge to be distributed to all levels of the organization. The quality of the cooperation and the quality of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctranslations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between the business/commercial where the interaction with the customer is reflected and the support/the back office where the data is processed represent a milestone for the new banking model. Answers to questions such as what is the level of personnel necessary for the IT functions of a bank? or what can be externalized? gives valuable input for a new banking model that is willing to use technology in order to add value to the work of the people and to the customers. Due to the low interest rates banks should switch from incomes mainly from interests to incomes  mainly  from  fees  and  this  drives  new  changes  for  the  business  model  add additional services that need to be supported by the ITC systems.  The ITC architecture should be redesigned in order to insure integrity of data to identify what  are  the  assets  that  really  matters  to  ring  fence  them  and  protect  them.  The  ITC infrastructure  needs  to  be  modular  to  make  sure  that  further  developments  new platforms will be supported in this changing environment.  \\t\\t\\x0c\\t150 Dan Costin Ni\\xc8\\x9bescu For example in retail banking a decade ago a key word was prevention; nowadays in retail  a strategic aspect are recovery plans (e.g. \\xe2\\x80\\x9e2h recovery plans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) resilience to cyber attacks; the entire banking organization should be built resilient.  A new and sustainable banking business model considering all this developments should separate  customer  data  from  all  the  production  systems  and  all  the  communication systems.  Regarding  the  contact/interaction  with  the  customers  partners  the  bank  must sell all the products and services via all the possible channels. c) Internal procedures and workflows   Due  to  the  external  trends  presented  above  such  as  digitalisation  deep  change  in regulatory  frame  change  in  customer  behaviour  credit  deleveraging  development  of alternative funding channels banks faced a huge amount of work after the financial crisis but also a huge amount of challenges. All the major banking models were affected by the crisis and changed by the post crisis new situations and trends retail banking corporate banking investment banking(6) private banking/wealth management. The  concern  for  reshaping  internal  activities  in  a  bank  involves  new  procedures  and workflows for credit analysis risk management sales of banking products and services payments systems of a bank consultancy and advice to the customers (offered by bankers or  by  Roboadvisors)  processing  of  financial  transactions  Know  Your  Customer procedures etc.  Top  aspects  that  need  a  special  attention  from  the  banking  side  being  part  of  the  new banking  model  are  transition  planning  better  access  to  better  data  quick  operational programs to disburse resources better tools to gather and filter information customer due diligence. Banks should also share information about threats and should test the collective approach of a continuity plan. The  procedures  and  workflows  within  a  new  and  sustainable  banking  business  model should define clear roles and responsibilities flexible interdepartmental teams to address border line issues and to avoid building silo cultures topdown responsibility and quick reaction/decision making processes. Within the business continuity plans banks should include  and  sign  protocols  with  strategic  partners  in  order  to  insure  support  in  crisis situations. Banks may outsource some business functions but may not outsource the risks.  d) Communication policy and protocols  Communication in banking represents a strategic management tool a critical one it is no longer  just  a  part  of  the  marketing  policy  mix.  A  new  banking  business  model  should handle and insure a successful transition from traditional communication functions to real time  communication  via  computers  other  electronic  systems  devices  techniques  that have changed everything in society both banking and human relationships.  Banks benefit of large quantities of information and data the concern is how to organise and use the data making sure to communicate all the relevant actions to the customers and to capture their imagination. Communication  policy  must  be  based  on  unity  of  command  and  coordination  of  all communication efforts. \\x0cNew pillars of the banking business model or a new model of doing banking? 151A new communication strategy determines a reengineering for the entire banking organisation. The communication protocols includes support and management of multiple systems product driven system distribution and channel system and the customer driven system. Banks communicate with all the relevant stakeholders (authorities regulators customers institutional partners and investors) and benefit via technology of a continuous dialogue with  the  counterparties.  Communication  within  the  new  banking  business  changes instead  of  talking  at  the  customers  the  banks  should  listen  to  the  customers  earn  the attention of the customers. The crisis showed that is far better for banks to initiate the \\xe2\\x80\\x9econversation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d than to pick it up on it halfway through. Social media social connected networks have given customers an  influential  tool  to  share  information  to  put  pressure  on  banks  in  order  to  provide quality services. The  new  banking  business  model  should  include  crisis  communication  scenarios  to consider and test various variables as catalysers for a crisis. Basically all the alternative planning  activities  of  a  bank  business  continuity  activities  must  include  also communication  alternative  scenarios  policies  and  protocols  to  enable  a  consistent  and coherent reaction of a bank when a crisis situation occurs.  Conclusions The academic discussion over the banking sector business model is old and complex but always generator for progress.  Relevant  trends  such  as  digitalisation  change  in  regulations  and  customer  behaviour credit deleveraging development of alternative funding channels impacted the banking sector and the existing banking models the need to integrate technology and to develop strategic  digital  relationships  with  the  customers  the  need  to  almost  double  the  banks equity  capital  since  the  crisis  the  need  to  adjust  standard  economical  models  with behavioural analysis and to consider the client as the main driver for change in banking the  restructure  of  bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  balance  sheets  by  lowering  the  leverage  levels  the  need  to redesign banking activity to cut costs and to compete or cooperate with Fintechs within the new realities of the financial world. Transparency  authenticity  speed  and  delivery  are  rules  for  a  new  banking  business model in order to reset bad memories and regain trust. Via innovative technology banks that  are  merging  large  relationship  networks  must  communicate  and  be  engaged  in valuable dialogue with the customers.  Innovation/change is part of the new normality. The digitalisation of financial services is no longer optional traditional patterns in customer behaviour workflows and processes have changed. Educational sales of banking products and services should be a permanent concern within the new banking business model.  A new and sustainable banking business model should mix Human Capital and technology in order to do \\xe2\\x80\\x9creal time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d monitoring learn adapt and support the dynamic needs of the customers at the highest standards. Risks including cyber but also other asymmetric risks must \\t\\t\\x0cNotes Dan Costin Ni\\xc8\\x9bescu be  clearly  assessed  monitored  and  managed  within  a  new  risk  and  resilience  paradigm including also detailed business continuity action plans and communication protocols. \\t152 \\t\\t(cid4666)2(cid4667)\\t According to the European Banking Authority the levels of non performing exposure remains (cid4666)3(cid4667)\\t As reflected by the study \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDeloitte Deleveraging Europe 20152016\\xe2\\x80\\x9d published by Deloitte.
