Keywords SME financing economic growth. to  be  an important  player   INTRODUCTION  Turkey  needs  to  utilize  its  production  resources  in  order to  achieve  the  structure  providing  sustainable  export increase  and in  global competition.  Due  to  the  nature  of  competition  sustainability in achievement is important as the achievement in a particular  term  is  important.  Ownership  of  small  and medium  sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  in  Turkey  is  of  family enterprises  generally.  These  familyowned  enterprises are  not  yet  institutionalized  and  could  not  enter  into international markets because of their lack  of  knowledge    *Corresponding  author.

They  could  not  allocate  adequate resources  for  R  and  D  so  could  not  follow  modern technology. In this context it is required to support SMEs for decreasing import dependence in export solving cost problems  harming in  production processes related to export and shifting to products with high value add for Turkey.  competitiveness This  study  carried  on  the  consideration  that  capital structures  dividend  policies  financial  characteristics  of SMEs  in  Turkey  have  impact  on  their  growth  and  is aimed  at  developing  strategies  applicable  for  financial solutions on problems of SMEs.   Conceptual expositions  SME concept though may differ among countries or even among institutions in a country is developed for  enabling  \\x0c    small  and  medium  sized  enterprises  utilize  services  on credit facilities educationtraining informationknowledge and  consultation  at  low  cost  or  free  of  charge.  Level  of development  of  countries  and  features  of  sectors  affect definitions  for  SME  directly.  Thus  its  various  definitions use  number  of  employees  revenues  capital  work  floor utilized  wages  paid  raw  materials  input  and  production method as criteria. However the most preferred criteria is number of employees because of it is easily measurable and  comparable.  Definitions  diverse  according to economic  characteristics  and  criteria  used  of  countries own.  European  Union  (EU)  adopted  a  definition  valid  after 1988  in order to prevent confusion  both in national  level and in the union and was revised according to changed conditions in 2003. This new definition became valid after 2005.  The  definition  is  based  on  criteria  like  number  of employees volume of balance sheet and independence. Independence  criteria  mean  that  25%  or  more  of  its capital  (or  equity)  is  not  undertaken  by  an  enterprise  or that  its  capital  is  not  owned  by  enterprises  that  are  not defined as SMEs. Independent enterprises are classified by  EU  (but  countries  may  differ  in  their  purpose)  as  per the following (\\xc3\\x96zg\\xc3\\xbcl 2005)  Micro  enterprises  Employ  less  than  10  personnel  and annual  revenue  and/or  balance  sheet  volume  2  million Euros.  1. Small enterprises Employ less than 50 personnel and annual  revenue  and/or  balance  sheet  volume  10  million Euros. 2.  Middle  sized  enterprises  Employ  less  than  250 personnel  and  annual  revenue  and/or  balance  sheet volume 43 million Euros.  In  the  US  although  there  are  various  definitions  for SMEs  mostly  they  are  based  on  number  of  employees and  annual  turnover  generally.  Authority  of  SMEs  in  the US  entitled  with  bringing  a  definition  Small  Business Administration  (SBA)  develops  some  criteria  based  on number of employees sector annual turnover of a SME in  order  to  determine  whether  that  SME  deserves particular  supports.  Based  on  these  developed  criteria SMEs  are  defined  as  independent  enterprises  and  as nondominating companies in their sectors and they are required to comply with the following characteristics listed below (Steinhoff and Burgess 1993; \\xc3\\x96zg\\xc3\\xbcl 2005)  1.  Construction  enterprises  should  have  maximum  17.5 million dollars turnover per annum. 2.  Retail  sellers  and  service  enterprises  should  have maximum 3 million dollars annual turnover (for some subsectors maximum 13.5 million dollars). 3.  Transportation  and  warehousing  enterprises  should have  maximum  3.5  million  dollars  annual  turnover  (for some  types  of  enterprises  it  may  rise  to  maximum  12.5 million dollars). Yurttadur and Kaya         1077    4.  Wholesaler  enterprises  should  employ  maximum  500 personnel. 5.  Production  enterprises  should  employ  maximum  500 personnel (for some subsectors it may rise to maximum 1500 personnel). 6.  Agriculture  enterprises  should  have  maximum  100 thousand  dollars  annual  turnover  (for  some  subsectors maximum 3.5 million dollars).  Definition  for  SME  in  Turkey  is  adapted  to  that  of  EU  in order  to  prevent  raising  complications  in  issues  like cooperation  with  EU  and  its  supports.  Codes  for  SME definition  classification  characteristics  approved  by  the decision of the Council of Ministers numbered 2005/9617 is published in Resmi Gazete (Official Gazette) dated 18 November 2005. In these codes is enterprise defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregardless  of  its  legal  status  economic  activity  units owned  by  one  or  more  person  or  entity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and  is  shortly called  SME 4). Aforementioned  codes  classify  SMEs  as  follows  (Resmi Gazete 2005 item 5) (Resmi  Gazete 2005 item  1.  Micro  enterprise  Employing  less  than  10  personnel and  size  of  net  turnover  or  fiscal  balance  sheet  volume maximum 1 million TL. 2.  Small  enterprise  Employing  less  than  50  personnel and   size  of net turnover or fiscal balance  sheet volume maximum 5 million TL. 3.  Medium  size  enterprise  Employing  less  than  250 personnel  and    size  of  net  turnover  or  fiscal  balance sheet volume maximum 25 million TL.  Major  reasons  behind  SMEs  do  not  have  unique  and common  definitions  and  differences  among  industries and  among  level  of  development  of  countries.  For example; a textile production shop with 10 personnel may be taken as a small one while an exchange office with 10 personnel  may  be  taken  as  a  big  one.  In  another example  a  golden  goods  manufacturer  with  5  million annual turnovers cannot be considered as big as a textile producer with the same turnover (Y\\xc3\\xb6r\\xc3\\xbck and Ban 2003). All  enterprises that  value  adding  and  providing employment  for  national  economy  should  be  considered in  SME  definition  regardless  of  their  size  (Akgemici 2001).  their  practices  by SMEs  are  settlements  with  well  known  characteristics of  the  sector they  serve  well  recognizing  the  customers they serve developing good relations with their suppliers and  well  arranging following developments  in  their  sector.  Besides  all  among  the paramount  characteristics  of  SMEs  their  close  relations with their customers stand out.   Growth in capital structure  Enterprises  may  provide  capital  by  rising  their  equity  or through borrowing. Borrowing; may be built  up  either  by  \\x0c1078         Afr. J. Bus. Manage.    enterprise through equity retained earnings reserves  or capital  rising  may  be  achieved  by  bringing  new  partners out  of  the  enterprise  (Yener  1993).  Enterprises  may manage  their  capital  structures  and  they  may  take various  actions  to  strengthen  their  structures.  Since  the objective  of  finance  managers  is  to  maximize  value  of enterprise and should form capital structures with best fit needs  of  enterprises.  The  capital  structure  is  at  its optimum  where  resource  cost  is  minimum  and  value  of enterprise is maximum. All enterprises aim  to operate at optimal capital structure. Various approaches have  been developed  for  testing  whether  optimum  capital  structure exists  or  not.  These  approaches  analyze  the  impact  of changes in level of borrowing on value of enterprise and cost  of  capital.  Enterprises  should  well  know  that  there are many factors affecting their capital structures. Among many  the  factors  affecting  that  decision  in  wider  terms can  be  counted  as  economic  conditions  structure  of sector  characteristics  of  enterprise  behaviour  of  credit institution  legal  provisions  and  decisions  of  monetary authorities (B\\xc3\\xbcy\\xc3\\xbcktortop 2007).  Every  enterprise  should  search  for  its  optimal  capital structure  and  finance  its  investment  projects  caring  for that structure. However it is difficult for finance manager to determine optimal capital structure in practice. Various methods  are  used  to  do  that.  Yet  any  of  them  are satisfactory alone (Ceylan 1995). Amounts of equity and loan capital to be  used in forming  up capital structure of enterprises  differ  according to  country  and  sector. Interest  in  capital  structure  begins  with  the  article  of Modigliani  and  Miller  in  1958.  Modigliani  and  Miller argued  that  total  value  of  an  enterprise  and  its  cost  of capital  are  independent  of  capital  structure  of  that enterprise. Works of Modigliani and Miller  are  discussed more  than  other  similar  works  in  the  field  of  finance. Assumptions put forward by Modigliani and Miller (1958) brought  possibilities  to  ease  the  cost  of  financial  risk. Besides  they  suggest  that  capital  structure  does  not affect the cost of capital; therefore they claim that finance policies  applied  by  enterprises  do  not  affect  value  of enterprise. Rajan  and  Zingales  (1995)  used four  distinctive variables  in  their  study  in  order  to  determine  factors affecting  financial  decisions  of  public  enterprises  in industrialized countries called G7; these are USA Japan Canada the United Kingdom France Italy and Germany and  to  analyze  capital  structures  enterprises  in  USA. These  variables  are  measures  of  tangiblefixed  assets markettoaccount  ratio  logarithm  of  sales  and  profitability (Booth et al. 2001). Lensink et al. (1998) studied on factors  affecting  capital  structures  of  enterprises  in Holland.  Danbolt  and  Bevan  (2001)  analyzed  factors affecting  capital  structures  of  1054  each  of  British enterprises  (Acaravc\\xc4\\xb1  and  Do\\xc4\\x9fukanl\\xc4\\xb1  2004).  Other  than mentioned  researchers  Ferri  and  Jones  (1979)  Bradley et al. (1984) Tagart (1984) Pozdena (1987) Titman and Weselss (1988)  Mohamad  (1995)  Saa  (1996)  carried     empirical studies on factors affecting capital structures of enterprises (Y\\xc3\\xbccel 2001).   Growth in SMEs  Growth from the perspective of SMEs is qualitative and quantitative  changes  and  developments  happen  starting from  a  reference  level  these  take  place  in  material  and human  factors  of  their  structure.  Global  competition economic  integrations  and  information  technologies  in rapid  developments  all  urge  establishments  aiming  to grow  to  be  in  continuous  dynamism.  Growth  is  a  typical process  for  successful  establishments  in  developing economy.  Most  of  the  establishments  start  up  as  small establishments and they grow up through various stages. Growth  should  be  kept  on  up  to  the  level  of  production where  costs  are  minimized  (\\xc3\\x96zgener  2003).  Main  purpose  of  establishments  for  growth  can  be  seen  as  profit and  maximization  of  profit.  However  it  is  recently  seen that profit is not the first aim in growth after an enterprise has  reached  to  a  certain  growth  rate.  Recent  factor  in growth is the rise in productivity that plays important role in  sustainability  of  enterprise.  Profitability  becomes important only for productive enterprise (Tosun 1990). recognition.  Enterprise Enterprises  with  succeeded  growth  properly  have enhanced  market image (reputation) and power are closely related with its growth. Therefore SMEs give big importance to growth to acquire the  advantages  of  big  enterprises  in  size.  Besides enterprises  create  brand  value  by  branding  and  attract customers provide cash flow and competitive advantage by  creating  brand  value  (Kavas  2004).  Big  enterprises have  greater  possibilities  for  product  diversification  and market  segmentation.  Weaknesses  of  SMEs  and advantages  of  bigness  together  are  main  reasons  for SMEs aim to grow. Besides desire of entrepreneurs and managers  of  SMEs  in  being  an  owner  and  manager  of big and reputable enterprise  is another motive for SMEs to  grow  (Erko\\xc3\\xa7  2006).  Even  the  start  up  scale  is  small rapid  adaption  to  market  conditions  and  healthy  growth strategies  should  be  employed.  Aim  in  decision  for growth  should  be  sound  one  and  it  is  the  indicator  for length of life of a SME. Growth of SMEs is important not only  from  the  points  of  their  existence  profit  making motivating  their  owners  or  managers  and  providing prestige  for  them;  but  also  for  their  contribution  to economic  system  and  national  social  wealth.  Because growth  of  SMEs  contributes  to  increase  in  GNP  so  that GNP  grows.  Consequently  growth  of  SMEs  adds  value to  national  economy  and  wealth  by  contributing  to increase  in  production  factors  and  GNP  per  capita. Besides  since  it  brings  increase  in  employment  it  helps to  disappear  some  problems result  of unemployment (D\\xc3\\xbc\\xc4\\x9fer 1994). that  are In order to acquire a healthy growth and to have competitive advantages in global  competition  SMEs  should \\x0c    apply  growth  oriented  restructuring  strategies  that  are suitable  for  them  (\\xc3\\x96zgener  2000).  SMEs  with  well aligned  incomeandexpense  balance  have  higher  level of profit maximization and providing loans through equity may grow regardless of differences due to sectors. In the application section of the study general features capital structures  dividend  policies  financial  characteristics  of SMEs  and  their  impact  on  SMEs  growth  in  Turkey  are analyzed.   METHODOLOGY  This  study  is  aimed  at  compiling  data  on  general  features  capital structures  dividend  policies  financial  characteristics  of  SMEs  in Turkey  and  views  of  managers  of  them  on  the  impact  of  these features  on  their  growth  and  to  transform  these  data  into knowledge  besides  provision  of  recommendations.  Sample  of study  is  formed  by  34  SMEs  in  various  sectors  in  Istanbul.  Since SMEs  in  Istanbul  are  plenty  and  scattered  in  various  regions  it  is quite  difficult  and  costly  to  send  the  questionnaire  to  all  SMEs  in Istanbul.  A  sample  that  can  represent  the  majority  of  SMEs  in Istanbul  is  targeted  to  be  accessed  but  could  not  be  hit  because some  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  authorities  decline  to  contribute  reasoning  that  the questionnaire contains questions for confidential replies. Considering  this  it  would  not  be  appropriate  to  say  all  of  the replies  is  for  SMEs  in  general  and  is  complete  reference  or  information  source  for  them.  Totally  34  SMEs  replied  and  evaluations are  based  on  data  from  them.  Descriptive  and  relational  research methods  are  employed  in  the  study.  In  order  to  collect  unbiased and appropriate data for statistical analyses in descriptive research method  questionnaire  technique  is  used  as  the  data  collection method. Expert views are applied and a pilot study is employed to test  reliability  of  the  questionnaire  before  its  final  form  is  decided. Data  is  collected  in  face  to  face  interviews  carried  in  first  half  of 2009. In questionnaire features of the participants are asked in 40 questions like their education level position in the enterprise age sector  capital  structure  revenue  dividend  policy  and  autofinancing  technique  of  enterprise.  Closed  end  statements  are preferred  in  constructing  the  questions  in  order  to  collect  clearer data. Data  is  analysed with computer  software; statistical package for  social  Sciences  (SPSS).  Central  tendency  and  dispersion techniques  are  used  for  data  analyses.  Cross  tabulation  test  is employed  to  determine  differences  among  selected  variables.  All tables given in this study are of data collected by the writers.   ANALYSES OF DATA   Descriptive analyses and analyses for differences among variables are held in this section.  Descriptive analyses  Data  for  the  study  carried  are  collected  from  34  SMEs. General characteristics of SMEs and their managers are given  in  Table  1.  According  to  Table  1  first  rank  in position of repliers belongs to top level managers (f=16) followed by enterprise owners (f=14). The questionnaires are  replied  by  top  level  managers  or  owners  enhancing reliability  of  data  in  great  extent.  Therefore  the  level  of perception  becomes  higher  and level  of  error becomes lower. Level of  education  of  the  managers  of  the Yurttadur and Kaya         1079    SMEs  participating  to  the  research  is  generally  bachelor degree (f=16). In regard of level of education vocational schools and master degrees follow bachelor degree. This finding  provides  a  base  for  the  consideration  of  having the  level  of  education  of  the  participants  higher  may make  their  replies  more  reliable.  Taking  the  data  on sectors that are in the fields of activities of the SMEs it is observed  that  they  are  mostly  active  in  manufacturing/ production sector (f=19) where trade and service sectors follow  it.  It  is  also  observed  that  SMEs  in  Turkey  are  in manufacturing/production  generally.  Limited  companies are  at  the  first  rank  in  legal  status  of  SMEs  (f=17). Service  age  of  SMEs  with  \\xe2\\x80\\x9c21  years  or  more\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  are  in majority  (f=19).  This  fact  may  lead  to  a  conclusion  that SMEs  are  experienced  entities  and  may  help  them  to solve problems face. Table  2  shows  that  among  all  sources  of  finance problems  of  SMEs  it  comes  up  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDelayed  collections  of receivables\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  in  first  rank  (f=19).  Delayed  collections  of receivables  harm  finance  structure  of  SMEs  drastically and  lead  to  consequences  that  compensation  are  quite difficult. As share of sale for the account (forward sale) in total sales is high for SMEs they need finance support in order  to  minimize  its  influence  therefore  cause  increase in  indebtedness  of  SMEs.  Difficulties  in  collections  from market  is  the  major  short  term  finance  problems  for SMEs  (f=21).  High  credit  cost  and  problems  at  foreign markets instability  and  distrust together  are  the  major  long  term  finance  problem  for SMEs (f=24). Technological adaptation is at the first rank among  the  aims  of  utilization  of  finance  possibilities (f=11)  where  renewal  building  a  new  plant  decrease  in the need of foreign resource and tax advantage follow it respectively. it.  Economic follow According  to  Table  1  among  the  Factors  in  the selecting  financial  instruments  is  for  SMEs  Reasonable cost factor appears  as most important  one (f=15). Then term (maturity date) for instrument factor follows it (f=13). In  case  of  need  the  Financial  Instruments  Mostly  Used by SMEs appears as equity and bank loan respectively. In analyzing the Share of Equity in financing Investment it is  observed three alternatives;  40    60%  60   80%  and  80    100%  shares mostly (f=9 for each).  that  SMEs  are  divided  among Annual  limit  for  credits  used  is  mostly  up  to  1  million Turkish Lira (f=19). It could be comprehended that SMEs prefer  equity  rather  than  loans  as  financial  instrument  in paying  up  their  debts.  Thus  they  can  comparably  and relatively  resume  in  times  of  economic  crises  recession and shrinkage with least lost. Average term (maturity time) for  credits is rather short and  generally  shorter  than  one  year  (f=21).  This  finding supports  those  of  annual  limit  for  credits.  SMEs  prefer shorter term (shorter maturity time) credits in small amount. SMEs  prefer  to  finance  their  investments  with  their equities  in  order  to  protect  themselves  from  sudden crises  in  somehow.  Experienced  economic  crises  in Turkey lead   enterprises   to   employ   such   strategies. \\x0c1080         Afr. J. Bus. Manage.    Table 1.

SMEs struggling for existence could hardly afford these higher interest rates and receive sentence to perish in fact.  Difficulties  caused  by  long  procedures  is  the  most important  problem  (f=13)  SMEs  faced  in  using  bank credits.  Problem  of  having  high  noninterest  costs  is  the second important problem (f=11) in this regard. In taking credits  forcing  SMEs  to  be  subjected  to  overcome numerous procedures puts them into their trump. This is the  most  serious  problem  an  enterprise  face  and  it  puts enterprises hard up for material and moral trouble. It is found that SMEs heavily postpone their investment projects  because  of  high  credit  costs  (f=16)  and  push them to increase their equities (f=9). In other words it is observed  that  enterprises  postpone  their  investment projects without undertaking big risk and avoiding run into dept. It  is  seen  that  SMEs  refrain  from  using  credit  firstly because  of  their  equities  are  adequate  (f=15)  secondly because  of  difficulty issuing guarantee  (f=10)  and  thirdly  because  of  high  borrowing cost (f=4). Strong  equities   may   lead   to   decrease   in  in  being  obliged for indebtedness and thus to refrain from credit using.  According  to  Table  5  equity  structures  of  SMEs  are strengthened.  Enterprises  with  equity  structures  are strengthened  can  maintain  their  activities  stronger  in terms of finance. It is found out that financial structures of SMEs  are  strengthened  in  great  extend  as  result  of investments  they  financed  by  foreign  resources.  Enterprises  those  financial  structures  are  strengthened  can carry  on  their  activities  more  effectively  in  terms  of finance. finance  source As shown in Table 6 bank loans are at first rank as a working  capital In  solution alternatives for finance problems of SMEs long term and reasonable  credit  provision  comes  first  (f=20)  then  built up  new  incentives  for  development  of  SMEs  comes second.

Analyses for differences among variables  Findings  on  average  credit  limits  used  annually  versus share  of  equity  used  in  their  finance  is  given  at  below Table 7. All of the SME managers in whose enterprises have 0 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 20%  equity  in  their  financial  structures  expressed  that they  use  credit  less  than  1  million  TL  credit  in  a  year. Likewise half of the SMEs in whose enterprises have 20 \\xe2\\x80\\x93  40%  equity  in  their  financial  structures  expressed  that they use credit between 1.000.001 TL and 2.500.000 TL in  a  year.  SMEs  in  whose  enterprises  have  40  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  60% equity in their financial structures do not concentrate on certain  amount  of  credit  usage  annually  and  expressed that they  use  credit  less  than  1  million  TL  in  a  year  and then use between credit 1.000.001 TL and 2.500.000 TL in a year. It is seen that great majority of SMEs those use 80  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  100%  equity  in  their  financial  structures  use  less than  1  million  TL  credit  in  a  year.  According  to  these findings SMEs those equity shares are in increase adopt using  minimum  amounts  of  credit  and  as  less  as possible.

In  Table  8  it  is  observed  that  most  of  the  SMEs  in whose  equity  shares  are  0    20%  prefer  to  use  credits with maturity term in less than one year where rest of the SMEs  in  this  share  equity  group  prefer  to  use  credits with  maturity  term  between  12  to  24  months.  Likewise most  of  the  SMEs  whose  equity  shares  in  their  finance are 20  40%  prefer to use credits  with  maturity term in less than one year where rest of the SMEs in this share equity  group  prefer  to  use  credits  with  maturity  term between  24  to  36  months.  It  is  also  observed  that  the SMEs  in  whose  equity  shares  are  60    80%  do  not concentrate on certain credit maturity terms (months) but are  mostly  gathered  in  two  groups  one  with  credit maturity  term  between  0  to  12  months  and  others  with credit  maturity  term  between  24  to  36  months.  Most  of the SMEs in whose equity shares are 60  80% prefer to use credits  with  maturity  term  in  less  than  one  year.  Lastly  it  is seen that most of the  SMEs in  whose equity shares are 80  100% prefer to use credits with maturity term  in  less  than  one  year.  According  to  findings  it  is observed that there is an inverse relation between equity shares  and  credit  maturity  terms  in  SMEs  finance structure; as  equity shares in  finance  structure increase credit  maturity  terms  decrease.  Only  exception  is  at  the case  of  40    60%  equity  shares  in  where  frequency  of SMEs  for  credit  maturity  terms  increases  from  12  to  24 months case to 24 to 36 months case.

All  these  findings  show that  SMEs  prefer  to  follow  having  lesser  debt  with stronger capital structure. It  is  found  that  SMEs  whose  equity  shares  in  finance structure  are  0    20  20    40  40    60  and  60    80%  put increasing  investment  efficiency  issue  in  first  priority  in investment decisions generally. On the other hand SMEs whose equity share in finance structure is 80  100% has priorities  in  investment  decisions  like  increasing  investment efficiency decreasing cost of capital and increasing debttoequity  (leverage)  ratio.  These  findings  show  that the  Increasing  investment  efficiency  has  a  priority  in investment  decisions  and  SMEs  have  strong  tendency for investment as shown in Table 10. Findings with regard to capital amount versus share of equity  used  in  finance  of  SMEs  are  shown  in  Table  11. According to the findings given in Table 11 SMEs whose equity  shares  in  finance  structure  are  0    20%  have  0  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2.500.000  TL  capital  where  rest  of  them  have  0  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2.500.000  TL  capital.  Half  of  the  SMEs  whose  equity shares  in  finance  structure  are  20    40%  have  0  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2.500.000  TL  capital  where  rest  of  them  are  equally divided into two groups one is of 2.500.000 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5.000.000 TL  capital  and  the  other  is  of  20.000.001  TL  and  more capital.

As  a  result  capitals  of  SMEs  increase  in  parallel  to increase  in  equity  shares  in  finance  structure.  In  the Table 12 given below findings on distribution of capacity utilization  rates  of  SMEs  versus  their  revenues  take place.  In  Table  12  it  is  seen  that  SMEs  with  their revenues  are  less  than  5  million  TL  use  capacities between 21  40% and 61  80% rates. It is also observed that great majority of SMEs with revenues of 5.000.001 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 10.000.000  TL  use  41    60%  of  their  capacities  and almost  all  of  the  SMEs  with  revenues  of  10.000.001  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 20.000.000 TL use 61  80% of their capacities. Likewise great  majority  of  SMEs  with  revenues  of  20.000.001  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 40.000.000 TL use 61  80% of their capacities and lastly almost  all  of  the  SMEs  with  revenues  of  40.000.001  TL and  more  use  capacities  between  61    80%  and  81   100%  rates.  As  a  result  there  are  positive  relationship revenues and capacity utilization rates of SMEs. In other words  their  capacity  utilization  rates  increase  as  their revenues increase. SMEs with their amount of fixed assets are less than 5 million TL use capacities mostly in 41  60 and 21 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 40% rates respectively.

Most of the SMEs with their amount of fixed assets are 20.000.001 TL and more  use their capacities  mostly  in  61  80% and  in  81 100% rates respectively.  As it could be understood from these findings apositive relation  between  amount  of  fixed  assets  and  capacity utilization  rates  of  SMEs  was  observed.  In  other  words capacity  utilization  rates  of  SMEs  increase  as  the amounts of their fixed assets increase. In  Table  14  it  is  seen  that  SMEs  with  their  amount  of capitals  are  less  than  2.5  million  TL  use  their  capacities mostly  in  41    60%  rate  and  then  some  of  other  SMEs use  their  capacities  21    40%  and  61    80%  commonly. Majority  of  SMEs  with  their  amount  of  capitals  are 2.500.001  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  5.000.000  TL  uses  their  capacities  in  61   80% rate. Half of the SMEs with their amount of capitals are 5.000.001 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 10.000.000 TL uses their capacities in 61  80% rate and other half of them use  their  capacities  in  81  100% rates. Likewise it is observed that majority of SMEs  with  their  amount  of  capitals  are  10.000.001  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 20.000.000 TL use their capacities in 61  80% rate and with their amount  of capitals are  20.000.000 TL  or more use their capacities in 81  100% rates. According to these findings a positive relation between amount of capitals and capacity utilization rates of SMEs was  observed.  Another  consultable  result  could  be  that stronger  SMEs  in  capitalwise  have  higher  capacity utilization  rates  since  they  can  offer  favourable  payment conditions to their customers.

Thus  it  is  found  that credit  usage  decrease  as  equity  shares  increase.  They prefer  using  their  equities  and  refrain  from  borrowing. There  is  inverse  relation  between  equity  shares  in  their finance  structure  and  maturity  terms  of  their  debts  (40   60%  equity  shares  are  exception).  As  their  share  of equity  in  their  finance  structure  increase  their  amount  of borrowings  decrease  and  maturity these borrowings shortens. SMEs retain their profits within their finance  structure  and  prefer  to  strengthen  their  capital structures. These findings point out that SMEs follow the policy  of  lessened  indebtedness  with  stronger  capital structure.  It  is  also  seen  that  the  criteria  in  increasing investment  efficiency  has  the  highest  priority  in  their investment  decisions.  As  their  equity  shares  get  larger capitals  of  SMEs  drop.  Equity  shares  and  amounts  of capital affect each other inversely. It is not possible to say much  about relation  between  annual revenues  of  SMEs  and  their  amounts  of  capital.  There could be a positive relation between annual revenues of SMEs and their capacity utilization rates. In other words their  capacity  utilization  rates  increase  as  their  annual revenues increase.  A  positive  relationship  between amounts  of  fixed  assets  of  SMEs  and  their  capacity utilization  rates  could  be  mentioned.  Their  capacity utilization  rates their  annual  revenues increase  although  nonlinearly.  There  is  also  a  positive relationship  between  amounts  of  capitals  of  SMEs  and their capacity utilization rates in general sense. Besides increase  as the  existed findings  reached  indicating  that  the  enterprises  with stronger capital do not prefer much borrowing and could run  at  higher  capacity  utilization  since  they  can  offer favourable payment conditions. Consequently influence  of  capital  structures  and dividend  policies  of  SMEs  on  their  growth  is  held  and recommendations for problems faced and methods to be applied  for  their  solutions  are  put  forward  in  this  study. These recommendations are as follows  for time their  decision 1. SMEs should keep their equity at most high level. 2.  SMEs  should  have  well  analyze  market  conditions during  borrowing  and for borrowing  maturity  terms  and  the  borrower  (creditor) should be based on a sound research. 3.  Credits  can  be  taken  by  SMEs  only  when  needed  in minimum amounts and shorter maturity terms. 4.  SMEs  should  retain  their  profits  and  be  kept  in  the finance structure of the enterprise so that they strengthen their capital structures. 5.  SMEs  should  decide  on  the  basic  principle  on  small amount  of  borrowing  policy  to  strengthen  their  finance structure.  6. SMEs should always trace new technologies never fall back of their competitors in technology sense and should follow  appropriate  investment  course  in  accordance  to market conditions. 7. SMEs should keep in mind the truth that the priority in investment  decisions  should  belong increasing investment efficiency. 8. SMEs should raise their capacity utilization rates up to their maximum level. 9.   SMEs   should   always   consider   that   there   is    a  to \\x0c1088         Afr. J. Bus. Manage.    relationship  between  their  revenue  levels  and  their capacity utilization rates. 10.  SMEs  should  maintain  higher  amounts  for  their revenues  and  their  fixed  assets  since  there  is  a  positive relationship  between  these  two.  In  order  to  maintain higher capacity utilization rates importance of marketing should be emphasized. 11.  SMEs  should  place  importance  on  their  R  and  D activities. 12. Main source of financial problems of SMEs is delays in  collection  of  receivables.  Therefore  it  is  important  for SMEs to organize a successful collection department. 14.
