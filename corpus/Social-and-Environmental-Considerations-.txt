As such    more than 150 already launched startups in Romania were analysed according to   their  economic   social  and  environmental  scopes   on  a  scale  quantifying  their   involvement  degree.  The  results  emphasize  that   although  economicallydriven  in   most  of  the  cases   the  technology  and  Internetrelated  startups  in  Romania  are   increasingly considering the social and environmental concerns. This finding refers to   the  strategic  inclusion  of  the  sustainability  requirements  in  their  object  of  activity   and  inner  core  of  their  business   and  not  to  mere  corporate  social  responsibility   (CSR) pursuits.

Introduction   The quest for sustainability  competitiveness and technology inclusion   represents  the  main  prerequisite  of  economic  growth  of  the  new   business  models   the   entrepreneurial  initiatives  and  the  recently  launched  startups   these   three  preconditions  become  challenges  that  should  be  strategically   addressed in order to achieve the viable lasting on the market.   Assuming  the  above  mentioned  issues   the  present  paper  focuses  on   the  Romanian  technology  and  Internetrelated  startups  and  the  way   they  integrate  social  and  environmental  requirements  in  their  dayto  day business activities. The need for the present research is based on   some theoretical and empirical previously identified gaps       the  postcrisis  period.  Regarding     in     1.  The  general  inclusion  of  sustainability  concerns  was  less   investigated  for  the  smaller  firms   while  the  attention  on  the   topic  is  still  mainly  captured  by  larger  companies   with  inter  national operations.      2.  The  above  trend  is  even  more  pronounced  for  the  Romanian   market   where  the  national  startups  need  a  scientific  indepth   examination of including social and environmental components   in their business models.      3.  The  need  to  develop  this  type  of  study  for  the  Romanian   market is also supported by the keyrole that IT&C sector plays     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               75     The Romanian Economic Journal        as a factor of national competitive advantage. The long tradition   of  local  human  resources  in  contributing  to  the  advance  of   information and technology even at global level represents the   main  reason  for  the  Romanian  entrepreneurs  in  launching   IT&C startups and online businesses.     Acknowledging the importance and motivation of the present analysis   resides in the fundamentals of achieving the research purposes.   The  structure  of  the  paper  is  the  following   Section  2  presents  a  brief   literature review regarding corporate social responsibility and startups    at general and particular level (EU and Romania); Section 3 is dedicated   to  detailed  data  and  research  methodology   with  a  focus  on  the   typology  of  selected  startups  in  Romania;  Section  4  lists  the  achieved   findings  and  gives  arguments  for  the  prevalence  of  the  economic   rationales;  Section  5  summarizes  the  results  and  proposes  further   research directions.      2. Literature review   For a systematic presentation of the theoretical and practical setting of   the  relationship  between  hightech  startups  and  their  CSR  concerns   (from  the  EU  to  the  Romanian  case)   the  revision  of  some  recent   academic and business initiatives is structured into three categories of   information   theoretical  investigation  of  developing  CSR  at  startup   level;  analysis  of  including  sustainability  considerations  in  the  high  tech  startups  in  EU;  and  practical  evidence  from  Romanian  IT&C   startups  in  considering  social  and  environmental  components  in   relation to their main economic purposes.     2.1. Research background on CSR and startups   When  dealing  in  the  literature  with  the  social  and  environmental   concerns  that  should  be  addressed  by  companies  regardless  of  their   size  and  nationality   the  research  focus  is  on  corporate  social   responsibility  (CSR)   but  this  approach  may  be  too  complex  for  the   Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               76     The Romanian Economic Journal        newly born businesses. In supporting this idea  some specific evidence   is provided in the following lines.   Considering the stakeholder approach in corporate governance model    Retolaza   Ruiz  and  SanJose  (2009)  developed  a  sixstep  theoretical   methodology for the purpose of integrating CSR objectives within the   business model of the startup firms. In their paper  the particularities   of  startups  are  embedded  through  the  lenses  of  a  comprehensive   stakeholderbased model.   Thornton  and  Byrd  (2013   p.  43)   analysing  a  broad  range  of  small   businesses  in  USA  and  referring  to  several  international  research   papers   emphasize  the  following  traits  of  embedding  CSR  in  the   business model of small firms when compared to larger ones  (1) the   employees as the main considered stakeholders and beneficiaries  (2) a   significant less formal approach  and (3) a more challenging enactment   due  to  scarcer  human  and  economic  resources.  Highlighting  specific   the  challenge  of  having  fewer  resources  than  larger  firms   Feerick   (2015  p. 5) supports the setting of startups as an “impact investing”   strategy  or  a  new  form  of  business  model   where  social  pursuits  are   conjoined with the financial aims of the funding companies.   Ishida (2015)  considering the Silicon Valley businesses  focuses on the   corporate  social  responsibility  employment  within  startups  from  the   perspective  of  the  human  rights  policy.  The  author  synthesizes  the   main  drivers  beyond  economic  premises  and  proposes  general   implementation actions  concluding that human rights policies (within   the  CSR  context)  should  be  perceived  as  a  long  term  value  creation   business solution.   Going  further  on  the  startups  –  CSR  –  technology  and  innovation   line of investigation  CSR assessment and innovative business support   for  small  companies  have  to  be  also  mentioned.  For  example    Halberstadt   sustainable   accomplishment assessing and reporting framework for startups and     Johnson     advance     (2014)     and     a     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               77     The Romanian Economic Journal        small  enterprises  based  on  the  IT  applications  and  web  provided   facilities   when  the  main  functions  of  companies  are  taken  into   account (e.g. production  marketing  sales  human resources).   Barclays  (2015)  settled  a  physical  and  worldwide  virtual  community   (“Rise New York”) for consolidating the financial technology in newly   born business initiatives  and it also hosts an Accelerator for the fintech   (finance  and  technology)  startups.  Designed  with  Techstars  –  a   “global ecosystem” for helping entrepreneurs to foster their business –   as a thirteen week lasting program  the Rise New York initiative aims   at providing revolutionary novelties for the fintech area. Investigating   the role of social innovation in companies  Mirvis et al. (2016  p. 5017)   mention  the  Barclays  accelerator  as  a  “social  entrepreneur  support”;   from  the  startup  view   their  involvement  in  the  above  mentioned   project  could  be  considered  a  social  responsibility  engagement  as  a   human resources development activity.   At  the  crossroads  of  theory  and  practice  Reif  (2016)  presents a  new   MIT project (“The Engine”) designed to foster the role of startups as   creators and full developers of innovation  in order to solve some of   the major economic  social  and environmental problems. The driving   and  stimulation  effects  of  “The  Engine”  are  sought  to  be  its  key  features in consolidating the entrepreneurial ecosystem.     2.2. Technology startups and sustainability concerns in the   European Union   According to Leaper (2016)  in a critical analysis of the EU market and   its  corresponding  conditions  for  startups   some  of  the  challenges   faced by these ‘young’ business initiatives in the European setting may   be   structural  deficiencies  of  the  regional  background  (e.g.  thorough   market segmentation  disparities in economic development  legislation    bureaucracy);  ongoing  difficulties  in  accessing  financing  and  venture   capital;  need  for  strengthening  commercial   financial   and  marketing   competitive  advantages  for  gaining  a  stable  position  on  the  market;     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               78     The Romanian Economic Journal        concerns  regarding  internationalization;  role  of  the  tech  industry  in   developing  the  potential  of  human  resources  and  EU  regions;   increasing role of the digital economy in Europe and the current part   of startups in comparison with traditional SMEs (including the debate   regarding the priority that online business represents nowadays); quest   for  sustainability  and  developing  sustainable  business  models  etc.   Leaper  (2016)  analyses  the  above  challenges  related  to  the  EU  start  ups’ ecosystem by taking into account the European Startup Monitor   (ESM) (Kollmann et al.  2015) and suggests specific solutions.   In  the  comprehensive  European  Startup  Monitor   Kollmann  et  al.   (2015)  aim  at  presenting  and  investigating  the  general  setting  for   founding and developing startups in the member countries of the EU    by  constantly  emphasizing  the  role  that  technology  and  innovation   play  for  this  type  of  new  business  initiatives.  At  this  point   when   analysing more than 2 300 startups in EU countries  the ESM found   that the majority of them pertain to the digital/hightech economy and   are drivers of innovation. Some figures presented by Kollmann et al.   (2015   p.  33)  in  the  first  European  Startup  Monitor  are  relevant  for   highlighting  even  more  the  significance  that  the  digital  economy  has   for  the  startups  in  Europe.  For  example   16.4%  of  the  investigated   startups were included in the category ‘software as a service’  followed   by  the  next  categories   ‘IT/software  development’  (9.1%)  ‘consumer   mobile/web  application’  (7.6%)   ‘ecommerce’  (7.5%)   with  the  vast   preponderance of business sectors related to digital economy (a mere   of  22.6%  of  the  examined  startups  could  be  included  in  ‘other   category’  less  related  to  hightech  industries).  Even  more  specific    21.2%  of  the  investigated  startups  in  Romania  were  found  to  be   included  in  the  ‘software  as  a  service’  classification.  The  results   revealed by the European Startup Monitor 2015 support the rationale   of analysing the startups in the IT&C industry.   When dealing with the broad expectations of startups for the coming   years   the  above  mentioned  report  grouped  them  onto  four  main     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               79     The Romanian Economic Journal        categories  of  desired  support   social  and  consultative;  political  and   legislative; financial; and societal. The Romanian startups examined in   the European Startup Monitor highly appreciated the financial  social   and  advisory  backing  as  very  important  for  their  future  development   at  national  and  regional  level   while  societal  support  was  seen  as  less   stringent in the initial stages of growth (Kollmann et al.  2015  p. 63).   Considering  the  specific  needs  identified  by  the  European  startups    the  sustainability  concerns   (drivers  and  effects  of  corporate   operations)  are  related  with  the  entire  evolution  of  their  business   models  as the following correspondence suggests        The  economic  component  –  reflected  in  financial   legislative   and     societal needs;       The social component – supported by social  advisory  political  and     societal needs;       The  environmental  component  –  revealed  through  legislative  and     societal needs.     2.3. Evidence on IT&C startups and sustainability concerns in   Romania   Considering  the  relationship  between  CSR and  startups in  Romania    the  last  years  were  marked  by  an  increase  in  the  research  interest   concerning  the  inclusion  of  the  sustainability  criteria  in  the  business   operations of these firms. For example  in a recent chapter  Iamandi    Constantin  and  Munteanu  (2015)  compare  the  corporate  social   responsibility  features  at  managerial  level  –  operational   functional    and strategic – for several Romanian  Bulgarian and Croatian startup   companies. Their study reveals either a proactive or a reciprocal CSR   strategy   highlighted  mainly  through  the  planning  function  for  the   Romanian startups.   Hapenciuc  et  al.  (2015)  investigate  the  relation  between  several   marketing  categories  and  sustainable  entrepreneurship  in  startups   while  conducting  a  survey  among  104  Romanian  entrepreneurs.  The     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               80     The Romanian Economic Journal        main results reveal that several marketing practices are correlated with   the human resources (people) sustainability dimension.   While studying the sample companies for this specific research  several   characteristics  of  the  IT  startups  were  identified  relating  to  their   sustainability and CSR concerns    A.  When  present   the  social  and  environmental  concerns  are  mostly   embedded in the economic component of the sustainability model.   B. When the CSR considerations are present and well inserted in the   business model  an interest towards supporting educational programs   and  human  resources  may  be  emphasized.  The  focus  on  educational   programs basically reflects the transfer of knowledge of the founders   and employees to the broad community; more specifically  giving it to   the  community  means  also  developing  even  further  their  concept  of   business.  The  particular  orientation  towards  human  resources  in  the   IT&C  startups  is  put  into  practice  both  in  terms  of  satisfying  their   needs  as well as developing their skills and educating.   In order to exemplify the above mentioned features and to prepare the   background  of  our  research   we  further  present  several  cases  of   Romanian startups from the IT domain and their standpoint in terms   of sustainable or corporate social responsibility (CSR) approach.   BuyAndHelp.ro   Through  an  innovative  idea   the  startup  brings   together the concepts of affiliated marketing and online commerce  by   providing  the  possibility  to  finance  Romanian  social  causes  while   buying from various producers through the specially designed website.   By  joining  CSR  and  ecommerce   the  financial  resources  are  directed   towards  various  community  causes  targeting  facets  like  education    culture   health  or  social  integration.  Particular  to  this  case  is  the  fact   that the firm per se could be considered a CSR startup/accelerator.   UrbanKid.ro   It  stands  for  a  parenting  blog  that  encompasses  various   tested  childhood  related  activities  and  experiences  and  promotes  a   healthy  and  balanced  attachment  parenting  style.  Moreover   as  it  is     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               81     The Romanian Economic Journal        stated  in  their  presentation   it  is  wholefamily  oriented  and   in  our   opinion   it  is  highly  socially  driven  from  its  core  founding  purposes.   The  blog  is  also  involved  in  the  Danone  campaign  “Say  Yes  to   Creativity” through a special section of their web page – sponsored by   the food processing company.   NextSteve Group  This startup is also innovative and it is dedicated to a   wide  range  of  emotional  intelligence  based  educational  programs  for   children   while  dealing  with  topics  like  personal  motivation  and   development  economic education and entrepreneurship (the program   “Juniors in Business”)  drawing and painting.   Shipros   It  is  an  international  online  shipping  exchange  based  on   auction for route optimization and better price. Through this activity    the  transporters  attain  both  the  economic  and  the  environmental   benefit of properly filling the transport space.   Cobalt Sign  While developing various programs for Android  iOS  and   Windows  the firm is dedicated both to economic and social purposes   through  health  and  cultural  oriented  applications.  Moreover   since   2014   Cobalt  Sign  is  also  directly  CSR  committed  through  their   volunteering  initiative  entitled  “Giving  Back  to  the  Community”.   Specifically  the startup offers every year free courses for 1520 years   old teenagers and students within the mobile development field.   Evidence like the cases presented above boost the need for the current   study  which is presented in the following sections of the paper.      3. Data and research methodology   The  research  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  analyse  the  launched   Romanian  technology  and  Internetrelated  startups  in  order  to   identify  their  preference  for  also  including  social  and  environmental   objectives  into  their  daily  business  strategies.  The  sustainability  quest   for  IT&C  startups  in  Romania  is  a  subject  less  investigated  in  the   specialized literature  but of increasing practical interest.     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               82     The Romanian Economic Journal        The selection of the startups was based on two fundamentals  firstly    the  wellknown  IT&C  boost  of  companies  in  Romania  in  technical   and  economic  terms  from  one  year  to  another   a  trend  even  more   pronounced  in  the  last  period;  secondly   the  existence  of  freely   available  information  regarding  the  startups  in  this  industrial  sector   (we  collected  the  data  from  www.romanianstartups.com  website).   Moreover  there is also the question about the need of mainly online   business  initiatives  to  include  sustainability  concerns  in  their  daily   operations  considering the characteristics of their object of activity.   For achieving the proposed aim  158 already launched startups were   included  in  the  sample   because  of  their  listing  on  the  specialized   directory  www.romanianstartups.com  and  their  ‘maturity’  degree  (the   potential growth phases of the startups are project  test – private beta   or  public  beta   and  launch).  The  launched  startups  were  preferred   because their business strategies and longterm visions were assumed   to be more definite articulated compared with the case of emerging or   testing projects.   According to their financing status (see Figure 1)  the considered start  ups are mainly in the bootstrapped (54.4%)  profitable (22.2%) or seed   capital  (17.1%)  categories   only  few  of  them  (6.3%)  being  already   opened up for different rounds of external investments from outside   sources  (series  A   B   C  financing).  The  startups  in  the  bootstrapped   stage depend on the personal capital of the founder(s)  the ones in the   seed  capital  phase  are  opened  up  for  very  early  investments   while  the   profitable firms already generate consistent profit for their owners.   The  distribution  of  the  investigated  startups  reaffirms  the  decisive   role  of  the  founder  when  establishing  the  business  strategy  to  be   followed  up  and  identifying  the  market  needs  and  niches  to  be   covered. At the same time  it should be noticed the significant share of   profitable companies  most of them already having between 10 and 50   employees  as an additional confirmation of their economic success.     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               83          The Romanian Economic Journal          Figure 1     Funding status of the investigated startups          Source  Authors’ processing using information from www.romanianstartups.com.      Although all startups that we took into account (158 firms) pertain to   the  IT&C  sector   specific  38  domains  of  activity  were  identified   (Iamandi  Constantin and Munteanu  2015  p. 60)  whereas one start  up  could  be  associated  with  more  than  one  domain.  In  the  online   business  environment  for  the  Romanian  startups   the  software   (39.2%)   mobile  (38%)   services  (35.4%)  and  SaaS/PaaS  (31%)  lead   the top  followed by web development and design (25.9%)  consumer   web (23.4%)  ecommerce (22.2%)  social media (18.4%)  social/other   (17.7%)  and  advertising  (15.2%)  sectors.  The  second  part  of  the  top   comprises  the  following  fields  of  online  activity   online  marketing   (14.6%)   cloud  computing  (13.3%)   enterprise  (11.4%)   consulting   (10.9%)   marketplaces  (10.1%)   education  (7.6%)   big  data  (7%)    branding  (7%)   games  (6.3%)   2D/3D  design  (5.7%)   networking   Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               84     The Romanian Economic Journal        (5.7%)  video and entertainment (5.7%)  communications (5.1%)  and   hosting (5.1%). The online domains with the lowest number of start  ups  were   HR/recruiting  (4.4%)   security  (4.4%)   travel  (4.4%)    customer  support  (3.2%)   financial  (3.2%)   health  (3.2%)   internet  of   things  (2.5%)   and  crowdfunding   hardware   nonprofit  and  search   (with  1.9%  each).  With  only  one  mention  in  the  investigated  sample   (meaning  0.6%)   we  found  cleantech   consumer  electronics  and   semiconductors domains. Even in the case of the companies that are   not  developing  exclusively  their  main  business  activities  through  the   internet  at least the promotion and customer contacting are made via   IT&C  channels   while  the  broad  interaction  with  the  customers  and   the PR activities are constantly changing.   The  validity  of  this  sample  and  the  corresponding  representativeness   of  the  investigated  firms  are  reflected  by  remembering  the  results  of   the European Startup Monitor (ESM  2015  p. 33) that emphasizes for   Romanian startups the prevalence of ‘software as a service’ business   sector. Going further with the comparison between the results of the   ESM  2015  study  and  the  current  research   other  three  hightech   business  segments  highly  represented  in  the  two  samples  are   web   development  consumer mobile or web applications  and ecommerce.   One  highly  pronounced  difference  resides  in  the  low  inclusion  of   ecological or green technologies in their business operations by start  ups in Romania in comparison with the ones at European level.   The  investigated  issues  are  aimed  to  identify  the  inner  nature  of  the   startups (economic  social or environmental scopes). More precisely    the motives for settingup startups were examined (mainly economic    social  or  environmentaldriven  companies)   as  well  as  additional   concerns for operating the business. The exclusion of economic  social   or  ecological  reasons  from  the  corporate  fundamentals  was  also   studied   by  acknowledging  the  size  of  the  investigated  firms  and  the   features of the European background.     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               85     The Romanian Economic Journal        In what concerns the grading of startups  each company was assessed   for  all  three  areas  of  business  study   economic  (EC)   social  (S)   and   environmental (ENV) contributions. For each corporate contribution   to  sustainability  (EC   S  and  ENV  –  generically  noted  with  the  “X”   areas in the following lines)  the involvement degree for every startup   was considered by checking one (and only one) of the three available   alternatives   Xdriven  (deep  contribution  to  the  “X”  area   it  identifies   the  inner  nature  of  the  respective  startup);  X  concerns  (there  is  some   contribution of the startup to the “X” area); or no X reasons (there is   no  contribution  of  the  startup  to  the  “X”  area).  In  this  way   we   created a grading scale for each area and we gave only the values of 1   (existent) or 0 (nonexistent) for a specific level of involvement.   Moreover  there are other two relevant issues to be mentioned about   the grading procedure of the startups and the proposed methodology.   First  of  all   one  startup  could  be  “driven”  by  only  one  area  of   sustainability (specifically because that area represents its inner nature   –  EC   S  or  ENV).  On  the  other  hand   one  startup  could  not  be   “driven” by and have “concerns” on the same area (e.g.  it could not   be ECdriven but also proving EC concerns  otherwise this finding being   redundant)  but it could be “driven” by one area and have “concerns”   on other areas (e.g.  ECdriven  S concerns  ENV concerns) or not having   “concerns”  at  all  on  one  or  two  areas  (e.g.   ECdriven   S  concerns   no   ENV concerns or ECdriven  no S concerns  no ENV concerns).   Additional  methodological insights could  be  provided  by  the authors   on specific request.   The achieved results are presented in detail in the following section of   the paper.      4. Findings and interpretation   As previously expected  the vast majority of the investigated startups   (91.8%) are basically driven by economic pursuits  whereas only 8.2%     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               86     The Romanian Economic Journal        of them are sociallydriven and none of them environmentallydriven.   In  what  concerns  the  IT&C  sociallydriven  startups   their objects of   activity refer to  answering to socioeconomic needs  supporting social   causes  of  general  or  specific  interest  for  their  customers   crowd  funding  for  social  entrepreneurship   offering  professional  assistance   for medical or health issues  strengthening the educational process and   developing  skills  through  less  conventional  methods   and  providing   entertainment  and  leisure  time  facilities.  For  these  sociallydriven   companies  the operating revenues are additional to their core business   activities  and   excepting  two  already  profitable  or  externallyfinanced   startups  they all are in the bootstrapped or seed capital stages.   The  second  studied  aspect  identifies  the  types  of  concerns  also   supported by the startups in addition to their core business activities.   At  this  point   the  social  concerns  associated  to  economic  business   ventures are leading the top (for about 24% of the investigated start  ups)  followed by environmental and economic concerns (with roughly   5% each). The approached environmental issues tackle with  offering   services  with  low  carbon  emissions  or  for  logistics  optimization  in   order  to  protect  the  environment   supporting  ecological  issues    offering geolocation and smartliving applications  and improving the   personal habitat and lifestyle. From the total of 158 startups  only 5 of   them  (3.2%)  are  including  economic   social  and  environmental   considerations altogether into their longterm strategies  while they are   in the bootstrapped or seed capital phases in financial terms.   Regarding  the  (economic   social  or  environmental)  component(s)   totally  ignored  by  the  investigated  startups   the  absence  of  the   environmental considerations (94.3%) seems to be a common feature   for the IT&C startups  followed by the lack of taking into account the   social  reasons  (67.7%)  when  settingup  the  business  operations.  The   importance  of  the  sustainability  criteria  for  assuring  longterm   competitiveness is not overlooked by the examined startups  but their   absence is rather associated with the peculiar object of activity of these     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               87     The Romanian Economic Journal        startups that are mainly developing their business undertakings in the   online  environment.  In  addition   there  are  5  startups  (3.2%  of  the   analysed  sample)  not  guided  by  economic  reasons   but  slightly   associated with the idea of social entrepreneurship  all of them being   bootstrapped  in  financial  terms  and  depending  on  the  personal   finances of the founder or operating revenues.   A  synthesis  of  the  corporate  consideration  of  economic   social  and   environmental  targets  in  the  business  ventures  of  the  investigated   startups is depicted in Table 1.

Although  mostly  driven  by  economic  purposes  because  of  their   business peculiarities  the startups in the IT&C sector in Romania are   well aware of the importance of including sustainability criteria (social   and environmental concerns) into their business operations  in a more   integrated way than it is usually the case with the CSR actions of the   bigger  companies.  As  previously  presented   the  limited  financial     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               88     The Romanian Economic Journal        resources  and  the  size  of  the  investigated  firms  are  two  barriers  that   limit  the  corporate  additional  involvement  in  social  or  ecological   causes not directly related with their core business. As a consequence    for  dealing  with  the  sustainability  challenge  in  the  postcrisis  period    the  newly  launched  startups  set  business  strategies  for  competitive   differentiation  where their economic objectives are intimately related   with  and  based  on  the  social  and  environmental  needs  of  the  broad   society (see  for example  Munteanu  2015).   The financing status of the startups could be one of the main criteria   when  analysing  the  integration  of  the  social  and  environmental   pursuits into the business strategies (see Table 2). However  there is no   direct relationship between the social and environmental concerns  on   the  one  hand   and  the  typology  of  the  startups’  financing   on  the   other hand. Taking into account the number of the investigated start  ups  in  each  financing  stage  only  the  firms  included in  the categories   “bootstrapped”  “profitable”  and “seed capital” will be analysed.   The  vast  majority  of  the  bootstrapped  startups  are  economicdriven   (approx.  91%)   not  guided  by  environmental  (93%)  or  social  (66%)   reasons;  however   the  social  concerns  are  3.5  times  higher  than  the   environmental  ones  when  designing  the  business  strategy.  The   situation  is  almost  the  same  for  the  companies  listed  in  the  seed  capital  category   because  approx.  89%  of  them  are  economicdriven    while  the  environmental  (89%)  and  social  (67%)  reasons  are  not   included  in  their  online  business  ventures   and  the  environmental   concerns  are  2  times lower  than  the  social prerequisites.  The  case  of   the  profitable  startups  is  even  more  pronounced   97%  of  them  are   economicdriven  and the environmental and social reasons are almost   totally ignored (100% and  respectively  74%).

The profile of a success startup in the IT&C sector in Romania seems   to  look  like  an  economicdriven company   with  slight  social  interests   mainly imposed by business prerequisites. Its main domains of activity   are not related to social or environmental issues  but they refer to  e  commerce   mobile   SaaS/PaaS   services   software   web  development   or design etc. However  when the sustainability criteria are concerned    they are included in the core business and not supported separately  as   distinct objectives. In the end  the purpose of the present research was   not  to  claim  for  a  higher  sustainability  involvement  for  the  IT&C   startups in Romania  but to investigate the way these companies relate   to social and environmental concerns.     Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               90     The Romanian Economic Journal          5. Conclusions and further research   The  strong  points  of  the  present  study  refer  to  its  originality  degree   and  comprehensive  sample.  A  similar  study  was  not  previously   conducted in the literature  especially for the Romanian market  and it   opens up new research directions in the field of entrepreneurship. The   investigated  firms  that  we  selected  are  all  the  IT&C  startups  listed   under  the  ‘launched’  category  on  the  www.romanianstartups.com   directory  at  the  end  of  2015   offering  a  complete  image  about  the   analysed  business  sector.  Last  but  not  least   the  present  study   contributed to solving the dilemma regarding the voluntary choice or   competitive  necessity  for  including  sustainability  concerns  into  the   IT&C startups’ business strategies.   The  main  difference  between  new  startups  and  already  set  larger   companies  in  terms  of  sustainability  attention  envisages  the  level  of   integration  of  social  and  environmental  concerns  in  the  current   business  operations.  In  case  of  the  investigated  IT&C  startups   the   perception  of  sustainability  is  in  accordance  with  the  changes  on  the   market and the size of their operations  and it becomes an integral part   of  their  business  strategy  and  a  decisive  factor  for  their  forthcoming   competitiveness.  When  analysing  the  Romanian  IT&C  startups   the   social  and  environmental  purposes  are  not  strictly  supported  by   considering the available financial resources or the corporate ‘maturity’   degree   but  they  are  rather  strategically  incorporated  in  the  core   business  activities   since  the  beginning  of  the  venture.  Summarizing   the  findings   a  new  business  pattern  for  the  competitive  startups   could  be  suggested  based on organic  integration of  economic   social   and environmental pursuits into the core object of activity.   In  order  to  extrapolate  the  achieved  findings   further  research  is   necessary   for  increasing  the  number  of  analysed  companies  and   diversifying the scrutinized fields of activity. Firstly  we appreciate that   not  only  launched  startups  should  be  taken  into  account   but  also   business initiatives in their initial stages of development (e.g. project or   Year XIX no. 62                                                                                         December 2016               91     The Romanian Economic Journal        test  phases)  or  final  stages  of  transformation  (e.g.  closed  or  acquired   businesses); furthermore  a strategic correspondence between the first   growth stages and the launched initiatives in social and environmental   terms would be of great interest. Secondly  a similar research could be   also  conducted  for  companies  operating  in  other  industrial  sectors    mainly  because  the  present  study  was  deeply  influenced  by  the   peculiarities  of  the  IT&C  sector   where  the  need  for  including   sustainability  concerns  in  the  daily  business  operations  is  arguable.   Finally   the  addition  of  quantitative  methods  in  support  of  the   qualitative ones is also needed.
