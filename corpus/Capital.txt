His  words   emerged from LPEA’s strategy exercise   which reflected the members’ views on   the  association  and  produced  guide  lines for the coming years.  With the future in mind and a broad new   chapter ahead of us  LPEA decided to   convey a new branding which ultimately   better reflects the association’s constitu  ency and goals which we now present to   you.  As from September 2015  LPEA is rep  resented by a new logo and a new set of   colours  and  graphical   tools.  The   rebranding keeps “LPEA” as the nomen    clature of the association but changes its   format to a more straight forward letter  ing.  At  the  same  time  we  introduce  a   pictogram which in its red and pink tones   reflects  the  youth  and  audacity  of  a   young association as much as the risk  taking attitude of the sector. While at first   the square pictogram may resemble an   arrow focusing on the unity of LPEA  if   you look more closely you will notice dif  ferent building blocks that represent the   stakeholders of the association and the   different  services  we  can  find  in   Luxembourg’s  private  equity  and  ven  ture capital “tool box”.  The  rebranding  is  the  result  of  a  half  yearlong  development  accomplished   by  LPEA’s  Promotion  Committee  and   Executive Committee with the expertise   of the communication agency Mediation.    CAPITAL  #6 I 5    EDITORIAL    DEAR PRIVATE    EQUITY PROFESSIONALS      I n this 6th edition of Capital V we bring you      the views of three entrepreneurs from a sector   that is pointed out by many as the way forward    to Luxembourg  Fintech.     Given the need for diversification the country faces    Fintech is seen by many end result of Luxembourg’s   many useful features  very highspeed internet    secured data centres and a unique Financial    sector’s know how.  Are we ready for the shift in mindset that    this will imply? Will the more traditional practices   welcome this new world? If we want to continue   to be a leader in finance  the answer must    be “yes”.   LPEA is also changing! Along with    the celebration of our 5th anniversary    we are rolling out a new logo that   represents our positioning and   Luxembourg’s PE/VC toolbox.  Enjoy the reading.

M  M  a    /    i    d  e  m  s  s  o  r  C  0  6  3  ©    Finance Minister Pierre Gramegna    “WE BELIEVE IN    A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD”    PIERRE GRAMEGNA SAYS   LUXEMBOURG IS ON THE WAY BACK   TO A BALANCED BUDGET  WANTS    A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD ON TAX    AND IS A PERFECT TEST BED FOR   FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY.    the     What is the state of the national   budget following the VAT rate   changes?  Overall the situation is satisfactory. The   effects  of   ‘future  package’   (“Zukunfspak”) measures start to be felt    as  the  IMF  has  just  confirmed  in  its   recent report. We are on track to return   to a balanced budget for the central gov  ernment by 2018  while maintaining one   of  the  highest  levels  of  investment  in   Europe – it will grow by 15% this year to   nearly €2bn. And the growth trend is not   restricted  to  investment;  overall     8 I CAPITAL  #6    INTERVIEW    state expenditure will increase by   an average of 4% a year between 2014   and 2018. As regards VAT  rate adjust  ments were necessary to compensate in   part  for  the  expected  loss  of  revenue   from VAT on ecommerce  which is esti  mated at around €700m for the current   year.  However   let’s  not  forget  there   hasn’t  been  any  acrosstheboard   increase. The 3% rate on food and other   basic necessities as well as books  med  icine  and  cultural  events  still  applies    and  our  rates  remain  the  lowest  in   Europe.    Why has Luxembourg been   singled out for criticism of its tax   rulings?  I think this is no longer the case. At first   we were subject to scathing media accu  sations based on documents stolen from   a Luxembourg company. If the theft had   taken  place  somewhere  else   it  would   have been another country in the firing   line. We needed to make a big effort to   explain that tax rulings are not unique to   Luxembourg  –  they  are  a  wellestab  lished practice in most countries. Now   the European Commission is looking at   how tax rulings are established in all EU   member states  while the OECD is work  ing on a proposed global legal frame  work for business taxation. Luxembourg   is actively contributing to these efforts   because  we  believe  in  a  level  playing   field where the same rules apply to eve  ryone.  Meanwhile   Luxembourg’s  pro  gress on fiscal transparency  an area in   which we have been subject to attacks    is  widely  recognised  by  our  partners    even if old stereotypes die hard  espe  cially for certain media. All we can do is   continue our efforts to restore the coun  try’s positive brand image.    How will Luxembourg position   itself in the new European and   international tax environment?  Luxembourg isn’t  and has never been    a tax haven – in 2013 the government’s   tax  take  was  39.3%  of  GDP  –  but  we   have  always  maintained  a  competitive   tax framework to attract companies and   enable  them  to  grow.  Upholding  and   indeed improving the competitiveness of   our  businesses  is  a  prime  aim  of  our     tax     planned   reform.  Successive   Luxembourg  governments  have  mani  fested their commitment to fair tax com  petition between the countries because   it’s the only way of preventing a negative   spiral  of  continuing  and  excessive   increases  in  tax  rates.  As  part  of  this   commitment   Luxembourg  is  actively   involved in the OECDsponsored initia  tive on base erosion and profit shifting    which seeks to establish common rules   that  would  implement  a  level  playing   field on a worldwide basis.   However   I  should  stress  that  the  tax   regime has only ever been one element   among many that attract businesses to   Luxembourg.  Other  factors   including   political  and  economic  stability   long  term  planning   highquality  infrastruc  ture   a   responsive   administrative system  a legal framework   that responds to the requirements of the   economy  the availability of a skilled mul  tilingual  workforce  and  the  country’s   ideal geographical location are just as   important.    flexible  and     How important for Luxembourg   is the confirmation of its AAA   credit rating?  The AAA rating is a guarantee of stabil  ity  a seal of approval shared with very   few countries around the world  and thus   a significant competitive advantage. The   AAA rating highlights the strength of our   public finances and investor confidence   in  Luxembourg’s  economy   and  prom  ises the creation of new jobs in the years   to come.    What added value does   Luxembourg offer Fintech   companies such as Amazon    Rakuten  PayPal  Alibaba and   eBay?  I  have  made  the  development  of  the   financial  technology  sector  one  of  my   priorities.  It  already  accounts  for  150   companies and more than 10 000 jobs   in Luxembourg  and its growth potential   is enormous. Luxembourg benefits from   an  infrastructure  that  few  if  any  of  its   competitors can match. Companies can   find here some of the most efficient data   centres  in  the  world   a  well  calibrated   legal framework  and a real ecosystem     CAPITAL  #6 I 9    “Luxembourg   isn’t  and has   never been     a tax haven     but we have   always offered   companies a   competitive tax   framework.”    Pierre Gramegna    Finance Minister    at their disposal including specialist ser  vice  providers   a  network  of  nearby   research centres  incubators and financ  ing. In addition  our established financial   industry  offers  an  ideal  research  and   development environment with hundreds   of potential clients.    Could Fintech companies   become competition for the   traditional financial sector?  It’s interesting to see ecommerce spe  cialists  such  as  Rakuten  obtaining  a   banking licence and launching activities    but  I  see  them  complementing  rather   than  competing  with  established  play  ers. Traditional financial institutions can  not ignore the digital revolution and will   have  to  adapt   and  Fintech  providers   have an important role to play in helping   our  financial  industry  to  diversify  its   offerings.

During the second semester of     2015   Luxembourg  took  over   the Presidency of the Council of   the European Union from Latvia   . Despite not being a legislating institu  tion  the European Council plays a critical   role  in  Europe  by  setting  the  policy   agenda and by adopting “conclusions”   which  identify  issues  of  concern  and   actions to take. It is therefore worthwhile   to highlight the policies that Luxembourg   has put on the agenda for such a critical   period for the EU.   Amid a slow recovery from an economic   crisis  the rise of euroscepticism and the   more  recent  challenge  of  thousands  of   illegal  migrants   it  is  no  surprise  that   Luxembourg  aims  at  focusing  its  man  date on bringing back the citizens – and   their voice  to the core of the European   project.    Given the inherent subject of Capital V –   private  equity  and  venture  capital   we   have  highlighted  below  the  main  areas   where Europe and its Council Presidency   will  be  working  towards  a  stronger   economy      European Investment Plan    The  socalled  “Juncker  Plan”  is  set  to   invest €315 billion during a period of 3   years starting in 2015. The initiative tar  gets the real economy and aims at creat  ing an investment friendly environment.   The plan seeks to overcome current mar  ket failures by addressing market gaps   and  mobilising  private   investment   towards innovation and risk finance for   SMEs. Investors  notably private equity   players   are  invited  to  join  project  co  financing   on  a  risksharing  basis  with     R  D  ©    the European Investment Bank and the   European Investment Fund.     Capital Markets Union (CMU)    The CMU  an important element in the   Investment Plan  aims at creating deeper   and  more  integrated  capital  markets.   The initiative is intended to reduce the   fragmentation in financial markets  diver  sify financing sources  strengthen cross   border capital flows and improve access   to  finance  for  businesses   particularly   SMEs. This is to be achieved by remov  ing barriers to cross border investment    simplifying access to public markets and   improving risk capital  notably for SMEs.   Overall   the  European  Commission   expects  to  make  markets  work  more   effectively  linking investors to those who   need  funding  more  efficient  and  less   costly  both within Member States and   crossborder.     The Transatlantic Trade and   Investment Partnership (TTIP)  The  free  trade  agreement  currently   under negotiation is estimated to impact   the European economy with an annual     growth of €119 billion (on average €500   per  household)  and  is  therefore  per  ceived as a “free” growth package for   Europe. TTIP will make it easier to invest   across de Atlantic and overall will impact   businesses  at  the  competition  level   through  lower  custom  duties  and  less   restrictions  on  standards  and  regula  tions. While the discussions around the   TTIP are expected to intensify in the sec  ond  semester   the  Luxembourg  presi  dency  plays  an  important  role  in  the   sensitive  debate  of  the  Investorstate   dispute  settlement  (ISDS)  and  in  the   implementation of further transparency   to the negotiations.    In  addition  to  the  policies  above   the   Luxembourg Presidency of the European   Council has already made clear its com  mitment  to  focus  on  policies  against   fraud and tax evasion in the context of   the developments led by the OECD and   the G20. Such policies will contribute to   greater transparency and establishing a   level playing field for all.    CAPITAL  #6 I 11    NEWS    THE FUTURE IS NOW    LAUNCH OF THE NEW   LUXEMBOURG FUTURE FUND    After an initial announcement in 2012    the  Luxembourg  Future  Fund  (LFF)   was finally launched on 20 April 2015.   The €150 million fund  designed to invest   in  businesses  intended  to  shape  the   future of Luxembourg  is subscribed by   SNCI    Societé  Nationale  de  Crédit  et   d’Investissement contributing €120m and   by the EIF  European Investment Fund   acting as Advisor bringing in the remain  ing €30m.   The  fund   targeted  towards  innovative   SMEs  from  early  to  growth  stages  in   domains such as ICT and Cleantech  is   composed  of  three  different  subfunds   which  will  (1)  coinvest  with  other  VC   funds  (2) coinvest with business angels   and family offices and (3) fund other funds   financing the envisaged target group.   EIF’s experience with an extensive net    work  of  VC  funds  across  Europe  is   expected to be a major source of deal   flow for the LFF.  The international approach of the fund is   well  aligned  with  EIF’s  privileged  pan  European overview. With circa 250 funds   under management and a team of some   30  investment  professionals  most  of   whom are based in Luxembourg  EIF is   certainly  in  a  good  position  to  recom  mend the programme to all those looking   for a welcoming spot  e.g. in the ICT and   Cleantech domains.    One of the specificities of the LFF is   that  it  cannot  invest  in  companies   already  established  in  Luxembourg.  The goal of the fund is to bring interna  tional spillover to Luxembourg by invest  ing  in  businesses  which  aim  to  either     settle in Luxembourg (eg. open an office    develop a research centre) or to sign long   term partnerships with key actors of the   Luxembourg innovation ecosystem.     In addition to the inflow of new funds   to  SMEs   the  local  venture  capital   industry  may  well  also  benefit  from   the LFF. Usually claiming a limited local   deal flow  the programme will foster the   development of new business activities in   Luxembourg  and  bring  over  new  fast  growing companies which may well turn   into desirable investment opportunities.  The  LFF  is  initially  designed  to  be   deployed during the next 5 years and is   foreseen to be renewed if shown to be   successful as experienced by the EIF in   other  countries.  First  investments  are   expected before the yearend.

Since  its  inception  15   years  ago   the  company  built  over   25 000  towers  (most  in  Nigeria)   hired   1 000  engineers  and  has  brought   US$5bn   the   continent.  In  2014    turnover  reached   US$315m  with  an  Ebitda  of  about   US$100m. The number of towers built by   the company has continued to grow in   2014 to support the increasing need of   infrastructure in Africa.   Those investments have been financed   by a US$2bn  capital increase  the larg  est funding raised by an African com  pany since 2010.

INTERVIEW WITH JEANPHILIPPE BURCKLEN  HEAD OF EQUITY FUND INVESTMENTS    (EIF) is Europe’s main provider of   risk  financing  for  small  and   medium sized enterprise (SMEs)   and MidCaps. EIF delivers sources of   funding  including  equity   debt  and   microfinance  via  financial  intermediar  ies. EIF’s shareholders are the European   Investment  Bank  (EIB)   the  European   Commission (EC) and public and private   financial institutions. This combination of   public  and  private  shareholding  gives   EIF a dual focus  to support EU policy   objectives  while acting as a marketori  ented institution that delivers appropri  ate return on capital.    We met JeanPhilippe Burcklen who has   been Head of Equity Fund Investments   at EIF since September 2000. Burcklen   oversees the lower midmarket activity   and is responsible for investments and   portfolio  in  private  equity   mezzanine   and debt funds including coinvestments   in companies  a new activity at EIF.    Burcklen and his team were instrumental   in the creation in 2009 of the €1bn (dou  bled  in  2013)  Mezzanine  Facility  for   Growth (MFG) programme funded by th   EIB. Additionally in 2015  they have been   mandated to manage a new programme   funded by the EIB that focuses on invest  ments in senior loan funds with a view to   address the credit needs of SMEs and   MidCaps in Europe.    We know EIF’s involvement in   supporting SMEs by investing into   Private Equity funds. Could you   explain why EIF is now turning to   the Private Debt market?  Private Debt is not something new for EIF   and  we  cannot  limit  our  action  in  the   Private  Debt  market  to  this  new  pro    funds     First  EIF’s guarantee and securitisation   activity  has  been  crucial  for  the  debt   market and has indirectly helped sup  porting  hundreds  of  thousands  of   European companies.  In parallel  on the equity side  EIF  argu  ably the biggest fundofVenture Capital    funds  in  Europe  started  developing  a   significant role in supporting European   growth  capital   from  2003.   Alongside the traditional instruments of   the growth capital Private Equity indus  try   the  need  for  different  instruments   expanding  the  support  to  SMEs  and   MidCaps  soon  emerge.  Specifically  I   am  referring  to  those  companies  or   groups owned by shareholders that are   not willing  for various reasons  to lose   their influence or control  or not ready to   welcome  a  significant  external  share  holder   or  managers  willing  to  take  (or   strengthen)  their  control.  Hybrid  debt/  equity instruments proved to be an ideal   response to this market need. However    even if deriving from the traditional con  vertible bonds often implemented by PE    players  these products were also requir  ing strong “credit expertise” as they tar  geted   investee  companies  with   midtolow  growth  rate  and  limited   default  affordable.  For  the  EIB  Group   (EIF and the EIB)  these products were   also representing an interesting alterna  tive way of deploying less equity for the   same impact  while keeping pure equity   only for where strictly necessary. In addi  tion another market need emerged for   “technology  mezzanine”  or  “venture   debt” also perceived as a very effective   funding source for high growth techno    logy companies when injection of equity   is not strictly financially required.    It seems however that EIF’s   Private Debt activity has   intensified over the last 5 or 6   years   Yes   for  the  reasons  given  above  and   particularly  since  2009  when  we   launched the MFG programme   as an   answer  to  the  financial  crisis  of  2008    which clearly evidenced the undercapi  talisation of the European SMEs and the   need  for  significant  equity  and  quasi  equity injections.  This  programme  helped  a  number  of   mezzanine players affected by the sig  nificant reduction of the volumes of deals   sponsored by an equity fund to refocus   and reorientate their strategy towards   more  sponsorless  transactions.  The   programme attracted in 20112012 the   interest of the German government that   was  at  the  time  seeking  solutions  to   address the forthcoming wall of maturity   of  the  mezzanine  platforms  loans  that   was expected in 20142017.  We have thus been active in the private   (junior)  debt  market  for  six  years  now   and  have  backed  more  than  45  fund   managers with commitments exceeding   €1.6bn.  This shows that EIF is constantly analys  ing the need of its underlying markets    always trying to anticipate these needs    and then in close cooperation with our   stakeholders (mainly the EIB and the EC)   to  help  design  and  deploy  new  pro  grammes and mandates.     The further development in 2015 of our   Private  Debt  strategy  with  a  new  pro  gramme funded by the EIB and designed   for  funds  distributing  primarily  senior   debt to SMEs and MidCaps is another     CAPITAL  #6 I 15    example  of  our  constant  evolution.   Beyond the difference in risk (from junior   debt to senior debt) this new programme   also allows us to work differently  asso  ciating  our  guarantee  &  securitisation   team  for  high  granularity  (diversified)   strategies and our PE team for low gran  ularity (selective) strategies.  We are currently finalising our first deals    which have been approved by our Board   of Directors and should be signed dur  ing the coming weeks.  So   this  “senior  debt  funds”  strategy   appears  to  be  more  of  an  evolution    rather than a revolution  building on the   convergence of our PE and guarantee   businesses. We have identified 50 to 60   general partners (GPs) providing debt   funds to SMEs in Europe with interesting   deal flows. We want to make sure that   SMEs  and  MidCaps  have  access  to   loan facilities that are not always easy to   access  through  banks.  Credit  institu  tions  are  still  very  active  in  financing   good  risks  and  large  corporations  but   seem to have less appetite for the low   end of the midmarket.    EIF does not have as such a   banking licence  is it an issue    per se?  EIF  does  not  distribute  credit  directly    but acts as a Limited Partner (LP) in a   fund managed by a GP. As LP  EIF does   not need a banking licence. The situation   is different for GPs when it comes to loan   distribution. Depending on the jurisdic  tion   this  activity  can  be  subject  to  all   kinds of regulatory requirements even in   some cases having banking license or   working in collaboration with banks. The   differences in local regulatory environ  ments  have  generated  different   approaches (e.g. secondary acquisition   in  France   SPVs   in  Luxembourg    Minibonds in Italy  etc).    How should this move to the   Private Debt market be read with   the Capital Market Union   initiative?  For  EIF   the  harmonisation  of  the  legal   and  regulatory  frameworks  across   Europe is key for an efficient rollout of     our  products  (equity  and  debt).  The   development  of  a  functioning  EU  eco  system for SMEs and MidCaps seeking   access to finance in VC and PE is one of   the  pillars  of  our  action   targeting  the   stimulation of the activity of VC/PE firms   and  extending  the  reach  of  financial   instruments to companies currently left   without adequate access to finance.  When we decide on a new investment  it   always has to be measured (beyond its   expected performance) in terms of added   value summarised by three criteria  mar  ket need  structuring input and catalytic   impact. With its growing activity in Private   Debt   EIF  directly  contributes  to  the   Capital Market Union with additional and   more diversified funding mobilised  with   an  accelerated  dissemination  of  best  marketpractice   with  new  operations   under senior loan funds and the involve  ment of nonbank lenders. Simultaneously   EIF modulates its action on the various EU   countries overweighting those countries   where  the  access  to  finance  for  SMEs   and MidCaps is more difficult.    Are there any specific differences   between the two asset classes    in terms of expected returns     risk management  investment   followup?  Clearly  expected  returns  in  Private   Equity  and  Private  Debt  are  not  in  the   same  range.  Private  Debt  returns  are   expected (gross IRR) in the 56% range   without  equity  kicker  and  reaching   810%  with  equity  kicker.  Two  obvious   consequences of such levels of return   are the difficulty to properly address the   “alignment of interest between LPs and   GP”  which  is  a  key  dogma  in  Private   Equity  and the sensitivity of the global   performance to a non performing invest  ment is very high and a debt fund man  ager cannot afford to record too many   defaults. In such a context we have to   adjust  our  due  diligence  process  and   insist more on topics such as the selec  tion process  track record  credit skill set   and motivation of the investment team    without  forgetting  some  Private  Equity   expertise in case the fund benefits from   some equity kicker as well.

But   based in Luxembourg  you have   maybe some thoughts on how   Luxembourg is performing on   the debt fund market. What   comment would you have on   their current position?  There is still a lot of progress to be made   to  improve  the  fund  infrastructure  in   Europe. Access for new GPs for example   is  a  key  issue   so  working  around  an   easy toolbox is crucial. Luxembourg has   developed a number of good scalable   tools for the investment community.

Hergott is one of the active angel     investors in Luxembourg and a   wellknown name within the local   entrepreneurial community. After   a career in R&D and having cofounded   several  businesses  including  Luxscan   Technologies and the seed and startup   focused fund Chameleon Invest  Hergott   is now bringing some fresh air  and funds    to  formaly  R&D  focussed  company   VISUOL.   LPEA spoke with Hergott about the new   investment but also about the overall angel   investment landscape in Luxembourg.    How large and active is the   business angel community in   Luxembourg and who is the   typical business angel we can find   today?  Despite being always a very informal mar  ket with no clear figures  I can tell you that   at  LBAN   the  Luxembourg  Business   Angels Network  today we have approxi  mately  30  members   most  of  whom  are   quite active investors. It’s a diverse com  munity in which I identify two major types   of  participants.  One  group  of  entrepre  neurs who have succeeded  mostly dur  ing  the  late  90’s  and  another  group   characterized by highlevel executive pro  file where we will find former and current   CFOs  CEOs and other professionals with   strong management experience.     With 50.000 professionals   working in the financial industry    is there room to find more   business angels in Luxembourg?  We know that there are many more busi  ness angels in Luxembourg and certainly   many coming from the financial sector. At   this  stage   and  given  the  direction  our   association seeks to take  we would like to   encourage the participation of those pro  fessionals  who  can  certainly  bring  an   higher level of professionalism to our prac  tices and surely bring in “executive” exper  tise that can help startups deal with growth   challenges  such  as  internationalisation    recruitment and governance.I am never    theless concerned that many may be pre  vented  from  joining  due  to  a  possible   conflict of interests with their day job.    Where are Luxembourg business   angels investing today?  Business  angels  in  Luxembourg  invest   mostly in the Greater Region and in the   web sector but we see many also inter  ested in impact investing  healthcare/ bio  technology   industry  and  even  retail   business. While usually business angels   aim  for  global  and  scalable  businesses   (and therefore IT  web or fintech)  our drive   is also to impact the region hence to invest   mostly in the great region and “down to     CAPITAL  #6 I 17    “We all invest    with an eye on   successful exits   but having fun is   still our first   reward  especially   by creating value   and sharing    knowhow.”    JeanYves Hergott    One of your recent investments   with other Luxembourg business   angels  was in Visuol   Technologies  a 20years old   French business. Are business   angels tracking far more than   young startups? Tell us more   about this investment.  Visuol was indeed created in 1994 under   the name Techlab which sold material for   labs specially for the steel industry. In 2007   the company split to have VISUOL focus  sing on its current business field  the devel  opment and sale of quality surfaces control   systems for the industry. Last year myself    with four other business angels of LBAN   and three others from France looked closer   into this company  and invested early 2015   in this optical measurement business to do   something that can be very appealing for   experienced business angels and entre  preneurs. It consists iof “starting up” the   company or  in other words  accelerating   the  business  via  investment   injection  of   knowhow  and  better  governance.  In   Visuol   as  in  other  decadeslong  busi  nesses  we need to refine and refocus mar  kets  and  business  which  brings  a  big   challenge  but  also  immense  passion  to   redraw the company from scratch. In pri  vate equity words  we’re doing a turnaround   of the business  not with millions of Euros    but with angels wings.    .

Actually  besides investing in start  ups  we also see many investors targeting   the  “succession”  stage   relaunching   established  businesses  with  a  need  for   new  business  models  or  other  critical   improvements  that  can  shuffle  up  the   game. This is much in line with the regional   focus  of  our  investments.  Luxembourg    being a small country in size  has limited   deal flow so the Greater Region (bordering   regions of Belgium  Germany and France)    accessible in a short drive  is where many   of us feel most comfortable to invest.     Is angel investment in   Luxembourg taking any direct or   indirect advantage of the   country’s leading financial   centre?   Luxembourg  has  multiple  tax  efficient   investment structures. However this only   applies to more “committed” investors who   are those actually setting up these holding   structures. If you are an individual doing   investments without such structures you   expose  yourself  to  being  taxed  on  your   income tax as Luxembourg doesn’t have   any kind of special regime for business     angels today. This is something we lose   against other countries which have cre  ated adequate regimes for angel invest  ments knowing the specificities  high risk   & high economic impact  and is something   we need to continue working on with the   authorities.     What is your experience with   Luxembourg based Venture   Capital/ Private Equity investors?  We keep close contact with early stage   VCs although recognising we live in dif  ferent  leagues.  As  I  mentioned  before    angels are more local while VCs  espe  cially  those  based  in  Luxembourg   are   naturally global and many also special  ised in certain sectors. This means we are   not seeking the same kind of deals and   would be hard pressed to find a local VC   fitting the sector or the stage of develop  ment we’re looking for. This leads us to   most often look for VCs abroad which are   more aligned with the business needs. I   must recognise there’s still a gap that we   should  try  to  overcome  on  having   Luxembourg early stage VCs funds more   aligned  with  the  region  businesses’   needs.     18 I CAPITAL  #6    COVER STORY    Rocket Internet    ROCKING    THE    FINTECH   WORLD    FINTECH IS OUT TO REVOLUTIONIZE AND   RESHAPE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

EACH OF THEM IS A COMPANY OF ROCKET   INTERNET  THE GLOBAL INCUBATOR   HEADQUARTERED IN BERLIN  WHICH EXPANDED   ITS OPERATIONS TO LUXEMBOURG LAST YEAR.    FinTech is ramifying into every   corner of the financial industry.   Is FinTech complementing or   taking the place of the   traditional banking industry?  Paymill  The FinTech sector won’t com  pletely  replace  the  traditional  banking   industry.  But  it  will  make  them  rethink   their current models  since they will start   to struggle if they don’t keep up with their   digital competitors in terms of flexibility.   Spotcap  There was a time when banks   used  lobbying  to  slow  down  fintech.   Now  the trend leans towards coopera  tion.

Are major established players of   the financial industry able to   create disruptive change within   their organization? Or can   fundamental change only be   triggered by the outside  e.g. by   startup companies?   Spotcap  It’s certainly possible but only   very few will succeed. Disruptive change   needs  a  certain  mindset  and  environ  ment.  Fintech  startups  have  the  great   advantage of flexible structures and agil  ity. We don’t need representative prime   offices  and  countless  employees  to   serve our clients.  Zencap  Paul Volcker  the former chair  man  of  the  Federal  Reserve   said  in   anger over the financial crisis  ‘The only   useful banking innovation was the inven  tion of the ATM.’ We completely agree   with  this  statement.  For  a  long  time      banks  have  been  stuck  in  complex   restructuring processes which they fail   to manage well. Fundamental shift can  not  be  triggered  from  the  inside.  You   need people who think about financial   services from a different angle  who rec  ognize  that  innovative  technology  and   Big Data are crucial to drive disruptive   change.    The FinTech sector is much   lighter regulated than the   banking industry. Looking at   tendencies such as the Bitcoin   regulation  what is your opinion   on the potential impact of an   increased regulation to the   FinTech industry?   Paymill  Indeed  the more participants   and  the  more  complex  processes   become  the more rules and regulations   need to be set up. Service providers and   customers  will  benefit  from  it.

But we hope those remain   flexible or at least suitable to the digital   environment.  Spotcap  In the end regulatory require  ments will deter dishonest financial ser  vice providers from entering the market.   This  will  be  an  advantage  for  us  and   other reliable financial service providers.   If  authorities  enforced  regulation   we   would strongly lobby for it.    What are the exit route(s) of   preference for FinTech   companies?   Spotcap  I don’t believe in the existence   of  one  preferred  exit  route.  There’s   always  a  whole  spectrum  of  exit   opportunities.   Paymill  To my mind  it would be coope  tition  the innovative ideas of startups   combined  with  experience   workforce   and resources of incumbent players. It   all depends on the size of the company.   Once the company has achieved a cer  tain  level  of  growth  IPOs  are  also  an   option for FinTechs once the market has   matured.

As an entrepreneur    what are the Top 3 picks that   could make you decide where to   set up your next venture?   Zencap   In  order  to  set  up  a  FinTech   venture  you need to consider the regu  latory  environment  of  a  country.  The   competitive landscape is also an impor  tant  criterion.  For  example   although   other  online  lending  platforms  have   launched before us  Zencap was the first   one only focusing on SMEs in Germany.   Another factor is rather an emotional fac  tor than a hard fact. We decided to set   up Zencap in Berlin because the city is     a melting pot of different cultures and a   great place to live. We benefit from the   diversity  of  our  employees  every  day    and Berlin attracts an incredible inflow of   highly talented people from around the   world.   Paymill  Important is the access to peo  ple  and  resources   similar  to  what  we   see in London or Munich. Living costs   also  play  a  critical  role.  That’s  where   Berlin has few peers in Europe  offering   a mixture of infrastructure as well as an   attractive cost of living. Last but not least   is  the  regulatory  environment  in  the   country.

Zencap  For now  I could settle with only   one wish  We are on our way to transform   one of the last resorts in the global econ  omy that has not been disrupted by inno  vative  challengers  yet.  Banking  won’t   look  the  same  10  years  from  now.  To   change  an  industry  that  is  as  old   as   powerful   and  that  has  turned  as  far   away from its customers as the banking   industry  we need the best and brightest   to  shape  this  change.

While the PE market had   been growing constantly for over a dec  ade  the years following the banking crisis   brought  a  major  setback  which  can  be   claimed to be over now. The first 6 months   of 2013 showed even worse figures com  pared to 2012 in terms of volume of total PE   investments  number and volume of deals.   But since the second half of 2013 both exit   and investment environment have consid  erably improved.    PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS   For  example   the  number  of  PE  invest  ments in Q1 2014 were already twice as   high  as  in  Q1  2013.  Fundraising  also   improved during that year; in total  2014   saw €4 800 million being raised. A driving   force in particular was the publicsector   fund  of  fund  FondICO  Global   which   started to share out its €450 million to a   number of funds such as Corpfin  Diana    Espiga   Magnum   Oquendo   PAI    Portobello  Suma and Trilantic. This par  ticularity  of  the  Spanish  market  not  only   fueled the PE and VC industry in 2014 but   is expected to continue to do so in 2015. A   mirror of the opportunities available are the   €3 billion being invested  a figure similar to   the years before the banking crisis. The   invested capital stands for a plus of 45%   via 580 transactions  compared to 2013   data. The first half of 2015 saw lower fig  ures with €726m invested  a decrease by   41% compared to the same period in 2014.   However  this is simply due to the lack of   any megadeal in the first 6 months. 70% of   the invested capital in 2015 went into LBOs   and expansion capital  in line with Spanish   PE tradition. Interesting detail is the origin   of the funds invested  52% come from inter  national investors  proof of the confidence   and attractiveness of the Spanish market.   Further  support  comes  from  Ardian    Cinven and EQT opening local offices.   Another  important  factor  for  PE  and  VC     growth in 201415 is the ongoing regenera  tion of the exit market  either via Trade Sales   or via IPOs  thereby freeing capital that can   again be invested in new funds. Figures   were already encouraging in 2014 but the   first semester 2015 has beaten the record   with €1.8 billion exited through 141 deals.    PRIVATE DEBT FUNDS  While macroeconomic conditions continue   to show significant improvements and give   hope for further growth over the next sev  eral years  reforms in the banking sector   over the past few years have forced banks   to  shut  down  or  merge    the  number  of   financial institutions decreased from 50 in   2009 to 14 in 2012. This consolidation and   the deleveraging process has led to less   product coverage and diminished lending   to local businesses. But the sector restruc  turation process also leads to a number of   opportunistic situations to acquire loans   and assets from forced sellers. Therefore    still more than in other countries  private   debt  funds  have  found  their  niche  to   finance  growth  or  restructuration  of  the   SME market in particular. Also  at least in   the near future  there remains significant   scope for private debt funds to provide   financing  and  other  specialized  credit   solutions – at the same time servicing the   SME market and injecting much needed   liquidity.  Some  believe  that  the  Iberian   market currently constitutes the most com  pelling  jurisdiction  in  Europe  for  SME   credit  investing.  These  conditions  are   underpinned by specific structural adjust  ments and a massive overhaul of the finan  cial  sector   creating  a  distinctive   opportunity for specialized credit invest  ments in the region.    THE VENTURE CAPITAL MARKET  Not only private debt but also the venture   capital  market  is  attracting  investors     although Spain has traditionally been a PE   market  investing  in  buyouts  and  lever  aged firms. Since 2014 again  public insti  tutions that provide credits  international     VC funds as well as other players such as   business angels  acceleratorsincubators   and other sources like crowdfunding plat  forms  are  boosting  the  VC  industry  in   Spain. 14 VC funds were active in 2014  an   amazingly high number  compared to 5 on   average over the past years. Spanish start  ups are on the radar of national and inter  national VC funds. Here again  FondICO   Global  provided  financing  to  private  VC   funds in 2014 so those could close their   fundraising and start investing. Overall  this   lead to an increase by 26% in 2014 in avail  able  capital  to  VCbacked  firms  though   less deals  in total numbers  were closed.   A  shift  towards  latestage  VC  was  also   recorded  at the detriment of startups and   other earlystage investments. Interesting   as  well  that  almost  8%  of  all  financing   received by Spanish PE and VC houses   was  provided  by  US  investors   a  figure   reached in 2006 for the last time.    FUND VEHICLES  While the largest funds in the country are   still domiciled abroad  there is a move from   offshore jurisdictions to onshore and a   clear tendency towards Spanish registered   funds. The market  especially institutional   international investors  are not yet used to   Spanish AIF Managers (“AIFM”)  but there   is an increasing number of Spanish Risk   Capital  Companies  (“Sociedades  de   CapitalRiesgo”  or  “SCR”)  managed  by   local AIFMs. The move from offshore to   onshore is triggered by a) compliance/  regulatory  requirements  that  make  off  shore  vehicles  more  difficult  and  2)  tax   measures  such  as  BEPS  on  an  interna  tional  basis  and   locally   changes  in  the   Spanish  tax  treatment  under  which  the   conditions for the SCR are regulated and   advantageous  for  local  structures   as  a   general  rule   capital  gains  derived  from   transfer of shares in portfolio companies   are 99% taxexempted.

PE  market  participants   tend to favour the “rent an AIFM” solution   over the platform.   Numerous Luxembourgbased AIFMs –   a number of which are LPEA members   –  are  now  assisting  US  managers  to   comply with AIFMD regulatory require  ments to access the passport.   Control related concerns of the US man  ager are typically dealt with by (i) having   an appropriate framework agreement in   place with the Luxembourg AIFM  (ii) the   ability  of  the  AIF  –  which  remains  ulti  mately controlled by the US manager –   to terminate the AIFM appointment and   appoint another AIFM and (iii) a putin   favour  of  the  US  manager  over  any   equity  interest  which  the  Luxembourg   AIFM would have in the AIF.    LUXEMBOURG PARTNERSHIP  In view of the AIF  the Luxembourg leg  islator took the opportunity of the imple  mentation of the AIFMD into Luxembourg   law   the   Luxembourg partnership regime.  Now  Luxembourg Limited Partnerships   are organised  operated and capitalised   in  much  the  same  manner  as  partner    to  completely     revamp     LPEA roadshow in New York City held on June 2nd 2015.    ships in major AngloSaxon jurisdictions.   The legislator added further benefits  (a)   the extent to which there is a separate   legal  existence  (or  not)  –  indeed   Luxembourg has a common limited part  nership (société en commandite simple    SCS) which has a legal personality and   a special limited partnership (société en   commandite  spéciale    SCSp)  which   does not have legal personality and (b)   the  management  of  the  Partnership  –   Luxembourg  introduced  express  safe   harbour  provisions  for  LP  involvement   and  the  possibility  to  have  managers     managing the partnership without incur  ring unlimited liability. According to mar  ket participants  those are very helpful   additional features.   Further  changes  are  ahead   with  the   Luxembourg legislator currently working   on the introduction of a new Restricted   Investment Fund regime. The proposed   regime would add a further type of fund    not regulated by the CSSF provided that   it  is  managed  by  an  authorised  EEA  based AIFM  with a legal regime close to   that of the Specialized Investment Fund   (SIF).  The  current  proposal  contem    CAPITAL  #6 I 25    “The importance   of economic   substance    for holding   companies    can only be   heightened.”    tain actions of the BEPS action plan. As   an illustration  action five aims notably at   aligning taxation with the substance of   transactions. Similarly  the BEPS action   plan identified treaty shopping as one of   the main issues and action six proposes   to  amend   the  OECD  Model  Tax   Convention to include  amongst others    strong limitationonbenefits provisions   and general antiabuse rules. The impor  tance of economic substance for holding   companies can only be heightened.    CONCLUSION   Ultimately  the substance requirements   imposed from a regulatory perspective   are very beneficial for tax purposes  and   indeed tax and regulatory requirements   are converging.   Accessing an AIFM in Luxembourg (with   a Luxembourg AIF) allows US managers   to avail themselves of the AIFMD market  ing passport. At the same time  the fact   that  certain  core  functions  cannot  be   delegated  by  the  AIFM   such  that  the   AIFM  would  need  to  have  appropriate   staff and infrastructure to be able to per  form these functions itself  significantly   decreases the likelihood that foreign tax   authorities might successfully challenge   the  substance  throughout  the  holding   and financing structure beneath the fund   level.

USE OF LUXEMBOURG   INTERMEDIARY INVESTMENT   VEHICLES AND BEPS  US managers who do not operate a fund   platform  in  Luxembourg  are  generally   familiar  with  Luxembourg’s  corporate   and  tax  framework  for  holding  and   financing  companies.  Substance  for   such companies is becoming a key topic   in the current tax environment.     The  Parent  Subsidiary  Directive2  has   recently been amended to introduce a   general  antiavoidance  rule  (GAAR)   which  has  to  be  implemented  into   domestic law before 1.1.2016.

THE APPEAL OF AGRICULTURAL   REAL ASSETS  In the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis    investors  faced  the  challenge  to  rethink   their investment portfolios. The low interest   rate environment that has persisted since   then  across  the  developed  world  has   added  pressure  as  investors  face  the   prospect  of  continued  low  returns  and   increased volatility in financial markets. In   these circumstances  investors are mov  ing  towards  alternative  investments  that   stand between risky equities and overval  ued  bonds;  and  agricultural  real  assets   like farmland can fit very well.  Agricultural real assets are linked with the   longterm theme of resource scarcity and   besides their positive correlation to infla  tion  they can provide a strong cash yield   and  offer  low  correlation  to  traditional   assets. Managers and investors seem to   agree on the prospects of this asset class    As  of  June  2015   there  are  almost  280   funds investing exclusively on this space    up from 54 funds in 2005  and with total   AuM  over  US$50  billion   according  to   funds tracked by Valoral Advisors.    Institutional and private investors alike are   increasingly allocating capital to the agri  cultural asset class. For family offices  as   their portfolios have usually a longterm   outlook   they  can  be  best  positioned  in   terms of pursuing trends that are likely to   persist  for  the  next  ten  years  or  even   longer. And besides the economic bene  fits to their portfolio  some family offices   find that the agricultural sector offers them   the possibility to address socially respon  sible or impact investments  they can gen  erate attractive economic returns and at   the  same  time   they  can  do  something   positive.    SEEDING THE FUTURE OF   FARMING FROM LUXEMBOURG   TO EUROPE AND BEYOND  Luxembourg is well known as the leading   European domicile for vehicles investing in   international real estate; now the growing   interest  in  farming  assets  can  further   strengthen the country´s innovative role in   real  estate.  There  are  already  several   funds  domiciliated  in  the  country  that   cover  the  full  spectrum  of  the  food  and     agriculture asset class – from listed equi  ties  and  commodities   through  private   equity and trade finance  to farmland and   forestry.  One  of  the  managers  attracted  by  the   Luxembourg´s  offering  in  real  estate   investment vehicles is Blue Harvest S.A.    a  Genevabased  wealth  management   company  founded  in  2009  by  Jens   Ohnemus. Mr Ohnemus  a Danish native   with agricultural background and with a   large  trajectory  in  banking  and  wealth   management  decided to invest in the land   he  knows  best.  The  company  will  soon   launch the Blue Harvest Danish Farmland   Fund SCSp  seeking to raise capital for the   acquisition and sustainable operation of   agricultural farms in Denmark  with a focus   on  crop  and  animal  production.  Mr.   Ohnemus explains that “the fund is a first   for Denmark and plans to build a portfolio   of sustainable producing farms across the   country  providing investors an opportu  nity to invest in real  tangible assets that     CAPITAL  #6 I 27    “Institutional and private   investors alike are increasingly   allocating capital to the   agricultural asset class.”    offer a diversified source of income and   capital  appreciation”.  The  Fund  will  be   structured as a “Société en commandite   spéciale” (“SCSp”) in Luxembourg  com  parable  with  the  AngloSaxon  Limited   Partnership. The corporate flexibility and   tax transparency that this structure pro  vides were among the main attributes that   attracted  the  attention  of  Blue  Havest´s   management.    THE DANISH HEDGE  The fund had a warm reception so far – Mr.   Ohnemus comments that “Denmark is an   agricultural nation  with more than 60% of   its  territory  devoted  to  agriculture”.  The   country is a net exporter of food  a global   leader in animal welfare and with best in   class  environmental  protection  policies.   And with its AAA rating  a strong econ  omy  a stable parliamentary democracy   and ranked first in Europe in ease of doing   business  the country scores very high in   the context of agricultural investments.     As Mr. Ohnemus says  “Today  Denmark is   a top choice for farmland investments in   Europe”. Whether investors go for devel  oped farms in Europe or for more exotic   farms in South America or SubSaharan   Africa  Luxembourg finance industry can     play a key role in channeling resources to   invest responsibly in producing increasing   supplies of food for a growing population.

WHETHER IT BE “OASIS    OF WEALTH”  “CROSSROADS OF DIVERSITY”     OR JUST “A LITTLE POCKET OF LOVELINESS”.     The latter aims to translate “klein     aber fein” – a German expression   – which in the context of nation   branding speaks volumes about   the booster effect coming out of this tiny   yet vibrant country. Little Luxembourg is   capable of doing big things – like Apple   did  once upon a time  from a garage. It   seems that size is not a “sine qua none”   for  becoming  big;  many  cutting–edge   companies  start  small  nowadays.  Our     pocketsized  country  has  ‘Duracel’like   potential and a proven track record for   being first in class – be it for Europe  steel    satellites or finance.    IMPORTANCE OF BEING   FOCUSED  Yet the sheer number of positive attrib  utes  is  not  a  good  thing  for  branding.   The challenge is to get “the” message    which captures the spirit and essence of     the  country  in  its  entirety.  It  has  to  be   transversal  as relevant for tourism as it   is for finance and industry. And it has to   resonate  with  everyone   Luxembourg   residents  as  much  as  Luxembourg   nationals – no easy task.  Sadly  the results of the recent referen  dum go against building a coherent mes  sage any time soon. What it revealed is a   country with several faces  each looking   in different directions mimicking Janus      CAPITAL  #6 I 29    “Luxembourg has its roots in   history  boldly stating a desire   to remain independent.”    George Bock    R  D  ©    Luxembourg  has  its  roots  in  history    boldly stating a desire to remain inde  pendent.  In  the  present  context   how  ever   this  motto  takes  on  different   undertones. Could it subtly hint at resist  ance to change?   The  gap  between  how  Luxembourg  is   perceived by the outside business world   and its actual way of working is a further   stumbling block to a coherent message.   Politicians  aspire  to  close  the  existing   perception gap and show Luxembourg   as a dynamic place to be. Luxembourg   has a hardworking international commu  nity working like cogs in unison. With the   current political momentum  it can grow   to  be  a  place  where  talents  flourish    ideas  spark  and  then  go  live.  So  how   best to express this to the outside world?    BRIDGING THE GAPS – MIND   THE GAP  In our country of hills and valleys  bridges   play  an  important  role.  Luxembourg   excelled in the past by bridging commu  nities and nations. It is  after all  the birth  place  of  the  European  Union  and  the   country that put “Schengen” in the agree  ment  to  have  open  borders  in  Europe.   Today  with the Luxembourg presidency     of the Council of the EU  our small country   is once more at the apex of the political   and economic scene  trying to solve the   Greek  puzzle  together  with  other  EU   members and at the same time welcom  ing with a grateful  muted nod  the confir  mation that hard work has paid off with   another triple A rating granted.  The  bridge  is  a  symbol  for  the  nation   which has built its reputation on being a   reliable yet accessible partner. A compel  ling story built around connections  mak  ing  things  happen  and  staying  unique.   Could this be the key to successful nation   branding?  Nation Branding is not a simple advertis  ing campaign – it aims to extract juices   about  what   the  Grand  Duchy  of   Luxembourg  is  best  at   add  innovative   elements and create a beautiful waterfall   of  emotional  stories  and  compelling   images with a meaningful tagline around   them.

When you visit the 26km   along the Moselle river that   Luxembourg shares with   Germany  you will discover   numerous wineries   producing excellent wines   and cremants in a vineyard   area that covers 1 287   hectares only. Cremants    representing an astonishing   15% of the entire wine   production  are the   oenological flagship of   Luxembourg which   represents the country at   any event. But at the same   time Luxembourg represents   15 grape varieties to be   discovered by wine lovers.   Sandwiched between   Germany and France    Luxembourg has   developed its own wine   style. On its limestone    Keuper and clay marl soils it   is the pinot grape varieties   that turn out best  which is   reflected in the main   varieties grown  apart from   the most common one  the   Rivaner or MuellerThurgau    a hybrid bred in the Swiss   canton of Thurgau in the   1880 by Mr. Mueller  based   on Riesling and Madelaine   Royal (26%)  which has been   constantly decreasing in   grown quantity  the pinot   varieties Auxerrois  Pinot   Gris  Blanc and Noir (51% all   together) are the most   widely represented and are     more and more replacing   the “table wine” grape   variety Rivaner. These are   complemented by Riesling   (12%) and Elbling (7.5%)  the   famous grape already   cultivated by the Romans in   the Moselle valley more than   2000 years ago  and a   number of more exotic   grapes like Gewürztraminer   and Chardonnay (also a   Pinot grape).    The main producers of   wines in Luxembourg are    its cooperatives which   nowadays market their    wines successfully under the   single label of Domaines   Vinsmoselle  encompassing   the traditional wineries    of Greiveldange    Grevenmacher    Remerschen  Stadtbredimus   and Wellenstein as well as   the POLLFABAIRE Crémant   Development Centre in   Wormeldange.  With more than 300   winemakers they produce   some 60% of all   Luxembourg wines  while 50   private wine growers    represented by its   association “Privatwënzer”    successfully elaborate and   market their own wines. The   association and its   oenologists have assisted   the private growers in   boosting both quality and   marketing to place their   wines not only with the local   gastronomy  commerce and   end consumers but also with   international wine importers   and restaurants throughout   Europe.     Winegrowing is still done by   hand by the Privatwënzer –   note that only 9 out of the   375 wine growers own and   cultivate more than 15   hectares  and these usually   around their own estates.   The cooperatives  however    purchase grapes from all   around Luxembourg  so they   cannot only blend wines   from different soils and   climates but can also   produce wines from specific   prestigious lots and terroirs.   A propos terroir wines    Luxembourg was at the   forefront when creating   the quality label “Charta   Schengen”. Being the   synonym for a borderless   European Union    winegrowers on the German    Luxembourg and French   Moselle may elaborate their   best wines to become a   “Charta Schengen wine”.   From Luxembourg    4 wineries elaborate these   label wines  from France   there are 2 and 1 from   Germany. These   winegrowers commit to   respecting rigorous   restrictions in the production   process  such as the     M  B  ©    orientation of the vineyard  a   minimum slope angle    defoliation  a maximum yield   per acre  the vinification   process and its marketing.   Once they have undergone   a severe organoleptical   exam by an independent   jury  they can finally market   these wines. As with all other   Luxembourg wines and   cremants  around 2/3 of all   exports end up in Belgium…   Last but not least    Luxembourg’s oenotourism   has been developing   strongly over the past years    apart from annual events   such as the opendoor week  ends where all wineries are   open to the public  its wine   village events  guided tours   through the vinyards along   the Moselle  winetastings    the Riesling ralleys  and   many more invite wine   amateurs and lovers to   discover Luxembourg’s   wineries and vineyards.
