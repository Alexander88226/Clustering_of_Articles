The rebranding keeps \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLPEA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as the nomenclature of the association but changes its format to a more straight forward lettering.  At  the  same  time  we  introduce  a pictogram which in its red and pink tones reflects  the  youth  and  audacity  of  a young association as much as the risktaking attitude of the sector. While at first the square pictogram may resemble an arrow focusing on the unity of LPEA if you look more closely you will notice different building blocks that represent the stakeholders of the association and the different  services  we  can  find  in Luxembourg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  private  equity  and  venture capital \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctool box\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.The  rebranding  is  the  result  of  a  halfyearlong  development  accomplished by  LPEA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Promotion  Committee  and Executive Committee with the expertise of the communication agency Mediation.\\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 5EDITORIALDEAR PRIVATE  EQUITY PROFESSIONALS I n this 6th edition of Capital V we bring you  the views of three entrepreneurs from a sector that is pointed out by many as the way forward  to Luxembourg Fintech.

The effects  of \\xe2\\x80\\x98future  package\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cZukunfspak\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) measures start to be felt as  the  IMF  has  just  confirmed  in  its recent report. We are on track to return to a balanced budget for the central government by 2018 while maintaining one of  the  highest  levels  of  investment  in Europe \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it will grow by 15% this year to nearly \\xe2\\x82\\xac2bn. And the growth trend is not restricted  to  investment;  overall \\x0c8 I CAPITAL  #6INTERVIEWstate expenditure will increase by an average of 4% a year between 2014 and 2018. As regards VAT rate adjustments were necessary to compensate in part  for  the  expected  loss  of  revenue from VAT on ecommerce which is estimated at around \\xe2\\x82\\xac700m for the current year.  However  let\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  not  forget  there hasn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  been  any  acrosstheboard increase. The 3% rate on food and other basic necessities as well as books medicine  and  cultural  events  still  applies and  our  rates  remain  the  lowest  in Europe.Why has Luxembourg been singled out for criticism of its tax rulings?I think this is no longer the case. At first we were subject to scathing media accusations based on documents stolen from a Luxembourg company. If the theft had taken  place  somewhere  else  it  would have been another country in the firing line. We needed to make a big effort to explain that tax rulings are not unique to Luxembourg  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  they  are  a  wellestablished practice in most countries. Now the European Commission is looking at how tax rulings are established in all EU member states while the OECD is working on a proposed global legal framework for business taxation. Luxembourg is actively contributing to these efforts because  we  believe  in  a  level  playing field where the same rules apply to everyone.  Meanwhile  Luxembourg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  progress on fiscal transparency an area in which we have been subject to attacks is  widely  recognised  by  our  partners even if old stereotypes die hard especially for certain media. All we can do is continue our efforts to restore the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s positive brand image.How will Luxembourg position itself in the new European and international tax environment?Luxembourg isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t and has never been a tax haven \\xe2\\x80\\x93 in 2013 the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s tax  take  was  39.3%  of  GDP  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  but  we have  always  maintained  a  competitive tax framework to attract companies and enable  them  to  grow.  Upholding  and indeed improving the competitiveness of our  businesses  is  a  prime  aim  of  our tax planned reform.  Successive Luxembourg  governments  have  manifested their commitment to fair tax competition between the countries because it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the only way of preventing a negative spiral  of  continuing  and  excessive increases  in  tax  rates.  As  part  of  this commitment  Luxembourg  is  actively involved in the OECDsponsored initiative on base erosion and profit shifting which seeks to establish common rules that  would  implement  a  level  playing field on a worldwide basis. However  I  should  stress  that  the  tax regime has only ever been one element among many that attract businesses to Luxembourg.  Other  factors  including political  and  economic  stability  longterm  planning  highquality  infrastructure  a responsive administrative system a legal framework that responds to the requirements of the economy the availability of a skilled multilingual  workforce  and  the  country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ideal geographical location are just as important.flexible  and How important for Luxembourg is the confirmation of its AAA credit rating?The AAA rating is a guarantee of stability a seal of approval shared with very few countries around the world and thus a significant competitive advantage. The AAA rating highlights the strength of our public finances and investor confidence in  Luxembourg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  economy  and  promises the creation of new jobs in the years to come.What added value does Luxembourg offer Fintech companies such as Amazon Rakuten PayPal Alibaba and eBay?I  have  made  the  development  of  the financial  technology  sector  one  of  my priorities.  It  already  accounts  for  150 companies and more than 10000 jobs in Luxembourg and its growth potential is enormous. Luxembourg benefits from an  infrastructure  that  few  if  any  of  its competitors can match. Companies can find here some of the most efficient data centres  in  the  world  a  well  calibrated legal framework and a real ecosystem \\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 9\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLuxembourg isn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t and has never been  a tax haven  but we have always offered companies a competitive tax framework.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dPierre Gramegna Finance Ministerat their disposal including specialist service  providers  a  network  of  nearby research centres incubators and financing. In addition our established financial industry  offers  an  ideal  research  and development environment with hundreds of potential clients.Could Fintech companies become competition for the traditional financial sector?It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting to see ecommerce specialists  such  as  Rakuten  obtaining  a banking licence and launching activities but  I  see  them  complementing  rather than  competing  with  established  players. Traditional financial institutions cannot ignore the digital revolution and will have  to  adapt  and  Fintech  providers have an important role to play in helping our  financial  industry  to  diversify  its offerings.Article published in Duke 05 in September 2015..MMa/idemssorC063\\xc2\\xa9MORE INFORMATIONwww.myofficialstory.com/pierregramegnawww.mf.public.lu\\x0c10 I CAPITAL  #6EUROPEAN UNIONHOW IS THE LUXEMBOURG PRESIDENCY IMPACTING BUSINESS?During the second semester of 2015  Luxembourg  took  over the Presidency of the Council of the European Union from Latvia . Despite not being a legislating institution the European Council plays a critical role  in  Europe  by  setting  the  policy agenda and by adopting \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconclusions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which  identify  issues  of  concern  and actions to take. It is therefore worthwhile to highlight the policies that Luxembourg has put on the agenda for such a critical period for the EU. Amid a slow recovery from an economic crisis the rise of euroscepticism and the more  recent  challenge  of  thousands  of illegal  migrants  it  is  no  surprise  that Luxembourg  aims  at  focusing  its  mandate on bringing back the citizens \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and their voice to the core of the European project.Given the inherent subject of Capital V \\xe2\\x80\\x93 private  equity  and  venture  capital  we have  highlighted  below  the  main  areas where Europe and its Council Presidency will  be  working  towards  a  stronger economy European Investment PlanThe  socalled  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJuncker  Plan\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  is  set  to invest \\xe2\\x82\\xac315 billion during a period of 3 years starting in 2015. The initiative targets the real economy and aims at creating an investment friendly environment. The plan seeks to overcome current market failures by addressing market gaps and  mobilising  private investment towards innovation and risk finance for SMEs. Investors notably private equity players  are  invited  to  join  project  cofinancing  on  a  risksharing  basis  with RD\\xc2\\xa9the European Investment Bank and the European Investment Fund. Capital Markets Union (CMU)The CMU an important element in the Investment Plan aims at creating deeper and  more  integrated  capital  markets. The initiative is intended to reduce the fragmentation in financial markets diversify financing sources strengthen cross border capital flows and improve access to  finance  for  businesses  particularly SMEs. This is to be achieved by removing barriers to cross border investment simplifying access to public markets and improving risk capital notably for SMEs. Overall  the  European  Commission expects  to  make  markets  work  more effectively linking investors to those who need  funding  more  efficient  and  less costly both within Member States and crossborder. The Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP)The  free  trade  agreement  currently under negotiation is estimated to impact the European economy with an annual growth of \\xe2\\x82\\xac119 billion (on average \\xe2\\x82\\xac500 per  household)  and  is  therefore  perceived as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfree\\xe2\\x80\\x9d growth package for Europe. TTIP will make it easier to invest across de Atlantic and overall will impact businesses  at  the  competition  level through  lower  custom  duties  and  less restrictions  on  standards  and  regulations. While the discussions around the TTIP are expected to intensify in the second  semester  the  Luxembourg  presidency  plays  an  important  role  in  the sensitive  debate  of  the  Investorstate dispute  settlement  (ISDS)  and  in  the implementation of further transparency to the negotiations.In  addition  to  the  policies  above  the Luxembourg Presidency of the European Council has already made clear its commitment  to  focus  on  policies  against fraud and tax evasion in the context of the developments led by the OECD and the G20. Such policies will contribute to greater transparency and establishing a level playing field for all.\\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 11NEWSTHE FUTURE IS NOWLAUNCH OF THE NEW LUXEMBOURG FUTURE FUNDAfter an initial announcement in 2012 the  Luxembourg  Future  Fund  (LFF) was finally launched on 20 April 2015. The \\xe2\\x82\\xac150 million fund designed to invest in  businesses  intended  to  shape  the future of Luxembourg is subscribed by SNCI    Societ\\xc3\\xa9  Nationale  de  Cr\\xc3\\xa9dit  et d\\xe2\\x80\\x99Investissement contributing \\xe2\\x82\\xac120m and by the EIF  European Investment Fund acting as Advisor bringing in the remaining \\xe2\\x82\\xac30m. The  fund  targeted  towards  innovative SMEs  from  early  to  growth  stages  in domains such as ICT and Cleantech is composed  of  three  different  subfunds which  will  (1)  coinvest  with  other  VC funds (2) coinvest with business angels and family offices and (3) fund other funds financing the envisaged target group. EIF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience with an extensive network  of  VC  funds  across  Europe  is expected to be a major source of deal flow for the LFF.The international approach of the fund is well  aligned  with  EIF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  privileged  panEuropean overview. With circa 250 funds under management and a team of some 30  investment  professionals  most  of whom are based in Luxembourg EIF is certainly  in  a  good  position  to  recommend the programme to all those looking for a welcoming spot e.g. in the ICT and Cleantech domains.One of the specificities of the LFF is that  it  cannot  invest  in  companies already  established  in  Luxembourg.The goal of the fund is to bring international spillover to Luxembourg by investing  in  businesses  which  aim  to  either settle in Luxembourg (eg. open an office develop a research centre) or to sign long term partnerships with key actors of the Luxembourg innovation ecosystem. In addition to the inflow of new funds to  SMEs  the  local  venture  capital industry  may  well  also  benefit  from the LFF. Usually claiming a limited local deal flow the programme will foster the development of new business activities in Luxembourg  and  bring  over  new  fastgrowing companies which may well turn into desirable investment opportunities.The  LFF  is  initially  designed  to  be deployed during the next 5 years and is foreseen to be renewed if shown to be successful as experienced by the EIF in other  countries.  First  investments  are expected before the yearend.RD\\xc2\\xa9\\x0claw is our artthe leading businesslaw firm in Luxembourg95 experts in Private Equity\\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 13DEALTOWERS  OF STRENGTH  AND PROSPERITYIHS  TOWERS OF STRENGTH MAY CERTAINLY BE ONE OF THE MOST VISIBLE INVESTMENTS OF LUXEMBOURG PRIVATE EQUITY IN AFRICA.

Growth has  been  fast.  Since  its  inception  15 years  ago  the  company  built  over 25000  towers  (most  in  Nigeria)  hired 1000  engineers  and  has  brought US$5bn the continent.In  2014 turnover  reached US$315m  with  an  Ebitda  of  about US$100m. The number of towers built by the company has continued to grow in 2014 to support the increasing need of infrastructure in Africa. Those investments have been financed by a US$2bn  capital increase the largest funding raised by an African company since 2010. The round was led by Wendel  represented in Luxembourg by Winvest Conseil LPEA member alongside IHS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shareholders who are major financial institutions active in economic development and toptier private equity companies. Among these are Emerging Capital  Partners  the  leader  in  private equity in Africa IFC part of the World Bank  group  and  Investec.

EIF delivers sources of funding  including  equity  debt  and microfinance  via  financial  intermediaries. EIF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s shareholders are the European Investment  Bank  (EIB)  the  European Commission (EC) and public and private financial institutions. This combination of public  and  private  shareholding  gives EIF a dual focus to support EU policy objectives while acting as a marketoriented institution that delivers appropriate return on capital.We met JeanPhilippe Burcklen who has been Head of Equity Fund Investments at EIF since September 2000. Burcklen oversees the lower midmarket activity and is responsible for investments and portfolio  in  private  equity  mezzanine and debt funds including coinvestments in companies a new activity at EIF.Burcklen and his team were instrumental in the creation in 2009 of the \\xe2\\x82\\xac1bn (doubled  in  2013)  Mezzanine  Facility  for Growth (MFG) programme funded by th EIB. Additionally in 2015 they have been mandated to manage a new programme funded by the EIB that focuses on investments in senior loan funds with a view to address the credit needs of SMEs and MidCaps in Europe.We know EIF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement in supporting SMEs by investing into Private Equity funds. Could you explain why EIF is now turning to the Private Debt market?Private Debt is not something new for EIF and  we  cannot  limit  our  action  in  the Private  Debt  market  to  this  new  profunds First EIF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s guarantee and securitisation activity  has  been  crucial  for  the  debt market and has indirectly helped supporting  hundreds  of  thousands  of European companies.In parallel on the equity side EIF arguably the biggest fundofVenture Capital  funds  in  Europe  started  developing  a significant role in supporting European growth  capital from  2003. Alongside the traditional instruments of the growth capital Private Equity industry  the  need  for  different  instruments expanding  the  support  to  SMEs  and MidCaps  soon  emerge.  Specifically  I am  referring  to  those  companies  or groups owned by shareholders that are not willing for various reasons to lose their influence or control or not ready to welcome  a  significant  external  shareholder  or  managers  willing  to  take  (or strengthen)  their  control.  Hybrid  debt/equity instruments proved to be an ideal response to this market need. However even if deriving from the traditional convertible bonds often implemented by PE  players these products were also requiring strong \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccredit expertise\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as they targeted investee  companies  with midtolow  growth  rate  and  limited default  affordable.  For  the  EIB  Group (EIF and the EIB) these products were also representing an interesting alternative way of deploying less equity for the same impact while keeping pure equity only for where strictly necessary. In addition another market need emerged for \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctechnology  mezzanine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  or  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cventure debt\\xe2\\x80\\x9d also perceived as a very effective funding source for high growth technology companies when injection of equity is not strictly financially required.It seems however that EIF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Private Debt activity has intensified over the last 5 or 6 yearsYes  for  the  reasons  given  above  and particularly  since  2009  when  we launched the MFG programme  as an answer  to  the  financial  crisis  of  2008 which clearly evidenced the undercapitalisation of the European SMEs and the need  for  significant  equity  and  quasiequity injections.This  programme  helped  a  number  of mezzanine players affected by the significant reduction of the volumes of deals sponsored by an equity fund to refocus and reorientate their strategy towards more  sponsorless  transactions.  The programme attracted in 20112012 the interest of the German government that was  at  the  time  seeking  solutions  to address the forthcoming wall of maturity of  the  mezzanine  platforms  loans  that was expected in 20142017.We have thus been active in the private (junior)  debt  market  for  six  years  now and  have  backed  more  than  45  fund managers with commitments exceeding \\xe2\\x82\\xac1.6bn.This shows that EIF is constantly analysing the need of its underlying markets always trying to anticipate these needs and then in close cooperation with our stakeholders (mainly the EIB and the EC) to  help  design  and  deploy  new  programmes and mandates. The further development in 2015 of our Private  Debt  strategy  with  a  new  programme funded by the EIB and designed for  funds  distributing  primarily  senior debt to SMEs and MidCaps is another \\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 15example  of  our  constant  evolution. Beyond the difference in risk (from junior debt to senior debt) this new programme also allows us to work differently associating  our  guarantee  &  securitisation team  for  high  granularity  (diversified) strategies and our PE team for low granularity (selective) strategies.We are currently finalising our first deals which have been approved by our Board of Directors and should be signed during the coming weeks.So  this  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csenior  debt  funds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  strategy appears  to  be  more  of  an  evolution rather than a revolution building on the convergence of our PE and guarantee businesses. We have identified 50 to 60 general partners (GPs) providing debt funds to SMEs in Europe with interesting deal flows. We want to make sure that SMEs  and  MidCaps  have  access  to loan facilities that are not always easy to access  through  banks.  Credit  institutions  are  still  very  active  in  financing good  risks  and  large  corporations  but seem to have less appetite for the low end of the midmarket.EIF does not have as such a banking licence is it an issue  per se?EIF  does  not  distribute  credit  directly but acts as a Limited Partner (LP) in a fund managed by a GP. As LP EIF does not need a banking licence. The situation is different for GPs when it comes to loan distribution. Depending on the jurisdiction  this  activity  can  be  subject  to  all kinds of regulatory requirements even in some cases having banking license or working in collaboration with banks. The differences in local regulatory environments  have  generated  different approaches (e.g. secondary acquisition in  France  SPVs in  Luxembourg Minibonds in Italy etc).How should this move to the Private Debt market be read with the Capital Market Union initiative?For  EIF  the  harmonisation  of  the  legal and  regulatory  frameworks  across Europe is key for an efficient rollout of our  products  (equity  and  debt).  The development  of  a  functioning  EU  ecosystem for SMEs and MidCaps seeking access to finance in VC and PE is one of the  pillars  of  our  action  targeting  the stimulation of the activity of VC/PE firms and  extending  the  reach  of  financial instruments to companies currently left without adequate access to finance.When we decide on a new investment it always has to be measured (beyond its expected performance) in terms of added value summarised by three criteria market need structuring input and catalytic impact. With its growing activity in Private Debt  EIF  directly  contributes  to  the Capital Market Union with additional and more diversified funding mobilised with an  accelerated  dissemination  of  bestmarketpractice  with  new  operations under senior loan funds and the involvement of nonbank lenders. Simultaneously EIF modulates its action on the various EU countries overweighting those countries where  the  access  to  finance  for  SMEs and MidCaps is more difficult.Are there any specific differences between the two asset classes  in terms of expected returns  risk management investment followup?Clearly  expected  returns  in  Private Equity  and  Private  Debt  are  not  in  the same  range.  Private  Debt  returns  are expected (gross IRR) in the 56% range without  equity  kicker  and  reaching 810%  with  equity  kicker.  Two  obvious consequences of such levels of return are the difficulty to properly address the \\xe2\\x80\\x9calignment of interest between LPs and GP\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  which  is  a  key  dogma  in  Private Equity and the sensitivity of the global performance to a non performing investment is very high and a debt fund manager cannot afford to record too many defaults. In such a context we have to adjust  our  due  diligence  process  and insist more on topics such as the selection process track record credit skill set and motivation of the investment team without  forgetting  some  Private  Equity expertise in case the fund benefits from some equity kicker as well.JeanPhilippe Burcklen Head of Equity Fund Investments.RD\\xc2\\xa9Finally we know that EIF is a European institution embracing the whole European market. But based in Luxembourg you have maybe some thoughts on how Luxembourg is performing on the debt fund market. What comment would you have on their current position?There is still a lot of progress to be made to  improve  the  fund  infrastructure  in Europe. Access for new GPs for example is  a  key  issue  so  working  around  an easy toolbox is crucial. Luxembourg has developed a number of good scalable tools for the investment community. I was recently  surprised  to  see  an  English Limited  Partnership  managed  by  a Luxembourg  GP  notably  because  the procedure  to  obtain  the  passport  was quicker in Luxembourg!Interview by Alexandre ProstGargoz Cochair of LPEA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Promotion Committee and Partner  of Deloitte.\\x0c16 I CAPITAL  #6INTERVIEWTURNAROUND  WITH ANGEL WINGSINTERVIEW WITH JEANYVES HERGOTT BUSINESS ANGEL AND ENTREPRENEUR WHO HAS RECENTLY LED THE DEAL TO INVEST IN THE PROMISING FRENCHBASED OPTICAL METROLOGY COMPANY TECHNOLOGIES.

LPEA spoke with Hergott about the new investment but also about the overall angel investment landscape in Luxembourg.How large and active is the business angel community in Luxembourg and who is the typical business angel we can find today?Despite being always a very informal market with no clear figures I can tell you that at  LBAN  the  Luxembourg  Business Angels Network today we have approximately  30  members  most  of  whom  are quite active investors. It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s a diverse community in which I identify two major types of  participants.  One  group  of  entrepreneurs who have succeeded  mostly during  the  late  90\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  and  another  group characterized by highlevel executive profile where we will find former and current CFOs CEOs and other professionals with strong management experience. With 50.000 professionals working in the financial industry is there room to find more business angels in Luxembourg?We know that there are many more business angels in Luxembourg and certainly many coming from the financial sector. At this  stage  and  given  the  direction  our association seeks to take we would like to encourage the participation of those professionals  who  can  certainly  bring  an higher level of professionalism to our practices and surely bring in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexecutive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d expertise that can help startups deal with growth challenges  such  as  internationalisation recruitment and governance.I am nevertheless concerned that many may be prevented  from  joining  due  to  a  possible conflict of interests with their day job.Where are Luxembourg business angels investing today?Business  angels  in  Luxembourg  invest mostly in the Greater Region and in the web sector but we see many also interested in impact investing healthcare/ biotechnology  industry  and  even  retail business. While usually business angels aim  for  global  and  scalable  businesses (and therefore IT web or fintech) our drive is also to impact the region hence to invest mostly in the great region and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdown to \\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 17\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe all invest  with an eye on successful exits but having fun is still our first reward especially by creating value and sharing  knowhow.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dJeanYves HergottOne of your recent investments with other Luxembourg business angels was in Visuol Technologies a 20years old French business. Are business angels tracking far more than young startups? Tell us more about this investment.Visuol was indeed created in 1994 under the name Techlab which sold material for labs specially for the steel industry. In 2007 the company split to have VISUOL focussing on its current business field the development and sale of quality surfaces control systems for the industry. Last year myself with four other business angels of LBAN and three others from France looked closer into this company and invested early 2015 in this optical measurement business to do something that can be very appealing for experienced business angels and entrepreneurs. It consists iof \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstarting up\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the company or in other words accelerating the  business  via  investment  injection  of knowhow  and  better  governance.  In Visuol  as  in  other  decadeslong  businesses we need to refine and refocus markets  and  business  which  brings  a  big challenge  but  also  immense  passion  to redraw the company from scratch. In private equity words we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re doing a turnaround of the business not with millions of Euros but with angels wings..MS./aidemssorC063\\xc2\\xa9earth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d businesses in more traditional sectors. Actually besides investing in startups we also see many investors targeting the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csuccession\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  stage  relaunching established  businesses  with  a  need  for new  business  models  or  other  critical improvements  that  can  shuffle  up  the game. This is much in line with the regional focus  of  our  investments.  Luxembourg being a small country in size has limited deal flow so the Greater Region (bordering regions of Belgium Germany and France) accessible in a short drive is where many of us feel most comfortable to invest. Is angel investment in Luxembourg taking any direct or indirect advantage of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading financial centre? Luxembourg  has  multiple  tax  efficient investment structures. However this only applies to more \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccommitted\\xe2\\x80\\x9d investors who are those actually setting up these holding structures. If you are an individual doing investments without such structures you expose  yourself  to  being  taxed  on  your income tax as Luxembourg doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have any kind of special regime for business angels today. This is something we lose against other countries which have created adequate regimes for angel investments knowing the specificities  high risk & high economic impact and is something we need to continue working on with the authorities. What is your experience with Luxembourg based Venture Capital/ Private Equity investors?We keep close contact with early stage VCs although recognising we live in different  leagues.  As  I  mentioned  before angels are more local while VCs especially  those  based  in  Luxembourg  are naturally global and many also specialised in certain sectors. This means we are not seeking the same kind of deals and would be hard pressed to find a local VC fitting the sector or the stage of development we\\xe2\\x80\\x99re looking for. This leads us to most often look for VCs abroad which are more aligned with the business needs. I must recognise there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still a gap that we should  try  to  overcome  on  having Luxembourg early stage VCs funds more aligned  with  the  region  businesses\\xe2\\x80\\x99 needs. \\x0c18 I CAPITAL  #6COVER STORYRocket InternetROCKING  THE  FINTECH WORLDFINTECH IS OUT TO REVOLUTIONIZE AND RESHAPE THE FINANCIAL SERVICES INDUSTRY.

Or can fundamental change only be triggered by the outside e.g. by startup companies? Spotcap It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s certainly possible but only very few will succeed. Disruptive change needs  a  certain  mindset  and  environment.  Fintech  startups  have  the  great advantage of flexible structures and agility. We don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t need representative prime offices  and  countless  employees  to serve our clients.Zencap Paul Volcker the former chairman  of  the  Federal  Reserve  said  in anger over the financial crisis \\xe2\\x80\\x98The only useful banking innovation was the invention of the ATM.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 We completely agree with  this  statement.  For  a  long  time banks  have  been  stuck  in  complex restructuring processes which they fail to manage well. Fundamental shift cannot  be  triggered  from  the  inside.  You need people who think about financial services from a different angle who recognize  that  innovative  technology  and Big Data are crucial to drive disruptive change.The FinTech sector is much lighter regulated than the banking industry. Looking at tendencies such as the Bitcoin regulation  what is your opinion on the potential impact of an increased regulation to the FinTech industry?

Spotcap I don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t believe in the existence of  one  preferred  exit  route.  There\\xe2\\x80\\x99s always  a  whole  spectrum  of  exit opportunities. Paymill To my mind it would be coopetition the innovative ideas of startups combined  with  experience  workforce and resources of incumbent players. It all depends on the size of the company.

As an entrepreneur  what are the Top 3 picks that could make you decide where to set up your next venture? Zencap  In  order  to  set  up  a  FinTech venture you need to consider the regulatory  environment  of  a  country.  The competitive landscape is also an important  criterion.  For  example  although other  online  lending  platforms  have launched before us Zencap was the first one only focusing on SMEs in Germany. Another factor is rather an emotional factor than a hard fact. We decided to set up Zencap in Berlin because the city is a melting pot of different cultures and a great place to live. We benefit from the diversity  of  our  employees  every  day and Berlin attracts an incredible inflow of highly talented people from around the world. Paymill Important is the access to people  and  resources  similar  to  what  we see in London or Munich. Living costs also  play  a  critical  role.  That\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  where Berlin has few peers in Europe offering a mixture of infrastructure as well as an attractive cost of living. Last but not least is  the  regulatory  environment  in  the country.

At Spotcap part of our mission is to show that the financial sector can keep up with times and reinvent itself. My second wish would be for the faster acceptance of fintech companies  by  traditional  lending  institutions. Technological progress will continue to transform the financial sector. I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m certain that collaboration between fintech companies  and  traditional  financial  institutions  will  give  this  transformation  an additional boost and be mutually beneficial for both parties.

While the PE market had been growing constantly for over a decade the years following the banking crisis brought  a  major  setback  which  can  be claimed to be over now. The first 6 months of 2013 showed even worse figures compared to 2012 in terms of volume of total PE investments number and volume of deals. But since the second half of 2013 both exit and investment environment have considerably improved.PRIVATE EQUITY FUNDS For  example  the  number  of  PE  investments in Q1 2014 were already twice as high  as  in  Q1  2013.  Fundraising  also improved during that year; in total 2014 saw \\xe2\\x82\\xac4800 million being raised. A driving force in particular was the publicsector fund  of  fund  FondICO  Global  which started to share out its \\xe2\\x82\\xac450 million to a number of funds such as Corpfin Diana Espiga  Magnum  Oquendo  PAI Portobello Suma and Trilantic. This particularity  of  the  Spanish  market  not  only fueled the PE and VC industry in 2014 but is expected to continue to do so in 2015. A mirror of the opportunities available are the \\xe2\\x82\\xac3 billion being invested a figure similar to the years before the banking crisis. The invested capital stands for a plus of 45% via 580 transactions compared to 2013 data. The first half of 2015 saw lower figures with \\xe2\\x82\\xac726m invested a decrease by 41% compared to the same period in 2014. However this is simply due to the lack of any megadeal in the first 6 months. 70% of the invested capital in 2015 went into LBOs and expansion capital in line with Spanish PE tradition. Interesting detail is the origin of the funds invested 52% come from international investors proof of the confidence and attractiveness of the Spanish market. Further  support  comes  from  Ardian Cinven and EQT opening local offices. Another  important  factor  for  PE  and  VC growth in 201415 is the ongoing regeneration of the exit market either via Trade Sales or via IPOs thereby freeing capital that can again be invested in new funds. Figures were already encouraging in 2014 but the first semester 2015 has beaten the record with \\xe2\\x82\\xac1.8 billion exited through 141 deals.PRIVATE DEBT FUNDSWhile macroeconomic conditions continue to show significant improvements and give hope for further growth over the next several years reforms in the banking sector over the past few years have forced banks to  shut  down  or  merge    the  number  of financial institutions decreased from 50 in 2009 to 14 in 2012. This consolidation and the deleveraging process has led to less product coverage and diminished lending to local businesses. But the sector restructuration process also leads to a number of opportunistic situations to acquire loans and assets from forced sellers. Therefore still more than in other countries private debt  funds  have  found  their  niche  to finance  growth  or  restructuration  of  the SME market in particular. Also at least in the near future there remains significant scope for private debt funds to provide financing  and  other  specialized  credit solutions \\xe2\\x80\\x93 at the same time servicing the SME market and injecting much needed liquidity.  Some  believe  that  the  Iberian market currently constitutes the most compelling  jurisdiction  in  Europe  for  SME credit  investing.  These  conditions  are underpinned by specific structural adjustments and a massive overhaul of the financial  sector  creating  a  distinctive opportunity for specialized credit investments in the region.THE VENTURE CAPITAL MARKETNot only private debt but also the venture capital  market  is  attracting  investors   although Spain has traditionally been a PE market  investing  in  buyouts  and  leveraged firms. Since 2014 again public institutions that provide credits international VC funds as well as other players such as business angels acceleratorsincubators and other sources like crowdfunding platforms  are  boosting  the  VC  industry  in Spain. 14 VC funds were active in 2014 an amazingly high number compared to 5 on average over the past years. Spanish startups are on the radar of national and international VC funds. Here again FondICO Global  provided  financing  to  private  VC funds in 2014 so those could close their fundraising and start investing. Overall this lead to an increase by 26% in 2014 in available  capital  to  VCbacked  firms  though less deals in total numbers were closed. A  shift  towards  latestage  VC  was  also recorded at the detriment of startups and other earlystage investments. Interesting as  well  that  almost  8%  of  all  financing received by Spanish PE and VC houses was  provided  by  US  investors  a  figure reached in 2006 for the last time.FUND VEHICLESWhile the largest funds in the country are still domiciled abroad there is a move from offshore jurisdictions to onshore and a clear tendency towards Spanish registered funds. The market especially institutional international investors are not yet used to Spanish AIF Managers (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAIFM\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) but there is an increasing number of Spanish Risk Capital  Companies  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cSociedades  de CapitalRiesgo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  or  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSCR\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)  managed  by local AIFMs. The move from offshore to onshore is triggered by a) compliance/regulatory  requirements  that  make  offshore  vehicles  more  difficult  and  2)  tax measures  such  as  BEPS  on  an  international  basis  and  locally  changes  in  the Spanish  tax  treatment  under  which  the conditions for the SCR are regulated and advantageous  for  local  structures  as  a general  rule  capital  gains  derived  from transfer of shares in portfolio companies are 99% taxexempted.By Anja Grenner Private Equity & Real Estate Leader at SGG S.A.\\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 23REGULATORYGL\\xc2\\xa9REGULATORY AND TAX  HOW LUXEMBOURG  ALLOWS U.S. MANAGERS TO KILL TWO BIRDS WITH ONE STONEU.S. MANAGERS TAPPING OR INVESTING INTO EUROPEAN MARKETS HAVE LONG BEEN USED TO LUXEMBOURG. IN THE CONTEXT OF THE IMPLEMENTATION OF THE ALTERNATIVE INVESTMENT FUND MANAGERS DIRECTIVE (THE AIFM DIRECTIVE) IN 2013 AND THE PROGRESS IN THE BASE EROSION AND PROFIT SHIFTING (BEPS) OECD INITIATIVE LUXEMBOURG OFFERS THE POSSIBILITY TO SOLVE TWO ISSUES IN ONE STRIKE.USE OF LUXEMBOURG MARKET PARTICIPANTS FOR AIFMD PURPOSESDuring phase 1 of the AIFMD only EEAauthorised Alternative Investment Fund Managers  (AIFMs)  marketing  EEAbased  Alternative  Investment  Funds (AIFs)  have  the  ability  to  market  those funds across the EEA on the basis of a European passport. Non EEA managers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 such as US managers \\xe2\\x80\\x93 are left to rely on a few options such as only relying on reverse solicitation (which is hardly a strategy) relying on private placement rules (for as \\x0c24 I CAPITAL  #6REGULATORYlong  as  they  exist)  or  settingup shop in the EEA (or upgrading their current presence) to obtain an AIFM licence.Obtaining  and  maintaining  an  AIFM licence requires a high level of compliance and substance adequate human capital  technical  systems  organizational  policies  and  share  capital  are required.  Antiabuse  provisions  also prohibit  the  AIFM  from  delegating  the performance of investment management functions (that is risk management and portfolio management) to an extent that exceeds  by  a  substantial  margin  the investment management functions performed by the AIFM itself. Based on more than 25 years of experience in the UCITS world Luxembourg market participants have developed further  alternatives  for  US  managers  the use of platforms and renting of AIFMs.Platforms and \\xe2\\x80\\x9crent an AIFM\\xe2\\x80\\x9d solutions are  conceptually  similar;  as  in  both instances the US manager will partner with  an  established  structure  so  as  to allow him to have an EEAbased AIF with an EEAbased AIFM hence accessing the  passport.  PE  market  participants tend to favour the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crent an AIFM\\xe2\\x80\\x9d solution over the platform. Numerous Luxembourgbased AIFMs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a number of which are LPEA members \\xe2\\x80\\x93  are  now  assisting  US  managers  to comply with AIFMD regulatory requirements to access the passport. Control related concerns of the US manager are typically dealt with by (i) having an appropriate framework agreement in place with the Luxembourg AIFM (ii) the ability  of  the  AIF  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  which  remains  ultimately controlled by the US manager \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to terminate the AIFM appointment and appoint another AIFM and (iii) a putin favour  of  the  US  manager  over  any equity  interest  which  the  Luxembourg AIFM would have in the AIF.LUXEMBOURG PARTNERSHIPIn view of the AIF the Luxembourg legislator took the opportunity of the implementation of the AIFMD into Luxembourg law the Luxembourg partnership regime.Now Luxembourg Limited Partnerships are organised operated and capitalised in  much  the  same  manner  as  partnerto  completely revamp LPEA roadshow in New York City held on June 2nd 2015.ships in major AngloSaxon jurisdictions. The legislator added further benefits (a) the extent to which there is a separate legal  existence  (or  not)  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  indeed Luxembourg has a common limited partnership (soci\\xc3\\xa9t\\xc3\\xa9 en commandite simple  SCS) which has a legal personality and a special limited partnership (soci\\xc3\\xa9t\\xc3\\xa9 en commandite  sp\\xc3\\xa9ciale    SCSp)  which does not have legal personality and (b) the  management  of  the  Partnership  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Luxembourg  introduced  express  safe harbour  provisions  for  LP  involvement and  the  possibility  to  have  managers managing the partnership without incurring unlimited liability. According to market participants those are very helpful additional features. Further  changes  are  ahead  with  the Luxembourg legislator currently working on the introduction of a new Restricted Investment Fund regime. The proposed regime would add a further type of fund not regulated by the CSSF provided that it  is  managed  by  an  authorised  EEAbased AIFM with a legal regime close to that of the Specialized Investment Fund (SIF).  The  current  proposal  contem\\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 25\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe importance of economic substance  for holding companies  can only be heightened.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dtain actions of the BEPS action plan. As an illustration action five aims notably at aligning taxation with the substance of transactions. Similarly the BEPS action plan identified treaty shopping as one of the main issues and action six proposes to  amend the  OECD  Model  Tax Convention to include amongst others strong limitationonbenefits provisions and general antiabuse rules. The importance of economic substance for holding companies can only be heightened.CONCLUSION Ultimately the substance requirements imposed from a regulatory perspective are very beneficial for tax purposes and indeed tax and regulatory requirements are converging. Accessing an AIFM in Luxembourg (with a Luxembourg AIF) allows US managers to avail themselves of the AIFMD marketing passport. At the same time the fact that  certain  core  functions  cannot  be delegated  by  the  AIFM  such  that  the AIFM  would  need  to  have  appropriate staff and infrastructure to be able to perform these functions itself significantly decreases the likelihood that foreign tax authorities might successfully challenge the  substance  throughout  the  holding and financing structure beneath the fund level.

Substance  for such companies is becoming a key topic in the current tax environment.

The low interest rate environment that has persisted since then  across  the  developed  world  has added  pressure  as  investors  face  the prospect  of  continued  low  returns  and increased volatility in financial markets. In these circumstances investors are moving  towards  alternative  investments  that stand between risky equities and overvalued  bonds;  and  agricultural  real  assets like farmland can fit very well.Agricultural real assets are linked with the longterm theme of resource scarcity and besides their positive correlation to inflation they can provide a strong cash yield and  offer  low  correlation  to  traditional assets. Managers and investors seem to agree on the prospects of this asset class As  of  June  2015  there  are  almost  280 funds investing exclusively on this space  up from 54 funds in 2005  and with total AuM  over  US$50  billion  according  to funds tracked by Valoral Advisors.Institutional and private investors alike are increasingly allocating capital to the agricultural asset class. For family offices as their portfolios have usually a longterm outlook  they  can  be  best  positioned  in terms of pursuing trends that are likely to persist  for  the  next  ten  years  or  even longer. And besides the economic benefits to their portfolio some family offices find that the agricultural sector offers them the possibility to address socially responsible or impact investments they can generate attractive economic returns and at the  same  time  they  can  do  something positive.SEEDING THE FUTURE OF FARMING FROM LUXEMBOURG TO EUROPE AND BEYONDLuxembourg is well known as the leading European domicile for vehicles investing in international real estate; now the growing interest  in  farming  assets  can  further strengthen the country\\xc2\\xb4s innovative role in real  estate.  There  are  already  several funds  domiciliated  in  the  country  that cover  the  full  spectrum  of  the  food  and agriculture asset class \\xe2\\x80\\x93 from listed equities  and  commodities  through  private equity and trade finance to farmland and forestry.One  of  the  managers  attracted  by  the Luxembourg\\xc2\\xb4s  offering  in  real  estate investment vehicles is Blue Harvest S.A. a  Genevabased  wealth  management company  founded  in  2009  by  Jens Ohnemus. Mr Ohnemus a Danish native with agricultural background and with a large  trajectory  in  banking  and  wealth management decided to invest in the land he  knows  best.  The  company  will  soon launch the Blue Harvest Danish Farmland Fund SCSp seeking to raise capital for the acquisition and sustainable operation of agricultural farms in Denmark with a focus on  crop  and  animal  production.  Mr. Ohnemus explains that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe fund is a first for Denmark and plans to build a portfolio of sustainable producing farms across the country providing investors an opportunity to invest in real tangible assets that \\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 27\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInstitutional and private investors alike are increasingly allocating capital to the agricultural asset class.\\xe2\\x80\\x9doffer a diversified source of income and capital  appreciation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.

The corporate flexibility and tax transparency that this structure provides were among the main attributes that attracted  the  attention  of  Blue  Havest\\xc2\\xb4s management.THE DANISH HEDGEThe fund had a warm reception so far \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Mr. Ohnemus comments that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDenmark is an agricultural nation with more than 60% of its  territory  devoted  to  agriculture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  The country is a net exporter of food a global leader in animal welfare and with best in class  environmental  protection  policies. And with its AAA rating a strong economy a stable parliamentary democracy and ranked first in Europe in ease of doing business the country scores very high in the context of agricultural investments. As Mr. Ohnemus says \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToday Denmark is a top choice for farmland investments in Europe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Whether investors go for developed farms in Europe or for more exotic farms in South America or SubSaharan Africa Luxembourg finance industry can play a key role in channeling resources to invest responsibly in producing increasing supplies of food for a growing population.By Roberto Vit\\xc3\\xb3n founding partner  of Valoral AdvisorsAV\\xc2\\xa9NUMBER OF FUNDS SPECIALIZED IN FOOD & AGRICULTURAL ASSETS  BY TYPE OF ASSET  WORLDWIDE300250200150100500981025425\\xe2\\x80\\x9805255267277277225233422052407144224944745026504782512851528551324858513248588888192371638356616132153328531313014242241871910121531\\xe2\\x80\\x9806\\xe2\\x80\\x9807\\xe2\\x80\\x9808\\xe2\\x80\\x9809\\xe2\\x80\\x9810\\xe2\\x80\\x9811\\xe2\\x80\\x981213141H\\xe2\\x80\\x9815 Farmland       Private equity       Listed equities       Venture capital       Others\\x0c28 I CAPITAL  #6LUXEMBOURGCROSSROADS OF DIVERSITYTHERE ARE SO MANY SLOGANS WE COULD  USE TO BRING OUT LUXEMBOURG\\xe2\\x80\\x99S CHIEF ATTRACTIONS.

The latter aims to translate \\xe2\\x80\\x9cklein aber fein\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a German expression \\xe2\\x80\\x93 which in the context of nation branding speaks volumes about the booster effect coming out of this tiny yet vibrant country. Little Luxembourg is capable of doing big things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 like Apple did once upon a time from a garage. It seems that size is not a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csine qua none\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for  becoming  big;  many  cutting\\xe2\\x80\\x93edge companies  start  small  nowadays.

The challenge is to get \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe\\xe2\\x80\\x9d message which captures the spirit and essence of the  country  in  its  entirety.  It  has  to  be transversal as relevant for tourism as it is for finance and industry. And it has to resonate  with  everyone  Luxembourg residents  as  much  as  Luxembourg nationals \\xe2\\x80\\x93 no easy task.Sadly the results of the recent referendum go against building a coherent message any time soon. What it revealed is a country with several faces each looking in different directions mimicking Janus \\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 29\\xe2\\x80\\x9cLuxembourg has its roots in history boldly stating a desire to remain independent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dGeorge BockRD\\xc2\\xa9Luxembourg  has  its  roots  in  history boldly stating a desire to remain independent.  In  the  present  context  however  this  motto  takes  on  different undertones. Could it subtly hint at resistance to change? The  gap  between  how  Luxembourg  is perceived by the outside business world and its actual way of working is a further stumbling block to a coherent message. Politicians  aspire  to  close  the  existing perception gap and show Luxembourg as a dynamic place to be. Luxembourg has a hardworking international community working like cogs in unison. With the current political momentum it can grow to  be  a  place  where  talents  flourish ideas  spark  and  then  go  live.  So  how best to express this to the outside world?BRIDGING THE GAPS \\xe2\\x80\\x93 MIND THE GAPIn our country of hills and valleys bridges play  an  important  role.  Luxembourg excelled in the past by bridging communities and nations. It is after all the birthplace  of  the  European  Union  and  the country that put \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSchengen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the agreement  to  have  open  borders  in  Europe. Today with the Luxembourg presidency of the Council of the EU our small country is once more at the apex of the political and economic scene trying to solve the Greek  puzzle  together  with  other  EU members and at the same time welcoming with a grateful muted nod the confirmation that hard work has paid off with another triple A rating granted.The  bridge  is  a  symbol  for  the  nation which has built its reputation on being a reliable yet accessible partner. A compelling story built around connections making  things  happen  and  staying  unique. Could this be the key to successful nation branding?Nation Branding is not a simple advertising campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x93 it aims to extract juices about  what the  Grand  Duchy  of Luxembourg  is  best  at  add  innovative elements and create a beautiful waterfall of  emotional  stories  and  compelling images with a meaningful tagline around them. This is a story that the private equity sector could pick up on by adding its unique twist and making the most of what we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve got already. By Georges Bock Managing Partner of KPMG Luxembourgthe god of beginning and transitions. Residents find it easy to rattle off a seemingly endless list of strong points praising a country where they are respected and feel at home. Native Luxembourgers however are slightly more reticent and have relatively low selfesteem when it comes  to  creativity  openmindedness and entrepreneurship. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMir w\\xc3\\xablle bleiwe wat  mir  sinn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  or  \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWe  want  to  remain what  we  are\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  the  national  motto  of \\x0c30 I CAPITAL  #6LIFESTYLEBERNARD MASSARD AND THE WORLD OF SPARKLING WINES\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe always conduct a very strict policy on the quality  of our products.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dAntoine ClasenMB\\xc2\\xa9BernardMassard is Luxembourg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first sparkling wine but also one of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finest still wine producers through its three estates BernardMassard Clos des Rochers and Chateau de Schengen.

Harmony between fruitiness alcohol structure and acidity are important to me. For the rest there is a big part of subjectivity.What do you like most of your job? Variety.

What gives you the right to \\x0c32 I CAPITAL  #6LIFESTYLELuxembourg \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the other facets of the countryWINEGROWING  IN LUXEMBOURGLuxembourg may be a small country but it is not only the financial industry that has created its own brand and reputation worldwide but also the wine industry.  When you visit the 26km along the Moselle river that Luxembourg shares with Germany you will discover numerous wineries producing excellent wines and cremants in a vineyard area that covers 1287 hectares only. Cremants representing an astonishing 15% of the entire wine production are the oenological flagship of Luxembourg which represents the country at any event. But at the same time Luxembourg represents 15 grape varieties to be discovered by wine lovers. Sandwiched between Germany and France Luxembourg has developed its own wine style. On its limestone Keuper and clay marl soils it is the pinot grape varieties that turn out best which is reflected in the main varieties grown apart from the most common one the Rivaner or MuellerThurgau a hybrid bred in the Swiss canton of Thurgau in the 1880 by Mr. Mueller based on Riesling and Madelaine Royal (26%) which has been constantly decreasing in grown quantity the pinot varieties Auxerrois Pinot Gris Blanc and Noir (51% all together) are the most widely represented and are more and more replacing the \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctable wine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d grape variety Rivaner. These are complemented by Riesling (12%) and Elbling (7.5%) the famous grape already cultivated by the Romans in the Moselle valley more than 2000 years ago and a number of more exotic grapes like Gew\\xc3\\xbcrztraminer and Chardonnay (also a Pinot grape).  The main producers of wines in Luxembourg are  its cooperatives which nowadays market their  wines successfully under the single label of Domaines Vinsmoselle encompassing the traditional wineries  of Greiveldange Grevenmacher Remerschen Stadtbredimus and Wellenstein as well as the POLLFABAIRE Cr\\xc3\\xa9mant Development Centre in Wormeldange.With more than 300 winemakers they produce some 60% of all Luxembourg wines while 50 private wine growers represented by its association \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPrivatw\\xc3\\xabnzer\\xe2\\x80\\x9d successfully elaborate and market their own wines. The association and its oenologists have assisted the private growers in boosting both quality and marketing to place their wines not only with the local gastronomy commerce and end consumers but also with international wine importers and restaurants throughout Europe. Winegrowing is still done by hand by the Privatw\\xc3\\xabnzer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 note that only 9 out of the 375 wine growers own and cultivate more than 15 hectares  and these usually around their own estates. The cooperatives however purchase grapes from all around Luxembourg so they cannot only blend wines from different soils and climates but can also produce wines from specific prestigious lots and terroirs. A propos terroir wines Luxembourg was at the forefront when creating the quality label \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCharta Schengen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Being the synonym for a borderless European Union winegrowers on the German Luxembourg and French Moselle may elaborate their best wines to become a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCharta Schengen wine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. From Luxembourg 4 wineries elaborate these label wines from France there are 2 and 1 from Germany. These winegrowers commit to respecting rigorous restrictions in the production process such as the MB\\xc2\\xa9orientation of the vineyard a minimum slope angle defoliation a maximum yield per acre the vinification process and its marketing. Once they have undergone a severe organoleptical exam by an independent jury they can finally market these wines. As with all other Luxembourg wines and cremants around 2/3 of all exports end up in Belgium\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Last but not least Luxembourg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s oenotourism has been developing strongly over the past years apart from annual events such as the opendoor weekends where all wineries are open to the public its wine village events guided tours through the vinyards along the Moselle winetastings the Riesling ralleys and many more invite wine amateurs and lovers to discover Luxembourg\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wineries and vineyards.By Anja GrennerThe author is member of the LPEA at SGG S.A. and runs an own wine business in Luxembourg as a certified sommelier.\\x0cCAPITAL  #6 I 33LPEA IN BRIEFABOUT LPEAThe Luxembourg Private Equity and Venture Capital Association (LPEA) is the representative body of private equity and venture capital professionals in Luxembourg.With over 120 members LPEA plays a leading role in the discussion and development of the investment framework and actively promotes the industry beyond the country\\xc3\\xads borders.Luxembourg disposes of a stable tax regime and is today at the forefront of international PE regulation providing a flexible secure predictable and multilingual jurisdiction to operate in.LPEA provides a dynamic and interactive platform for its members to discuss and exchange information and organises working meetings and networking opportunities on a regular basis.If Luxembourg is your location of choice for private equity LPEA is where you actually become a player!EXECUTIVE COMMITTEEJ\\xc3\\x89R\\xc3\\x94ME WITTAMERPresidentHANSJ\\xc3\\x9cRGEN SCHMITZHonorary PresidentEMANUELA BREROViceChairmanOLIVIER COEKELBERGSViceChairmanPAUL JUNCKManaging DirectorGILLES DUSEMONTechnical Committee LeaderPATRICK MISCHOSecretaryANTOINE CLAUZELMemberCHRISTOPH LANZMemberTECHNICAL COMMITTEE LEADERSTax Committee Marianne Spanos Patrick MischoPromotion Committee St\\xc3\\xa9phanie Delperdange Alexandre ProstGargozLegal Committee Marie AmetHermes Xavier Le SourneAccounting & Valuation Committee David Harrison Yves CourtoisMarket Intelligence & Training Committee Maarten Verjans\\x0c34 I CAPITAL  #6EVENT\\xe2\\x80\\x99S CALENDARMULTIPLE DATESSEPDEC 2015LUXEMBOURGHow to Start A Startup2124SEPTEMBER 2015BEIJING SHANGHAI SHENZHENLFF Mission to China28SEPTEMBER 2015PARISLPEA Roadshow16OCTOBER 2015AMSTERDAMPE Conference BENELUXDECEMBER 2015MUNICHLPEA RoadshowRD\\xc2\\xa920OCTOBER 201522OCTOBER 201513NOVEMBER 2015PARISLFF Mission to ParisBERLINEVCA VC ForumNEW YORKLPEA Roadshow15DECEMBER 20151920JANUARY 20164FEBRUARY 2016LUXEMBOURGWarranties and Indemnities Insurance ConferenceLUXEMBOURGEuropean Alternative Investment Fund ConferenceZURICHInvestment Funds Conference LPEA Roadshow2326FEBRUARY 2016BERLINSuper Return International1617MARCH 2016GENEVAEVCA Investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ForumAPRIL 2016NEW YORKLPEA Roadshow\\x0cNeed help with fund formation?
