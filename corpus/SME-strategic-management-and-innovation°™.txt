It is  an  exploratory  research  with  an extensive literature  review and knowledge development.   The phenomenon of SME innovation has captured the  interest of many scholars  there is a growing consensus that innovation system approach are  important for fostering innovation in developing as much as developed countries. This paper is  trying to make a valuable contribution to current thinking which fills the blank of contemporary  scholars’ topic. The objective of this study is to obtain a deep insight into innovation trajectory  in Finnish  companies  and  in  comparison  with  Chinese  companies(cid 712)  focusing  on the major  similarities  and  differences  across  the  regional  areas.  The  study  attempts  to  examine  the  critical  driving  forces  of  innovation  and  to  analyze  different  innovation  patterns  based  on  theoretical and empirical  studies. It provides a conceptual framework to describe innovation  activities  on  the  background  of  countryspecific   especially  identifying  various  factors  determinant the innovativeness of SMEs. The project targets the experience gain from a pilot  research   which  is  carried  out  in  cooperation  with  other  researchers  in  the  Department  of  Management Studies at the University of Tampere  also close collaboration with professors at  Fudan  University.  The  findings  would  help  managers  and  policy  makers  to  better  foster  innovation and researchers to better channel their efforts in studying the phenomenon. Prior to  empirical  studies   this  study  was  started  by  theoretical  studies  and  collecting  available  statistical database.    Key  words     SME  Strategic  Management  Innovation  System  Comparative  study  Finland  China    1. Introduction  Innovation  is regarded  as  one  of  the  most  critical  factors for  success  in  a rapidly  changing  market.  In  an  overview  of  the  study  of  innovative  strategy  management   there  is  a  new  tendency of growing interest in business strategy in which more and more scholars start by  examining some of the assumptions underlying the current innovation strategic management  domains. As we know  strategy influences on company’s performance  growth  profitability and  market  share  (Gellatly  1999   Baldwin  1994)   thereby  increasing  the  awareness  of  the  innovation strategy research.  In general  innovation can be defined as the transition from a  novel idea to a successful product in the market. By far  strategic innovation is regarded as the  most important factor that has relative impact on a firm’s sustainable competitive advantage.    1    Many  enterprises  are  facing  a  number  of  typical  problems  with  regard  to  their  innovation  process.  “Innovation is not flash of  genius   it is hard work.”1  Quinn (2002   P.13)  states that  “true innovation is complex and tumultuous full of spurts  frustrations and sudden insights”. In  economics  terms   strategic  innovation  management  shifts  from  a  static  to  a  dynamic  perspective. Innovation is usually conceptualized in terms of ideas  learning  and the creation  of knowledge. In other words  innovation is the implementation of new ideas in an attempt to  create  value   therefore  creating  new  customer  expectations   setting  new  standards   and  making  possible  new  satisfactions.  Innovation  as  a  subject  that  all  companies  should  be  focused  on   regardless  of  their  size  and  industry  they  are  involved  in.  By  implementing  dynamic  innovation  strategies   a firm  has  the  ability to  enhance  its activities in  pursuit  of  a  more complex and advantageous strategy configuration. SME must respond by adopting more  innovativeness to establish or sustain competitive advantage in the market place (Mosy et al   2002). This research also reflects a theorydevelopment process. It is often argued that SMEs  innovate in a different way to larger firms. The innovative advantages of large firms are in terms  of  material  or  resource  factors   while  small  firms  are  attributed  with  behavioral  advantages  (Rothwell  1985).  However   the  region  or  immediate  local  environment is more  important  to  SMEs than to large firms (Asheim  2002; Tödtling  2002).    1.1 Purpose and Scope of the research   The  ambition  of   this  scientific  research  is  to  cross  theoretical  boundaries  and  to  reconceptualize the study field. In order to create research  my task is to develop a theory of  Integrative Innovation Management  combined with market  organizational and technological  changes.  An  additional  aim  of  the  study  is  to  analyze  a  set  of  strategic  models  for  strengthening  the  innovation  knowledge  in  action.    This  paper  will  follow  the  line  of  a  comparative analysis  exploring the underlying determinants of  SMEs innovation disparity at  the  national  /regional  and  firm  level.  This  pilot  study  will  increase  the  understanding  and  knowledge of the integrated approach and to develop new business innovative patterns.    1.2 Problem formulation   This  study  targets  innovation  strategy  management  problems  and  focuses on  a  number  of  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  attempts  to  investigate  underlying  innovation factors in two specific countries. Unlike large firms  small firms’ innovativeness is  strongly  influenced  by  the  national  or  regional  systems  of  innovation  in  which  they  are  embedded. The investigation is related to a cluster of distinct features between Finnish SME  and  Chinese  SME.  The  academic  theme  is  based  on  describing  and  interpreting  the  phenomenon of  innovative SMEs in real. Why  did they  innovate? What types of  innovation  were they involved in?   How those innovation activities affect the operational performance of  firms? And which sorts of determining factors are significant for SME in efficiency of innovation?  Moreover  a comparative framework of growthorientation and propensities toward innovation    1  Peter Drucker    2    between two geographic enterprises will be illustrated.    2. The definition of SME   The definition of  SME varies from countries to countries and in different size ranges (Peres  and  Stumpo   2000).  Employee  numbers  are  not  the  sole  defining  criterion.  In  European  legislation  the upper limit of a SME is 250 employees and financial assets are also used to  define  SMEs.  This  definition  has been  widely  applied throughout  the  European  Union  (see  website links2).   In Finland  a small and mediumsized enterprise is defined as a firm with less  than 250 employees and either an annual turnover of maximum € 40 million or a balance sheet  total of maximum € 27 million. Businesses larger than this may not own more than 25% of the  capital of an SME. A small business is defined as a firm with less than 50 employees and either  an annual turnover of maximum € 7 million or a balance sheet total of maximum € 5 million.  Businesses larger than this may not own more than 25% of the capital of a small business. 3  In  contrast   according  to  the  Chinese  latest  law  on  promotion  of  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises   manufacturing  SMEs  are those  with fewer  than 2000  employees   or  an  annual  turnover of less than or equal to RMB Yuan 300 million   or total assets of less than or equal to  RMB Yuan 400 million. In this study  I will limit the size of the sample of Chinese firms to less  than 500 employees.    3. Theoretical background and literature review  3.1 What is innovation?  First  of  all   the  conceptual  background  of  innovation  should  be  described.  The  concept  “innovation” can be explained in many ways. Innovation is often associated with concepts of  change   invention   creative  behavior  and  adaptation  (Pierce  and  Delbecq  1977).  Nord  and  Tucker (1987  p. 6) defined innovation as a “technology  strategy  or management practice that  a firm is using for the first time  whether or not other organizations or users have previously  adopted it  or as a significant  restructuring or improvements in a process”.  New technology  always needs new markets which were not even conceivable until the new technology created  new demands.4  In this context  innovation can be defined as attempts “to create competitive  advantage by perceiving or discovering new and improved ways of competing in an industry  and bringing them to market” (Porter  1990  p45). Moreover  the concept of innovation refers  ‘the  transformation  of  an  idea  into  a  marketable  product  or  service   a  new  or  improved  manufacturing  or  distribution  process   or  a  new  method  of  social  service’  (European  Commission   1995   4).    Schumpeter  classifies five  categories  of  innovation   new  products   new methods of production  new source of supply  the exploitation of new markets  and new  ways to organize business.    2 http //ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/factsfiguresanalysis/smedefinition/index_en.htm  3 http //www.expatfinland.com/entrepreneurship/development_and_finance.html  4  Drucker 1969  pp. 52–53.    3    Freeman and Perez (1998) categorized two types of innovations based on the characters of  degree.  There  are  incremental  innovations  and  radical  innovations.  Christensen  (2003)  distinguishes  as  “disruptive innovations”  and  “sustaining  innovations”.  Radical  innovation  in  which both the technology and the market are new and customer needs are  unknown;  and  incremental  innovation  is  consisting  of  the  improved  use  of  existing  technologies  to  meet  known customer needs (Henderson  and Clark  1990). Radical innovations refer to significant  change  that  simultaneously  affects  both  the  business  model  and  the  technology  of  the  company  pathbreaking  discontinuous and pioneering. Incremental innovations refer to small  but useful improvements. Incremental innovation is the most prevalent style of innovation.    Concepts  of  innovation  have  been  changed  greatly  in  recent  years.  The  dimension  of  innovation  appears  complex  and  broadly   and  it  can  be  understood  from  a  linear  process  towards  an  interactive  dynamic  process  (Kline  and  Rosenberg   1986;  Dosi   1998;  Malecki   1997). The different explanation of innovation is based on three common elements  1) Change  or doing things in a different way; 2) Newness that is mostly related to the technical approach  and  3) Performance  improvement that  links  to  economic  achievement  (Jorna  &  Waalkens   2006). Four innovation dimensions will be applied to classify the innovation behaviors of SME.  These four aspects of  innovation performance are the number of innovations   the speed of  innovation  the level of innovativeness (novelty  newness) and the level of aggressiveness in  adopting or generating innovation. 5    Innovation  has  been  identified  as  a  powerful  way  for  attaining  and  sustaining  competitive  advantage. Nowadays  it is becoming a more complex  interactive  and dynamic context what  is  commonly  labeled  as  the  system  of  innovation  (Edquist   1997).  Innovationbased  competitive  strategy  emphasizes  on  the  creative  improvement  of  appealing  new  products   processes  or  services   or  in the  crafting  of  efficient  new business  models  or  organizational  innovation.  Furthermore   the  strategic  innovation  process  should  be  adopted  for  better  management  and  more  access  to  resources  in  order  to  compete  and  survive.  It  is  a  valuecreating activity which determines to what extent actual change and performance match  to desired change and performance.    Innovation is seen as a process of interaction between firms and their external environments.  This  external  environment  has  usually  been  dimensioned  in  terms  of  national  or  regional  ‘systems  of  innovation’.  Therefore   we  should  understand  in  the  context  of  the  innovation  system.  Dosi(1988b)   Lundvall(1988)  and  Thomas  (1985)  note  that  innovation  may  have  a  strong geographic dimension due to the specific and cumulative nature of knowledgebased  innovative inputs. Firmlevel innovation occurs in the context of an ‘innovation system’. In other  words  SMEs innovation is embedded in a regional or national innovation system. The national    5  FirmsDaniel  I.  Prajogo   “The  Relationship  between  Innovation  and  Business  Performance—A  Comparative Study between Manufacturing and Service” P220    4    theory  highlights     three  perspectives   1)    innovation  system   in  a  socialeconomic  circumstance; 2)  Interactions  among  actors (universities   technological  institutes  consulting companies  suppliers and even competitors); 3) knowledge learning and  diffusion. Camagni and Capello (2000) found that within an innovative local milieu interSME  links  provide  channels for  knowledge  acquisition   uncertainty  reduction   and local  collective  learning.    innovation     firms     3.2 Strengthening the knowledge of systematic innovation  Keizer et al. (2002) note the factors that having effect on innovation can be divided into internal  and  external.  The  innovation  factors  between  firmlevel  and  the  external  environment  represent the important focus in this research. I am interested in critical factors that relevant to  success or failure in  SME innovation (in Figure 1). Internal variables refer to characteristics  and  strategies  of  SMEs  and  external  variables  refer  to  environment  impact  on  SMEs’  innovation  activities.  Internal  factors  are  determined  by  SMEs’  specific  resources  and  technology  competencies   innovation  strategies  and  entrepreneurship.    Resource  and  capabilities  play  major  roles  in  establishing  special  competitiveness.  To  build  a  set  of  technological  competences  and  capabilities  based  on  resources   firms  enable  to  create  distinctive  areas  of  competitive  advantage.  Strategy  indicates  innovativeness  among  of  commercialization  and  marketing  effort   the  degree  of  marketing  involvement  in  product  planning and firm competence in the area of technology strategy and technology management  (Hoffman  et  al.   1998).  New  innovation  knowledge  development  should  adopt  a  variety  of  strategies and make sure which strategic options can be optimally matched. Entrepreneurship  is SME owners or leaders’ attitudes  vision and decisions toward innovation activities. On the  other hand  the external environment in which a firm involved that conducts its business and  also  influences  its  innovative  capability  (King  and  Anderson   1995).  Concerning  external  factors  there are Market scope  firm’s regional technology infrastructure  networking (suppliers   customers   etc)  and  government  policy.  Market  growth  is  very  significant  in  fostering  innovativeness. It means firms operating in fastgrowing markets are more likely to innovate.  The  market  spurs  firms  to  innovate  through  competition.  Governmental  support  is  another  important element for SMEs’ innovation. Government through regulation can both encourage  and discourage the adoption of innovation (Tornatzky and Fleischer  1990; Lai et al.  2005).  The traits of SME innovation are associated with internal factors and external factors. In other  words  the strategies of SME innovation need to be conceived in relation to the firm  sector  and countryspecific advantages and disadvantages in the different parts.   Building a dynamic  strategy  framework   setting  up  various  innovational  strategy  models   and  evaluating  the  interaction  of  strategic  factors  are  based  on  the  total  business  performance  analysis  that  includes assessment of current markets  products  and management processes.    5    Regional innovation system    External Factors  Market  scope  and  development  of  demand  Firm’s region  Networking  Government and public policies  Finance resource  Surrounding culture    Innovation patterns  Innovation strategies    Internal Factors  Firm’s market position  Firm’s resources and core capabilities  Firm’s innovation strategies  Entrepreneurship    Firm level innovation    Figure 1  the framework of strategic innovation (Determinants of a firm's innovation behavior     internal and external factors  Source  Zheng Huang)    4. Research Methodology  The  research  methodology  draws  on  the  concepts  of  the  research  wheel  (Wallace   1971).  Methodology is an important scientific way in creating knowledge. Methodology is defined as a  method or technique approach that is to be applied in the conducting of research. The most  useful  of  three  scientific  research  methods  in  the  business  area  were  defined  by  Arbnor  &Bjerke in  1997.  They  introduced  three  different  methodological  approaches  for  generating  business knowledge which are analytical approach  systems approach and actors approach.  Each of these is based on different assumptions about their subject areas and different valid  processes of knowledge creation. Systems research methodology will be chosen because the  systems  thinking  create  a  better  understanding  of  the  big  picture  of  phenomena.  Systems  approach is a proven methodology to view how specific elements can be combined to create a  whole that is greater than the sum of the individual parts or functions. In the systems approach   reality is viewed as a social construction formed by systems.    4.1 Research method and Data sources   The  goal  of  this  paper  is to  discover  which factors  contribute to  SME  innovation.  The core  research topic concerning the importance factors of firmlevel and nationallevel determinant of  innovation activity is addressed through a comparative analysis of two countries. To effectively  conduct  crossregional  studies  in  this  project   I  should  take  into  account  of  crossregional    6    comparability  establishing data/case equivalence (Reynolds  Simintiras  and Diamantopoulos  2003).    My  research  approach  is  consistent  with  the  basic  assumptions  and  definitions  of  crossregional  research.  At  this  stage   Secondary  data  are  utilized  in  the  comparison  of  different types of innovation patterns where demonstrated in this paper. OECD (Organization  for Economic CoOperation and Development) Statistics reports provide one of the important  resources for international comparison of innovative output at country level.    The  analysis is mainly  based  on  data from  “Statistical  Finland”   “OECD  SMEs  reports”  and  other relevant research articles from various academic journals  etc. I try to draw some general  conclusions in this paper. Analyze the extent to which structural differences between the two  innovation systems can be explained by underlying characteristics in a framework. Empirical  research  will  be  conducted  later  by  further  investigation  which  applying  case  studies.  This  research  represents  a  “systems  innovation  management”   argues  that  an  appropriate  innovation strategy will usually depend on the specific circumstances and situations.    5. The analysis of SME innovation in Finland and China   Comparative  analysis  shows  significant  differences  of  national  innovation  system  across  countries  (Nelson   1993;  OECD   2002a).  My  discussion  addresses  SME  from  the  national  innovation  system  to  the  business  strategies  in  relevant  to  innovative  management.  I  developed  a  conceptual  framework  to  highlight  the  key  differences  in  genetic  innovation  patterns between Finnish and Chinese SMEs. It maps out the generic strategies in national  innovation  systems  as  well  as  the  linkages  to  the  innovative  performance  of  firms  in  two  countries. The following propositions are stated in the table 1   Comparative differences in innovation strategies    type of  innovation  innovation  pattern    innovation field  technological  infrastructure  Venture capital in  innovation  innovation  behavior  scope of  innovation  innovation  situation    other factors    Finland    Technological creating    China    Technology adaptation and  adoption    exploration    ICTrelated  industries or service sectors  manufacturing sectors    exploitation    good    funding    organized  Muticompany innovation  networks    growing    nonfunding  Individual  passive  adaptive and  flexibly  Supply Chain Cluster or regional  district ( larger contiguous region)    lack of Entrepreneurship  innovationsupport policy;  supporting organization    lack of organizing and supporting  competition environment  High  growing domestic market    7    Table 1  propositions (source  ZhengHuang)    From this comparative table  we can see two different regional innovation system models that  involve a verity of firm strategies  innovation network structures  and state intervention roles.    in  knowledgeintensive     Most  of  Finnish  SMEs  are  engaged   in  hightechnology or service sector  where concentrate on product or service innovation  such as  “sciencedriven”  or  “technologydriven”  innovations  (Hassink   1996).  Compared  to  Finland   China  is  a  laterindustrializing  country.  Chinese  SMEs  are  primarily  involved  in  the  laborintensive  or  resourceintensive  manufactories   focusing  more  on  process  innovations  and cost reduction. Many of them  are steered by inexperienced owners and managers  and  operate with relatively low capital intensity and simple technology.    industries   mainly     China’s economic growth has received world’s attention recently.  China moves from central  planning toward a more marketdriven economy since 1979. The development of China’s SME  is fueled by a high pace of market growth and economy booming. On the other hand  China’s  SMEs provide the main sources of rapid and sustainable economic growth (Yeung  2004) and  job creation  especially in the private sector (Li   2004).  By the end of June 2009  China has  9978.8  thousand  enterprises   increasing  264.2  thousand  than  last  year   It  has  30636.3  thousand individual holders and small enterprises  the growth 5.01% than last year (P.R.net   July 31  2009). Small and mediumsized enterprises occupy the 99% of the total enterprises  number; enterprises accounted for 60% of contribution to GDP  50% of the tax and provide 80%  of jobs. SMEs are also changed from  scattered operations to concentrated operations  from  the early developing in the domestic market mainly to both of the domestic and international  markets.6  Chen (2006) identifies three major economic development stages of China’s SMEs.  The first  phase  (19781992)  that  was  characterized  by  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  Chinese  SME sector after reforming and opening up to the world  private economy and different sorts of  ownerships were highly encouraged during that period. The second stage (19922002) was a  reform  of  stateowned  SMEs  in  restructuring   merger  and  acquisition.  Chinese  SMEs  was  getting rapid growing after 1992  Chinese government emphasized on improving the overall  quality and competitiveness of  the domestic SME sector (Chen  2006). The third stage was  from  2002  it refers to setup government law and supporting policies aimed at consolidating  and  further  fostering  the  expending  Chinese  SME  sector.  The  promotion  of  scientific  and  technological innovation and upgrading has been regarded as one of the most important tasks.  Since  then   China’s  SMEs  innovative  capabilities  and  research  output  have  been  growing  dramatically.  Many  areas  were  opened  up  for  bottomup  innovation  and  entrepreneurship.  China is moving successfully from imitation to innovation. In addition  Chinese government has  chosen clusterbased SMEs innovation policies. National clusters and incubators  which were    6  ZHOU  Jun   GUO  Tuxin   LU  Shan   “SME  law and  policy analysis”  Journal  of  USChina  Public  Administration  May.  2010  Volume 7  No.5 (Serial No.55)    8    established  by  the central  government  and local  governments   provide diverse  supports  for  spinoffs and hightechnology startups.  By  2008   China has established over 200 business  enterprise  incubators   53  hightech  development  zones   over  62  university  scientific  and  technological parks  over 20 enterprise parks for returned overseas students  over 40 service  centers for SMEs’ technology innovation  and more than 500 productivity promotion centers.7  China's expenditures on scientific and technical activities and R&D of GDP have continually  arisen year by year from 1994 to 2007 (see appendix I). Although those measured figures are  still lower than the  world average (1.6 percent) and developed countries (2.2 percent) (see  appendix II).    As for opening innovation milieu  Finnish innovation system is encompassing the support and  conduct  of  R&D  and  innovation   technology  diffusion  where  embedded  in  networking  governance  structures.  It  is  becoming  more  involved  in  international  scientific  cooperation  compared  to China  (see appendix  III). Nearly onethird collaboration innovation projects are  carried  out  with  international  partners.8  Finland  has  a  welldeveloped  system  of  innovation  with R&D intensive cluster. From the late 1980s  nationwide networks of technology parks and  centers  of  expertise  were  set  up  in  Finland.  The  technology  parks  have  initiated  spinoff  projects  and  incubators.9  Finland  has  the  good  technology  infrastructure  in  shaping  their  innovativeness and has accumulated a plenty of experiences. A systemic supporting scheme  of  SMEs  innovation  activities  and  entrepreneurship  is  applied  as  part  of  broad  national  innovation  strategies   aim  at  promoting innovation  and  strengthening  SMEs’ prosperity.  For  instance   regional  industryacademiagovernment  cooperation  projects   it  assists  SME  in  collecting  innovationrelated  information  and  working  on  cooperative  innovation  projects.  Through supplying external risk capital  the projects not only encourage SMEs’ willing  but also  enable them to take the risks of technology innovation. These efforts are focused on helping  SMEs  become  more  innovative   more  qualityconscious  and  more  efficient.  In  China   innovation governance system for SME is still  at  a nascent  stage. The Innovation Fund for  TechnologyBased Firms was established by the Chinese central government in 1999. Policy  makers in China began to setup the task of  crafting regulations to support  SME innovation  since  2003.  National  innovation  system  is  not functioning  well  enough   and  the  supporting  innovation  service  is  still  in  an  early  stage.  The  institutions’  services  for  technological  innovation in China are mainly concentrated on large and mediumsized firms. The promotion  of  overall  competitiveness  of  Chinese  SMEs  is  still  challenging  tasks  for  the  Chinese  government.  In  a  recent  study   the  AllChina  Federation  of  Industry  and  Commerce  (the  Chinese  chamber  of  commerce)  found  “most”  private  enterprises  “not  interested  in”  or    7  Annual report on “Torch Program” of 2003  released by the Torch Hightech industry Development  centre  Ministry of Science and Technology  8  Statistics Finland “Innovation survey 2008 report”  published by 2010  9  G Ö R A N R O O S   L I S A F E R N S T R Ö M A N D O L I V E R G U P T A    (2005)  “NATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS  FINLAND  SWEDEN & AUSTRALIA COMPARED”    9    “unwilling  to  engage  in”  innovation. 10 A  very  small  portion  of  total  Chinese  SMEs  have  entered hightech and high valueadded fields.    to  education  and     training  for  Finnish  government  has  given  increasingly  attention   entrepreneurship   teaching  people  how  to  start  their  own  business  and  willingness  of  risktaking. It aims to stimulate entrepreneurship and new firm startup. In financing of SME  aspect   Finnish  government  also  provides  financial  support  in  knowledgecreating  and  new  ideas of application  offering a range of financial programmes to help entrepreneurs manage  risks  and  raise  innovations.  The purpose of  national policy intervention is to assist SMEs to  enhance their innovative capability  therefore to overcome sizerelated innovation barriers. On  the contrary  Chinese SMEs can not get such benefactions. It is difficult for them to either direct  financing (bonds  IPO) or indirect financing (mainly refers to bank loans). Selffinancing plays  an important source of the financing of the innovation activities of Chinese SMEs.   It is also  widely reported that Chinese SMEs have great difficulties in obtaining bank loan because the  Chinese  banking  system  has  been  designed  for  large  stateowned  enterprises   rather  than  SMEs  particularly privately owned SMEs. The financing problems of SMEs are solved through  connection with friends  family or selffinancing. It is also shown in relevant surveys that 62%  of  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  in  China  regard  difficulties  in  direct  and  indirect  financing. Less than 10% of private enterprises are supported by bank loans and less than 1%  has access to other forms of  external financing. Established by  central government in June  1999   the  Innovation  Fund  for  Small  Technologybased  Firms  (Innofund)  is  a  special  government fund in support of technological innovations for small techbased firms. Venture  capital  scarcity  is  a major  constraint  for  Chinese  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises   thus  hampering  the  development  of  innovation.    Despite  China  implements  tax  system  as  an  instrument to improve SME financing   two kinds of incentives like lowering tax rates and tax  relief   for  instance   including  an  exemption  of  up  to  150  percent  of  R&D  expenditure  from  corporate income tax and the provision of carrying forward any unused amount to offset tax  liabilities up to four years in the future; “hi and newtech firms” be applied 15 percent tax rate  instead  of  the  normal  rate  of  25  percent.  The  sorts  of  tax  incentives  are  not  enough.  The  difficulty in raising funds in China still is a serious bottleneck which restricting the  growth of  SMEs. However  China’s policy makers have realized and attempted to address this issue to  supply  adequate  and  special  finance  for  SMEs.  According  to  recent  empirical  studies   shortage of talent is ranked the secondhighest obstacle to innovation of China’s SME.    Most Chinese SMEs are private owned with weak capacities for technology creation. The level  of technological innovation of SMEs in China is still not high. The mode of innovativeness is  adoption  or  adaptation  that  SMEs’  innovators  are  specialized  in  the  application  of  existing    10  Chunlin Zhang  World Bank  Douglas Zhihua Zeng (2009) “Promoting enterpriseled innovation in  China” William Peter Mako  World Bank Publications  P35    10    these     to  enhance     technologies     in  costreduced  ways     their  technologies   using  of   competitiveness.  The fast  growth of  local market offers a big substantial  space and a  huge  domestic  demand  stimulate  the  development  of  SMEs.  Apparently   laborintensive  and  lowtechnology  industries  are  easy  for  new  private  entrepreneurs  to  set  up.  Moreover   Internationalization and FDI lead to the global knowledge diffusion  technology spillover from  advanced foreign companies that provides as an opportunity to Chinese SMEs to catch up with  the worldleading technologies. However  those sorts of technologies are not latest upgrade  technologies because some foreign companies fear the loss of intellectual property and future  competition from companies that learn the new technologies (Hayter and Han  1998  page 3;  Young and Lan  1997). In addition  China has already demonstrated some success in building  up technological infrastructure and supporting institutions in its HighTech Industry Zones. So  far  Chinese SMEs majorly dependent  on a close integration of the clusters of  supply  chain  partners  which  providing  them  to  access  information   knowhow  and  new  technologies   in  general  potential  local  or  domestic  links  along  and  between  value  chains.  These  is  limited  formal collaboration across firms (or between firms and other organizations) going on locally.  Many  innovative  SMEs  have  extensive  linkages  to  other  organizations  through  industrial  cluster  or  Science  Parks   whereas  networks  are  weak  and  fragmented.  R&D  projects  are  usually conducted inhouse  and seldom collaboration. Even when there is ‘collaboration’  it is  tend  to  partially  shortterm  focus  and  opportunistic  behavior   unwillingness  to  take  risk  or  failure.  Therefore   the collaboration with  universities  and  research  institutes  in  China is  still  lower  than  developed  countries.  In  other  words   the  effective  industryuniversityresearch  cooperation system is still understructure. The innovation capacity of Chinese SME is weak.  Many  SME  owners/managers  lack  of  relevant  skills  and  knowledge  in  making  important  innovation  reform  decisions  and  their  employees  are  low  quality. Many  firms  simply  don’t  know  how  to  plan  for  and  manage  the  innovation  process.  Insufficient  collaboration  and  communication  among  small  and medium  enterprises   the  innovation  strategies  are  largely  relied on their personal ties where contact with external stakeholders for generating ideas for  their strategic decisions. They rely heavily on their formal and informal socialnetworks to gain  information and advice from outside. These networks are based on family connections on the  basis that family members could be trusted.    The  Finnish  national  innovation  system  pursues  a  constant  strategy  in  R&D/technological  accumulation and human resource development. Finnish SME’s innovative strategies are on  the  basis  of  knowledgebased  creating.  Namely   innovation  strongly  evolves  around  the  creation  of  new  knowledge.  Many  of  them  are  innovation  leaders  with  advanced  technical  knowledge  and  patents  within  a  market  niche.  Networks  between  industry  and  science  research  are  fairly  developed  in  Finland.  Innovation  activities  of  SMEs  is  switching  to  customer  and  useroriented   networked  and  open  innovation  ecosystems  which  are  embedded in a global economy. Nevertheless  science and technology researches are carried  out more especially in ICT (information and communication technology) sector that causes the    11    innovation  capabilities   making  their     less diversification of industrial structure. Chinese SME’s innovative strategies vary in medium  and  lowtech  or  manufacturingbased  innovation  development.  The  innovation  model  of  Chinese SME is defined regard as Chainlinked or Supplyoriented models. Only few of them  possess core technologies  due to most of them have limited capabilities to conduct a research.  The local innovation system is often structured by integrating the relationships in supply chains   transition  from  production  to   innovation  process  dependent  on  them.  The  supplerdriven  innovation  from  large  companies  helps  SMEs  on  adopting  advanced  equipment  to  achieve  higher  quality  in  proficient  production  processes   therefore  enhancing  innovative  capacity.    The  buyerdriven  innovation  is  pulled  by  large  costumers that requiring SMEs to improve their products’ quality and technology standards.  These  sorts  of  usersupplier  interactions  within  the  local  cluster  spur  SMEs  to  focus  their  specialties on R&D and innovation. China’s SMEs Innovative activities are yielded by flexible  operation  and  quick  adaptability  to  market  changes.  They  enable  to  enter  new  markets  segments quickly by offering much flexibility to satisfy the requirements of market competition.  However  they are facing to inadequate technology innovation infrastructure. Better absorption  of  available worldwide technological resources and foreign knowlow has become the main  strategy  in  Chinese  SMEs  to  catching  up  with  developed  countries.  China’s  SMEs  pursuit  profitmaximizing and have little incentives to invest in innovation and technological progress.  Their innovation strategy is lack of longrange planning.  Although China’s SMEs have more  pressure  for  innovation  in  order  to  survive  market  competition.  Strong  competition  and  interfirm rivalry thus serves to accelerate innovation (Porter  1990 and 1998; Grabher  2002).  Their natural tendency is to maximize shortterm profit through the expansion of their existing  production capacity and market share as well by controlling costs. Furthermore  Chinese SME  owners/managers  widely  adopt  an  outsidein  approach  in  developing  their  strategies  which  more  highly  adaptable   innovation  commercialization  reduce cost and increase the flexibility.    to  environmental  changes   such  as  shorten     6. Conclusions   The innovative small and middlesize enterprises are considered essential for the development  and  growth  of  nations.  Therefore   facilitating  innovation  in  SMEs  is  central  for  stimulating  economics development at the local  regional and even national levels (Jone and Tilley 2003).  A successful innovation often contents support mechanisms outside the firm  able to provide  specialized  services  and  information  that  can  be  used  to  overcome  innovation  obstacles.  Governments play a fundamental role in determining policies that can affect innovation. Policy  makers should place greater emphasis on creating effective fundamental system  support or  policies to facilitate local  cooperation network  for SMEs  and  establish a stable platform for  cooperation to achieve mutual learning between SMEs and partners.    Obviously  different factors impact on strategic innovation decisions and models with regional  characters. Innovativeness is not only happened in hightech industries alone but also can be    12    achieved in  traditional  lowtech  sectors.  SMEs  in  China  have more  flexibility  in  operations   more easily adapt to changing markets and execute attack quickly in face of competitive. The  success factors of Chinese SMEs lies in the ability to access  transfer  and apply technology.  Finnish SMEs has knowledgebased entrepreneurial competitiveness.    As we have seen  there are many differences in innovation patterns within countryspecific.  But  we  can  also  find  common  factors  as  well.  In  summary   effective integration  innovation  strategy and continuous learning are critical to the survival and success of firms operating in  changing and complex  environments.  This article represents an early research stage of  my  dissertation.    The  future  research will  be  contacted  by  a  qualitative  investigation  which  to  improve the indicators in practice.
