here  in file  The role of crowdfunded debt in early stage     entrepreneurial finance*          Jerry Coakley†     Winifred HuangMeier‡   Daniel Tsvetanov§          This version  January 2017     Abstract     In recent years  crowdfunded debt has become popular among risky and relatively early stage     small  young  and privately held UK firms. This  paper investigates the role of crowdfunded     debt in financing decisions from 2010 to 2015 using a unique dataset of 1 014 private small     firms.  The  results  indicate  that  firms’  debt  ratios  are  sensitive  to  crowdfunded  debt  and  to     firm characteristics like firm size  asset tangibility and debt composition  but less sensitive to     firm  profitability.  The  larger  target  leverage  deviations   the  higher  the  probability  of  firms     issuing  or  having  crowdfunded  debt.  We  find  evidence  that  capital  expansion  plays  an     important role in explaining increases in crowdfunded debt. Our findings provide new insight     into  the  traditional  pecking  order  theory  of  capital  structure  that  crowdfunded  debt  is     considered to be an additional financing source for private firms. They also show that  in line     with the tradeoff theory  UK private firms have a higher proportion of debt to equity due to     the high cost of issuing equity capital.

Since  the  seminal  and  comprehensive  Cosh   Cumming   and     Hughes  (2009)  study  of  the  external  funding  sources  for  UK  privately  held  entrepreneurial     firms  crowdfunding has emerged as a novel source of outside capital.  Crowdfunded debt is     also known as peertopeer (P2P) business lending and it is growing very rapidly in both the     USA  and  UK.  Zhang   Baeck   Ziegler   Bone   and  Garvey  (2016)  provide  a  comprehensive     overview  of  crowdfunding  in  the  UK  and  their  analyses  suggest  that  in  2015  P2P  business     lending  accounted  for  14%  of  the  lending  to  UK  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs).     Although  it  has  been  linked  to  microfinance   credit  unions  and  other  antecedents  in  the     finance arena  the real driver is the meteoric rise of P2P markets such as eBay  Amazon and     Uber that demonstrates the potential draw of electronic marketplaces over the past decade or     so.1 However   crowdfunded  debt  is  a  very  distinctive  and  recent  P2P  market  that   despite     having its own specific characteristics  remains largely underresearched  particularly within     the  context  of  firms’  capital  structure.  This  paper  aims  to  fill  this  gap  in  the  literature  and     sheds new light on a specialist but growing segment of the crowdfunding market.     The paper employs a unique handcollected dataset of 1 014 privately held small firms     that have raised funds on the Funding Circle platform during the 20102015 period. The data     are  linked  with  company  data  from  the  FAME  database  to  create  a  unique  deidentified     crowdfunding  database.  The  paper’s  first  contribution  is  that  its  sheds  new  light  on  a     specialist  area  of  forprofit  crowdfunding  known  as  debt  crowdfunding  or  crowdlending.2     Debt crowdfunding involves investors at large or the crowd funding small firms (and others)                                                        1 In  recent  years  crowdfunding  platforms  have  come  to  provide  two  main  novel  sources  of  outside   entrepreneurial capital for small firms  equity and debt crowdfunding.       2 See Einav  Farronato and Levin (2015) for an overview of P2P markets in general whose focus is mainly on   goods and services.          1     via an internet portal. These investors include financial institutions that can contribute up to     30% of any crowdfunding project on Funding Circle  the main debt crowdfunding platform in     the  UK  and  indeed  in  Europe.  This  part  of  crowdfunded  debt  has  some  parallels  with  non    bank private debt but it is funded via a public internet platform. On Lending Club  the main     US  debt  crowdfunding  platform    the  crowd  has  been  squeezed  out  and  institutions  now     dominate. This crowdfunded private debt market now known as P2P marketplace lending can     be viewed as internetbased private placements of debt. This is pure businesstobusiness debt     and  therefore  contrasts  sharply  with  the  dominant  role  of  many  small  investors  in     crowdfunded  debt  in  the  UK.  Our  findings  confirm  that  crowdfunded  debt  plays  an     increasingly important role in the external financing of small private entrepreneurial firms.          Our  paper  links  with  both  the  Cosh  et  al.  (2009)  study  of  the  sources  of  outside     entrepreneurial capital for private UK firms and the Brav (2009) study of the  characteristics     of UK public and private firms in 19932003. The Cosh et al. findings support the traditional     pecking order hypothesis and indicate that smaller private firms may face a capital gap. Brav     establishes  that  private  firms  depend  almost  entirely  on  debt  finance   have  higher  leverage     ratios and tend to avoid external capital markets.   Debt  crowdfunding  platforms  have     emerged  in  the  aftermath  of  the  Cosh  et  al  (2009)  and  Brav  (2009)  studies  and  can  be     regarded  as  a  hybrid  external  debt  source.  Crowdfunded  debt  differs  from  conventional     public  debt  in  two  respects.  The  first  is  that  it  economises  on  transaction  costs  –  notably     flotation costs – as the funds are raised via an internet platform in contrast to the public debt     sold  on  the  corporate  bond  market.  The  second  and  major  difference  is  that   while     conventional public debt is raised by large established corporations with strong credit ratings     – with the notable exception of the junk bond market – crowdfunded debt is raised by small      young   risky   and  nonlisted  (i.e.  privately  held)  firms  that  would  have  difficulties  in     accessing medium term bank debt.          2          The  paper’s  second  contribution  is  that  it  investigates  the  drivers  of  the  decision  by     the 1 014 small private UK firms to raise crowdfunded debt as opposed to alternative sources     of  debt  financing.  Indeed   this  is  the  first  study  of  the  drivers  of  firms’  choice  to  relay  on     crowdfunded  debt  during  a  period  where  the  other  major  source  of  debt  financing  –  bank     lending – was heavily constrained in the UK.  It focuses on two major mediumterm external     sources of funds available to small private UK firms  crowdfunded debt  and bank debt.3 As     such  it complements the path breaking study of Brav (2009) that focuses only on the external     financing  of  private  medium  and  largesized  SMEs.  New  external  equity  is  typically  not  a     feasible  source  of  funding  for  small  private  firms. 4 Thus  our  sample  of  firms  is  largely     confined  to  a  choice  between  different  sources  of  debt  or  loan  capital.  Crowdfunded  debt     shares  some  characteristics  with  nonbank  private  debt  as  institutions  can  also  invest.     However  even though institutional investors contribute  the majority of funds are raised from     the public (crowd) via an internet portal and as such it must be considered a new hybrid form     of public debt. Our empirical results show that  crowdfunded debt plays a unique role in the     funding of risky and relatively early stage small private firms and is gradually considered to     be an additional source of outside debt capital although it is still not the first preferred choice     than bank debt. The implication of our findings is that crowdfunded debt adds a new layer of     outside capital to the traditional pecking order of external funds for private firms and this is a     novel finding.     The paper is organised as follows. Section 2 outlines the distinctive features of the P2P     lending  markets  in  the  UK   compares  crowdfunded  debt  and  bank  debt  and  provides  the     hypothesis  development.  Section  3  describes  the  data  and  variables  used  in  this  study  and     presents  descriptive  statistics.  Section  4  analyses  the  empirical  results.  A  final  section     concludes.                                                      3 See Cosh et al. (2009) for a comprehensive list of the other sources of outside capital.     4 Crowdfunded equity may be a new source of equity for such firms but is beyond the scope of this paper.          3     2.  Crowdfunding debt and hypothesis development     2.1   P2P lending markets     P2P  markets  are  revolutionising  or  uberising5 traditional  markets  for  goods  or  services  that     often are dominated by monopolistic or oligopolistic suppliers. Einav et  al. (2015) view the     main  function  of  P2P  markets  as  making  it  easy  for  buyers  to  find  sellers  and  engage  in     convenient and trustworthy transactions. P2P markets in finance developed later than general     P2P  markets.  However   their  recent  rapid  growth  and   in  particular   the  mushrooming  of     crowdfunding platforms has led to them being designated as leaders of the fintech6 (financial     technology)  or  alternative  finance  sector.  Other  prominent  examples  of  the  latter  include     foreign exchange transfer platforms such as Transferwise and CurrencyFair. Interestingly  the     latter shares most of the common features of P2P markets identified by Einav et  al. (2015).     These  include  lowering  entry  costs  for  sellers   engaging  in  spot  transactions   employing     technology  to  match  buyers  and  sellers   doing  little  upfront  screening   and  maintaining     quality using feedback mechanisms.           Crowdfunded  debt  markets  enable  small  firms  (and  consumers)  to  access  financing     from  the  crowd  and  is  by  far  the  most  prevalent  form  of  crowdfunding.7 These  markets  are     characterised by three distinctive features that distinguish them from P2P markets in general.     First  crowdfunded debt involves ongoing relationships between the lending platform (acting     on  behalf  of  the  investors)  and  the  borrowers  (crowd)  typically  for  periods  of  one  to  five     years  depending on the term of the loan facility. By contrast  most general P2P markets like     eBay or Amazon involve spot transactions only.                                                         5 This refers to the disruptive effects Uber had on the taxi market potentially spreading to other markets.     6 See Cumming and Schwienbacher (2016) for an interesting study of fintech venture capital.     7 Note that most early crowdfunding projects were generally in the arts and creative industries and were reward/   product  based  rather  than  for  profit.  See  Agrawal  et  al.  (2015)   Belleflamme  et  al.  (2014)   Belleflamme  et  al.   (2015) and Mollick (2014) for more discussion.          4          Second  they take advantage of technology and machine learning to aggregate or pool     the savings of individual investors  as well as to screen and allocate borrowers into different     risk  categories.  Indeed   the  aggregation  of  “part  loans”  is  what  distinguishes  debt     crowdfunding  from  marketplace  lending  in  the  USA  where  financial  institutions  supply  the     whole debt.     Third  they seek to maintain quality by using market design mechanisms and reputation     to  continue  successfully  to  attract  investor  funds.  One  of  the  most  important  tasks  is  the     provision point mechanism highlighted by Agrawal et al. (2013). In this case  the SME only     receives  the  funds  if  the  funding  target  level  is  met  or  exceeded  within  a  particular  time     period  of  time.  Such  a  mechanism  is  a  solution  to  a  classic  coordination  and  freeriding     problem that arises in the provision of public goods.          One of the big issues addressed in this paper is where crowdfunded debt might fit into     the  pecking  order  of  outside  debt.  It  links  with  Denis  and  Mihov  (2003)  who  employ  an     incremental  approach  to  study  1 560  new  US  debt  financings  on  the  choice  between  bank     debt   nonbank private debt  and public debt.  They  establish a hierarchy or pecking order of     debt funding and are one of the first to stress the role of credit quality in this process. They     find  the  highest  credit  quality  firms  (as  indicated  by  credit  ratings)  issue  public  debt  in  the     bond  markets   medium  credit  quality  firms  borrow  from  the  banks   while  the  lowest  credit     quality firms are financed by nonbank private lenders under SEC Rule 144A.           This  paper seeks to  provide an answer to  the question of whether crowdfunded debt     ranks  above  or  below  bank  debt  in  terms  of  the  firms  it  is  likely  to  attract.  Since  debt     crowdfunding is often described as P2P business lending  this may give the false impression     that it is similar to bank lending. It is not because crowdlending can be viewed as a form of     regulatory  arbitrage  or  disintermediation  as  crowdfunded  debt  is  not  subject  to  Basel  III     capital  requirements  under  which  commercial  banks  operate.  Note  that  Basel  III  capital          5     requirements rise in tandem with risk and so banks were discouraged from lending to smaller     (riskier) UK SMEs in the wake of the 2008 banking and financial crisis.           The implication is that lending platforms have a lending rate comparative advantage     relative to commercial banks.. Thus firms that have crowdfunded debt are likely to be small     firms  that  may  also  have  had  difficulties  in  or  were  discouraged  from  raising  medium  term     bank loans. The external funding problem is particularly acute for privately held small firms     as their accounts are sparse and opaque. For instance  small private firms are required by UK     company law to publish balance sheet financial information with their annual reports but are     not  obliged  to  publish  their  profit  and  loss  accounts.  This  makes  risk  assessment  more     challenging  for  banks.  Finally   crowdfunding  provides  a  less  complicated  and  more  rapid     means for private firms to raise external debt since it is time consuming to apply for a bank     loan  as  the  evaluation  process  can  be  lengthy  and  complicated.  Due  to  the  ease  of  raising     funds  via  the  internet   more  and  more  small  and  private  firms  have  obtained  crowdfunded     debt in recent years.            2.2    Hypothesis development       In this paper  we are interested in private firms’ financial decisions on the both traditional and     unconventional  capital  sources  –  the  issued  capitals   bank  debt  and  crowdfunded  debt.     Aforementioned   in  recent  years  many  firms   especially  small  private  firms   consider  raise     capital  from  the  public  crowdfunding  platform.  Although  the  capital  size  of  crowdfunded     debt  is  not  as  large  as  bank  debt   it  cannot  be  ignored  that  crowdfunded  debt  is  part  of  the     firm’s capital structure. While virtually all UK small firms have short run  overdraft financing     from their clearing bank  more risky firms are unlikely to have access to mediumterm bank     debt where the latter has a maturity of 15 years. We conjecture that this makes small private          6     firms more likely to be candidates for crowdfunded debt borrowers when their credit quality     is  lower  than  that  required  by  banks.  In  particular   Denis  and  Mihov  (2003)  find  that  firms     preferring  debt  financing  tend  to  have  higher  leverage  ratios.  Thus   the  first  empirically     testable implication is     H1  Crowdfunded debt contributes to a firm’s debt ratios.     Following  ShyamSunder  and  Myers  (1999)   we  use  the  financing  deficit  regression     model  to  examine  the  pecking  order  behaviour  of  these  small  private  firms  in  our  sample.     Since it is costly  particularly for smallsized firms  to  raise capital  externally  private firms     are in general less likely to raise or retire capital.  Until the internal funds are insufficient for     the  deficit   these  private  firms  thus  seek  for  external  funding  sources.  Therefore   the  next     empirically testable implication is     H2   When  private  firms  have  financing  deficit   they  are  likely  to  issue  either  debt  or     request more equity capital than retire debt or repurchases equity.     Most  small  private  firms  are  typically  owned  by  founder  entrepreneurs  and  thus  are     unlikely to make large investment in fixed assets due to funding gaps (e.g. Fraser  2012). If     bank  debt  is  unavailable  or  perceived  to  be  unavailable  as  in  the  discouraged  borrowers’     hypothesis   then  firms  will  be  credit  constrained  and  thus  unable  to  invest.  In  this  context      crowdfunded debt is probably the only accessible source of external financing for such firms     and  particularly  for  those  pursuing  growth  opportunities.  Then  the  next  empirically  testable     implication is     H3  Small private firms are more likely to issue crowdfunded debt.     Next   we  examine  the  relationship  between  firm  size  and  crowdfunded  debt.  Most  of     prior studies focus on public firms and find that firm size matters to the pecking order theory.     For instance  Frank and Goyal (2003) document that the pecking order theory applies well to     large US firms but does not explain the financing decisions of small US firms well. Denis and          7     Mihov (2003) find that firm size is positively related to public debt than bank debt  using US     public  firms.  Fama  and  French  (2005)  conclude  that  many  US  publicly  listed  firms  do  not     follow the pecking order theory and issue equities in the first place than debt. However  these     studies do not explore whether firm size influences  the financing decisions of private firms.      Since  the  vast  majority  of  small  private  firms  are  tiny  in  terms  of  their  firm  size  (i.e.  total     assets)  many of them yet to have wellstructured financial and accounting reports that can be     provided on the webbased public funding platform. The information that is mostly available     and reliable to lenders is the value of a firm’s total assets. Thus  crowdfunding investors are     likely to invest in relatively bigger rather than in smaller private firms because these firms are     more stable in terms of their economies of scale. This leads to the hypothesis     H4  Crowdfunded debt is positively impacted by the size of small private firms.     As the pecking order theory suggests (Myers and Majluf  1984)  firms would first use     internal funds to finance corporate activities before pursuing external finance. As to external     finance   debt  financing  is  preferable  to  equity  financing  as  the  latter  is  more  costly  and     managers  are  reluctant  to  cede  control  of  their  enterprises  to  outsiders.  As  such   our  next     empirical testable implication is     H5  Debt (either crowdfunded debt or other debt) is preferable to issued capital.     Other  debt  is  mainly  bank  debt.  The  main  difference  between  bank  and  crowdfunded     debt is the degree of information asymmetry which influences the order or sequencing in how     external financing sources are chosen.  Compared with other nonbank public debt providers      banks request more financial information in applications in order to better assess and monitor     borrowers.  As  such   firms  with  lower  asymmetric  information  will  normally  borrow  from     banks  first  and  those  with  higher  asymmetric  information  will  tend  to  borrow  privately     (Fama  1985). Moreover  crowdfunded debt amounts typically are much smaller than those of          8     bank  loans.  Therefore   we  hypothesise  that  other  debt  (mainly  bank  debt)  is  the  main  debt     capital alternative to crowdfunded debt for private firms.      Crowdfunded firms are at the early stage of their entrepreneurial finance life cycle and     thus  are  unlikely  to  have  sufficient  levels  of  retained  profits  to  finance  their  capital     expenditures.  These  expenditures  are  the  main  reason  for  cash  outflows  for  small  private     firms and in particular those that pursue growth opportunities. Such firms will need to fund     their growth through bank debt or  more likely in the case of our sample period  crowdfunded     debt. Thus  we predict that     H6   Crowdfunded  debt  has  a  larger  impact  than  other  (mainly  bank)  debt  and  equity     capital on the capital expenditures of small private firms in the years following that in which     debt is raised.          3.   Data and sample     3.1   Sample construction     This  subsection  reports  on  the  data  for  our  unique  sample  of  small  private  firms  with     outstanding  crowdfunded  debt  raised  via  the  Funding  Circle  platform.  This  platform  was     chosen  for  two  reasons.  First   Funding  Circle   founded  in  2010   is  the  UK’s  and  indeed     Europe’s largest crowdlender. It has over 42 000 investors and has lent to more than 10 000     firms. Second  it is the only large crowdlender that specialises in lending to small firms in the     UK. While its rival Zopa also lends to small firms  it still primarily lends to consumers.          Funding Circle makes available on its website aggregated data on its lending by risk     category   interest  rate   region   industry  and  reason  for  borrowing.  Extant  crowdfunding     studies  typically  use  such  aggregated  data  from  large   longestablished  platforms  such  as          9     Kickstarter. Our approach is different from the previous work in that we handcollect a large     sample  of  firms  with  outstanding  crowdfunded  debt  from  the  Funding  Circle  website. 8     Financial  information  for  these  firms  is  obtained  from  the  Financial  Analysis  Made  Easy     (FAME) database9 to create a deidentified database.10 The sample firms are overwhelmingly     small private (i.e. nonlisted) UK firms. They are defined by Companies House as small and     so are required to submit balance sheet financial information only. Since they are not obliged     to submit a profit and loss statement  income data from the balance sheet had to be extracted     to create the control variables for the empirical analyses. Thus  firms not listed in FAME are     excluded.  We  also  exclude  utility  firms  (USSIC  codes  49004939)   financial  firms  (USSIC     codes 60006999)  and public sector firms  (USSIC codes 90009999) due to the regulations     they  are  subject  to  and  their  distinct  financial  policies  and  capital  sources.  This  filtering     process results in a final sample of 2 661 firmyear observations and 1 014 firms.           Since the sample is a fraction of the Funding Circle loanbook  it is interesting to see     how representative is it for the purposes of our analysis. Appendix 1a summarises the firms’     profile by industry  along with the share of the corresponding industry from the total number     of  loans  in  the  Funding  Circle’s  portfolio  as  of  May   2016.  The  sample  includes  a  diverse     range of firms.  Overall  the sample industry percentages are quite close to the total number     of  funded  projects.  There  are  two  exceptions.  First   the  sample  overweights  the     manufacturing  and  engineering  industry  and   second   it  underweights  the  property  and     construction industry. However  the  combined percentages for these two industries are very     close with figures of 30% and 29% for the sample and total  respectively.                                                        8 Available from https //www.fundingcircle.com/uk/ [Accessed from September 18  2015 to January 25  2016].     9 FAME is compiled by Bureau van Dijk (BvD). The data are collected from Jordans  a leading provider of legal   information in the United Kingdom. In turn  Jordans collect the data from Companies House.     10 The data are deidentified to avoid any confidentiality issues. Our interest is solely in the data at aggregated   levels and not that of individual firms.          10     One of the interesting  and attractive aspects  of  crowdfunded debt  is  that  in  contrast     with  traditional  bank  debt   the  borrowers  are  not  geographically  constrained  to  borrowing     from  local  sources  only.  In  principle   any  firm  with  an  internet  connection  can  become  a     borrower  (assuming  that  it  has  the  capacity  to  repay  the  loan).  Appendix  1b  provides  the     location of the sample  firms by region. As a benchmark  we report the regional sample and     total  loan  shares  as  well  as  the  proportion  of  the  population  located  in  each  region.11 The     figures suggest that London and the South East are slightly underrepresented in our sample as     compared with Funding Circle’s loanbook. Our sample accounts for 34% of loans as against     37% for total loans in this region. However  the London and the South East sample share of     34% clearly exceeds the region’s population share of just 27% and is in line with the spatial     concentration of crowdfunding highlighted in Agrawal et al. (2011).      This  is  to  be  expected  for  two  reasons.  First   London  and  the  South  East  were  least     affected by the post2008 recession. Second  London has been described as the crowdfunding     capital  of  the  world.  The  Northern  powerhouse 12  (North  West  and  North  East  regions)     accounted  for  26%  of  crowdfunded  debt  as  against  23%  of  total  loans  and  the  population.     This  is  consistent  with  manufacturing  being  overweighted  in  our  sample.  The  Midland’s     sample share of 15% is representative relative to the total and the region’s population share.     In  the  remaining  regions  like  Scotland   Wales   Northern  Ireland   and  East  of  England   the     proportion of sample debt is 3% to 5% and underweighted relative to the regions’ population     shares. By contrast  it is overweighted at 11% for the South West region against a population     share of 8%. Overall  all sample figures are reasonably close to the percentage shares of each     region from the total loanbook  suggesting that our sample is representative.                                                           11 Population estimates were downloaded from the Office for National Statistics  UK  mid2015.     12 This term is used as shorthand for proposals to boost economic growth in the North of England by the 2010  15 Coalition government and 201520 Conservative government in the United Kingdom  particularly in the core   cities of Manchester  Liverpool  Leeds  Sheffield and Newcastle.          11     3.2   Descriptive statistics       Table  1  shows  the  debt  characteristics  for  the  sample.  It  also  reports  summary  statistics  for     the  dependent  and  independent  variables  used  in  the  regression  models  in  this  paper.  The     detailed  variable  definitions  are  summarised  in  Appendix  2.  The  table  shows  the  sample     means (and standard deviations in parentheses under the mean) of the variables for firmyear     observations with no crowdfunded debt (column 2)  for observations with crowdfunded debt     (column  3)   and  all  observations  (column  4).  The  final  column  gives  the  tstatistic  (and     corresponding pvalues in parentheses) for equality of means for columns 2 and 3.       [Table 1 around here]          Several  observations  can  be  made.  First   firmyear  observations  with  crowdfunded     debt  are  characterised  by  higher  leverage  (in  total  and  net  terms)   spend  more  on  capital     expenditures (CAPEX)   are larger (proxied by total assets) and  older  enjoy higher turnover     (TURNOVER)  and profitability  (PROFIT) levels   and have a smaller  deficit (less negative)     (DEFICIT)  gap.  Second   firmyear  observations  with  crowdfunding  are  indistinguishable     from firmyear observations without crowdfunding in terms of both average return on assets     (ROA)  and  tangible  assets  (TANGIAT).  Finally   firmyear  observations  with  crowdfunding     have  a  lower  ratio  of  short  to  long  term  debt  (SHORT_TO_LONG)  relative  to  firmyear     observations without crowdfunding.           Table 2 presents the correlation matrices for the variables included in the econometric     specifications  for  our  full  sample.  The  table  separately  presents  the  correlations  between     variables  for  firmyear  observations  with  crowdfunding  in  the  (shaded)  upper  triangular     matrix  part  and  the  firmyear  observations  without  crowdfunding  in  the  lower  triangular     matrix part.           [Table 2 around here]     12     The table shows several significant correlations at the 5% critical value or better and     some  the  coefficients  are  relatively  low  (<0.5).  In  the  case  of  firmyear  observations  with     crowdfunding   leverage  is  positively  correlated  with  crowdfunded  debt  but  negatively     correlated  with  firm  size.  On  the  other  hand   in  the  case  of  firmyear  observations  without     crowdfunding   leverage  is  positively  correlated  with  firm  size.  Both  subsample  groups’     leverage is positively correlated with tangible assets and the deficit but negatively correlated     with  net  working  capital.  Also   crowdfunded  debt  is  significantly  inversely  related  with     capital expenditures  tangible assets  firm size  age  turnover  profitability  and the deficit.            4.  Empirical results     This  section  analyses  the  determinants  of  debt  ratios  of  the  small  nonlisted  firms  in  our     sample and of their external financing choices. Following Brav (2009)  we use firms’ balance     sheet  data  to  quantify  their  leverage  and  differentiate  between  capital  issuances  or     repurchases. In particular  we measure leverage as the sum of shortterm loans and overdrafts     plus long term liabilities  all divided by total assets. In the context of debt financing  we also     analyse the key factors that affect firms’ decision whether to crowdfund or not. To do this  we     calculate the outstanding balance of each company’s loan at the end of the fiscal year using     an  amortization  schedule  calculator  and  assuming  that  the  monthly  payments  are  fixed.13 If     the firm has more than one loan  we first calculate the outstanding balance at the end of the     fiscal year for each loan individually and then sum these outstanding loan amounts to obtain     the total value of crowdfunding debt for this firm.                                                        13 All crowdfunding loans in our sample are being amortized. For each company we assume that the accounting   reference date reported by FAME is the end of the fiscal year. Given that Funding Circle provides the duration   and date at which the loan was accepted  calculating the outstanding balance using an amortization schedule is a   straightforward exercise.          13          4.1  Leverage      This section analyses the determinants of firms’ debt ratios using a regression framework as     in  Brav  (2009)  and  Rajan  and  Zingales  (1995).  The  choice  of  explanatory  and  control     variables is motivated by the previous theoretical and empirical literature of capital structure.     For example  Berger and Udell (1995)  Rajan and Zingales (1995)  Hovakimian et al. (2001)      and  Petersen  and  Rajan  (2002)   among  others   find  that  firm  size   asset  tangibility   growth      profitability  and  age  are  key  determinants  of  firms’  debt  ratios.  We  also  include  the     composition  of  firms’  debt  (SHORT_TO_LONG)  to  control  for  contracting  problems  (e.g.     Faulkender  and  Petersen   2006;  Brav   2009)  and  a  dummy  variable  to  help  quantify  the     increase in leverage due to crowdfunding.           Table 3 presents pooled Ordinary Least Squares regression estimates for net leverage     (or  leverage)  for  the  full  sample  from  2010  to  2015  and  the  corresponding  tstatistics      adjusted for clustering by firm. The independent variables are lagged one period (except for     the  binary  crowdfunding  dummy  variable)  to  avoid  potential  endogeneity  issues  and  all     variables are divided by total assets to mitigate for heteroskedasticity.      [Table 3 around here]     The  coefficients  on  growth  and  capital  expenditures  are  always  statistically     insignificant  which is consistent with Brav (2009) who posits that private firms’ leverage is     more  sensitive  to  operating  performance  since  their  absolute  cost  of  capital  is  high.  In  line     with the tradeoff theory of capital structure  however  leverage is positively and significantly     related to  the proportion of shortterm  debt  and  assets tangibility.  These  findings are robust     regardless  of  whether  or  not  we  take  into  account  bank  deposits  and  investments  when     measuring leverage.          14     The  table  shows  negative  relations  between  net  leverage  and  profitability  (proxied  by     ROA)  and  between  leverage  and  age  but  both  are  only  marginally  significant  at  the  10%     level.  There  is  also  a  positive  and  statistically  significant  relationship  between  net  leverage     and size. Interestingly  both leverage measures (net and total) are positively and significantly     related to a crowdfunding dummy at the 1% critical value and these remain significant even     when the usual control variables are added. This is a novel finding in the context of leverage.     It is consistent with the fact that crowdfunded debt has a cost advantage relative to bank debt     since   unlike  bank  debt   it  is  disintermediated  debt  and  thus  not  subject  to  Basel  III  capital     requirements.          Overall  the results indicate that firms’ debt ratios are sensitive to  crowdfunded debt     as predicted in hypothesis H1 and to firm characteristics like firm size  asset tangibility and     debt  composition   but  less  sensitive to  firm  profitability.  These findings depart in  important     respects  from  those  of  Brav  (2009)  for  his  sample  of  medium  and  large  private  firms.  He     establishes  that  leverage  is  highly  sensitive  to  performance  variables  like  ROA  in  line  with     traditional  trade  off  theory.  However  he  also  finds  highly  significant  coefficients  for  all  his     other independent variables including growth  capital expenditures  tangible assets  firm size      age  and debt composition. By contrast  our findings indicate that ROA is significant in just     one  regression  at  the  10%  level  and   apart  from  tangible  assets   firm  size   and  debt     composition  the other variables are mostly insignificant.           4.2  Decision to raise or retire capital     This subsection examines how access to capital markets affects the decisions of small private     firms on whether to raise or retire capital. Brav (2009) argues that private firms tend to rely     more on debt than on equity since their cost of equity is higher for two reasons. One is that          15     the  owner  managers  (and  other  large  shareholders)  in  private  firms  are  reluctant  to  cede  or     dilute  their  control.  The  other  is  that  the  equity  of  private  firms  will  be  less  attractive  to     outside  investors  due  to  the  high  degree  of  information  asymmetry  between  insiders  and     outsiders.  These  two  factors  combine  to  raise  the  cost  of  equity  for  private  firms.  In  the     context of this paper  crowdfunding offers new sources of external debt and equity capital to     private firms that are less expensive than their traditional counterparts but this paper focuses     on crowdfunded debt only.     We  explore  the  capital  issuance  and  retirement  decisions  of  firms  within  our  sample     using a multinomial logit model as in Brav (2009). The dependent variable takes the values of     0 if the firm takes no action (the base category)  1 if it issues either debt or equity  and 2 if it     either retires debt or repurchases equity. A firm is defined as issuing (repurchasing) equity if     the percentage change of its shareholders’ funds (the face value of total outstanding shares) is     larger  (smaller)  than  5%  (5%).  Similarly   we  define  a  firm  as  issuing  (retiring)  debt  if  the     percentage change in the sum of shortterm debt  and long term liabilities is larger (smaller)     than 5% (5%). Following Leary and Roberts (2006) and Brav (2009)  a firm’s deficit and net     working capital (NWC) are used as control variables.     The multinomial model results are presented in Table 4. In interpreting the results  note     that  the  sign  on  the  reported  coefficient  estimates  shows  whether  a  small  change  in  the     explanatory variable increases or decreases the odds ratio of the indicated alternative relative     to  the  baseline  case  of  taking  no  action.  Model  (1)  includes  all  the  explanatory  variables     (excluding Zscore) employed by Brav (2009) and  similarly  a firm’s deficit and net working     capital (NWC) are used as control variables. The differences between this and Models (2) and     (3) is  that the latter successively  add leverage and profitability  respectively   as  explanatory     variables.          [Table 4 around here]     16     The results are interesting.  Small  private  firms  are more likely to  raise  capital  when     they  have  a  deficit  and  to  retire  capital  when  they  have  a  surplus.  The  results  support  our     hypothesis  H2.  The  implication  is  that  private  firms  are  likely  to  raise  external  capital  only     when they have to  which is consistent with the higher cost of capital they face. The results     indicate that  the larger the firm size  the less likely it is to raise or retire capital  possibly due     to economies of scale in cash management. Both of these findings are consistent with those of     Brav  (2009)  for  his  sample  of  private  firms.  However   growth  opportunities  in  our  sample     have  an  insignificant  impact  unlike  in  Brav  (2009)  where  the  probability  that  private  firms     issue (retire) capital is positively (negatively) related to an increase in growth opportunities      consistent with firms raising capital to finance future investments.           Our results show that small firms with higher levels of net working capital are more     likely  both  to  raise  and  to  retire  capital   possibly  using  the  new  capital  to  retire  debt.    By     contrast  Brav (2009) finds that his sample of private firms with higher levels of net working     capital is less likely to retire capital. Our Model (2) adds leverage as an explanatory variable     while our Model (3) adds profitability as well as leverage. These have the no impact on our     previous  results  with  one  exception  in  Models  (2)  and  (3).  Including  leverage  (and     profitability) has the effect of rendering insignificant the impact of net working capital on the     probability of raising capital but not on retiring capital. The Model (2) results indicate that the     higher the leverage levels   the lower the probability of both  raising new capital  and retiring     existing capital.  The Model  (3) results also  show  that the higher the profitability levels   the     higher the probability of raising new capital. These two sets of results are novel.          To sum  up  our results on the decision to raise or retire capital  are highly  consistent     with  those  of  Brav  (2009)  for  his  medium  and  large  private  firm  sample.  Our  findings     produce  two  novel  results.  First   the  higher  the  leverage  levels  of  small  private  firms   the          17     lower is the probability both of raising new capital and retiring existing capital. Second  high     profitability levels boost their probability of raising new capital.          4.3   Crowdfunding and external financing choices     This subsection presents results on the decision of small private firms to crowdfund or not to     crowdfund. The  crowdfunding decision  is  interesting as it can shed light  on the aversion of     private firms to external financial markets that is well documented in the literature. It is tested     within a Probit regression framework where the response binary variable assumes a value of     one for firms that prefer crowdfunding as the source of debt financing and zero for firms that     take no action on issuing  crowdfunded debt. The choice of  general  explanatory  and  control     variables is motivated by Brav (2009) and the theoretical and empirical literature  on capital     structure.  For  example   Rajan  and  Zingales  (1995)  and  Havakimian  et  al.  (2001)  find  that     firm size and profitability (among others) are key determinants of firms’ debt ratios. Building     on Brav (2009)  we model the decision to crowdfund in the spirit of Hovakimian et al. (2001)     using the predicted debt ratios from the leverage regressions (in columns (2) and (4) of Table     3)  as  proxies  for  the  target  debt  ratios.  The  independent  variables  include  the  target     adjustment  of  leverage   ROA   and  firm  size.  The  target  adjustment  of  (net)  leverage      TMA_LEV (TMA_NET_LEV)  is the difference between the predicted (net) leverage ratios     from the leverage regression models of Table 3 column (2 (4)) and the actual (net) leverage     ratio in the previous year. The results from the Probit regression are reported in Table 5.     [Table 5 around here]     The  target  adjustment  hypothesis  of  the  static  tradeoff  theory  posits  that   the  larger     the target          18     leverage distance relative to the startingperiod leverage and the more profitable the firm  the     more  likely  the  firm  will  choose  debt  in  the  issuance  decision.  The  results  in  Table  5  offer     support  for  our  hypothesis  H3.  The  coefficients  on  both  the  target  leverage  proxies  are     significantly positive for both crowdfunding dummy variables. These indicate that the larger     target leverage deviations  the higher the probability of firms issuing more crowdfunded debt     in regressions (1) and (2) and of having crowdfunded debt in regressions (3) and (4). This is     consistent with the tradeoff theory of capital structure.           Table  5  shows  that  profitability  levels  are  inversely  related  to  the  probability  of     raising crowdfunded debt at the 1% significance level in all specifications. It is possible that     low  ROA  levels  imply  low  retained  earnings  and  thus  a  need  to  raise  external  capital.  This     contrasts with the Brav (2009) finding of an insignificant coefficient on this variable for the     private firms in his sample. Finally  we include firm size measured by taking the natural log     of total assets in our Probit regressions. The results indicate that the larger the firm size  the     higher is the probability of issuing crowdfunded debt at the 1% significance level. The results     are  in  line  with  the  hypothesis  H4  that  larger  firms  face  lower  costs  of  asymmetric     information and thus are more likely to have crowdfunded debt.          Table  6  presents  Probit  regression  results  on  financing  choices  for  the  full  sample     from  2010  to  2015.  The  choice  between  debt  and  equity  results  are  given  in  the  first  and     second  columns  where  the  dependent  variable  is  equal  to  one  if  the  firm  issued  debt     (including crowdfunded) only and zero if issued equity capital only.      [Table 6 around here]     A  firm  is  defined  as  debt  issuer  if  its  change  in  total  debt  (∆DEBT)  exceeds  5%.     ∆DEBT is defined as the difference between the total of short term loans and overdrafts and     long  term  liabilities  in  the  current  year  and  the  corresponding  total  in  the  previous  year      scaled by the latter total. Similarly  a firm is defined as an equity capital issuer if the change          19     in its issued capital between a given year and the previous year  divided by the issued capital     in the previous year  exceeds 5%.     The column (1) results indicate an increased probability     of issuing debt when firms’ net leverage deviations from target increase but this is significant     at the 10% level only. The dependent variable in the third and fourth columns is equal to one     if the firm issued other noncrowdfund debt  (most likely bank debt) only and zero if issued     equity capital  only.  The  results in  column (3) show an increased likelihood  of issuing other     debt  when  net  leverage  deviations  increase  and  this  also  significant  at  the  10%  level.  The     final  four  columns  of  Table  6  present  results  on  the  choices  between  the  decision  to  raise     crowdfunded  debt  versus  other  financing  choices.  The  dependent  variable  in  the  fifth  and     sixth columns is equal to one if firms issued crowdfunded debt only and zero if they issued     equity capital only. In the last two columns the dependent variable is equal to one if the firms     issued crowdfunded only and zero if they issued other debt. A firm is defined as a crowdfund     issuer if the change in crowdfunded debt between a given year and its previous year is greater     than  zero.  The  TMA_LEV  independent  variable  is  the  deviation  of  the  predicted  leverage     ratios  from  the  leverage  regression  models  of  Table  3  column  (4)  and  the  actual  leverage     ratios  in  the  previous  year.  The  results  in  columns  (5)  and  (6)  indicate  an  increase  in  the     probability of issuing  crowdfunded debt  (rather than equity) both net  leverage and leverage     deviations from target  respectively. Both coefficients are significant at the 5% level. This is     plausible as private firms are more likely to prefer crowdfunded debt to equity for both cost     and control reasons. These results and those in columns (1) to (4) indicate our preference for     debt over equity receives strongest support from crowdfunded debt (hypothesis H5).          The results in columns (7) and (8) indicate a lower likelihood of raising crowdfunded     debt (rather than other debt) if the firm experience increases in both net leverage and leverage     deviations from target  respectively. Both coefficients are significant at the 5% level. Finally      the  results  indicate  an  inverse  relation  between  the  probability  of  raising  crowdfunded  debt          20     and  profitability  and  the  coefficients  are  significant  at  the  5%  level.  The  implication  from     these  results  is  that  small  private  firms  have  a  better  chance  of  raising  crowdfunded  debt  if     their leverage deviations from target are decreasing and their profitability is low.           4.4   Funding capital expenditures     The  main  purpose  for  crowdfunding  given  on  applications  shown  on  the  Funding  Circle     platform  is  for  capital  expansion.  It  is  therefore  interesting  to  analyse  the  link  between  the     raised capital and the subsequent investments by the firm.  Using a regression model similar     to  the  one  employed  by  Kim  and  Weisbach  (2008)   capital  expenditures  are  related  to  the     three competing sources of funding for the 20102015 sample period. The dependent variable     is the total amount of capital expenditures (CAPEX) in years 1  2  3  and 4 after the base year     in which the funds are raised. The funding independent variables include crowdfunded debt      other  (mainly  bank)  debt  and  the  change  in  issued  capital.  The  results  are  summarised  in     Table 7.     [Table 7 around here]     The results indicate that capital expenditures are positively and significantly related to     both crowdfunded and other debt but not to equity funding. This is consistent with the view     that  small  private  firms  mainly  rely  on  debt  rather  than  equity  funding  in  early  stage     entrepreneurial finance (hypothesis H6). The positive impact of crowdfunded debt on capital     expenditures is significant at the 5% level in years 1 and 2 following the funding year and at     the  10%  level  in  year  3.  The  drop  in  significance  level  may  be  explained  by  the  fact  that     crowdfunded debt is a very recent phenomenon as one can deduce from the declining sample     size  (N)  from  2 075  in  year  1  to  569  in  year  4  following  the  funding  year.  The  results  also     show that capital expenditures are positively and significantly related to other (mainly bank)          21     debt in years 1 to 4. The coefficients are significant at the 5% level in years 1 to 3 following     the funding year and at the 10% level in year 4.     One can use the results to perform some tests on pecking order theory. First  while both     debt and the equity capital (at the 10% level only) coefficients are significant in years 1 and 2     after the capital is raised  those on debt are significantly larger than those on equity.  Second      the crowdfunded debt coefficients are all economically significant and are numerically larger     than  the  corresponding  other  debt  coefficients.  However   unreported  results  indicate  that     these two coefficients are not statistically different.14     In the spirit of Kim and Weisbach (2008)  we also calculate the implied change in the     dependent variable when each source of funds is increased by one pound (£1) for a median    sized  firm  in  2011  in  the  twodigit  SIC  code  73  (Business  Services).  The  results  of  these     calculations  are  also  presented  in  Table  7.  The  implied  change  per  pound  raised  by  either     crowdfunded or other debt financing is positive and increasing for the first three  years after     the base  year during which capital is raised but decreases in  the fourth  year. In number  for     every  pound  raised   capital  expenditures  rise  by  53  pence  for  the  first  year  after     crowdfunding.  Over  a  2year  and  3year  horizons   capital  expenditures  rise  by  65  and  71     pence. These findings suggest that firms do not exhaust their crowdfund at once. In contrast      the implied change per pound raised by issuing capital is negative over all years.          5.  Conclusions       Crowdfunded  debt  or  P2P  business  lending  is  a  novel  form  of  external  debt  financing  for     small  young  entrepreneurial  firms  in  which  funds  are  raised  from  the  crowd  via  internet                                                        14 The results  were not reported in order to preserve space  however  they are available upon request. We also   perform a test that all three coefficients are equal and this hypothesis is rejected only for the first two years after   the capital is raised and at the 10% significance level.          22     platforms This paper investigates a unique sample of 1 014 small private UK firms financed     by  Funding  Circle  over  the  20102015  period.  This  is  the  largest  crowdfunding  platform  in     Europe  and  specialises  solely  in  raising  debt  for  small  firms.The  platform  data  are     supplemented  by  financial  data  from  FAME  to  analyse  crowdfunded  debt  in  the  context  of     theories of capital structure.      The  results  indicate  that  small  private  firms’  debt  ratios  are  sensitive  to  crowdfunded     debt and to firm characteristics like firm size  asset tangibility and debt composition  but less     sensitive to  firm  profitability. Small firms  are more likely to  raise capital  when they have a     deficit and to retire capital when they have a surplus. These results are highly consistent with     those  of  Brav  (2009)  for  his  medium  and  large  private  firm  sample.  The  Probit  regression     results  show  that  the  larger  target  leverage  deviations   the  higher  the  probability  of  firms     issuing  or  having  crowdfunded  debt  which  is  consistent  with  the  tradeoff  theory  of  capital     structure.  Finally   the  results  indicate  that  crowdfunded  and  other  debt  has  a  larger  positive     impact  on  capital  expenditures  than  equity  capital  in  the  years  following  that  in  which  the     external  funds  were  raised.  This  result  is  intuitive  because  the  main  crowdfunding  purpose     given on the funding applications is for capital expansion. We document that  in the first year     after  having  crowdfunded  debt  (other  noncrowdfunded  debt)   capital  expenditures  increase     by 53 (47) pence for every pound raised.                       23     References     Agrawal   A.

It also reports summary statistics for the   dependent and independent variables used in the regression models. The definitions are given   below and also summarized in Appendix 1 (FAME data item is in italics). CHANGE_DEBT   is the difference between the total of Short Term Loans Overdrafts and Long Term Liabilities   in the current year and the total of Short Term Loans Overdrafts and Long Term Liabilities in   the  previous  year   scaled  by  the  total  of  Short  Term  Loans  Overdrafts  and  Long  Term   Liabilities  in  the  previous  year.  NET_LEVERAGE  is  the  total  of  Short  Term  Loans   Overdrafts  and  Long  Term  Liabilities  minus  the  sum  of  Bank  Deposits  and  Investments   Current  Assets   scaled  by  Total  Assets.  LEVERAGE  is  the  total  of  Short  Term  Loans   Overdrafts and Long Term Liabilities  scaled by  Total Assets. CROWDFD is the amount of   crowd  fund  loan  (in  thousands)   scaled  by  Total  Assets.  The  loan  and  interest  data  for   crowdfunded debt is  collected  from  the website site Funding Circle.  We  then calculate the   remaining  crowd  fund  loan  every  year.  PROFIT  is  the  difference  between  Profit  Loss   Account in the current year minus Profit Loss Account in the previous year. ROA is PROFIT    scaled  by  the  average  of  current  Total  Assets  and  Total  Assets  in  the  previous  year.   TURNOVER  is  the  difference  between  Shareholders  Fund  in  the  current  year  and   Shareholders Fund in the previous year. GROWTH is the percentage change of TURNOVER   between  current  and  previous  years.  CAPEX  is  the  difference  between  Fixed  Assets  in  the   current year and Fixed Assets in the previous year  scaled by Total Assets. TANGIAT is the   sum  of  Tangible  Assets  and  Investments  Fixed  Assets   scaled  by  Total  Assets.  SIZE  is  a   natural log of Total Assets  inflation adjusted in  2015 pounds. SHORT_TO_LONG is  Short   Term Loans Overdrafts divided by the total of Short Term Loans Overdrafts and Long Term   Liabilities.  AGE  is  a  natural  log  of  firm  years  of  incorporation.  NWC  is  the  sum  of  Stock   WIP  Trade Debtors and Other Current Assets  minus Trade Creditors  then the total scaled   by  Total  Assets.  DEFICIT  is  the  difference  between  Fixed  Assets  in  the  current  year  and   Fixed Assets in the previous year  minus the sum of Bank Deposits and Investments Current   Assets in the previous year  plus PROFIT  the total scaled by Total Assets. ROA  GRWOTH    CAPEX   TANGIAT   SIZE   SHORT_TO_LONG   AGE   TURNOVER   NWC   and  PROFIT   are lagged one year.

In  the  first  and  second  columns  the  dependent  variable  is   equal to one if the firm issued debt (including bank and crowdfunded debt) only and zero if issued equity capital only. In the third and fourth   columns  the  dependent  variable  is  equal  to  one  if  the  firm  issued  other  debt  (i.e.  mainly  bank  debt   excluding  crowdfunded  debt)  and  zero  if   issued equity capital only.  In the fifth and sixth columns the dependent variable is equal to one if the firm issued crowd fund only and zero if   issued equity capital only. In the last two columns the dependent variable is equal to one if the firm issued crowd fund only and zero if issued   other debt excluding crowd fund. A firm is defined as debt issuer if its change in total debt (∆DEBT) larger than 5%. ∆DEBT is the difference   between the total of short term loans overdrafts and long term liabilities in the current year and the total of short term loans overdrafts and long   term  liabilities in  the previous  year  scaled by  the total  of short term loans overdrafts and long  term  liabilities in  the previous  year. A firm  is   defined as equity capital issuer if its change in its issued capital between a given year and the previous year  divided by the issued capital in the   previous year  larger than 5%. A firm is defined as crowd fund issuer if the change in CROWDFD between a given year and its previous year is   greater  than  zero.  The  loan  and  interest  data  for  crowd  fund  loan  is  collected  from  the  website  site  Funding  Circle.

If the   company has more than one loan  we first calculate the outstanding   balance at the end of the fiscal year for each loan individually and   then sum these outstanding loan amounts to obtain the total value of   crowdfunding debt for this company.
