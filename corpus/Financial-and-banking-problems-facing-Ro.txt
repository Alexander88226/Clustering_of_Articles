Introduction     For many years  government policy and international nongovernmental organizations have     been  pursued  and  partly  implemented   several  initiatives  to  support  and  consolidate  SMEs      guarantees  for  government  loans  (e.g.  Small  Business  Administration  SBA  in  the  US)   direct     lending  by  stateowned  banks  (e.g.  the  British  Business  Bank)   initiatives  to  simplify  core     requirements  for  SMEs   tax  incentives  to  provide  SMEs  with  capital   the  direct  subscription  of     alternative lenders (e.g. insurance companies  asset  managers)  institutional  exchanges (e.g. SME    covered  bonds   stock  markets  for  SMEs)   consolidation  initiatives  on  securitization  of  markets      attempts to support private placement markets. Despite all efforts  there is still a significant funding     gap.  FinTech  has  become  a  strong  trend   and  FinTech  is  a  frequently  used  term   referring  to     companies that provide or facilitate financial services using technology. "     Worldwide  debt  in  2017   according  to  Business24   reached  a  record  high  of  $  233 000     billion  in  the  third  quarter  of  2017   according  to  an  analysis  published  on  Thursday  by  the     International  Finance  Institute (IIF)  the world's largest  lobbying  group in the financial sector. the     conditions in which the debt of the nonfinancial private sector has reached new highs in Canada      France   Hong  Kong   South  Korea   Switzerland  and  Turkey.  This  figure  includes  the  total  debt  of     households  governments  the financial sector and nonfinancial companies. At the same time  the     IIF  points  out  that  while  the  total  debt  increased  by  $  16 000  billion  in  the  third  quarter  of  2017     compared to the end of 2016  the debttoGDP ratio declined for the fourth consecutive quarter as     the world economy has expanded. According to IIF  this ratio is now about 318%  three percentage     points below the peak recorded in the third quarter of 2016. "A combination of factors including a     global  oversynchronized  growth  potential   rising  inflation  in  China  and  Turkey  and  efforts  to     prevent  a  destabilizing  accumulation  of  debt  in  China  and  Canada  all  contributed  to  this  decline      "the IIF report said. According to the IIF  China  which was responsible for most of the emerging     markets' new debt  slowed the pace of new debt accumulation  so last year its debt rose by just two     percentage points to 294% of GDP  with an average annual growth of 17 percentage points in 2012    2016. IIF analysts warn that the debt burden could act as a brake on central bank intentions to raise     interest  rates   given  the  concerns  that  exist  about  the  ability  of  firms  and  governments  that  are     heavily indebted to secure debt service.          Methodology of scientific research     To  substantiate  the  funding  model  for  innovation   we  used  observation  and  examination     tools   research  methods  based  on  the  basic  principles  of  scientific  research   and  we  also  created     procedures based on factual analysis as a result of a significant practical experience and of intensive     documentation at the level of national and international literature.          Research results     In  order  to  be  able  to  formulate  opinions  on  the  current  financial  system   we  need  to     carefully analyze the figures presented at both national and international levels  relying on several     indicators such as the assets of the banking system  dominant at the financial sector level.                                             Graph no.1 Structure of financial system assets     Source  BNR  2017               In 2008  the cumulative assets of the banking sector and IFN accounted for 94% of the total     (insurances represented 4%  the capital market was 1.8%). After 2009  there are structural changes     in  the  financial  sector  assets   namely   the  11%  reduction  in  the  share  of  banking  sector  and  IFN     assets  (to  83%)   the  increase  by  approx.  6  pp  of  the  share  of  assets  related  to  the  capital  market     (investment  funds)  7.9%  and  the  increase  by  approx.  5  pp  of  the  share  of  private  pension  funds     assets (to 5.4%).                                                            Graph no. 2 The level of banking intermediation advanced rapidly after 2004     Source  National Bank of Romania  2017               After 1990  in the process of economic reforms and with a nonmodernized banking system      the intermediation rate ranged between 41 and 51% (19941996) matching the NBR's sources.     The  next  period  19972000   after  the  profound  restructuring  of  the  banking  system  the     degree  of  intermediation  fell  to  10%.  But  the  period  of  acceleration  of  privatization  of  banks     followed   including  foreign  capital  flows   which  generated  the  leap  of  intermediation  to  38%  in     2008.     The  postcrisis  period  brought  a  sharp  contraction  of  brokerage  (29%  in  2016)   amid  a     massive  reduction  in  resources  attracted  from  parent  banks  and  a  generally  workable  lack  of     demand   especially  in  strategic  areas  such  as  agriculture  and  rural  development  considered  as  a     sector with banking risk.     Compared to large financial institutions that are often slowed down by old processes and an     inert culture  startups are able to do so by promoting more radical innovations. FinTech has gained     a  significant  attraction  in  recent  years.  Global  investment  has  multiplied  in  2014   reaching  an     investment volume of over $ 12 billion. Looking at global  IT spending  which was estimated at $     215  billion  for  2014  (including  hardware   software   domestic  and  external  IT  services)   the     advantage  is  obvious.  Loans  represent  a  major  subsector  of  FinTech   thus  total  investment  in     FinTech   27%  went  into  consumer  lending  and  16%  in  business  lending.  Corporate  credit     companies include Zopa  Credit Club and SoFi  while companies such as OnDeck or MarketInvoice     lend especially to small businesses.     In addition to debt financing  online crowdfunding platforms such as Seeders  Crowdcube or     OurCrowd  link  companies  and  investors  who  want  to  help  finance  small  businesses  or  newly     created  businesses  by  providing  a  form  of  equity.  Also   bank  transfer  services  provided  by  banks     and  brokers  were  the  only  means  available  to  make  money  transfers  before  FinTech  suppliers     appeared. Companies like WorldRemit  Kantox or CurrencyFair offer international money transfer     and currency exchange  services that involve advances in technology  leading to faster and cheaper     solutions.     Mobile payments enable people to make mobile or personal mobile transactions (companies     such as MPesa (Kenya) or EcoCash (Zimbabwe) are responding to the current challenges  notably     in  terms  of  innovation  in  mobile  phone  payments.  this  technology  aims  to  revolutionize  the  very     concept  of  money  itself.  We’ll  encounter  trading  platforms  where  FinTech's  capital  market     providers  have  grown  in  popularity.  For  platforms  like  eToro   retail  investors  can  provide     information and invest directly in a range. In recent years  the businesstobusiness (B2B) segment     of  the  virtual  space  has  received  increased  attention.  In  the  years  to  come   the  potential  can     significantly increase in this segment with new types of revenuegenerating activities that still have     remains unexploited.     FinTech  has  the  potential  to  become  an  important  player  in  financing  small  businesses.     Appropriate funding access remains one of the most important ingredients for the success of SMEs.     Over  the  past  few  years   a  growing  number  of  business  products  and  models  have  emerged   thus     meeting the needs of small businesses  prefiguring a paradigm shift in finance for small businesses.     At that time  financial technology provided the nucleus of innovation with potential for significant     growth  in  access  to  finance  for  small  businesses.  While  the  limits  are  sometimes  fluid   five  key     products for financing small businesses are highlighted      A. peertopeer loans;     B. Funding of traders and ecommerce;     C. invoicing financing;     D. financing the supply chain;     E. Trade finance.     Together  using these solutions can have enormous positive effects on the balance sheet of     SMEs  leaving smaller businesses more cash  better working capital  management  and more stable     and secure funding.     Peertopeer  loans    this  type  of  loan  was  introduced  with  the  first  platform  launched  in     2005   the  PP  or  peertopeer  (P2P)  market  becoming  a  global  marketplace  with  a  multitude  of     customized   and  with  a  high  estimated  growth  rate.  In  general   the  credit  market  refers  to  the     practice of lending money to borrowers without going through a traditional financial intermediary     such as a bank.     FinTech solution     Lenders on the market aim to provide innovative solutions that banks cannot do. This is due     to a number of factors that determine their model of operation.     First  the unsecured loan is the most common form of lending to the market so far. As such      there  is  no  required  warranty.  Small  businesses  especially  benefit  from  this   especially  in  the     services  sector.  Often   such  businesses  have  fairly  stable  cash  flows   but  no  real  collateral   and     banks can borrow in these conditions.     Secondly  market creditors are not funded as a classic and much regulated financing process     for money depositors. In contrast  in fintech financial services  sources come from funds from retail     or institutional investors with an increased risk of appetite; these are Fintech's main financiers.     Third   market  creditors  apply  innovation  credits  based  on  innovation  and  less  on  scoring     items.  Such  models  are  heavily  based  on  data   use  semiautomatic  risk  assessment  methods  and     stimulate nontraditional data points. Sources may range from online business rating such as Yelp      LinkedIn's  social  network   or  satellite  data  to  assess  the  level  of  wealth  in  a  particular  area.  This     allows credit risk assessment  if banks do not traditionally develop innovations to do so  especially     in  markets  with  limited  credit  (office  information).  Unlike  the  consumer  market   loans   however      always involve a certain degree of human decision.     The  fourth  factor  is  given  by  the  fact  that  FinTech  suppliers  operate  with  a  reduced     operational configuration  without maintaining a certain branch of activity and less staffing to make     underwriting decisions. They can therefore lend competitive rates or incur credit losses at a certain     level and with high risk potential for which they have subscribed.     Overview of the market compared to total bank lending to SMEs with a market of over 14     trillion dollars  while SME lending on the market is still limited in size and scope. Globally  market     lending for $ 60 billion to $ 70 billion in outstanding borrowing volumes in 2014 was recorded. The     countries  with  the  largest  SME  lending  volume  in  terms  of  volume  include  China   The  United     States and the United Kingdom. Since 2014  China has been the largest country with a volume of     loans  issued  through  creditors  on  the  market.  Based  on  estimates   the  market  lending  volume     exceeded  Yuan  RMB  250  million  (Chinese  renminbi)   or  $  40  billion  in  2014   the  number  of     platforms on the market rising to an impressive number of 1 575 platforms compared to only 20 in     2011  the number of these platforms being over 2 000.     The  United  States  has  reported  over  $  5  billion  in  new  loans  for  SMEs  through  fintech     market platforms in 2014  while a volume of over $ 12 billion has been reached in 2015. Among the     most relevant platforms since 2014 we mention OnDeck ($ 1.2 billion)  CAN Capital ($ 1 billion)      Kabbage ($ 400 million)  Merchant Cash & Capital ($ 277 million)  and Strategic Funding ($ 200     million).     This  leaves  significant  potential  untapped.  According  to  estimates   Morgan  Stanley  and     Goldman  Sachs  market  lending  to  SMEs  through  fintech  technology  would  be  about  180  billion     USD.  An  annual  SME  loan  of  47  billion  dollars  can  be  reached  in  2020   which  will  account  for     16% of the total SME loan issue.     The UK market is more fragmented  with over 40% in different operating platforms. Among     the finest operators we mention on RateSetter ($ 457 million) and LendInvest ($ 236 million).     Existing  infrastructure  is  often  a  prerequisite  for  market  models  to  work   especially  for     fintech  models.  This  includes  a  payment  existence  and  banking  infrastructure   which  all  players     need to use. Also  the technical infrastructure  such as the basic one  namely the internet or mobile     connectivity  is particularly necessary especially for the fintech business model.     Alternatively   and  outside  of  the  official  banking  system   mobile  moneylaundering     solutions such as MobileMoney in Romania and Kenya are slowly gaining market share. However      so  far   they  have  not  reached  a  mature  scale  in  financing  small  businesses.  As  a  result   market     lending  now  offers  bank  and  "nonbank"  solutions   in  relation  to  total  nonbank  corporations  or     informal microenterprises. The availability of bank borrower analysis data is another requirement     for  the  lending  market.  Data  may  come  from  credit  bureaus   SME  balance  sheets   or  electronic     accounting systems.     In  many  cases   market  creditors  will  have  to  mobilize  data  from  alternative  data  sources      such  as  mobile   social  media  and  behavioral  models.  However   classical  analysis  data  is  still     preferred.  Typically   more  data  is  available   specifically  on  risk  assessment  and  interest  rate  cuts      and can be offered differently depending on each type of client.     As far as financial regulation is concerned  fintech platforms in many jurisdictions initially     started to operate in a "gray area"  given that the legislation on market lending is not  yet in place.     This usually corresponds to a critical threshold  where innovation goes from "too small to be taken     into account" to "too big to ignore."     However  in order for fintech to be accepted by the market  three central actors are needed      a.  Firstly   there  must  be  a  number  of  wellmaintained  platforms  and  appropriate  operating     systems.  In  general   the  existence  of  a  larger  number  of  platforms  will  help  to  spread  awareness     among  borrowers  and  increase  competition.  Improvements  can  also  be  made   including  lower     operating  costs   better  customer  service  (such  as  video  tips)  or  a  wider  range  of  loan  products.     Increasing  competition  will  force  lenders  to  offer  more  at  competitive  prices.  Similarly   in  the     classical lending market  perceived interest rates have declined considerably in recent years (Manta     O  2017).     b.  Secondly   private  equity  providers  are  needed  to  provide  sufficient  funding  for     sustainable SME development. Globally  institutional investors hold $ 62 billion of financial assets     under management  which may be sufficient to close the SME financing gap more than 20 times.     Investors  need  to  be  aware  and  trust  in  the  existing  forms  of  credit  in  the  market.  Preferably      investors should invest not only on a loan but also to invest higher amounts to invest for a longer     period of time. For example  Blackstone had committed $ 300 million to be lent to Prosper. Victoria     Park Capital announced it will invest up to 230 million euros through Zencap  a European platform.     However  many such institutional creditors need a high level of expected return on their investment     and the risk they take. The expected  results may  vary  with  yields  ranging  from  5% to  more than     10% per year. Therefore  a critical challenge for many FinTech companies as suppliers is to provide     sufficient  attractive  return  for  these  investors   while  on  the  borrower  side  they  need  to  be  more     competitive than banks with low historical refinancing rates.     c. Third  debtors of small businesses must be willing to address the lending markets in their     search  for  funding.  This  requires  both  awareness  of  the  availability  of  market  finance  and     knowledge of how to  access them. Since SMEs do not see that managing  finance is  actually their     force  many never start looking for new information and instead rely on their bank's advice  even if     the bank declines their credit demand. As a recent UK survey showed  most SMEs that did not get     credit from their bank never came to any other source. Therefore  active involvement in education     and  information  on  credit  markets   such  as  available  funding  sources   which  are  needed  to  fund     their work  must be actively involved. Beyond awareness and knowledge  SMEs must also have the     confidence to use this new financial market as a source of funding.     Process facilitators can help players interact perfectly.     By optimizing the investment process  intermediary parties can help bring extra liquidity to     the  market.  Some  innovative  firms  address  the  financial  problem  through  SME  education.  The     American company NerdWallet aims to provide highquality online content on alternative sources     for  consumers  and  small  businesses  to  rank  based  on  Google  searches.  The  reason  for  this  is  that     many small businesses start their financial tracking activity based on web searches.     Thirdparty  service  providers  facilitate  the  process  and  increase  integration.  KYC  and     security providers help verify user identity. Data aggregators (e.g.  Yodlee) synchronize with users'     financial  data  from  different  sources  and  integrate  with  bank  account  information  from  different     financial  institutions   with  data  easily  accessible.  Cooperation  and  partnerships  can  help  increase     market access for creditors. This can take many forms; in partnerships between banks and platforms     (eg  Royal  Bank  of  Scotland  and  Circle  Finance).  Moreover   the  integrated  cooperation  between     institutional investors and platforms  respectively  the bank assumes a substantial amount of capital     to be lent to the platform. Already in 2012  Goldman Sachs provided a significant portion of a $ 100     million  credit  facility  for  OnDeck  SMEs.  A  secondary  market  for  SME  lending  can  help  create     additional  investment  demand.  The  ability  to  resell  credits  allows  investors  to  get  out  of  their     investments before maturity. Some companies already have a second trading platform for the loans     they have created. One of the most advanced secondary markets is in China  where the secondary     trading  volume  in  March  2015  reached  almost  onethird  of  all  new  market  lending.  Financial     securitization  markets  allow  structured  risk  transfer  and  pooling  of  credit.  In  the  European  Union     (EU)   the  specific  objective  of  stimulating  SME  securitization  is  managed  through  certain     programs  such as the SME Initiative Program  with a common funding  being an instrument of the     European  Investment  Bank  (EIB)  and  of  the  European  Investment  Fund  (EIF)   which  aims  to     stimulate SMEs to finance by granting a partial loan for the risk to SMEs. However  most current     solutions  are  adapted  at  the  bank  level  through  interim  securitization.  However   for  large     commercial banks  obtaining liquidity on secondary markets is now less challenging. For example      the  amount  of  guarantees  for  securitized  SMEs  under  the  European  Investment  Fund  (EIF)  credit     enhancement program with less than one billion euros a year. Finally  most of the current European     proposals  are  mainly  adapted  to  "high  quality  securitization".  However   this  approach  may  again     exclude the most creditintensive segment  SMEs that have no access to the bank or bank with the     best possible rating based on traditional bank rating criteria. However  this instrument  embedded     in ongoing initiatives to  redeem the SME securitization market   could continue and stimulate the     growth rate of loans on the SME market.     Systemic inherent risk may be unpredictable     The recent loan default credit default swap creates a "market with interest for SME failures"      similar to the 20072008 financial crisis. In countries where withdrawal is at all times guaranteed to     investors (for example  in China)  this could be possible and would trigger an unpredictable  vicious     circle.  Platforms  need  to  sell  loans  to  provide  liquidity  in  a  declining  market   similar  to  that  of     banks.  To  some  extent   this  was  noticed  during  the  collapse  of  China's  summer  capital  market  in     2015.     P2P  platforms  provided  trading  facilities   which  had  to  be  closed  as  support  market     conditions. As a remedy  third party insurance is that it has to provide security  but in case of major     disturbances   insurance  providers  may  fall.  Finally   hedge  funds  have  recently  begun  to  take     leveraged  investments  and  buy  loans  on  the  market   thus  increasing  the  risk  from  a  systemic     perspective.     In  China   the  development  of  the  FinTech  market  has  been  made  precisely  because  of  the     more relaxed regime of data confidentiality. This allowed Alibaba to rely on their data on millions     of  consumers  to  extend their  loan  offer  to  small  businesses.  However   it  cannot  be  ruled  out  that      implicitly  China could adopt stricter privacy and data security measures in the future.     Perspectives and trends     The  current  market  lending  landscape  is  expected  to  change  significantly  in  the  coming     years   i.e.  the  consolidation  of  market  creditors  is  expected.  Moreover   it  is  expected  to     internationalize  the  players.  Recently   OnDeck  entered  the  Canadian  and  Australian  markets.     However  while a common data and technology  platform can usually be  easily transferred to  new     markets  divergences in regulatory requirements and different customer behaviors limit the speed of     expansion.  Over  time   another  formalization  of  the  industry  is  also  expected.  From  our  point  of     view   industrial  clusters  such  as  the  PeertoPeer  Financing  Association  in  the  UK  need  to  be     formed.     Banking response to new challenges     At  the  same  time   banks  have  become  very  aware  of  the  opportunities  of  financial     technology  and challenges their traditional business model lending to small businesses. According     to  an  industry  survey  in  August  2016   68%  of  bank  respondents  said  their  lending  to  small     businesses  is  in  danger.  Some  banks  will  try  again  to  increase  SME  lending  in  order  to  capture     some of the available market share. Wells Fargo  for example  launched a widespread "Wells Fargo     Work"  initiative  to  place  100  billion  dollars  in  new  small  businesses   i.e.  loans  until  2018.     Internally   banks  will  have  to  further  streamline  processes  for  make  small  business  lending  more     costeffective.     Bank  of  China  has  built  a  "credit  facility"   especially  for  small  business  loans   with  the     standardization  of  internal  processes.  As  a  result   only  four  levels  of  management  are  involved  in     approving a loan  compared to up to 10 levels previously. And sometimes it took several months to     process  loan  applications   now  it  only  takes  an  average  of  four  business  days.  In  this  way   more     than  200 000  SMEs  have  already  been  served.  At  the  same  time   implicit  levels  remained     comparable to credits for larger businesses. Others will track internal innovations and evolve under     online  models  and  under  the  umbrella  of  their  licensed  banking  services.  In  June  2015   Goldman     Sachs  announced  the  launch  of  an  online  platform  for  lending  to  small  businesses.  Funding  was     provided by the bank  the New York State Branch.     Instead of pursuing internal development  banks can also directly acquire market creditors to     keep technology or the team  a practice often called "rapid adaptation."     It  is  still  hard  to  predict  where  the  industry  is  heading  in  the  next  few  years.  However      estimates  are  significant   i.e.  changes  in  the  market  landscape  for  loans  to  small  businesses  are     certainly expected  ideally with a positive effect on them (Manta O  2017).     The new role of public institutions  national and local at international level     Few industries are as regulated as in the financial industry. The question whether and how     quickly FinTech players can replace traditional business models therefore critically depends on the     role  that  regulators   governments  and  international  organizations  choose  to  play.  These  actors      however   are  in  a  biased  situation.  While  FinTech  has  a  tremendous  potential  to  improve  the     situation  for  small  businesses  and  entrepreneurs   regulatory  authorities  must  also  maintain  their     mandates  covering                          A  country  where  government  institutions  seem  to  have  found  a  constructive  path  in  the     middle is the UK. The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) is positioned as a leader in a prospective     exercise  to  establish  the  best  framework  to  support  FinTech  while  developing  a  competitive  and     solid  banking  industry.  Looking  east   China  has  recently  issued  comprehensive  guidelines  for     FinTech's  development   a  differentiated  market  that  allows  both  existing  operators  and  FinTech     Startups to function.     In order for all stakeholders to benefit from the positive benefits that FinTech's industry can     generate   key  objectives  and  principles  are  essential  for  FinTech  regulators   governments  and     players.     Basic principles for FinTech companies     While  supporting  actions  by  regulators  and  governments  are  critical   FinTech  companies     also need to contribute their share of creating a collaborative environment.     Compliance  FinTech must always comply with the strictest standard available. This will not     only  prevent  costly  adjustments  to  their  business  model  later   it  will  also  signal  the  desire  to     cooperate with regulators. The company that found out this was Prosper creditor. In 2008  the US     Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  found  that  Prosper  Dependent  Borrower  issued  credit  notes     that were securities that had been sold without registration or applicable exemption. The action was     "stop  and  quit"   the  letter  of  November  2008  that  effectively  stopped  Prosper  with  all  the  money     borrowed   and  asked  the  company  to  fully  relaunch  its  business    which  is  finally  succeeding      setting a precedent for many fintech players (Manta O  2017)     Organization  Regulators often criticize fragmentation from the FinTech landscape. "Whom     I call if I want to talk about peer loans " said the executive director of a regulatory body complains.     Some verticals of the industry began to be organized at national level. Meanwhile  in the UK  the     UK  P2P  Finance  Association  (P2PFA)  has  become  a  credible  partner  player  and  conversation  for     civil servants. P2PFA represents over 90% of the UK peertopeer loan market  including consumer     lending   business  crediting   and  billing.  Its  membership  base  includes  all  major  national  players     such as Funding Center  LendInvest  MarketInvoice  RateSetter  ThinCats and Zopa.     Opportunities for development finance institutions     A group of institutions that have significantly contributed financially to SMEs in the past is     international  to  IFIs  such  as  the  IFC   the  European  Bank  for  Reconstruction  and  Development     (EBRD)  the European Investment Bank (EIB) or the Bank (DFI)  such as those based on the US      the  Overseas  Private  Investment  Corporation   the  British  CDC  Group  or  the  Dutch  Bank  for     Development  FMO.  They  are  governmental  organizations  controlled  by  institutions  that  invest  in     sustainable  private  sector  development  projects  in  order  to  stimulate  development  in  developing     countries (Manta O  2017).     Ways to support SME finance     Traditionally  a number of instruments have been applied by IFIs and DFIs  In many cases      DFIs  provide  direct  funding  to  local  banks   which  is  transferred  to  small  businesses  according  to     predefined  criteria.  A  recent  example  is  the  $  12  million  loan  from  the  EBRD  to  SMEs  to  a     Belarusian private banking company. In other cases  DFI offers risk sharing  such as first loss items     for  certain  tranche  loans.  In  terms  of  capital   DFIs  also  take  the  equity  investment  or  invest  as  a     limited partner in private equity funds that offer venture capital to small businesses. Over the years      only the EBRD has invested in more than 150 private equity funds.     All  investments  must  meet  three  general  criteria   they  must  be  additional   i.e.  where     investors  are  informed  about  the  transactions    do  not  go  to  avoid  "elimination";  they  must  be     focused  i.e. attracting money from other investors to be viable  that is to ensure longterm viability.     Given the  complex nature of setting  up  and monitoring the contract  and the agreement with  local     banks  usually the investments tend to have a volume of about $ 10 million up to $ 50 million.     Can  FinTech  change  small  businesses   FinTech  has  recently  attracted  public  attention  and     could become one of the strongest tools to support small businesses and thus stimulate sustainable     growth of global economies? Multiproduct market lending solutions offer tremendous potential for     improving  small  business  financing  because  institutional  capital  is  immediately  available.  Market     creditors connect to risktaking institutions for small businesses in need of funding. On the Internet     platforms   payment  processors  and  telecom  companies  can  rely  on  existing  business  relationships     and make use of customer knowledge. Funding through platforms can provide an effective tool to     overcome the liquidity shortage and improve the small business capital situation. The online supply     chain  of  finances  will  further  integrate  existing  supply  chains  and  lead  to  positive  results  for  all     parties involved. FinTech in  trade finance is  still at  an early stage  but  promises great  potential to     unlock a global customer base for small  businesses. Governments  can set the right  incentives  and     can provide direct support to help national industries develop through FinTech's solution.     Regulatory  bodies  can  create  positive  and  coherent  cooperation  in  promoting  innovative     solutions.  At  the  same  time   however   it  must  ensure  the  protection  of  individuals  and  systemic     viability by establishing appropriate framework regulations for this new form of funding (Manta O.      2017).     Some  data  provided  to  the  NBR  that  should  allow  each  of  us  to  reflect  and  identify     specialist’s solutions      1.  From  the  total  capital  of  Romania   at  the  end  of  2014   the  financial  capital  represents     only 30% (70% nonfinancial capital  tangible and intangible assets);     2.  Within  the  financial  capital   foreign  capital  has  become  preponderant  since  2008  and     represents 62% in 2015 compared to only 38% of the domestic capital;     3.  Foreign  capital  inflows  over  the  period  20042008  (with  an  annual  average  of  14%  of     GDP)  allowed  for  a  sharp  rise  in  the  investment  rate  well  above  the  saving  →     unsustainable  current  account  deficits  (14%  in  2007  and  12  %  in  2008)  →  substantial     currency  imbalance   which  required  major  internal  economic  correction  in  20092010     and  funding  of  approx.  EUR  17.9  billion  from  international  financial  institutions  in     20092012 (from EUR 18.9 billion initially contracted);     4.  fiscal  procyclical  policies  and  boombased  revenue  →  accentuating  the  postcrisis     budget  deficit →  tripling  public  debt   from  13%  of  GDP  in  2008  to  37.6%  of  GDP  in     2016;     5.  The  GDP  per  capita  evolution  of  Romania  in  20032016  and  the  comparison  of  its     dynamics with other former socialist countries → NATO entry and EU accession were     decisive moments for the development and modernization of the Romanian economy →     was  the  only  solution  viable  and  efficient  for  the  irreversible  orientation  of  Romania     towards the values of Western democracies with a reasonable costbenefit ratio.     6.  Monetary and prudential measures of the NBR have helped to strengthen the resilience     of  the  banking  system  to  shocks  →  Additional  liquidity  and  capital  buffers  →  Bank     overrun  of  the  recent  crisis  without  the  use  of  public  funds  →  Maintaining  financial     stability;     7.  Deep  economic  reforms  applied  after  1990   including  the  privatization  of  stateowned     banks   foreign  capital  inflows   the  crisis   massive  outflows  of  postcrisis  banks   the     consolidation  of  the  banking  system  →  large  fluctuations  in  banking  intermediation      51% in 1996; 10% in 2001; 39% in 2009; 29% in 2016.
