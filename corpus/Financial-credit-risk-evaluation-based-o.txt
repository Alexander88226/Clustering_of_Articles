Introduction  Small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) have generally played the most significant role in the development of the national and provincial economies in China. SMEs have made  great  strides  that  have  accounted  for  over  98%  of  all  enterprises  contributed more  than  60%  of  growth  in  GDP  and  foreign  trade  for  economic  development nationwide provided over 80% of job opportunities and more than 50% of business revenues.  Although  SMEs  have  experienced  an  overall  performance  that  would  be characterized  as excellent  and have an irreplaceable  role in  promoting  the national economy their financial environment has been and remains susceptible and sensitive to changing financial conditions at all levels.  Overall  SMEs  face  greater  financial  constraints  than  do  larger  firms.  There  are measures  that  are  intended  to  alleviate  the  financial  constraints  of  SMEs  such  as leasing and factoring that are helpful in facilitating access to finance in the absence of welldeveloped  financial  institutions.  Numerous  studies  have  argued  that  SMEs  are financially more constrained than are large firms.  SMEs are major players in the economy such that the current financial market failure is an obstacle to their expansion and growth. For this reason SMEs need administrative and financial support from governments at all levels. However despite the growing interest  in  subsidizing  SMEs  there  are  concerns  about  whether  these  measures  are helpful and sufficient. According to statistics from the People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bank of China SMEs have obtained bank loans that account for 16% of the loans of financial institutions and bank supporting loans to SMEs lie in the range 30%  40%. Moreover virtually 80% of SMEs are experiencing capital circulation problems.    As SMEs have not received financial support relative to the contribution they have made to the economy their financial problems have become a barrier that affects the  3 \\x0csustainable development of SMEs. Given this background the financial supply chain enters  as  an  important  participant  to  the  financial  system  with  associated  financial credit risks.  The remainder of the paper is as follows. Section 2 gives a literature review including the  definition of supply chain finance credit risk evaluation of supply chain finance and risk control for supply chain finance. The theory of Supply Chain Financial Core Enterprise Risks is discussed in Section 3 including credit guarantee and operational risk. Section 4 presents the Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) framework including the fuzzy judgment matrix and a check for its consistency the weight vector and  composite  weight  vector.  The  empirical  analysis  is  evaluated  in  Section  5 including a discussion of core enterprises an evaluation system of the core enterprise credit  risk  and  model  construction  and  solution.  Some  concluding  remarks  are presented in Section 6.  2. Literature Review  International research on supply chain finance started before similar developments in China  the  mode  of  operation  is  more  mature  and  the  achievements  are  relatively advanced. Regarding relationship between supply chain and financing [1] Berger et.al. (2006)  advanced  the  conceptual  framework  for  the  development  and  financing  of global small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) and established the idea of supply chain  finance.  [2]  Klapper  (2005)  analyzed  the  principles  underlying  the  inventory financing  model  and  the  functions  that  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  had adopted in the supply chain.  The development of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supply chain finance began around 2000.  In 2005 the financing mode of \\xe2\\x80\\x9c1 plus N\\xe2\\x80\\x9d implemented by the Shenzhen Development Bank (since  4 \\x0crenamed the Ping An Bank) offered a $250 billion credit line making 25% profit with the nonperforming loans accounting for 0.57% of all supply chain finance.  In recent years supply chain finance has been developing rapidly. Statistics show that by the end of 2015 60% of SMEs had chosen supply chain finance to alleviate the shortage of business liquidity. However as an innovative financing method supply chain finance also has certain risks such as the financing of small and mediumsized enterprise core banks whereby one party\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit problems can lead to the failure of supply chain financing and the loss of other participants. While SMEs are undoubtedly the engine of economic growth their speed of growth will be dampened by market imperfections  and  institutional  weaknesses  (for  further  details  see  [3]  Beck  and DemirgucKunt (2006)).  2.1 Definition of Supply Chain Finance  According to the definition of Supply Chain Finance (SCF) in [4] Hofmann (2005) it relies  on  two  or  more  organizations  in  the  supply  chain  to  cooperate  on  financial resources  to  create  extra  values  jointly  although  these  organizations  remain independent. [5] Pfohl and Gomm (2009) argued that SCF could raise the value of participating firms in the supply chain in addition to the value of leading firms in the supply chain.  According  to  [6]  Gupta  and  Dutta  (2011)  with  increasingly  fierce  competition  it becomes more important to improve the efficiency of working capital by using cash that is trapped in the financial supply chain (FSC). [7] Mathis and Cavinato (2010) argued that banks should play a more active role in the FSC to integrate the resources in the chain. [8] Silvestro and Lustrato (2014) showed that banks are key players that can offer alternative supply chain solutions in the FSC.   5 \\x0c[9] Blackman et al. (2013) proposed a formal definition that a financial supply chain is  the  network  of  organisations  and  banks  that  coordinate  the  flow  of  financial transactions through shared information systems to facilitate a product supply chain between trading partners.    SCF  can  be  defined  in  many  ways.  The  analysis  of  the  different  definitions  and conceptual  contributions  highlights  two  major  perspectives  on  SCF  which  can  be identified as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinancialoriented\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (from which a further \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbuyerdriven perspective\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can  be  identified)  and  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csupply  chainoriented\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  The  financial  perspective  interprets SCF as a set of (innovative) financial solutions (for further details see [10] Caniato et al. 2016)).  SCF has increasingly become a hot topic in supply chain management and a growing product category of financial institutions (FIs). In China SCF is experiencing a rapid development  stage  and  numerous  FIs  have  begun  to  focus  on  developing  and designing new SCF services and products to solve the financing issues facing SMEs. SCF  is  a  channel  for  financing  which  manages  plans  and  controls  all  cash  flows across supply chain members to improve the turnover efficiency of working capital. In  SCF  SMEs  obtain  loans  with  looser  constraints  from  banks  through  expanded credit  lines.  Core  enterprises  (CEs)  alleviate  the  pressure  of  funding  and  financial intermediaries dramatically increase their incomes.    More  specifically  SCF  significantly  decreases  the  credit  risk  of  SMEs  for  FIs. Nevertheless SCF cannot completely eliminate credit risk which continue to be one of the major threats to FIs. Moreover SCF has been promoted for almost ten years and  has  experienced  slow  development  in  China  because  there  is  not  as  yet  an appropriate  SME  credit  risk  evaluation  index  system  or  an  outstanding  prediction model which hinders SCF (for further details see [11] Zhu et al. 2016)).   6 \\x0cSCF is concerned with the capital flows within a supply chain an area that has often been  neglected  in  the  past.  Nevertheless  SCF  does  have  an  impact  on  a  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s capability  for  adopting  sustainable  supply  chain  management  (SCM)  practices  (for further details see [12] Liu et al. (2015)).    2.2 Credit Risk Evaluation of Supply Chain Finance  In China SMEs are the main applicants of SCF so that banks suffer from credit risk in  SCF  when  the  SMEs  cannot  honour  agreements  and  contracts.  It  is  generally agreed that structuring the SME credit risk evaluation index system is the greatest and most critical challenge to bank management of SCF and is fundamental to credit loan decision  making.  A  good  credit  risk  evaluation  index  system  can  guarantee profitability  and  stability  of  a  FI  whereas  a  poor  system  can  potentially  lead  to significant losses (for further details see [11] Zhu et al. 2016)).    In previous studies the experts and scholars pay more attention to the credit risk of SMEs while neglecting the credit risk of core enterprises which is one of the main financial entities of the supply chain. In fact the core enterprises\\xe2\\x80\\x99 credit risk is the key to influence the effective implementation of supply chain finance.  [13] Feldmann and M\\xc3\\xbcller (2003) emphasized the role of asymmetric information held by supply chain partners who are opportunistically behaved. [7] Silvestro and Lustrato (2014) argued that the factors that could affect the risk of SCF include supply chain coordination cooperation and information sharing.  [14] Berger and Udell (1998) found that small firms have limited access to external financing and were more tighly constrained in their operations both in developing and developed countries. [15] Galindo and Schiantarelli (2003) drew the same conclusion for countries in Latin America.   7 \\x0c[16] Schiffer and Weder (2001) found that small firms consistently face greater growth obstacles than do large firms which implies that size is one of the most reliable factors for financing obstacles confronting firms except for age and ownership of firms (for further details see [17] Beck et. al 2006).  [18] Song and Zipkin (2009) analyzed the methods for determining the quality of goods in the pawn financing process. Moreover an investigation by [19] Wuttke et al. (2013) indicated that it is better for the supply chain enterprises of SMEs to adopt a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpre\\xe2\\x80\\x93shipment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  financing  model  in  preference  to  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpostshipment\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  funding  model. Furthermore  both  corporations  and  banks  have  shown  great  interest  in  using  SCF techniques  to  ease  their  tensions  in  the  supply  chain  and  also  in  making  large corporations shorten the payment periods for their key suppliers (for further details see [20] Randall et. al 2009)).  [11]  Zhu  et  al.  (2016)  proposed  an  SME  credit  risk  evaluation  index  system specifically designed for SCF. This system is used to evaluate the credit risks from different  points  of  view  which  not  only  consist  of  financial  and  nonfinancial conditions  of  SMEs  but  also  contain  the  financial  and  nonfinancial  conditions  of CEs  the  operational  status  of  the  entire  supply  chain  and  the  transactional relationship between SMEs and CEs (for further details see [11] Zhu et al. 2016)).    Therefore measuring and evaluating the credit level of core enterprises and controlling the credit risk of core  enterprises  are the keys to using supply  chain finance in an efficient manner.  2.3 Risk Control for Supply Chain Finance  As mentioned above there has been substantial and informative research on supply chain finance for SMEs. Nevertheless there remain some limitations. There has been little research on collaborative supply chain finance for SMEs and the research has not  8 \\x0cnecessarily been systematic. Some studies have concentrated on one aspect to solve the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMacmillan gap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d but have ignored systematic analysis and the overall optimization of supply chain finance for SMEs.  [21]  Lee  and  Rhee  (2011)  demonstrated  that  through  the  coordination  and establishment of commercial credit among SMEs the results of risk control for supply chain  finance  of  SMEs  are  better  than  those  of  financial  risk  control  by  financial institutions for the individual companies.  The  apparent  ability  of  some  supply  chains  to  recover  from  inevitable  risk  events more  effectively  than  do  others  has  recently  triggered  a  debate  about  supply  chain resilience (SCRES). While SCRM focuses on the identification and management of risks  for  the  supply  chain  in  order  to  reduce  its  vulnerability  SCRES  aims  at developing the adaptive capability to prepare for unexpected and contingent events to respond to disruptions and subsequently recover from them (for further details see [22] J\\xc3\\xbcttner and Maklan 2011)).  3. Theory of Supply Chain Financial Core Enterprise Risks  In  supply  chain  finance  core  enterprises  are  the  exchange  centre  of  capital  flows information  flows  and  logistics  and  play  an  important  role  in  the  supply  chain financing. The risks can vary including three major risks namely credit guarantee and operational risks which are discussed below.  3.1 Credit Risk  Core enterprises play an important role in supply chain finance and play key roles in connecting the supply chain capital flows information flows and logistics. Banks are based on the core enterprise\\xe2\\x80\\x99 strength and credit guarantee and select the upstream and  9 \\x0cdownstream  enterprises  to  perform  credit  activities.  Therefore  the  core  enterprise conditions and development prospects determine the smooth operation of the supply chain. The credit status of core business problems will inevitably spread to the supply chain  with  the  upstream  and  downstream  enterprises  thereby  affecting  the  overall supply chain finance security and operational efficiency and leading to supply chain financing failure.  Core  enterprise  credit  risk  manifests  itself  in  two  respects.  The  core  enterprise  can undertake  the  entire  supply  chain  finance  guarantee  function  when  they  are experiencing  poor  management  themselves.  Moreover  the  core  enterprise  may  be confronted with a credit crisis due to bonding credit which exceeds its credit capacity resulting  in  financing  failure.  As  the  core  enterprise  development  prospects  are  not encouraging their power is diminished.    A core enterprise may conceal their real transaction records with different parties in the supply chain which leads to false financing. This can affect their actual performance so that they will not be able to satisfy the conditions of the agreement with the bank in which case the SMEs financing will eventually fail.  3.2 Guarantee Risk  For the core enterprise the socalled guarantee risk arises in financing when SMEs break  a  contract.  When  SMEs  cannot  continue  payments  of  bank  loans  the  core enterprise as a guarantor of SMEs has to bear the associated bank losses. In supply chain finance guarantees by the core enterprise of the credit situation of SMEs leads to a greater strength of SMEs and the possibility of reducing the risk of banks in lending money to SMEs through promoting enterprise production and business development. If the core enterprise intends to give credit to SMEs the core enterprise should be careful in  selecting  SMEs  in  the  supply  chain  that  are  financially  strong  so  as  to  reduce guarantee risk. 10  \\x0c 3.3 Operational Risk  In  the  process  of  supply  chain  financing  many  of  the  required  steps  need  to  be confirmed manually so operational risk needs to be accommodated. The operation of the three main financing risk are also different. For example the operational risk of accounts receivable financing mode focuses primarily on the management of accounts receivable.    The existence of sales discounts will lead to errors when the accounts receivable are checked. Moreover given the fact that receivables financing is a repeatedly regular procedure  the  payments  and  actual  deviations  occur  when  the  core  enterprises  are confirming  such  payments.  In  addition  the  accounts  receivable  settlements  involve enterprises  and  many  settlement  accounts.  As  the  procedures  for  repayment  can  be complicated  especially  when  the  methods  for  the  accounts  receivable  transfer payments change operational errors are more prone to occur thereby leading to greater operational risk.  Overall the greatest influence on the supply chain of the three different types of risks mentioned above is financial credit risk. As the main participant in the supply chain the core enterprise credit level has a significant influence on the success in financing. In order to reduce the financial risks of the supply chain the effective control of core enterprise credit risk is fundamental.  4. Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) Framework  [23]  Saaty  (1990)  introduced  a  multifactors  decision  making  approach  in  which factors are arranged in a hierarchical structure. In order to apply the FAHP method it is necessary to construct a hierarchy that expresses the relative values of a set of attributes.  11 \\x0cDecision makers evaluate the relative importance of the attributes in each level based on the FAHP scale which in turn is used to direct them to express their preferences between each pairwise comparison. Then the decision makers are required to determine whether the element is of equal importance somewhat more important much more important  very  much  more  important  or  absolutely  important  relative  to  another element.    These important intensities are respectively converted to numeral values in the FAHP Scale as 1 3 5 7 9 and 2 4 6 8 as the intermediate values (see Table 1). By using this scale the qualitative judgments of evaluators are converted into quantitative values which enable construction of a pairwise comparison matrix. The pairwise comparison matrix is made for all elements to be considered in the construct hierarchy. The results from these comparisons are used to calculate a list of relative weights and importance of  the  factors  (eigenvectors)  based  on  the  rapid  application  development  (RAD) method.  Table 1                                                      FAHP Scale   Intensity of Linguistic variable Positive Positively AHP Scale value reciprocal value 1 3 5 7 9 The same important (1 1 1) (1 1 1) Weakly more important (2 3 4) (1/4 1/3 1/2) Fairly more important (4 5 6) (1/6 1/5 1/4) Strongly more important (6 7 8) (1/8 1/7 1/6) Absolutely more important (8 9 10) (1/10 1/9 1/8) 2 468 Intermediate values    12 \\x0c   4.1 Fuzzy Judgment Matrix  Fuzzy judgment matrix can be used to compare the importance of different indicators. The level of importance of two elements are assumed to be incorporated into an index labelled as T and the hierarchical elements a1 a2 a3 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 an represent the existing fuzzy relation all of which constitute a fuzzy matrix as given below          In the fuzzy T index matrix rij denotes a judgment value which represents the extent to which  ai is much more important than is aj  when the  two elements  ai and  aj  are compared.  Pairwise  comparisons  among  the  main  factors  subfactors  and  alternatives  are produced based on the typical ninepoint scale combined with fuzzy numbers. The next step  is  to  calculate  the  priority  weights  of  factors  subfactors  and  alternatives  by adopting the FAHP approach.    The  idea  of  calculating  the  priority  weights  of  attributes  is  based  on  the  pairwise comparisons given in the questionnaire. In doing so a set of comparison questions are  13 \\x0cproposed in order to ask the experts their opinions. The higher is the evaluation the greater will be the importance of a factor.    Corresponding to three levels of the hierarchical model the experts first evaluate the four main factors in the second level with respect to the overall goal. In the third level pairwise comparisons of alternatives are made with respect to the overall goal.    In order to obtain the quantitative value of the compared importance between each two indicators fuzzy numerical values from 1 to 9 are employed as shown in Table 1. With such  comparisons  between  each  two  factors  the  fuzzy  judgment  matrix  can  be constructed.    4.2 Fuzzy Judgment Matrix Consistency Check  A  consistency  check  is  the  first  condition  for  calculating  the  weights.  Only  if  the consistency  meets  the  requirements  can  the  model  be  solved.  A  relatively  simple judgment method is based on the following formula  . CI (A W) =  \\xe2\\x88\\x91\\xe2\\x88\\x9112nnni1=j1=aij\\xe2\\x88\\x92\\xcf\\x89 . ijThe acceptable condition for the consistency judgment is CI (A W) \\xe2\\x89\\xa4\\xce\\xb1 where the implication of \\xce\\xb1is the attitude of the decision maker. The higher is the consistency of the fuzzy judgment matrix required by the decision maker the smaller will be the value of \\xce\\xb1. The value of \\xce\\xb1 is most suitable when it is set to 0.01.  4.3 Weight Vector of Criterion Layer B   14 \\x0cThe determination of the weight vector is the key to the fuzzy judgment matrix which can be obtained after sorting out the results of the questionnaire given by the experts. The formula given in equation (1) is used to solve the weight vector for each criterion layer.  The  weight  given  to  each  expert  is  multiplied  by  the  weight  vector  and  the weight  vector  of  the  elements  at  the  B  layer  such  that \\xf0\\x9d\\x9c\\x94\\xf0\\x9d\\x90\\xb5=(\\xf0\\x9d\\x9c\\x941\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xf0\\x9d\\x9c\\x94\\xf0\\x9d\\x91\\x9b)  can  be obtained as follows  n\\xe2\\x88\\x91j= 1=i\\xcf\\x89aij1\\xe2\\x88\\x92+n2n              for any i = 12 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 n.               (1)     4.4 Weight Vector of Index Layer C to Criterion Layer B   Each decision making expert takes the B layer elements as the criterion and gives the fuzzy judgment matrix which is obtained by the C level elements compares two fuzzy judgment matrix by using the same method and thereby obtains the weight vector of each element of the C layer.  4.5 Composite Weight Vector   After  calculating  the  priority  weight  vectors  of  the  B  and  C  layers  the  following n\\xe2\\x88\\x91i1=formula in equation (2)    j\\xcf\\x89=   ijwiw           (2) 15 \\x0cis used to compute the composite weight vector and the priority weight vector of the different indexes to obtain the credit risk. The key risk factors can then be identified. In the formula    \\xcf\\x89j    is the index values of No. j element wi is the weight vector of the   No. i criterion layer  index value.     wij is the weight vector of the No. i criterion layer of the No. j      5. Empirical Analysis  5.1 Introduction to Core Enterprises  The Wuhan Iron and Steel Group is affiliated to the stateowned SASAC important backbone enterprises has a good credit rating and substantial financial strength. It is among  the  core  enterprises  in  the  supply  chain  finance.  The  Wuhan  Iron  and  Steel Group is in the production stage of the three stages of product supply production and sales.    The  upstream  enterprises  act  primarily  as  steel  materials  suppliers  which  are responsible for the mining of steel. The Wuhan Iron and Steel Group has applied to various  banks  for  financial  loans  by  means  of  the  receivables  documents  in  the financing process.      Downstream enterprises are mainly steel dealers which are responsible for the sales of steel. During the financing process they select the financing mode of prepayment to purchase and apply for loans based on sales contracts.    The China Industrial Bank (CIB) has been cooperating with the Wuhan Iron and Steel Group  in  the  supply  chain  finance  since  2002.  Until  December  2015  the  China  16 \\x0cIndustrial Bank had 53 credit lines among the upstream and downstream dealers of the Wuhan Iron and Steel Group with a credit amount that exceeded RMB 1.536 billion. The nonperforming loan ratio of the upstream and downstream enterprises is very low almost close to zero which is a successful case of the implementation of supply chain finance.  5.2. Evaluation System of the Core Enterprise Credit Risk  The core enterprise risk control is the most important factor in the supply chain risk. For this reason the construction of the core enterprise credit risk system is very important. This paper constructs a layer analysis using four approaches toward risk namely the core  enterprise  industry  position  management  perspective  asset  status  and  credit record.  5.2.1  Core enterprise industry status (B1)    The achievement of interenterprise transactions not only relies on the quality of goods but also the industry status as the focus of attention. In general the core enterprise industry status has a significant effect on their business conditions. This paper selects the macroscopic environment and the development situation of the enterprises as the secondary index of industry status evaluation.  5.2.2  Core enterprise operations (B2)    Banks are more concerned about the operation of the core enterprise with guarantees. The reason is that the core enterprise needs to assume the guarantee obligation in case of default by the SMEs. If the core enterprises do not have high solvency the banks will not be in a position to  offer loans to the SMEs as they need to  consider their own financial  interests.  The  operating  performance  of  the  core  enterprises  is  mainly  17 \\x0creflected in the three indicators of profitability operating capacity and solvency. This paper selects these three indexes as the secondary indicators in the evaluation system.  5.2.3  Asset status of the core enterprises (B3)    The main premise of bank loans is that the core enterprise provides security for SMEs such  that  when  SMEs  breach  their  contracts  the  core  enterprises  will  accept  their responsibility for the guarantees thereby compensating the banks and reducing bank losses. Therefore the asset status of the core enterprise is also an important focus of bank inspections. In this way the ability of the core enterprise to cash financial assets is stronger than that of the monetary funds receivable accounts and inventories. This paper  will  take  the  three  items  as  the  secondary  index  of  the  current  asset  status evaluation.  5.2.4  Core enterprise credit history (B4)    The key to the successful financing of SMEs is the core enterprise credit guarantees to be  bundled  together  with  SMEs  to  form  the  overall  credit.  However  if  the  credit situation of the core enterprise is poor even if the SMEs and the core enterprise credit guarantees  are  bundled  together  the  bank  will  not  make  the  loans  accessible.  This paper selects the credit rating and the previous performance namely the credit history as the secondary index.  The hierarchy of the evaluation system of core enterprise credit risk can constructed as shown in Figure 1. It is divided into three levels and arranged in descending order. The first level presents the overall goal which is the risk evaluation of supply chain financial core enterprises (A) and is situated at the top of the hierarchy. In the second level  four  major  factors  are  inserted  into  the  model  namely  industry status  (B1) operation condition (B2) asset state (B3) and credit record (B4). Each factor includes several subfactors in the third level of the hierarchy.   18  \\x0c The industry status factor is explained by two subfactors namely macroenvironment (C1)  and  enterprise  development  (C2).  The  operation condition includes  operation ability (C3) profitability (C4) and solvency (C5). The asset state consists of monetary fund (C6) accounts receivable (C7) and inventory (C8). The credit history includes enterprise credit rating (C9) and past performance (C10).     Core enterprise credit risk evaluation system hierarchical graph  Figure 1       5.3 Model Construction and Solution  By  using  the  risk  evaluation  system  that  was  described  above  including  4  risk categories and 10 risk factors the risk identification model was constructed using a  19 \\x0cfuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP) and the model was thereby solved. In this paper  the  core  enterprise  employees  are  divided  into  four  categories  namely managerial  staff  senior  engineers  middlelevel  employees  and  general  employees. The  questionnaire  is  scored  according  to  four  types  of  employees  with  the  fuzzy matrices given as B1 B1 B2 B3 and B4.  These 4 categories of employees are given different weights specifically managerial staff  0.3  senior  engineers  0.3  middlelevel  staff  0.2  and  general  employees  0.2. Various types of employees on the Blayer elements are compared pairwise and the fuzzy judgment matrix is thereby obtained       The  fuzzy  judgment  matrix  is  used  to  determine  the  fuzzy  consistency  of  the  four matrices namely B1 B2 B3 B4 and the weight order vectors that is \\xcf\\x89B1\\xef\\xbc\\x8c\\xcf\\x89B2\\xef\\xbc\\x8c\\xcf\\x89B3\\xef\\xbc\\x8c\\xcf\\x89B4  can be solved. By taking B1 as an example the solution is given as   20 \\x0c    Therefore   \\xcf\\x89B1 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.2 0.35 0.3 0.15\\xef\\xbc\\x89.   Similarly   \\xcf\\x89B2 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.1 0.35 0.35 0.2\\xef\\xbc\\x89  \\xcf\\x89B3 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.1 0.3 0.4 0.2\\xef\\xbc\\x89  \\xcf\\x89B4 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.075 0.35 0.45 0.125\\xef\\xbc\\x89.  Given the above the weight of the four categories of employees can be added and the Blevel weight vector can be obtained as follows   21 \\x0c  As a result the weight vector of the criterion layer to the target layer is (0.125 0.34 0.36 0.17). Given the construction the total weight vector of the criterion layer to the target layer can be determined as follows the core enterprise asset weight is 0.365 and is ranked first; the operating weight is 0.33 which is ranked second; the credit record weight is 0.17 thereby being ranked third; the industry position weight is 0.125 and is ranked fourth.    The ranking constructed above shows that commercial banks are primarily concerned with the asset status of  the core enterprise followed by the core enterprise operation then the credit record  of  the  core enterprise and finally the core enterprise industry status.  Under the premise of calculating the weight of the criterion layer the weight value of each risk factor in the index layer can also be obtained. According to the questionnaire survey results of the four kinds of employees the 10 risk factors in the index layer are compared with each other the fuzzy judgment matrix is constructed and the single ranking weight vector is obtained according to the judgment matrix.     22 \\x0cIn this paper the weight vector of the criterion layer B to each element in the C layer is taken as an example. The fuzzy judgment matrix C1k\\xef\\xbc\\x88k = 1234\\xef\\xbc\\x89 is constructed as follows        23 \\x0c      The same method is used to obtain the weight vector namely   24 \\x0c   Therefore   \\xcf\\x89C1 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.17 0.11 0.05 0.11 0.14 0.07 0.1 0.14 0.02 0.07\\xef\\xbc\\x89     Similarly\\xef\\xbc\\x9a   \\xcf\\x89C2 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.1 0.11 0.15 0.15 0.09 0.12 0.06 0.1 0.09 0.03\\xef\\xbc\\x89  \\xcf\\x89C3 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.08 0.06 0.13 0.11 0.16 0.12 0.14 0.07 0.06 0.07\\xef\\xbc\\x89    25 \\x0c\\xcf\\x89C4 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.08 0.07 0.15 0.06 0.14 0.17 0.12 0.09 0.04 0.08\\xef\\xbc\\x89  Based on the weight vector of the four kinds of employee fuzzy judgment matrix the weight coefficients of four kinds of employees are added to obtain the group weight vector as follows  \\xcf\\x89C1 = 0.3\\xc3\\x970.17\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.3\\xc3\\x970.1\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.08\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.08=0.113  \\xcf\\x89C2 = 0.3\\xc3\\x970.11\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.3\\xc3\\x970.11\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.06\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.07=0.092  \\xcf\\x89C3 = 0.3\\xc3\\x970.05\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.3\\xc3\\x970.15\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.13\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.15=0.116  \\xcf\\x89C4 = 0.3\\xc3\\x970.11\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.3\\xc3\\x970.15\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.11\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.06=0.112  \\xcf\\x89C5 = 0.3\\xc3\\x970.14\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.3\\xc3\\x970.09\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.16\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.14=0.129  \\xcf\\x89C6 = 0.3\\xc3\\x970.07\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.3\\xc3\\x970.12\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.12\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.17=0.115  \\xcf\\x89C7 = 0.3\\xc3\\x970.1\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.3\\xc3\\x970.06\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.14\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.12=0.1  \\xcf\\x89C8 = 0.3\\xc3\\x970.14\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.3\\xc3\\x970.1\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.07\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.09=0.104  \\xcf\\x89C9 = 0.3\\xc3\\x970.02\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.3\\xc3\\x970.09\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.06\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.04=0.044  \\xcf\\x89C10 = 0.3\\xc3\\x970.07\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.3\\xc3\\x970.03\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.07\\xef\\xbc\\x8b0.2\\xc3\\x970.08=0.075   Therefore the weight vector of the criterion layer B1 to the index layer is given as   26 \\x0c\\xcf\\x89C1 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.113 0.092 0.116 0.112 0.129 0.115 0.1 0.104 0.044 0.075\\xef\\xbc\\x89.  Similarly the weight vectors of the criterion layers B2 B3 B4 to the index layer C can be summarized as given below.  The weight vector of the criterion layer B2 to the index layer is given as  \\xcf\\x89C2 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.078 0.072 0.127 0.12 0.095 0.135 0.102 0.094 0.072 0.105.  The weight vector of criterion layer B3 to the index layer is given as  \\xcf\\x89C3 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.079 0.072 0.125 0.141 0.116 0.112 0.097 0.08 0.079 0.099\\xef\\xbc\\x89.  The weight vector of criterion layer B4 to the index layer is given as  \\xcf\\x89C4 =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.085 0.089 0.129 0.125 0.107 0.111 0.092 0.116 0.079 0.067\\xef\\xbc\\x89.  The weight vector \\xcf\\x89C of the target layer can be obtained by calculating the criterion layer weight vector for the target layer and the index layer. Taking C1 as the index the weight vector of the operating capacity is calculated as   0.125 \\xc3\\x97 0.133 + 0.34 \\xc3\\x97 0.078 + 0.365 \\xc3\\x97 0.079 + 0.17 \\xc3\\x97 0.085 = 0.08393.    Similarly we can derive the weight vector of 10 risk factors in the index layer as    \\xcf\\x89C    =\\xef\\xbc\\x880.0839    0.0774    0.1252    0.1275    0.109    0.120    0.0982    0.0939   0.0723    0.0926). 27 \\x0c  According  to  the  degree  of  importance  10  risk  factors  were  ranked  as  follows profitability (0.1275) operating capacity (0.1252) monetary fund (0.120) solvency (0.109) accounts receivable (0.0982) inventory (0.0939) past performance (0.0926) macroenterprise  environment  (0.0839)  enterprise  development  (0.0774)  and enterprise credit rating (0.0723).   Based on the importance ranking the index C layer of the ranking of the indicators and the importance of evaluating the standard level is basically the same. The indicators of business performance and asset status are at the forefront of the core corporate credit risk and are the two factors affecting core enterprise credit risk the most. Therefore by means  of  a  fuzzy  analytic  hierarchy  process  a  quantitative  risk  assessment  can  be performed. This approach can be very helpful in conducting key analysis observations for financial institutions to provide supply chain financing for purposes of determining the key financial indicators.  6. Concluding Remarks  Supply chain finance is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood medicine" to solve the financing problem of small and mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs)  which  can  effectively  alleviate  the  capital constraints of SMEs and achieve benefits for many participants in the supply chain. Therefore core enterprises should improve their economic strength by adjusting their business  strategies  and  innovation  to  enhance  enterprise  competitiveness  and improving their asset quality  and  credit records  to  enhance their industry status and core competitiveness.    Core enterprises should also carefully select SMEs in the supply chain; choosing those with good credit status higher industry position and strong profitability to ensure the  28 \\x0coverall security and stability of the supply chain reduce credit risks and  enhance the overall competitiveness.    There are several suggestions regarding balancing the development of supply chain finance  building  and  dynamic  improvements  of  the  supply  chain  financial  risk evaluation and control system and  establishing  electronic databases by  commercial banks. At present supply chain finance is mainly used in automobile steel and other industries which have large industry limitations.    As important participants in the supply chain core enterprises strengthen the strategic cooperative relationship of the supply chain members so that supply chain financing can be extended to other industries to solve the financing constraints of SMEs. The core enterprises can also use their own advantages to expand supply chain financing to other industries to maximize the profits among different industry groups. In this way core enterprises can play an important role in supply chain finance.    Supply chain finance is involved in the exchange of capital flows information flows and logistics. The major participants include banks core enterprises and  SMEs.  In order to maintain the interests of all parties it is necessary to construct and perfect the risk evaluation and control system. This requires establishing a scientific concept of risk management and risk assessment based on real transactions. The main business objects involved in supply chain financing should be strictly controlled to control a variety of risks dynamic adjustments of the weights and improving the supply chain financial risk assessment system.   A unified information file should be collected based on the core enterprise including the  operating  conditions  asset  status  industry  status  credit  record  effective  29 \\x0cinformation to the database collecting related data upstream and downstream of the archives around the core enterprise developing a data information system electronic data information and updating the database accurately using the latest information that might be available.  Finally through the establishment of a database on the supply chain finance supply chain  finance  and  modern  information  technology  are  integrated  to  establish  the sharing of information resources and realize the exchange of information flows capital flows and logistics between banks.  The core enterprises and small and mediumsized enterprises  will  thereby  function  more  smoothly  which  not  only  improves  the efficiency of the supply chain operation but should also reduce a variety of risks and improve the efficiency and effectiveness of supply chain finance.    30 \\x0c Author Contributions  Data curation WeiMing Mou; Formal analysis WeiMing Mou WingKeung Wong and  Michael  McAleer;  Methodology  Michael  McAleer;  Project  administration WingKeung  Wong;  Software  WeiMing  Mou;  Validation  WingKeung  Wong  and Michael  McAleer;  Writing  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  original  draft  WeiMing  Mou;  Writing  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  review  & editing WingKeung Wong and Michael McAleer.     31 \\x0c References   [1]  Berger  A.N.
