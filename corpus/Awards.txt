here  in file  Innovation and  Excellence in 2016  The Awards    By Helen Sanders  Editor    Y et again  2016 saw a record number of nominations and submissions for the    TMI Awards for Innovation and Excellence across both bank/supplier and  corporate categories. Once again  the quality was outstanding  and many    entries  both winners and – we hope – future winners  reflected a great deal of  thought and effort  for which we offer our sincere thanks. So with such close  competition  what ultimately marked out our award winners?  A year of success for US banks    The Cash & Liquidity Management and  Payments & Collections Awards were  dominated by Citi and Bank of America  Merrill Lynch respectively this year  with  both banks submitting highly professional  entries supported by very strong client    testimonials. Citi won the Global Cash &  Liquidity Management award  together  with regional awards for SubSaharan  Africa and South America. In Asia Pacific  and Middle East & North Africa  Citi was  successful in both the Cash & Liquidity  Management  and Payments & Collections  awards. In addition to specific regional    26                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      TMI  |  ISSUE 249    awards 2016    capabilities in each of the relevant  categories  the judges were impressed by  the bank’s ongoing investment in  innovative customer solutions  such as its  liquidity management services and Citi  Treasury Diagnostics (CTD). With over 600  participants  this differentiating diagnostic  feature helps clients to identify strengths   weaknesses  and areas for improvement  and generates specific action plans to help  them prioritise their activities. An  extension of CTD is the Citi Bank  Rationalization Tool (BRT). For complex  multinational corporations aiming to  rationalise global banking or transform  treasury practices  BRT allows the client to  gather data in a consistent manner on  banking practices to review its current state  and make critical decisions.    Bank of America Merrill Lynch achieved    similar success in the Payments &  Collections Awards  as well as being  awarded best bank for Cash & Liquidity  Management in North America and China.  As the winner of the Global Payments &  Collections award  as well as regional  awards in China and South and North  America  Bank of America Merrill Lynch  had a demonstrable commitment to  innovations that are driving a change in  client behaviour and opportunity. Over the  past 12 months  the bank has launched a  range of new solutions such as virtual  account management (VAM)  the next  generation of virtual accounts  which  supports both payments and collections   including SEPA direct debit collections.  Other innovations include ongoing  investment in the bank’s card programme   and CashPro® Flow  which enables clients  to lock in FX rates over extended periods  (also recognised by the technology award  for Risk Management).     European banks fighting back    While Citi and Bank of America Merrill  Lynch may appear to dominate these  award categories  other international and  regional banks were successful in some of  the most hotly contested categories  most  notably in the European awards. Nordea  won the Nordic regional awards for Cash &  Liquidity Management and Financial  Supply Chain Management. The bank’s  submission  supported by a variety of  client nominations  reflected the  leadership role that the bank is taking in  cash management innovation  with an  active innovation lab running initiatives in    In Financial Supply Chain Management   covering trade and supply chain financing   there was a very wellbalanced picture of    success across multiple banks.    fintech collaboration  PSD2 and open  banking. Nordea’s Startup Accelerator  programme is wellestablished and  reaping benefits for the bank  fintech  partners and ultimately  the clients they  support. The bank is also a pioneer in  external initiatives such as the R3 CEV  Blockchain initiative and SWIFT’s global  payments innovation (gpi) initiative.    In western Europe  the most contested  region  the clear winners were Deutsche  Bank and BNP Paribas in Cash & Liquidity  Management and Payments & Collections  respectively. There has been significant  reader interest in BNP Paribas’ Payments &  Collections supplement published earlier  in 2016  and more recently  its Cash  Management University publication   which together with other articles during  the course of the year  are a clear  demonstration not only of BNP Paribas’  credibility  insights and solutions in  payments and cash management  but also  of the bank’s commitment to engaging  with the corporate community to share  ideas and challenges  cocreate solutions  and provide education.    Deutsche Bank  winner of the Cash &    Liquidity Management Award for western  Europe  was also heavily focused on client  engagement during the course of 2016   These included a global treasury research  project culminating in the white paper  Managing Risk in Challenging Economic  Times conducted with The Economist  Intelligence Unit. A series of articles  authored by Deutsche Bank experts based  on the findings of this report starts in this  edition of TMI. The bank has also  announced a number of notable new  corporate mandates and innovation  projects  including ongoing developments  of its FX4Cash platform and Autobahn App  Markets  including Cash Inquiry which  supports payments across all currencies    and management reporting for  performance analysis.     In Central & Eastern Europe  UniCredit    was awarded best bank for Cash &  Liquidity Management  not least due to the  excellent guide published in conjunction  with TMI in September 2016. The Guide  combines expert industry insights with  practical  innovative customer solutions   and has been warmly welcomed by  readers. UniCredit’s leadership position in  instant payments was also amongst the  reasons for the judges’ decision to offer this  award.    Staying in Central & Eastern Europe   ING was particularly noted by the judges  for the quality of its submission  with a  clear commitment to creating a high  quality customer experience by simplifying  and streamlining its organisation and  processes and investing in innovation. This  includes initiatives to standardise and  rationalise the documentation  with  notable results for customers  and ongoing  development of its Inside Business  international banking platform. Similarly   while other banks have been consolidating  their footprint  ING continues to expand to  new territories in line with customer  demand.    A balanced picture of bank  achievement    In Financial Supply Chain Management   covering trade and supply chain financing   there was a very wellbalanced picture of  success across multiple banks. BNP  Paribas should be congratulated on an  excellent submission which resulted in the  global award  with a clear commitment to  developing and reinforcing its depth and  breadth of capability across a footprint of  60 countries and territories to support  international trade.

The  only bank to win awards in two regions in  this category was Societe Generale  which  was successful in both Middle East & North  Africa and Central & Eastern Europe. The  bank’s factoring business enjoys a  leadership position in France  but also in  key markets in these regions and beyond.  Since the beginning of 2016  Societe  Generale has been engaged in a  transformation project to create a  dedicated factoring business line to  facilitate integrated solutions and best  practices since the beginning of 2016   which is likely to further enhance its  success.    ANZ’s success in Asia Pacific was based    on a variety of excellent case studies and  testimonials. These illustrated  demonstrable benefits in improving  earnings and leveraging receivables  finance to drive behaviours at client  organisations  enhancing cash conversion  cycle and reducing the working capital  employed. In North America  HSBC’s  submission was also successful as a result  of the quality and diversity of case studies  and client testimonials that supported the  bank’s entry  across a range of industry  sectors including technology  retail   electronics and international fashion.  What was clear to the judges from HSBC’s  entry was the value that clients derived  from the combination of the bank’s  international network with highly  personalised solutions that meet each  company’s distinct requirements.    New priorities  new awards    With FX risk management becoming  increasingly important in an environment  of ongoing political  economic and  currency volatility  this year marks the first  of a new award in FX Management and  Markets  which the judges unanimously  awarded to Commerzbank. This award  attracted more customer nominations  than any other award  with compliments  from a number of senior finance  professionals from leading corporations.  What quickly became clear from the  nominations is not only the achievements  of both the bank and its clients  but also    how nice its clients are! One nominated the  bank “for consistently insightful and  helpful analysis of our balance sheet  exposures”. Another described the bank as  “innovative and convincing”  while others  referenced the bank’s excellent derivative  solutions. One simply said “Great bank   great service”. For any bank  this is an  accolade that’s hard to beat. This award  was also the only one for which clients  mentioned specific individuals  so  particular congratulations should go to  Mireille Meens  Commerzbank’s Head of  Corporate Sales  Western Europe  and the  teams in both Prague and Germany.     A clean sweep    In the Money Market Fund categories  J.P.  Morgan Asset Management won awards for  all three regions  Asia  US and Europe   although it should be noted that the  competition in each region was very strong   so it was a very close decision in each case.  Ultimately  the awards were given based on  excellent client testimonials  including  comment on the degree to which J.P.  Morgan Asset Management advocates on  behalf of its customers  the quality of advice  and transparency of its cash investment  solutions. Readers also responded very  favourably to the expert contributions to  TMI during the course of the year  which  have also enhanced perceptions of J.P.  Morgan Asset Management and its  credibility.    A quick fire round….    With fifteen separate technology  categories  including an impressive  number of nominations and submissions  in each one  I will keep this section short…  Judges decided to award the 2016  technology awards for innovation and  excellence for the following achievements     Card solution   Bank of America Merrill Lynch  for its  Value of Cards web app. This app  which is  freely available to clients  models the  potential benefits of a B2B payment card  solution.

Treasurers  and finance managers can also set realistic  objectives for card projects and measure  success.    28                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      TMI  |  ISSUE 249    Trade finance solution   BELLIN  for its integrated  paperless trade  finance solution as part of tm5.

TMI. While supply chains typically refer to  the connected thread of suppliers and  wholesalers that create a company’s  products and services  and the distributors   agents and retailers that sell them  this  concept has arguably become outdated as  networks of commercial counterparties  have extended and become more complex  and intertwined. Instead  the concept of  the ‘ecosystem’ better reflects the  complexity and mutual dependencies that  exist  from individuals and small family  producers through to the world’s largest  multinationals. These different entities  have different financing and banking  needs  but by taking a holistic approach to  providing liquidity  managing risk and  facilitating transactions  the ecosystem  becomes more resilient and efficient  financially  and is positioned for growth.    Electronic trading portal  FX  360T for ongoing growth  innovation and  investment. With 1 600 buy side customers  in 75 countries  and daily trading volume    of around EUR 70bn  in addition to  intercompany solutions  360T continues to  go from strength to strength.

(cid 0)    The end of innovation? Not so!    Commentators have been predicting a decline in innovation in the treasury and banking  sector in recent years as organisations direct their investment dollars towards  regulatory compliance and tackling and preempting security vulnerabilities and  threats. This year’s awards demonstrate that innovation is taking place alongside these  essential investments  with a clear focus on enhancing the customer experience. Many  people ask at this time of year how their organisation can win a TMI award. So here are  our handy tips     1.  You need to enter  or clients need to nominate you. This may sound obvious  but    every year we receive calls from banks or suppliers asking why they haven’t received  an award in a category that they have not entered.    2.  Produce a concise submission that outlines specifically why your organisation should    be considered for a particular award – bullet points are fine. This can refer to case  studies and editorial elsewhere in the publication  but you cannot assume that  judges will have time to trawl through everything you’ve produced to construct a  picture of your organisation’s strengths in the award category.    3.  Encourage clients to nominate you or provide case studies or testimonials you can  link to your entry. This was a characteristic of many of this year’s award winners  of  which Commerzbank is a particular case in point  not only did the bank provide a  very strong  clear submission  but clients in all regions submitted very short but  powerful nominations.    4.  Be selective. It’s better to enter for award categories in which you have a compelling    value proposition rather than every category.    With thanks for the very many entrants to this year’s awards  and congratulations to our  winners.
