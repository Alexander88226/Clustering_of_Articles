Blockchain  technology  is  predicted  to  have  a  bright  future  as disintermediate  of  the  financial  institution  become  more  popular.  This  research analysis the potential revenue streams through blockchain technology. However the  promising  of  disintermediation  of  their  technology  leaving  turmoil  all  of startup  to  release  the  decentralize  system  because  of  there  is  no  revenue.  We proposed long tail business model in term of release initial coin offerings (ICO) based on physical assetbacked of cryptocurrency. Rather than close platform to release ICO by the provider of cryptocurrency we tends to open the platform to niche  market  like  personal  businessman  MSMS\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  or  others  to  releasing  their ICO. The result show many users of cryptocurrency make an ICO to raise funds and  also  many  transaction  of  currency  exchange  occur  in  the  platform.  It  look like  high  product  of  ICO  with  low  of  volume  of  funds  but  currency  exchanges will  often  occur.  Therefore  margin  of  currency  exchange  will  made  a  new revenue streams for blockchain technology startup to monetize their platform to shift to another stage of growth and stability. Keywords  Blockchain  Technology  Long  Tail  Business  Model  Revenue Streams. 1.  Introduction Blockchain  technology  is  currently  attracting  great  attention  from  public  because  the uniqueness  of  their  technology  characteristic  as  a  foundation  for  disintermediate  transaction [1].  The  problem  of  doublespending  in  such  as  banks  notaries  escrow  agents  potentially replaced by blockchain technology [2]. Blockchain is a digitized decentralized ledger to allow record  keeping  of  all  peerpeer  transactions  without  the  need  for  a  centralized  authority  [3]. Latest reviews of technical papers on blockchain research shows that the majority of scientific papers  have  focused  on  increasing  and  the  challenge  of  the  current  Protocol  especially  for cryptocurrency in General and particularly to Bitcoin [4].  The increasing of peertopeer platform like blockchain technology can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t be denied and has changed the way for commercial transaction [5]. The main issue in developing of blockchain technology is the elimination of trusted parties [6] [7] [8]. Among the hype of that the first question  to  answer  the  appropriate  solution  whether  blockchain  technology  is  the  best technology  to  build  peertopeer  platform  transaction  trying  to  remove  trusted  parties  such  a SUAFBE 2018 December 06 Jakarta IndonesiaCopyright \\xc2\\xa9 2019 EAIDOI 10.4108/eai.6122018.2286339 \\x0c bank [9]. Even multidisciplinary blockchain research framework about intermediaries tends to disseminating how blockchain technology could provide intermediary services [10]. There are three element of intermediaries  function as  the bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core business (1) rising funds  (2)  make  loans  and  (3)  provide  services.    It  was  managed  trillions  dollars  of  global economy  and  takes  trillions  fee  per  transaction  through  system  of  slow  payment  additional cost  and  takes  more  time  [11]  [8].  Finally  the  customer  bears  the  burden  and  opened  over 45%    per  year  of  criminal  opportunities  from  financial  intermediaries  activities  include payment networks money transfer and stock exchange [12]. It was worth estimated to save up sixteen  billion  dollars  fees  per  year  from  Banking  and  Insurance  transaction  through  smart contracts  of  blockchain technology  [13]  while  others  was  estimated  could  reduce infrastructure cost $1520 billion per annum by 2022 [14]. Blockchain technology also was introduce new venture of raising funds through initial coin offerings  (ICO)  [15]  [16]  [17].  Coins  are  units  of  original  value  from  the  blockchain therefore It is also important to distinguish between coins and tokens. The only purpose of a coin is to exchange values and have limited functions beyond that [18]. Token is new type of digital  assets  that  represent  underlying  of  asset.  At  least  there  are  three  taxonomies  to understand  of  tokens  [19].  First  is  currency  tokens  like  Bitcoin  that  can  be  used  to  purchase goods and service. Second is platform tokens like Ethereum that provide a payment gateway and  three  is  assetbacked  tokens  which  is  bound  to  underlying  physical  assets  such  as  real estate fine art or even gold collections. The promising of blockchain technology was envisioned as an online payment or platform tokens  without  trusted  parties  [6].  But  many  entrepreneur  or  startup  company  difficult  to choice about decentralized system that may release a fixed revenue streams [20]. This research aims  to  see  the  possible  revenue  streams  from  blockchain  technology  in  term  of disintermediate  function  of  trusted  parties.  As  a  research  methodology  we  first  define  a framework  to  classify  current  activities  of  banking  system  and  investigate  possible  activities of blockchain technology to acquire revenue streams.  2.  Literature Review The  most  important  thing  of  disseminating  new  technology  is  about  the  adoption.  The adoption  of  diffusion  of  innovation  theory  has  four  main  elements  include  (1)  an  innovation (2) is communicated through certain channels (3) over time (4) among the members of a social system  [21].  This  theory  was  explain  how  idea  and  invention  of  technology  will  adopted through  reducing  uncertainty  of  a  system  over  time  [3].  Blockchain  technology  also  need  a decision  making  tool  that  will  defining  its  technology  as  the  correct  perspective  to  reach disintermediate [9]. The rise of blockchain technology was marked by the operation of a peer2peer electronic cash  system as known by Bitcoin  [6]. It is outline  the  mechanism of new  currency based on cryptography security system that will eliminating the trusted parties by online transfer to be sent directly from one party to recipient party [22]. Blockchain technology as one of the most enchanting  research  fields  because  the  digital  disruption  has  shaken  financial  services  [23]. Whereas  level  of  analysis  of  multidisciplinary  blockchain  research  fields  is  around  (1)  User and society (2) Intermediaries (3) Platforms (4) Firms and Industries [10].  At  least  there  are  five  different  activities  between  banking  system  and  blockchain technology. First is payment when banking system offers an intermediary function in term of approving transaction between customers  while blockchain technology offers the anonymity of users [24]. Second is clearing and balancing systems. Users or customers takes more time to reconcile  their  transaction  and  also  check  their  balance  as  an  operating  procedure  of     \\x0c intermediary  parties.  Blockchain  technology  can  reduce  transaction  time  and  simplifying  of reconciliation process through realtime in clearing and balancing arrangements [22]. Third is get funding if banking concept execute fundraising from customers whom excess funds  through  saving  Giro  or  time  deposit  product.  Blockchain  technology  is  trying  to  remodelling  the  business  through  initial  coin  offering  (ICO).  It  may  be  characterized  with  the publication such as white paper or token sale term that contains detail information about price (pricing per coin) product (supply of token) place (IT adopted) and promotion (business plan and marketing team) to raise money through cryptocurrencies  [25]. It is not only get funding from investor or customers but creating new opportunity from a broader access to capital. The  fourth  is  securities  the  term  of  asset  securities  was  shifted  from  nonasset  to  asset backed. When asset native is issued onchain as a digital representation it is called tokenising [8] [26] [27]. The last is lending or loan or credit by removing the necessity for gatekeepers within the lending business the blockchain will build it safer to borrow cash and supply lower interest rates [8]. There is term that will confuse of  blockchain researcher to clearly define about. The idea of  distributed  use  to  architecture  not  for  a  policy  of  decision  making  [28].  Whereas decentralization is open network  for everyone to access the ledger identities are not recorded and  the  validation  may  lead  decreasing  speed  of  transaction  [24]  [9].  Blockchain  is  type  of distributed  ledger  that  is  made  out  of  a  chain  of  cryptographically  connected  \'squares\' containing bunched exchanges [27]. Before  we  examine  potential  revenue  streams  in  discussion  section  better  we  start  to define  what  type  of  business  model  of  blockchain  technology.  Business  model  is  the  art  of how  company  to  generate  revenue  and  making  profit  [29]  [30]  [31].  In  term  of  revenue streams  we  found  type  of  activities  blockchain  technology  include  infrastructure  providers application  developers  and  Operators  [27].  Most  revenue  streams  in  one  or  more  of  the following ways [32] [27] [33].  NO REVENUE MODEL DESCRIPTION Table 1. Revenue Model of Blockchain Technology 1 2 3 4 5 Software as a service Professional Services Flat Fees & Transaction Fees Maintenance fee  Service Level Agreement (SLA) or Premium support packages Charging fee for using API and infrastructure Developing custom applications for enterprise clients Charging fee for subscription or fee per transaction Charging for the maintenance of a distributed ledger network codebase Providing professional 24/7 support and training 6 Consulting 7 A utility token 3.  Method Providing consulting services to customers seeking to adopt DLT can range from ideation and the development of a proofofconcept to a fullproduction deployment network It might be discharged which might be wont to access the network or can even be listed inside the network.  We  use  the  long  tail  business  model  as  a  research  approach  in  order  to  create  a  new opportunity of revenue  model. The long tail concept  was proposed by Chris  Anderson in his book  titled  The  Long  Tail.  It\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  concept  is  about  selling  that  focusing  on  a  large  numbers  of product with low volume (Anderson 2006). We was defined in the section two the potential     \\x0c disruption  of  banking  system  including  payment  clearing  and  balancing  system  funding securities  and  lending  with  blockchain  technology.  After  that  we  try  to  investigate  a  new revenue model through long tail business model canvas (see figure 1). To evaluate the business model canvas we will arrange FGD and in depth interview with a stakeholder  of  the  blockchain  technology  including  30  interviewee  from  Islamic  Fintech Association 4 interviewee from Otoritas Jasa Keuangan (OJK) 30 MSME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. The outcome of the method will describe a value proposition customer segment and finally making a decision about  the  revenue  streams.  The  revenue  streams  describe  revenue  generating  from  customer segment  whom buy the value proposition of the product [30]. Revenue streams can take from two  streams;  (1)  transaction  revenue  that  come  from  onetime  of  payment  (2)  recurring revenue that come from ongoing payment and repurchase of others similar product.  Fig. 1.  Long Tail Business Model Canvas Concept   4.  Discussion The  real  challenge  of  commercialism  niche  content  is  finding  interested  potential consumers [30]. If we see the old model of music industry the customer segment focusing on mass  audience  an  match  making  with  the  value  proposition  from  superstar  artist  and  hits. While  the  new  model  was  open  the  platform  did  not  focus  on  mass  audience  but  switch  to niche market like people who want buy or listen a song from another hits maker. Rather than entering  the  main  market  our  interviewee  proposing  to  open  a  strategic  avenue  to  pursue  a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cniche  market  strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Niche  market  is  small  market  that  consist  an  individual  or  a  small group of customers with similar characteristics and needs [34]. Therefore  banking  industries  usually  target  mass  market  of  funding  customer  and  they also  try  to  match  making  with  the  customer  of  lending  product.  They  earn  revenue  streams from  the  deviation  of  lending  margin  and  funding  interest.  Different  from  blockchain technology  is  reworking  everything  from  payments  transactions  to  however  cash  is  raised within the nonpublic market [8]. As we mention above blockchain can beyond question have an impact on just about each side of the financial setup. Because it relates to banking and also the disruption we will expect to work out happening. Our research results show the initial coin offering (ICO) are mostly carried out by blockchain provider or operator and we proposed the initial coin offering offer by users.     \\x0c Fig. 2. Value Proposition Canvas    Initial  coin  offerings  (ICOs)  represent  a  completely  unique  mechanism  for  funding extremely  innovative  ventures  that  use  distributed  ledger  technology  (DLT)  [16]  [25].  ICO represent  radical  innovation  in  financial  technology.  In  ICO  investors  get  the  token  directly from  startup;  tokens  unit  is  supposed  to  be  the  future  of  the  venture  project  (for  example utilities property rights royalties) [16]. ICOs alter startups to lift massive amounts of funding with negligible effort whereas avoiding compliance and reduce intermediator cost [35]. Let we illustrate the value proposition canvas above. Nature of Initial Coin Offering (ICO) usually written in white paper document. It is a document in which the company provides the information deemed necessary for the public and is an important component of the campaign company  ICO  [36].  It  mention  the  details  of  ICO  total  cap  and  distribution  legal  and compliance  team  security  marketing  and  public  relation  and  also  have  within  a  maximum time of coin selling [37] [38]. While Niche segment or one customer for example stands as a home industry and needs some funding in term of rising of their working capital around 200 dollars.  They  open  register  in  the  Initial  Coin  Offering  (ICO)  platform  and  offering  their equity crowdfunding to mass market about 50 coins. They start to campaign within a certain period to raise funds. It kind of online word of mouth and not just a peertopeer transaction or equity crowdfunding. It is an example of new economic model for raising working capital for home industry. If we compare with raise money through venture capital is a difficult process. Entrepreneurs have gathered with sat through countless meetings with partners and last a long time  in  negotiations  over  equity  and  assessment  in  hopes  of  exchanging  some  part  of  their company for review. At blockchain we do not need a platform to raise money. we don\'t need to venture capitalists. And also we do not need negotiations. All users can raise money from anyone at any time and anyone can invest in their projects. Indonesia still have gap financing about 988 trillion and over 49 million MSMEs unit not yet  bankable  [39].  World  bank  suggest  there  are  between  365445  million  MSMEs  in emerging  country  2530  million  are  formal  SMEs;  5570  million  are  formal  micro enterprises; and 285345 million are informal enterprises. it was estimated 70% of all micro small  and  medium  enterprises  in  emerging  country  lack  access  to  lending  [40].  It  may  give large  breath  access  of  people  MSME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  home  industry  and  or  startup  company  to  rising funds  through  Initial  Coin  Offering.  Quarterly  report  of  cryptocurrencies  was  mention  about  $7735207391 amount raised from April \\xe2\\x80\\x93 June 2018 include 339 Number of ICOs with the average amount raised over $22817720 [41]. Only 1820% of ICO that reach hard cap from AprilJune  2018  and  numbers  of  cryptocurrencies  provider  in  the  world  was  recorded  in www.coingecko.com  over  3431.  Our  interviewees  expected  it  might  looks  like  onethird (small) of number of ICO will offers by cryptocurrencies provider in large volume and three    \\x0c quarter (large) offers by users (MSME and personal) of cryptocurrencies in low volume in the future.  So  where  is  revenue  streams  come  from?  Our  interviewees  estimated  that  ICO  are fundamentally shift from seed fundraising to new investment ecosystem  [42] [43]. It kind of mid of utility and equity token because represent ownership of an asset and also provide users with future access to a product or service. For example case study from cryptocurrency (assetbacked)  like  gold  or  Dinar  and  Dirham  when  the  crypto  coin  sold  for  currencies.  It  can represent  ownership  of  the  ingots  and  also  enable  the  crypto  coin  to  purchase  for  another product or services [44].  Fig. 3. Long Tail Business Model Projection   It is supposed to bring through individuals to exchange currency from fiat to gold or Dinar and  Dirham.  It  additionally  implies  the  model  of  revenue  streams  from  fee  based  income  to margin of currency exchange. Cryptocurrency may  enable to provide price of sell and buy of the  crypto  coin  in  the  website  normally  buy  price  expensive  from  sell  price  because  the difference  in  numbers  indicate  the  margin  of  the  exchange.  This  revenue  model  tends  to comply with Islam because it is similar with the Ba\\xe2\\x80\\x99i alSarf or currency exchange. But it may contradiction  with  the  term  and  condition  of  purchasing  gold  via  online.  It  should  be  cash transaction and handover directly and it was narrated that Ubadah bin AsSamit \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUbadah bin AsSamit and Muawiyah met at a stopping place on the road. \'Ubadah told them \'The Messenger of Allah forbade selling gold for gold silver for silver wheat for wheat barley for barley dates for dates"\' one of them said \'salt for salt"\' but the other did not say it"unless it was like for like hand to hand. And he commanded us to sell gold for silver and silver for gold and wheat for barley and barley for wheat and to hand however we wanted."\' And one of them said "Whoever gives more or ask for more has engaged in Riba.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d But sharia Standard no 57 on Gold and its Trading Controls point 3/4 Sale of Gold Ingots for Currencies is the solution of the problem above. It cited following below \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhen gold ingots are sold for currencies the countervalues must be exchanged during the contracting session. Possession of the  ingot by the buyer or his agent is realized either physically or constructively. Constructive possession is realized by allocation of the ingot and by enabling the buyer to dispose of it or by holding a certificate that represents ownership of a specified ingot that is distinguishable (an allocated ingot) from others by serial numbers or other distinct marks from other ingots provided the certificate is issued the day the contract is concluded  [Trade  Date  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cT+0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d]  by  officially  or  customarily  recognized  agencies  enabling the buyer to take physical possession of the purchased ingot at his request\\xe2\\x80\\x9d [45].     \\x0c It impact the ICO usually launch by cryptocurrency provider  with the low of numbers of product  shift  to  ICO  launch  by  cryptocurrency  users  with  the  high  numbers  of  product.  The important  challenge  of  marketing  niche  content  is  finding  interested  potential  patrons. Powerful search and recommendation engines user ratings and communities of interest have created  this  much  easier.  Many  types  of  ICO  products  was  indicated  the  high  volume  of currency exchange between fiat and cryptocurrency even volume of each product is low.  Fig. 3. Long Tail Business Model Revenue Streams   5.  Conclusion In  this  paper  we  tried  to  use  a  long  tail  business  model  as  a  model  of  revenue  streams approach  but  still  comply  to  Islamic.  It  may  produce  aggregate  revenue  or  even  exceeding revenues produced via long tail business model because each currency exchange even in the first  market  of  cryptocurrency  will  impact  to  the  margin.  It  is  also  will  eliminate  the  cost  of intermediaries into free from the advantage of blockchain technology. Furthermore the future research  topics  of  ICO  about  the  Islamic  scheme  of  contract  for  the  underlying  asset  as  the assetbacked of the crypto coin.
