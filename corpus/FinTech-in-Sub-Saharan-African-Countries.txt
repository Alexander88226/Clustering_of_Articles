New technologies are being devel  oped and implemented in subSaharan Africa with the potential to change   the competitive landscape in the financial sector. FinTech challenges tra  ditional structures and creates efficiency gains by opening up the financial   services value chain  although it also raises concerns about new vulnerabil  ities. Today  FinTech is emerging as a technological enabler in the region    improving financial inclusion and serving as a catalyst for innovation in other   sectors  such as agriculture and infrastructure.    SubSaharan Africa has become the global leader in mobile money transfer   services  spurring widespread access to financial services. Although subSa  haran Africa has lagged behind the rest of the world in access to finance    some countries in the region are now global leaders. There is a wide degree of   differences across the region  with East Africa leading in mobile money adop  tion and usage. Built on an appropriate pricing strategy to attract customers    suitable regulation  and a reliable and trustful network  Kenya represents   today one of the most successful cases regarding the use of mobile money.     FinTech may carry significant gains for financial inclusion and deepening   by improving the level of efficiency of the financial sector. FinTech provides   avenues to extend access to credit as new technologies help overcome infor  mation barriers and lower the cost of crossborder transfers. In particular    pressures on correspondent banking relationships could be partly remedied   by the use of new technologies if the new systems can satisfy requirements   to avoid money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Furthermore    whereas the current technologies are still facing number of challenges  such as     vii    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    scalability and high energy consumption  future distributed ledger technolo  gies could enhance efficiency  security  and transparency of payment systems   in subSaharan Africa  thus lowering trading costs.    There is a need to balance the tradeoff between the benefits that FinTech   technologies may generate and potential added risks and vulnerabilities.   Given the lower levels of financial inclusion  bank competition  and macrofi  nancial linkages in subSaharan Africa relative to other regions  regulators and   central banks could potentially benefit from considering FinTech as a leap  frogging opportunity to foster inclusive economic growth and development.   At the same time  these new technologies and business models present new   risks that would need to be addressed with suitable regulatory frameworks.    Policy measures are needed to reap the potential benefits of FinTech while   managing associated risks. First  policymakers need to fill the large existing   infrastructure gap in the region  starting with electricity and internet services.   Second  there is a need to address the perennial race between fastmoving   innovation and the slower pace of regulation. Third  policymakers should   look beyond the potential benefits of FinTech in just the financial sec  tor to consider the possible impact on employment and productivity  the   digital economy  and more broadly  the scope for much needed structural   transformation.    viii    ChAPTEr    1    introduction    Innovation in financial technology  often referred to as “FinTech ” is rapidly   transforming the global financial sector. Since 2010  more than US$50 bil  lion has been invested in almost 2 500 companies worldwide as FinTech   redefines the way in which we store  save  borrow  invest  move  spend  and   protect money (Skan  Dickerson  and Gagliardi 2016). Although there is not   yet a consensus  the working definition of FinTech adopted by the Financial   Stability Board points to “technologically enabled financial innovation that   could result in new business models  applications  processes  or products with   an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the   provision of financial services” (Financial Stability Board 2017).    Ongoing innovation in business models and processes is building on advances   in technology. The technological basis for new FinTech business models and   services rests on the development of some major innovations developed in   recent decades. These include distributed computing  artificial intelligence    big data  cryptography  smart contracts  and mobile internet access. Taken   together  these innovations have enabled the ability to collate and analyze vast   amounts of data  develop more robust security systems  and connect eco  nomic agents through multiple types of platforms on a realtime basis.    FinTech is challenging traditional structures and is creating efficiency gains   by opening up the financial services value chain. Much of the interest in   FinTech is related to the way in which innovation in the financial sector can   lead to increased access  better services  and gains in efficiency. Such inno  vation includes transforming all aspects of delivery of core functions of the   financial sector such as settling payments  facilitating borrowing and saving    risk sharing  and allocating capital. Moreover  this process could trigger deep   changes to the existing market structure and financial market infrastructure   for the provision of these services. The current financial infrastructure typi  cally revolves around (1) incumbent banks  serving retail  commercial  and     1    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    wholesale customers; (2) insurance and pension providers; and (3) money    foreign exchange  and capital markets  all of which are underpinned by pay  ment system providers and other financial market providers  as well as central   banks and regulators. Financial innovation can improve the way the private   and public sectors function.    FinTech has the potential to strengthen and accelerate important gains in   financial development achieved in subSaharan Africa over the past two   decades. Financial liberalization  reform of monetary policy frameworks and   instruments  and improvements in the institutional environment contributed   to a significant expansion of banking activities and financial products. Some   countries achieved decisive progress in financial deepening and now have   increased access to international financial markets  while others have lagged.   The advent of panAfrican banks led to an increased use of payment system   tools such as debit and credit cards  and there has been robust growth in   mobile payments in many countries. Still  financial systems in subSaharan   Africa face several limitations and financial inclusion remains too narrow    limiting the prospect for further gains in sustained growth  employment  and   poverty reduction.    While acknowledging the large potential gains from FinTech  there are con  cerns about new vulnerabilities that these technologies and business models   may bring. New competitors without previous experience in the industry are   providing innovative financial services. For instance  blockchainbased tech  nology promises to enhance trust in economic exchanges. Its applications are   designed to provide a secure digital infrastructure to verify identity  facilitate   faster and cheaper crossborder payments  and protect property rights.1 How  ever  these technologies may be rapidly creating new types of risks that are   not well understood or covered by existing regulations.    Against this background  a careful consideration of the potential of FinTech   is needed to boost banking and financial development in subSaharan Africa.2   It is necessary to balance the tradeoff between the potential benefits that Fin  Tech generates and the added vulnerabilities that may be created. However    given the low level of financial inclusion and competition in Africa  and more   limited macrofinancial linkages relative to other world regions  regulators   and central banks should seriously consider FinTech as an opportunity to fos    1Pisa and Juden (2017) discuss in detail the potential role of blockchain technology in addressing develop    ment challenges.    2In October 2018  the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group (2018) launched the Bali     FinTech Agenda  a set of 12 policy elements aimed at helping member countries harness the benefits and   opportunities of rapid advances in financial technology that are transforming the provision of banking services    while at the same time managing the inherent risks. The Agenda proposes a framework of highlevel issues that   countries should consider in their own domestic policy discussions and aims to guide staff from the two institu  tions in their own work and dialogue with national authorities.    2     Introduction    ter economic growth and development.

Financial intermediation and financial inclusion in subSaharan Africa remain   low  despite progress in recent years. Helped by reforms  the depth and cover  age of financial systems in subSaharan Africa—as measured by the standard   indicators of financial development  such as the ratios of private sector credit   to GDP and broad money to GDP—have significantly improved over the   period 1995 to 2013 (Kasekende 2010). However  on average  countries in   subSaharan Africa continue to have a shallower financial system than those   in other developing regions of the world (Figure 1). In terms of financial   inclusion  only 20 percent of the population has a bank account compared   to 92 percent in advanced economies and 38 percent in nonadvanced econo  mies (Table 1). Underinvestment  poor infrastructure  and comparatively low   levels of financial literacy have contributed to the region being underbanked.    However  mobile money has underpinned a radical change in the delivery of   financial services in subSaharan Africa. As a result  the region has become   the global leader in mobile money innovation  adoption  and usage  with   close to 40 out of 45 subSaharan African countries actively using this new   financial technology (FinTech).1 Within subSaharan Africa  East Africa con  tinues to lead in terms of adoption and usage rates. Whereas overall financial   depth remains below other regions  FinTech is emerging as an engine of   growth and technological enabler that fosters financial inclusion and eco  nomic development.    1Both the Middle East  North Africa  Afghanistan  and Pakistan  and Caucasus and Central Asia regions are     also reporting progress in the adoption of FinTech.

SubSaharan Africa Leads the World in mobile money    The widespread use of mobile money has transformed the delivery of finan  cial services in subSaharan Africa.2 SubSaharan Africa leads the world in   mobile money accounts per capita (both registered and active accounts)    mobile money outlets  and volume of mobile money transactions (Fig  ure 2).

In addition  close to 20 per  cent of GDP in transactions are occurring through mobile money  compared   with just 7 percent of GDP in Asia and less than 2 percent of GDP in other   regions. Most transactions are used to send and receive domestic remittances.   Increasingly  transactions are also being used for domestic transfers such   as paying utility bills  receiving wages  and payments for goods and ser  vices (Figure 3).     Mobile money accounts have now overtaken traditional bank accounts in   several subSaharan African economies. Based on data for 17 subSaharan   African countries for which both mobile money and traditional bank account   data is available  there were nearly twice as many traditional deposit accounts   as mobile money accounts in 2012. By 2015  mobile money accounts sur  passed traditional deposit accounts in these 17 economies  which include   some of the largest in subSaharan Africa  such as South Africa  Kenya  and   Tanzania (Figure 4).     7    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    Figure 3.

Factors for Success    The success of mobile payments in subSaharan Africa is the result of several   factors (Box 1). The low number of branches and automatic teller machines   (ATMs) in the region and the absence of internet connections makes it diffi  cult to transfer remittances or pay bills. Therefore  there is a large unfulfilled   demand for payments services  and the relatively large penetration of mobile   devices in the region provides a technological platform that can be used by   mobile money agents.3 In fact  there are now more mobile money agents in   subSaharan Africa than ATMs or bank accounts.4    Within subSaharan Africa  East Africa is the clear leader in mobile money   adoption and usage. Despite the success of mobile money in subSaharan   Africa  there is a wide degree of crosscountry difference (see Figure 4).   East Africa developed an infrastructure that uniquely built upon the latent   demand for mobile financial services in subSaharan Africa      • East African countries favored a telecomled regulatory model. In this   framework  the telecom provider works with the financial regulator to   establish the infrastructure for mobile payments. The telecomled model   has proved more successful in attracting users than the bankled model that   other subSaharan Africa countries promoted.     • East African countries tended to have a single telecom provider with a large     market share  which provided an initial critical mass of users needed to   push mobile money past the niche level. In Kenya  Safaricom has a share of   nearly 70 percent of the market; in Tanzania  Vodacom has a market share   of close to half. Having a large market share allowed most mobile payment   users to operate on a single platform without facing compatibility issues    though this raises concentration and potential stability concerns.     • East African countries  particularly in the East African Community  have   national identification systems. These systems facilitate faster mobile pay  ment adoption rates and enable more secure transactions.    Addressing the region’s infrastructure gap can lead to an even higher usage of   mobile payment and other financial services. SubSaharan Africa lags behind   the rest of the world not only in terms of access to electricity but also in   terms of internet penetration and technological readiness (Table 2). For a   sample of subSaharan African countries  as of 2017  388 million of the con  tinent’s 1.25 billion are online  with 160 million holding Facebook accounts.   All subSaharan African countries score relatively low on the technological     3The GSM Association defines a mobile agent as a person or business contracted to process mobile trans  actions for users. Agents usually earn commissions for performing this service and often provide frontline   customer service  such as teaching new users how to complete transactions on their phone.    4Dupas et al. (2016) show that distance to banks acts as a barrier to access financial services.    9    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    Table 2.

Therefore  the margin of improvement for the continent is large  and the   potential impact of new technologies and infrastructure can set the path for   much stronger and inclusive financial development in the region. In many   instances  telecoms benefit from high barriers to entry  resulting in highly   concentrated segments. Although size matters for some telecoms to manage   liquidity and counterparty risk  from a policy perspective it is critical to lower   costs  improve access  and facilitate interoperability to foster competition. In   this regard  the proliferation of taxes on the telecoms sector in recent years—  like customs duties on capital equipment and handsets  diverse regulatory   fees  high corporate income tax and valueadded tax rates  or telephone   call excises—may distort product and output markets  impeding efficiency    affordability  and growth.5    FinTech Promotes Financial inclusion beyond the Payments Arena    A wellfunctioning payment system is indispensable to reduce the costs of   exchanging goods and services in the economy. However  promoting financial   inclusion and development implies going beyond payments. There is broad   demand in the region for many other financial services that are underdevel  oped  such as the provision of several types of credit services  crossborder   payments  various forms of investment products  and insurance services.    FinTech providers are leveraging their experience and large customer base   in payments services to provide other financial services.

From Financial Deepening to Economic Development    FinTech is emerging as a technological enabler in the region. FinTech is not   only helping improve financial inclusion in the region  but it also serves as a   catalyst for the emergence of innovations in other sectors  such as agriculture   and infrastructure  which promotes economic growth and development. Fin  Tech may also complement other nonfinancial technologies and foster inno  vation by the government  setting the path for the development of a digital   economy in the region (see Box 3).    12    FinTech in SubSaharan Africa—Where Does the Region Stand?    box 1.

MPesa   was jointly developed by the UK Department for International Development and Voda  fone in the early 2000s. The service has been   successful as it allows customers to deposit   and withdraw money  transfer money to   other users  or pay bills. The service quickly   expanded to other countries in subSaharan   Africa including Tanzania  Lesotho  Mozam  bique  and Ghana  and also Albania  Roma  nia  and India. As of end2016  the service   had almost 30 million users worldwide  of   which 20.7 million are in Kenya. Today    Kenya is one of the economies with the   highest use of mobile money at 53 transac  tions per adult per year (Figure 7).     Figure 7.

In addition  a good market strategy is   necessary to successfully deploy a service that is often subject to significant barriers   related to network effects  the “chickenandegg” trap  and lack of trust (Evans and   Schmalensee 2016; Shapiro and Varian 1998).    2.  An appropriate pricing strategy to attract customers and stores in tandem  and the     deployment of a reliable and trustful network  are critical for success.    3.  Safaricom had a good working relationship with the Central Bank of Kenya   and was given regulatory space to design MPesa in a manner that fit its mar  ket; this provided sufficient prudential comfort to the central bank. A recent   study by Suri and Jack (2016) underlined the role of MPesa to achieve inclusive   growth in Kenya.    13    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    box 1. Why Kenya (continued)    Going forward  mobile money can accelerate the inclusion of users into the for  mal financial system by integrating mobile money and other financial services pro  viders. In Kenya  mobile network operators partner with banks  creating a hybrid   system that offers access to formal saving  loan  and insurance products such as   Safaricom’s MShwari  which provides access to savings accounts and instantaneous   microcredit products.    14    FinTech in SubSaharan Africa—Where Does the Region Stand?    box 2. From Payments to Credit and Saving Products in SubSaharan Africa    Financial technology (FinTech) providers often start with simple highdemand ser  vices and then leverage economies of density and a strong reputation in the country to   expand their portfolio of products by providing related banking services  such as credit   or saving products. The industry is growing rapidly and the examples that follow—  although not exhaustive—illustrate the fast pace of innovation in the region.    Founded in 2009  Paga offers digital bank services (peertopeer money transfer  bill   payments  online payments  and payroll)  achieving a wide reach in Nigeria.    SimbaPay is a UKbased digital money transfer service serving Kenya  Uganda  Nigeria    and Ghana that delivers money via existing mobile money wallet services and using its   SimbaPay app. Simbapay and Kenya’s Family Bank recently launched an instant pay  ment service from East Africa to China. Users can send funds to China through Family   Bank’s PesaPap app or Safaricom’s MPesa.    Orange Money offers a payment and withdrawal card (Visa card) in Botswana  Camer  oon  and Côte d’Ivoire  and Orange Bank Africa has been created in partnership with   bancassurance group NSIA. Orange Group and MTN Group  two of Africa’s largest   mobile operators and mobile money providers  set up a joint venture  Mowali (mobile   wallet interoperability)  that enables interoperable payments across Africa.    Zoona is a mobile payments company that has expanded its portfolio of banking prod  ucts beyond payments. Zoona offers the service Sunga Pockets that helps customers to   store money in an affordable and accessible electronic account.    Zoona has also partnered with Kiva  a crowdlending platform  to offer entrepreneurs   financial support. The Kiva platform gives individuals from around the world the   opportunity to offer small loans to entrepreneurs. The entrepreneurs are vetted by Kiva   and over time the loans are repaid. Lenders are given the choice to keep their loan   within the system to support more entrepreneurs or withdraw it once they are satisfied   with the entrepreneur’s progress.    Wizzit is a payments company that has started providing microfinance products (see   International Finance Corporation 2011). Building on its payment services (mobile   payments to more than 7 million people in 13 countries for more than 15 years)    Wizzit partnered with the World Bank Group to create a microfinance pilot to allow   users to access microloans through their phones for personal use or to grow their small     The information on financial technology providers is for illustrative purposes only and is not intended     to serve as an investment advice or a formal endorsement.    15    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    box 2.

Digital innovation and Financial Services in SubSaharan Africa    The words “Africa” and “innovation” are not often found in the same sentence. But in   fact  much is happening in Africa. The reach of mobile networks and growth in sub  scriptions have made mobile technology the goto means by which digital content and   services are created and consumed. Several subSaharan African countries have estab  lished hubs for tech startups and have generated new employment opportunities. These   hubs provide the means for the industry to continue evolving not only in size but in   variety of services offered.    Innovation in the agricultural sector has huge potential in Africa. Digital financial   services increase smallholder farmers’ access to weather and market information and   help decision making on when and which crops to plant and where to sell crops. The   Tigo Kilimo SMSbased application  launched in Tanzania in 2012  provides uptodate   weather and agronomic information  and the Connected Farmer program in East Africa   sends uptodate market prices to farmers’ mobile phones  allowing them to select the   best markets and times at which to sell  and receive digital payments and receipts.    In fragile and conflictaffected states  financial technology (FinTech) has played an   instrumental role. In Sierra Leone  the government turned to mobile wallets to help   fight the Ebola virus outbreak. The United Nations finds that mobile payments to   emergency workers dramatically shortened payment times and minimized fraud during   the outbreak. In Liberia  mobile payments to health and education workers who   work in areas periodically cut off during the rainy season have helped maintain criti  cal social services. FinTech is also increasingly being harnessed to improve tax collec  tion  thereby contributing to domestic revenue mobilization  a key objective in many   African countries.    Payments innovation has also benefited the health sector. In Rwanda  the government   has partnered with a private company (Zipline) to use drones guided by mobile phone–  based location services to quickly deliver lifesaving medical products to rural health   clinics. Payment by mobile phone facilitates the business model.    New technology also has the potential to help address Africa’s infrastructure deficit.   MKopa Solar in Kenya (Kopa means borrow in Kiswahili) sells solar home systems   on a payment plan  with an initial deposit followed by daily payments up to one year.   After completing payments  customers own the product outright. MKopa aims at   solving two problems simultaneously  it seeks to accelerate rural electrification  a big   challenge in sparsely populated African countries  and to provide consumer credit   to rural households who would have found it difficult to qualify for a loan from a   traditional bank.    17    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    box 3. Digital innovation and Financial Services in SubSaharan Africa (continued)    Blockchain technologies can potentially be applied to many other environments beyond   virtual currencies. Bitland is a new platform in Ghana that seeks to solve the endemic   problem of land registration (as much as 90 percent of agricultural land is reportedly   undocumented). Bitland creates a record for every piece of land that is stored on a   blockchain  and thereby renders them less susceptible to forgery or tampering. In prin  ciple  outofcourt settlements of land disputes should be quicker and easier with the   use of blockchain technology.    18    ChAPTEr    3    FinTechled Transformations and implications    As the financial technology (FinTech) space is developing  innovators are   seeking to enhance elements along the financial services value chain well   beyond mobile money. Startups  established players  and central banks are   in a process of discovery to design  test  and redesign new products  services    and regulation. Underpinning this process is the coalescence of new technol  ogies. The largest impact will occur in the financial sector with important   implications for broader growth. This chapter seeks to provide a guide to   considering the channels through which the future financial development of   FinTech in subSaharan Africa could occur and the policy implications in   terms of the tradeoffs FinTech could create.    FinTech represents a disruptive competitive force that will have a major role   in shaping the structure of the financial industry. FinTech primarily affects   market structure by bringing new technologies that (1) reduce the costs of   financial services  (2) create market access opportunities for new entrants   (nonbanks)  (3) broaden access to new segments of the market and custom  ers  and (4) affect the competitiveness of existing incumbents. These changes   may potentially create large efficiency gains in an industry that has not expe  rienced major technological and market structure changes in the last decades.    The technological foundations for these new products and services are well   developed. The products and services being created in the field of FinTech   draw on global technological innovations. Broadly  these include the follow  ing (see He et al. 2017)      • Mobile access and the internet connect consumers to firms and to each     other (persontoperson transactions).     • Big data and artificial intelligence comprise the availability and analysis   of databases that have billions of observations of transactions and char    19    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    acteristics  which can be used to help design and tailor financial prod  ucts and services.     • Distributed ledger technology (DLT) refers to a type of networking of   independent computers to record  share  and synchronize transactions   rather than have a centralized database.1     • Cryptography allows for robust security systems that enable electronic     transactions to be carried out safely and is the basis for smart contracts and   cryptocurrencies.    The application of these new technologies in subSaharan Africa offers trans  formational potential. Although it is difficult to provide a comprehensive set   of changes that could occur  these new technologies can help to reduce exist  ing market inefficiencies. Together these technological developments provide   avenues to reduce information costs  increase transparency  as well as enable   greater trust and enforcement of contracts (Box 4).2 The new technologies   will also bring a range of risks that will need to be mitigated.    Possible Transformations  Financial inclusion and Deepening    FinTech can have a significant impact on financial inclusion and deepening   by improving the level of efficiency of the industry. SubSaharan Africa has   lower levels of financial inclusion and depth compared to other emerging   market and developing economies. This provides space for significant growth   opportunities in the sector as there is a large proportion of the population   that does not have access to financial services. FinTech offers opportunities   to new entrepreneurs and incumbents in the financial sector that can lever  age innovative and less costly business models to serve this large uncovered   segment of the market. In particular  the relatively large penetration of   mobile phones (81 mobile phones per 100 inhabitants) gives new entrants   a unique opportunity to reach these new customers with mobilebased   financial services.    Access to credit could also be extended through technologies that overcome   information barriers. The cost of credit risk assessment remains high in   subSaharan Africa. Challenges for banks stem from unreliable accounting   and financial information  a lack of credit bureaus  and limitations in legal   institutions. Small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) cite access to   finance as their main challenge  which has also gender equality implications     1A distributed ledger is a distributed database where each node has a synchronized copy of the data  allowing   also for (1) decentralization (control of the database is done by all network participants)  (2) reliable trustless   environments  and (3) cryptographic encryption. See more at Benos  Garratt  and GurrolaPerez (2017).    2See also Figure 4 from the He et al. (2017)  which provides a mapping of the major technologies and how     they impact financial services.    20    FinTechled Transformations and Implications    SubSaharan Africa    Other non advanced economies    Table 3.

Notes  The maximum value of the Boone indicator is 0 (monopoly case) and the more negative it is  the higher the   level of competition. The C5 is the combined market share of the five largest financial institutions in a country. The   Hstatistic is zero under monopoly  and the greater it is  the higher the degree of competition.

Big data and machine learning  for instance  has the potential to reduce the   cost of credit risk assessments  particularly in countries that do not have an   established credit registry. This can be achieved by using a broader range of   information such as mobile phone usage data and payments data  which is   available in higher volume  and new statistical tools to process this larger   volume of information to better understand and measure the nature of credit   risks. Such alternative information for credit risk assessments  possibly at a   lower cost  in subSaharan Africa could attract new entrants into the provi  sion of credit  including (nondeposittaking) FinTech firms (peertopeer   and other crowdfunding platforms). This will have implications for compe  tition and the use of personal information by thirdparty players and carry   legal and regulatory risks.    FinTech can change the financial industry in subSaharan Africa by increas  ing competition and efficiency. Bank competition in Africa is low compared   to other regions of the world (Table 3 and Figure 8). Bazot (2018) and   Philippon (2016) argue that the current financial system has historically been   inefficient. Moreover  banks in subSaharan Africa are typically less efficient   than banks in other world regions and  therefore  financial services are more   expensive. This inefficiency is driven in part by higher operational costs (Beck   and Cull 2014). Lower competition in these countries may be the result of   high entry barriers due to the existence of a negative business climate or the   regulatory barriers. New FinTech entrants may face lower entry barriers as   they may require a smaller scale of operation to be profitable.     Broader financial development in subSaharan Africa could be pushed for  ward at an accelerated pace. There is a need to develop financial markets in   subSaharan Africa beyond retail payments; the banking sector and financial   market infrastructure as capital markets  insurance companies  pension funds    and other financial institutions and instruments remain limited. The level   of financial literacy remains relatively low in subSaharan Africa. Efforts are   underway in the region to use FinTech for users to pay insurance premiums   (Lesotho)  receive pension payments (Ghana)  and purchase government     21    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    Figure 8.

FinTech tools can also help support financial literacy pro  grams (electronic wallet  education at the primary school and higher levels).    Possible Transformations  Crossborder and Domestic Payments    A potential widespread application of FinTech could be to significantly   lower the cost of crossborder transfers. The cost of sending remittances to   subSaharan Africa is the highest globally (see Ratha et al. 2018) in part   because of the oligopolistic nature of the banking industry in subSaharan   Africa  low regional and financial integration  and the existence of multiple   currencies and inefficient payment systems for intraAfrican crossborder   payments. FinTech has the potential to reduce transaction costs with positive   effects on the volume of remittances and regional integration. DLTs are being   considered to facilitate value transfer exchanges between parties without   the need for crossborder intermediation. Network technologies could have   the potential to bypass the complex web of intermediaries present in these   crossborder payments (multiple correspondent banks or infrastructures such   as continuous linked settlement [CLS]).3 4 Intermediaries can also use such   technologies.5    3For instance  international payments using cryptocurrencies can be securely received in minutes and can be   rapidly settled in the domestic currency. DLT systems such as Ripple can be used to efficiently process foreign   payments and can be supported by international banks and payment companies.    4CLS is a global clearing and settlement system for crossborder foreign exchange transactions. The system is   operated by CLS Bank International  which is owned by over 70 global banking and financial institutions. It   enables foreign exchange transactions involving the CLS eligible currencies to be settled through the CLS Sys  tem on a paymentversuspayment basis  thus eliminating the settlement risk in these transactions.    5For instance  CLS has started using a DLT platform.     22    FinTechled Transformations and Implications    Pressures on correspondent banking relationships could also be partly rem  edied by new technologies. Crossborder flows  including those related to   trade and remittances  are being challenged in many countries by the loss of   correspondent banking relations. The current correspondent banking rela  tions model is also expensive as correspondent banks often need to maintain   liquidity (prefunding) at correspondent banks and enter in credit relation  ships with them (overdrafts). In addition  there has been an increase in   compliance costs  including in relation to sanctions regimes and antimoney   laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). Such a   model can also entail long payment chains  particularly in the context of   nested relationships. These ongoing pressures on correspondent banking   relationships have mostly affected transactions denominated in US dollars.   In some instances  FinTech solutions could offer cost savings and secure   solutions (for example  certain regulationfocused technologies) that facilitate   customer due diligence measures and information sharing for the purpose   of correspondent banking relationships. Other emerging FinTech solutions   (for example  blockchain technology) could provide a more efficient alter  native to the traditional correspondent banking model. Provided the new   systems can still satisfy the international AML/CFT standards  this could be   a substantial boost to lowincome countries that receive significant remit  tances from overseas.    DLT could enhance efficiency of certain types of payment systems in   subSaharan Africa. With DLT  all operations are jointly kept by all mem  bers of the network and all processes involving ordering  settlement  and   payments are implemented in real time. Currently in payment systems across   subSaharan Africa  settlement processes that are not operated in realtime   (non–realtime gross settlement systems)  may involve several days to be   fully executed  thus increasing operational costs and creating operational and   counterparty risk. DLT could speed up the settlement of transactions with   a decentralized and automated settlement process  thus reducing backoffice   costs. However  it should be noted that use of DLT for wholesale pay  ments brings its own specific set of operational risks and some limitation   on scalability. Some central banks in subSaharan Africa are actively exper  imenting with DLTbased payment systems. For example  the South Afri  can Reserve Bank initiated a proof of concept that simulated a “realworld”   trial of a DLTbased wholesale payment system using a tokenized South   African rand (Box 5).    Possible Transformations  Fiscal and monetary Sectors    Some of the innovations in finance could be applied to the fiscal sector to   improve the efficiency of the interaction between the state and citizens. A     23    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    longstanding challenge in many subSaharan African countries is the effi  cient collection of taxes and delivery of public services and social spending.   For example  estimates suggest that digitalizing government payments could   create value of roughly 1 percent of GDP for most countries (Gupta et al.   2017). If well implemented  there are potential gains in tax administration   and compliance  targeting of social programs  and public financial manage  ment  more broadly using existing data on transactions and combining it   with personal information. Public procurement could also benefit from the   use of smart contracts that are designed to facilitate  verify  or enforce con  tract negotiations or performance. As with existing fiscal operations  effective   systems would need measures to protect privacy and minimize generating   new methods for fraud and evasion. Moreover  the use of DLT could offer   tools to help promote transparency and reduce corruption.    If adopted widely  digital currencies could have profound implications for the   monetary sector. It has been argued that some digital currencies and other   forms of digital money could potentially replace traditional currencies. The   economic literature has widely cited the three economic functions of money    (1) medium of exchange  (2) unit of account  and (3) store of value. Digital   currencies issued by the private sector differ along many dimensions and  at   the moment  struggle to fully satisfy the functions of money  in part because   of erratic valuations. In addition  they pose considerable risks as potential   vehicles for money laundering  terrorism financing  tax evasion  fraud  and   other financial crimes. Unlike private sector issuance of a digital currency    state issuance would satisfy the three functions of money and could further   support public policy goals such as financial inclusion  security and consumer   protection  and ensuring a degree of privacy in payments (ManciniGriffoli   et al. 2018). Even then  there are potential downsides of a digital currency    including risks to financial integrity and stability  that should be considered    as well as concerns from central banks regarding the implications of the   broader adoption of digital currencies6 and how this could affect the imple  mentation of monetary policy (Heller 2017a  2017b; Box 6).7    6The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the Markets Committee recently completed   work on central bank digital currencies  analyzing their potential implications for payment systems  monetary   policy implementation and transmission  as well as for the structure and stability of the financial system. The   report underlines that wholesale central bank digital currencies  combined with the use of DLT  may enhance   settlement efficiency for transactions involving securities and derivatives  but central banks should carefully   monitor digital innovations (Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures 2014  2016; Committee on   Payments and Market Infrastructures and Markets Committee 2018).    7The use of emoney could also affect the production  design  and distribution of currency  which is today a     traditional area of responsibility for central banks.    24    FinTechled Transformations and Implications    The need for investing in hard and Soft infrastructure    FinTech and associated innovations can have macroeconomic gains for   subSaharan African countries and make growth more inclusive. Increased   and more efficient financial intermediation can have a positive impact on   growth (see the finance and growth literature pioneered by Levine [2005])    especially if access to credit by SMEs increases. In addition  in economies   dominated by the informal sector  new technologies can increase the incen  tives to formalize (for instance  electronic payment of taxes in exchange for   being included in a pension system).    Investment in hard and soft infrastructure is needed to enable FinTech to   develop and serve a rapidly growing digital generation. Hard infrastructure   refers to the need for investment in internet connections and energy to   enable firms to gain from the technological improvements. Soft infrastructure   relates to the need for regulation to support a favorable business environment   and investment in skills.    Allocating resources to these investments will require policymakers in   subSaharan Africa to address several tradeoffs. Estimates for investment   in hard infrastructure are already large and pressing  whereas rising levels of   public indebtedness limits the scope of public financing. Filling the large   existing hard infrastructure gap in the region will require considering how to   work with the private sector to provide financing or delivery of services for   the adequate provision of electricity and internet services.    Investment in soft infrastructure needs to address the perennial race between   fastmoving innovation and the slower pace of regulation. There is a tradeoff   between catalyzing  or at least supporting  rapid innovation  which has large   potential gains to the economy  and taking the time to identify and manage   its associated risks through regulation and supervision to ensure financial   stability and integrity (Box 7). Given the central importance of financial reg  ulation in supporting the growth of the FinTech sector  the following chapter   gives deeper consideration to these factors.    Soft infrastructure  rethinking Financial Sector regulation    A variety of FinTech developments  especially related to the regulatory and   supervisory sector (“RegTech” and “SupTech ” respectively)  can potentially   strengthen financial stability by increasing diversification and transparency   as well as enabling better assessment of risks by all players in the financial   sector (Box 8).    25    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    Table 4.

Propagation to the rest of the financial sector through unforeseen channels.  Exacerbation of systemwide macrofinancial risks  such as contagion  procyclicality  or excess volatility  which can amplify   shocks to the financial system.    Source  Financial Stability Board (2017).    At the same time  potential gains from the emergence of FinTech carry risks   and introduce new vulnerabilities. Safety and soundness considerations are   a concern as the financial sector is prone to crises  panics  or runs (Table 4   and Box 9). Market failures such as externalities and asymmetric information   exacerbate the effects of these financial shocks  which may propagate to the   rest of the financial system and the entire economy  as well as create perverse   feedback loops with the financial system. FinTech can exacerbate some of the   wellknown existing vulnerabilities or create new weaknesses that were not   previously present in the financial system (see Basel Committee on Banking   Supervision 2017). Among the 10 areas of risk identified by the Financial   Stability Board  3 are priorities for international collaboration with rele  vance in subSaharan Africa  (1) the need to manage operational risk from   thirdparty service providers  (2) mitigating cyberrisks  and (3) monitoring   macrofinancial risks that could emerge as FinTech activities increase.8    Some steps are being taken in subSaharan Africa to start addressing these   risks. For instance  the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) issued information and   telecommunications technology risk management guidelines to the banking   sector in 2012 followed by a cybersecurity guidance note to the banking   sector in 2017. The CBK has subsequently extended the coverage of cyberse  curity guidelines to payment service providers through its 2018 draft guide  lines. In addition to guidance on cyberrisks issues  the CBK has emphasized   supervision  collaboration with national agencies  and information security   in its strategy to mitigate cyberrisk. For instance  bank supervision includes   vulnerability assessments to assess the quality of cyberrisk management    onsite examinations of the financial institution’s information and communi  cation technology systems  and the incorporation of information technology   auditors in onsite inspections (CBK 2017  2018).    8FinTech activities may be considered as part of the “shadow banking” sector  that is  financial intermediaries   that provide services similar to traditional commercial banks  but outside banking regulations. As the 2007–08   financial crisis demonstrated  the lack of appropriate regulation in the shadow banking sector  and their vulner  able business model  led to rapid contagion to the rest of the financial system.    26    FinTechled Transformations and Implications    The nature of the tradeoff between safetyefficiency in regulation of FinTech   is evolving (see Box 9). The efficiencysafety tradeoff is conceptually very   similar to comparable tradeoffs that have already been considered by poli  cymakers in the banking industry (Keeley 1990) or the payments industry   (Berger  Hancock  and Marquardt 1996). One of the differences with Fin  Tech is the nascent nature of these technologies  which makes it more diffi  cult for regulators and policymakers to determine with reasonable certainty   and accuracy the benefits in terms of economic efficiency  and the additional   vulnerabilities  side effects  and risks that these technologies can bring to   society. Moreover  “inflated expectations” about FinTech that are part of what   has been called the “hype cycle” (Gartner 2017) increase the difficulties for   regulators to provide a fair assessment of these tradeoffs. Continued research   is needed to remain up to date with the potential benefits and costs involved   in these technologies.    Due to its pioneering efforts in mainstreaming mobile money  subSaharan   Africa became an early leader in regulatory innovation. SubSaharan African   countries with large FinTech operations can use their central bank to license   and regulate mobile network operators. For instance  in the Kenyan National   Payment System Regulations  “mobile payment service providers” are tele  communications service providers licensed under the Kenya Information and   Communications Act and authorized by the CBK to offer payment services.   The common feature of these regulatory frameworks is that a mobile money   network operator maintains liquid assets equal to the amount of money   issued electronically. The funds are usually pooled and held by a bank in the   name of the mobile network operator. This arrangement ensures a customer’s   money will be available on demand. Mobile network operators do not typi  cally need to meet minimum capital requirements. Due to the relatively small   value of individual transactions  mobile network operators can limit money   laundering and terrorist financing risks by capping the number of accounts   an individual can hold and by limiting the total value of transactions over a   given period  although additional measures are also needed.    The rapid growth and evolution of FinTech created gaps for regulators to   address. The rise of FinTech has the potential to create vulnerabilities in the   financial system through several channels. First  FinTech should increase   competition in the financial system  which could reduce existing financial   institutions’ solvency by reducing their earnings  and promote higher risk   taking (Keeley 1990). Second  if FinTech firms provide financial services    thereby acting de facto as new banks  supervisors may decide to set asym  metric regulations on capital or liquidity  which could generate incentives   for regulatory arbitrage and risk shifting. Third  many of these new players   may enter in the market with relevant experience from other industries (for   example  retail or telecoms)  but much lower experience and expertise in the     27    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    financial industry. This can have negative consequences for the financial sys  tem too. All these channels can be an important source of risk  such as credit   risk  operational risk  liquidity risk  money laundering/financing of terrorism   risk  and other types of risks.    FinTech also raises concerns regarding the emergence of new risks related to   money laundering and financing of terrorism. Country authorities typically   use licensing/market entry controls and preventive measures—including   customer due diligence—transaction monitoring  record keeping  and obli  gations to report suspicious transactions to assist in deterring and detecting   money laundering and terrorism financing. Recent technologies such as   virtual assets and related financial services have the potential to spur finan  cial innovation and present some AML/CFT solutions  but they also create   new opportunities for criminals and terrorists to launder their proceeds or   finance their illicit activities (see the Financial Action Task Force (2015 and   2018). Some innovation may favor anonymity of users and promote a lack   of transparency in the financial system. In addition  crossborder payments   may become faster  cheaper  and more efficient  which can also help promote   financial flows between international crime networks. All these factors are   a cause of concern regarding money laundering and financing of terrorism    cyberrisks  and other associated risks.    Financial regulation plays a role in the emergence of FinTech. When con  sidering new FinTech entrepreneurs that provide financial intermediation   services  bank supervisors will need to consider how these new players are   going to be placed visàvis the financial regulatory toolkit. A first consid  eration that regulators may need to consider is whether FinTech companies   should be regulated like traditional banks or whether it would be optimal   to set differential regulations based on proportional application of specific   requirements for FinTech companies. For example  there are several regula  tions that increase the cost of operation of banks but are intended to control   risks and increase the safety and soundness of banks. These include requiring   capital and liquidity buffers  which would create an opportunity cost for   new entrants and impact their profitability. There are several tools that are   intended to increase the safety and soundness of the financial system when   banks are in a situation of stress  such as the use of lender of last resort facil  ities or the existence of implicit guarantees and deposit insurance schemes.   Issues related to the supervision and monitoring of cybersecurity and other   related operational risks or AML/CTF issues are especially relevant. Regu  lators could also facilitate interagency cooperation to clarify the conduct of   existing supervision.    To understand risk without hindering innovation  some jurisdictions are   adopting flexible regulatory approaches  such as “regulatory sandboxes.” A     28    FinTechled Transformations and Implications    regulatory sandbox is a closed testing environment designed for develop  ing regulatory frameworks for emerging business models such as FinTech.   Annex 2 provides a description of one of the first regulations specifically   designed for FinTech providers  set in March 2017 by the Ministry of   Finance in Mexico  and the case of a new regulatory sandbox created in Mau  ritius in October 2016.    29    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    box 4.

Project Khokha  A Distributed Ledger Technology–based Whole     Payment Systems    Project Khokha—initiated by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB)—is a proof   of concept that simulated a “realworld” trial of a distributed ledger technology   (DLT)based wholesale payment system using a tokenized South African rand. Project   Khokha built on previous global initiatives on DLTbased payments systems such as   the Bank of Canada’s Project Jasper and other initiatives in Brazil  Europe  Japan  and   Singapore (see Annex 1). The SARB (2018) notes that the project provided the oppor  tunity to broaden the DLT skills base in the South African banking industry and laid   the foundations for future collaborative work—essential in the blockchain context. The   results of Project Khokha show that      • The typical daily volume of the South African payments system could be processed in     less than two hours with full confidentiality of transactions and settlement finality.   • Transactions were processed within two seconds  across a network of geographically     distributed nodes  with distributed consensus providing the requisite resilience.   • The SARB was able to view the detail of all the transactions to allow for regu    latory oversight.     • There are many issues to consider before the decision to take a DLTbased system   into production can be made  including those related to the practicalities of imple  mentation  legal and regulatory factors  and the broader economic impact.    DLT can also enhance security and transparency in the payment system while lowering   trading costs. DLT significantly enhances the traceability and reliability of information   stored in the ledger. As blockchains are difficult to hack  DLT could be robust against   cyberattacks. DLT can also help mobilize a large volume of data and information to   better assess credit risk  thus contributing to financial stability. Several central banks are   analyzing the use of these technologies to replace existing realtime gross settlement sys  tems. In 2016  Payments Canada  along with the bank of Canada  R3  and commercial   banks  started an experiment project  codenamed Project Jasper  to explore a DLTbased   wholesale payment system.    31    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    box 6. monetary Policy implementation and mobile money    The remarkable penetration of mobile money services in the subSaharan Africa region   and the potential of this technology to evolve into a widely used transaction medium   is raising concerns about its effects on monetary policy implementation. Several central   banks in subSaharan Africa adhere to conventional reserve money programs to target   inflation through monetary targets. In these countries  targeting reserve money anchors   inflation if the growth rates of the money multiplier and the velocity of circulation are   constant (or at least predictable).    It is not clear yet how mobile money can affect the money multiplier and the velocity   of money. In principle  any mobile money balances are fully backed by money depos  ited by the mobile money service provider in a bank  so no new money is created.   Banks can use these additional funds to increase their lending  which does create new   money  but this is no different from the way in which banks use deposits (Adam and   Walker 2015). Mobile money services can also help the unbanked population to have   access to other financial services  leading to a greater level of financial inclusion  with   positive effects on the money multiplier.    Weil  Mbiti  and Mwega (2012) assessed the impact of MPesa on the behavior of   monetary aggregates in East Africa  concluding that the monetary policy implications   of mobile money have  so far  been negligible in Kenya  Tanzania  and Uganda. Weil    Mbiti  and Mwega (2012) show that the velocity of MPesa rises over time  which   indicates that users are more inclined to use the system as a transaction vehicle. None  theless  Weil  Mbiti  and Mwega (2012) suggest that developments and innovations in   this space could fuel the growth of mobile money such that it reaches levels where it   could have implications for monetary policy. This study was extended by Ndirangu and   Nyamongo (2015)  who concluded that mobile money has not affected the conduct   of monetary policy in Kenya as the (fast) pace of financial development in the country   has not caused structural shifts in the longterm money demand relation. Also  Macha   (2013) found an association between the instability of money demand in Tanzania after   the introduction of mobile money  with implications for the velocity of money. Aron    Muellbauer  and Sebudde (2015) found only tentative evidence that mobile money in   Uganda may exert some downward pressure on inflation.    Using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model  Adam and Walker (2015)   analyzed whether mobile money has changed the monetary policy environment for   the major economies of East Africa. Although mobile money poses challenges to the   conventional money targeting approaches used by several central banks across the   region  these authors found that the impact of mobile money is likely to be positive   and enhance the efficacy of monetary policy implementation. Focusing on the growth   of mobile money transactions and balances and its implications for inflation forecasting   models in Uganda  Aron  Muellbauer  and Sebudde (2015) found no significant effect.    32    FinTechled Transformations and Implications    box 7. emoney Floats and Financial Stability    Mobile cellular subscriptions in subSaharan Africa continue to grow faster than any   other region in the world. At the start of 2017  there were more than 420 million   unique mobile subscribers in subSaharan Africa  equivalent to a penetration rate of   43 percent (GSMA Intelligence 2017). The high usage of mobile money and its rapid   growth requires an effective oversight framework to safeguard public confidence and   financial stability.    Five key risks and oversight issues arising from mobile payments have been identified   (Khiaonarong 2014). They include the legal regime  financial integrity  fund safeguard  ing  operational resiliency  and risk controls in the payment system. A key element of   the oversight framework in mobile money is management of the float that refers to the   balance of emoney  physical cash  or money in a bank account that a mobile agent can   immediately access to meet customer demands to purchase or sell electronic money.   Management of the float has implications for financial stability. Based on country expe  riences  the key safeguarding measures could include the following     1.  Usage restrictions  Restricting customer funds for money transfers and prohibiting     use for other purposes such as extending credit or covering operating expenses of   the nonbank entity. Introducing liquidity requirements for nonbank mobile pay  ment schemes  which should include limiting the liquid asset categories to be held   that are equivalent to the total value of customer funds collected.    2.  Protection requirements  Insulating customer funds against the claims of other   creditors of the nonbank in the event of its insolvency. Introducing insurance or   comparable guarantees of electronic values for nonbank mobile payment schemes.   Adopting mechanisms to guarantee traceability of customer funds in the event of   mass conversion of electronic values to cash  or potential nonbank failure.    3.  Float management  A segregated trust account held by a third party with a     licensed and prudentially regulated bank. Maintaining multiple accounts at differ  ent banks to diversify risks. Holding of other forms of safe assets such as govern  ment securities.    Most financial technology (FinTech) companies use their own balance sheet for the   provision of credit or other services  implying a relatively minor impact of FinTech on   financial contagion through the credit or liquidity channel. However  many FinTech   companies have begun to rely increasingly on funding from banks or other financial   institutions with implications for interconnectedness risks and financial stability.    Customer funds held by nonbanks may be at risk if unprotected. Financial authorities   should consider adopting fund safeguarding measures. In subSaharan Africa  mobile   operators cannot reinvest floats; in some other jurisdictions (Hong Kong SAR  China)      33    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    box 7. emoney Floats and Financial Stability (continued)    floats are managed by segregation from the storedvalue facilities issuer’s own funds. By   not allowing further investment of floats  regulatory authorities in subSaharan Africa   have chosen to endure the safety and integrity of mobile payment systems  enhancing   financial sector stability.    34    FinTechled Transformations and Implications    box 8. regulatory and Supervisory Technologies in SubSaharan Africa    African countries have developed or are exploring solutions in the areas of regulatory   technology and supervisory technology.    The National Bank of Rwanda uses an electronic data warehouse to automate and   streamline the reporting processes for the supervision of more than 600 financial   institutions  including banks  microfinance institutions  and savings and credit coop  erative organizations. Data can be automatically pulled every 24 hours or even every   15 minutes in the case of mobile money and money transfer operators (Broeders and   Prenio 2018  Box 1).    The Central Bank of Nigeria and the Nigeria InterBank Settlement System are   developing a “data stack” that would include a data warehouse and dashboards and   allow riskbased and timely financial supervision and inform new strategies such   as financial inclusion policies and regulatory interventions (di Castri  Grasser  and   Kulenkampff 2018).    35    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    Box 9. The SafetyEfficiency Frontier    A wellknown tradeoff between safety and efficiency has often been considered for the   financial sector. This tradeoff  which has been applied to the banking industry (Keeley   1990) or the payments industry (Berger  Hancock  and Marquardt 1996; Chapman   et al. 2015)  can be simply illustrated by a safetyefficiency frontier possibilities curve.   The safetyefficiency frontier and the set of points inside the frontier summarizes the   possible set of market structures that may attain various levels of safety and efficiency   levels  subject to current regulatory and technological constraints. More specifically    along the frontier  technical efficiency is achieved because a certain market structure   cannot achieve more safety without compromising efficiency  and vice versa. Points   inside this frontier represent technical inefficiency because there exists an alternative   market/technological configuration that could achieve more safety  efficiency  or both.   Points above and to the right of the frontier represent market and technological struc  tures that are unattainable given current constraints. Over time  regulatory changes and   technological progress create movements of the frontier  making some of these points   technically feasible.    This simple framework can be used to analyze the impact of financial technology   (FinTech) in broader terms by considering the social impact of these technological   innovations. We would expect that FinTech expands the possibilities frontier in terms   of efficiency and safety as FinTech providers expand in the value chain. Recent tech  nologies can increase allocative efficiencies by reducing the cost of providing financial   services  increasing competition  and adding new services. Also  these innovative tech  nologies can be useful to better monitor risks  reduce operational failures  or provide   a solution to emerging vulnerabilities such as cyberattacks and antimoney laundering   and counterterrorist financing. For instance  the blockchain technology is essentially   a distributed network database that reduces transaction errors  increases transparency   and accountability  and is more flexible than traditional technologies used in clearing    payment  and settlement systems (see International Finance Corporation 2017).    Because FinTech expands the universe of existing opportunities and possibilities in the   financial industry  the set of alternatives made available by FinTech are greater than   before. One of the main challenges for public authorities is to avoid suboptimal market   situations that FinTech could create in the economy. For instance  in Figure 9 we show   a market structure in point 1 with a certain balance between safety and efficiency. As   technological progress moves the frontier  point 2 would be better off in terms of safety   and efficiency. Point 2 represents a market allocation that uses stateoftheart FinTech   to arrive to a point where the cost of providing financial services is smaller  there is   more competition  and the financial system has a lower level of vulnerabilities. Subop  timal public policies and regulations could move the allocation to suboptimal point 3    which is a situation that improves point 1 in terms of efficiency  but not in safety.    36    FinTechled Transformations and Implications    Box 9.

Safety    The entry of nonbanks in the financial services industry provides a good example. There   could be “excessive” market entry by nonbanks (for example  mobile operators) that   significantly increases competition and efficiency in the market but also adds fragility   to the financial system. These new players can use their mobile platforms to provide   traditional and new bankrelated financial services at a lower cost than traditional   brickandmortar providers. However  their use of innovative technologies (for exam  ple  blockchain  mobile money platforms  crowdfunding) can create new vulnerabilities   such as cyberrisks or other operational risks. Also  these players may not have adequate   regulatory capital levels or have access to central bank lending  which makes them   potentially more vulnerable to external shocks. For instance  in subSaharan Africa   some mobile money providers have started to provide financial services beyond pay  ments  such as savings accounts and microcredits. These providers may not have access   to deposit insurance  have limited or no capital  and no access to emergency lending by   the central bank. During a crisis of confidence in the financial system  these operators   could be exposed to potential deposit runs or to a shortage of other forms of funding    which could lead to failures and contagion to the entire financial system.    37    ChAPTEr    4    Conclusions    There is much uncertainty around the ultimate impact of financial technol  ogy (FinTech) and policymakers in subSaharan Africa as in other regions of   the world. At times  the speed of adoption of technology will even be faster   in the region  as in the case of the rapid growth of mobile payments. Effi  ciency considerations include choices regarding competition and coordination   (as in the case of whether to push for interoperability)  the likely impact on   business models and profitability  and cost and inclusion issues. They will   also have to manage risks to stability and security (including cyberrisk)  and   to financial integrity  and consider the possible impact on monetary policy   implementation and transmission as well as financial stability issues. Cyber  security is of concern as it is an emerging global risk (International Telecom  munication Union 2017).    Policymakers in subSaharan Africa will need to address several tradeoffs   to reap the potential benefits of FinTech. By 2035  more than half of those   entering the global labor market will be in subSaharan Africa. Technological   innovation and infrastructure development can play key roles in allowing   the continent to transform its demographic dividend into jobs  growth  and   rising living standards for all.    First  policymakers will need to fill the large existing hard infrastructure gap   in the region  choose the appropriate mix of energy sources to generate elec  tricity  and improve the governance of public utilities to ensure an adequate   provision of electricity and internet services. However  to do so they will   need to complement their scarce public resources with domestic and foreign   private financing as well as concessional resources. In turn  policymakers will   need to mitigate the risks associated with investing in infrastructure projects   in their countries (Gutman  Sy  and Chattopadhyay 2015).    39    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    Estimates of the infrastructure gap in subSaharan Africa need to be updated.   Indeed  the oftquoted figure of $93 billion necessary to fill the region’s gap   dates to 2009 (Foster and BricenoGarmendia 2010). Even at $93 billion    there are limits to the use of public financing to address the infrastructure   gap  given the level of government indebtedness and low domestic revenue   mobilization in the region. Policymakers in the region will need to mobilize   the financing needed to invest in electricity generation  transmission  and   distribution  as well as in the critical internet infrastructure and the hardware   and software systems infrastructure necessary to provide internet services such   as fiberoptic links.    Second  policymakers in the region will also need to address the perennial   race between fastmoving innovation and the slow pace of regulation. There   is a tradeoff between catalyzing or at least supporting rapid innovation    which has large potential gains to the economy  and taking the time to   identify and manage its associated risks through regulation and supervision   to ensure financial stability and integrity. The FinTech sector is evolving   rapidly in subSaharan Africa  and it is challenging for regulators to identify    measure  and manage the associated risks. However  regulators should be   flexible enough not to stifle innovation but at the same time ensure that their   objective to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability and financial   integrity is not compromised. Since subSaharan Africa is dominated by small   value payments  proportionality—the balancing of risks and benefits against   costs of regulation and supervision—is important and regulators can focus on   specific challenges such as price and financial stability  consumer protection   from fraud  cyberrisk  and on increasing financial literacy. In antimoney   laundering and counterterrorist financing  efforts to ensure appropriate iden  tification are needed. Regulatory sandboxes are used by many countries and   could be a useful approach to follow  while noting that they must be tailored   to different objectives  legal structures  and levels of financial development.    Third  policymakers will need to think beyond the potential benefits of   FinTech on the financial sector to assess FinTech’s impact on employment   and productivity  the digital economy  and  more broadly  muchneeded   structural transformation of their economies. To reap innovation’s potential   benefits  policymakers will need to elaborate policies that can help leverage   human capital such as improving financial and digital inclusion and ensuring   the adequate provision of financing to new sectors. Policymakers will need to   consider the larger picture as FinTech is only a means to the end of sustain  able and inclusive growth. For instance  appropriate education policies should   include financial literacy and skills upgrading if a sustainable digital economy   with activities such as ecommerce is to be encouraged. Policymakers will   need a forwardlooking approach to identify the type of future jobs that will   be needed in a digital economy and provide the relevant skills and education.     40    Conclusions    Similarly  they will need to assess how competition in different sectors will   affect the landscape of a future eeconomy (see Tirole 2017). More broadly    such policy questions should be in the context of the strategy that countries   in subSaharan Africa are elaborating to transform the structure of their econ  omies to benefit from innovation.    41    Annex 1. Project Jasper  A Distributed Ledger   Technology–based Whole Payment System    Project Jasper built a proofofconcept system that leveraged a settlement   asset issued and controlled by a central bank. The project started by allowing   participants to build a settlement capability on a special platform (Ethereum)   to demonstrate the ability to exchange a settlement asset between partici  pants. Jasper incorporates a liquiditysaving mechanism that allows partici  pants to coordinate their payments to reduce liquidity needs. Key features of   Jasper include the following (see Chapman et al. 2017)      • Value transfer. A financial market infrastructure was made available     through a digital representation of currency known as digital depository   receipt (DDR) to represent Bank of Canada deposits. DDRs are issued   in the system by the Bank of Canada and are backed one for one by cash   pledged to the bank by participants. As DDRs are exchanged for central   bank money  there is no increase in money circulating in the banking   system. DDRs are then used by participants in the system to exchange   and settle interbank payments. Ultimate settlement finality on the books   of the Bank of Canada is achieved after exchanging DDRs with the Bank   of Canada for Canadian dollars transferred into their respective settle  ment accounts. For all intents and purposes  these DDRs functioned as   cash in the system.     • Efficiency. Interbank payments were settled using systems that conduct   endofday netting between participants. However  as volumes and val  ues increased in these systems  central banks became concerned about   the risks inherent in netting. Central banks have responded by imple  menting realtime gross settlement (RTGS) systems  where payments are   processed individually  immediately  and with finality throughout the   day. Phase 1 of Project Jasper was implemented as a pure RTGS system    with every individual payment on the ledger being prefunded by DDRs   in the participant’s wallet. RTGS systems eliminate settlement risk at     43    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr    the cost of an increased need for liquidity. To make RTGS systems less   liquiditydemanding  operators around the world have implemented   liquiditysaving mechanisms. The most effective liquiditysaving mecha  nisms are those that support settlement by periodically matching offset  ting payments that have been submitted to a central payments queue and   settling only the net obligations. However  offsetting algorithms cause delay   in settlement  which is unacceptable for some types of payment. Phase 2 of   Project Jasper explored the possibility of giving banks the choice of enter  ing payments for immediate settlement or into a queue for netting and   deferred settlement.    44    Annex 2. Financial Technology   and Legal Frameworks  The Cases   of mexico and mauritius    A regulatory framework could provide the legal certainty to support the orga  nization  operation  functioning  and authorization of firms offering alterna  tive means of access to finance and investment  issuance  and management   of electronic payment funds  and the exchange of virtual assets. Regulating   financial technology (FinTech) could seek to (1) encourage the development   of products and services that are covering segments of the market not pro  vided by traditional financial institutions; (2) provide prudential rules in   risk—including corporate governance  accounting  and risk management; and   (3) prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism while protecting   users of financial technologies. The cases of Mexico and Mauritius can be   useful to contrast emerging legal frameworks across countries and regions.    The Case of mexico    In Mexico  on March 10  2018  the law regulating FinTech insti  tutions (“FinTech Law”) became effective. Key aspects of the law   included the following      • Antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing. The law proposes     establishing both client and investor identification standards  critical for   the integrity and correct functioning of the financial system. To protect   investors and clients  FinTech companies will not be allowed to make any   guaranteed returns on investment or guarantee the result or success of   investments. Also  the initiative prohibits related persons  or those with the   power to direct or control a FinTech institution’s management or resolu  tions  from applying for crowdfunding financing  as well as those officers    partners  board directors  managers  and other individuals imprisoned for   over one year for a financial crime.    45    FinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES  A G AmE ChAnGEr     • Institutions. FinTech institutions considered under the law include (1)   crowdfunding institutions  (2) electronic payment institutions  and (3)   virtual asset management institutions. To provide services in Mexico  these   FinTech institutions should be legally certified and incorporated as Mexi  can corporations or limited liability companies.     • Sandboxes. The Mexican law enables innovative companies to operate     using technological tools  models  services  or other means through inno  vative methods or processes. A twoyear temporary authorization will be   provided (trial period).     • FinTech Council. The law also provides for the creation of a FinTech   Council  which shall act as a means of consultation  advice  and coor  dination with the purpose of creating a space for exchanging opinions    ideas  and knowledge between the public and private sector  to learn   about the innovations in the field of FinTech and plan their development   and regulation.    The Case of mauritius    Mauritius is using the concept of “regulatory sandbox” to spur innovation in   the FinTech industry by accommodating the entry of new entrepreneurs. The   country has avoided adopting a prescriptive approach to regulation and has   instead developed a regulatory framework that facilitates “testing grounds”   for new digital business models that are not protected by current regula  tion. The purpose of the sandbox is to adapt compliance with strict financial   regulations to the growth and pace of innovation  in a way that does not   burden the FinTech sector with rules while also ensuring consumer protec  tion (BBVA Bank 2017). The Mauritius government launched the Regulatory   Sandbox License (RSL) on October 20  2016.    Although the RSL covers any innovative industry  most of the recent RSL   successful applicants are in the FinTech industry. For instance  SelfKey has   obtained an RSL to develop a digital identity wallet service based on Block  Chain. Other licenses have been issued to an online crowdfunding platform    a medical company producing stem cells  and a financial provider of new   investment products for the film industry.    46    references    Adam  Christopher S.  and Sebastien E.
