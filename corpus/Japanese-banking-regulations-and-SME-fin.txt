First   the  state  of  Japan's     banking  industry  and  an  outline  of  Japan’s  banking  regulations  are  discussed.  Second   we     explain the impacts of the global financial crisis on the Japanese economy and Japanese banks.     Then we explain various responses of the smallandmediumsized enterprise (SME) financing     support  program  and  banking  regulations  against  the  global  financial  crisis   including     reintroduction of the public fund injection scheme  revision of capital adequacy regulation  and     establishment of the Act to Facilitate Financing for SMEs. The measures taken by the Financial     Services Agency (FSA) were effective in terms of preventing the shocks from resulting in “the     greatest  crisis  of  the  century.”  However   these  measures  are  temporary  ways  to  avoid     exacerbation of the problems; they are not remedies for the structural issues facing the Japanese     economy  SMEs  and financial institutions.

Introduction     In  the  1980s   Japanese  financial  institutions  increased  their  presence  in  Western  financial     markets.  Japanese  financial  institutions  had  close  business  relationships  with  large  Japanese     corporations  (interlocking  keiretsu  business  relationships)  and  suffered  few  nonperforming     loans  because  of  the  country’s  steady  economic  development   making  them  the  soundest     financial  institutions  in  the  world.  Table 1  shows  the  transition  in  the  credit  ratings  of  major     Japanese  financial  institutions  and  demonstrates  that  in  1988   many  Japanese  financial     institutions were given a top credit rating.     However   in  the  1990s   the  financial  condition  of  Japanese  financial  institutions  deteriorated     rapidly as a result of an increase in nonperforming loans brought on by an economic slump. For     example   Figure  1  shows  the  changes  in  the  balance  of  nonperforming  loans  that  Japanese     banks held. At its peak at March 2002 (i.e.  the end of FY 2001)  this level exceeded ¥40 trillion.     Figure 2 clearly indicates the severity of the problem  and  Figures 1 and 2 show that  despite     disposing  of  nonperforming  loans  exceeding  ¥10  trillion  several  years  in  the  late  1990s   the     balance of nonperforming loans still increased.       In  1997   the  financial  condition  of  major  banks  grew  severe   as  evidenced  by  the  failure  of     institutions such as Hokkaido Takushoku Bank  which had a significant standing  among major     commercial banks  and Yamaichi Securities  one of the four major security corporations. Many     financial institutions that survived with government assistance barely escaped bankruptcy.     In the past  Japanese banks were subjugated under extremely strict regulations implemented by     the  Ministry  of  Finance.  In  the  1980s   however   financial  globalization  progressed   increasing     the  concern  that  if  the  regulations  did  not  change   they  may  promote  the  hollowing  out  of     domestic markets. Beginning in 1996  the Japanese government advocated Japanese “Big Bang”     financial  reforms  and  fundamentally  restructured  the  regulations.  These  reforms  could  have     been  viewed  as  a  “constructive”  approach  to  financial  regulations  for  a  new  economic     environment.     On  the  other  hand   the  deterioration  of  the  business  conditions  of  financial  institutions     progressed  at  a  speed  and  scale  greater  than  what  was  anticipated.  Because  the  laws  that     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013     Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp. 5990  2013          addressed such a situation were inadequate  financial regulators were forced to respond in an ad     hoc manner  tackling each financial problem encountered by the major financial institutions as it     occurred.  After  this  trialanderror  approach  of  ten  or  more  years   restructuring  of  the     regulations was almost completed by around 2005.     The  financial  regulation  reforms   aimed  at  dealing  with  the  financial  crises  in  Japan  that  took     place  after  the  bubble  economy  collapsed  (the  PostBubble  Financial  Crisis   for  simplicity)      initially  were  passive  in  nature.  However   these  reforms  enhanced  the  crisisresponse     capabilities of Japan’s financial system.       During  the  global  financial  crises  that  plagued  the  entire  world  from  2007  onward   Japan’s     financial system did not encounter major problems  and the distrust in the soundness of financial     institutions  did  not  intensify  among  the  general  public.  Certainly   the  Japanese  economy  was     confronted  with  severe  economic  afflictions  resulting  from  a  major  decline  in  exports.     Nonetheless   unlike  in  the  PostBubble  Financial  Crisis   the  economic  difficulties  were  not     attributable to the financial system. In this sense  Japan’s financial system had become equipped     with crisisresponse capabilities.     However   real  economic  damages  due to the  global  financial  crisis  seemed  unprecedented.  As     shown in Figure 3  real GDP growth rates were 3.2% for the fourth quarter of 2008 and 4.0%     for the first quarter of 2009. The Japanese government and the Bank of Japan tried to protect the     Japanese  economy  from  failing  into  “the  greatest  crisis  in  the  century.”  Regarding  banking     policy   several  important  measures   including  reintroduction  of  the  public  capital  injection     scheme  were taken.       In this paper  we discuss details of and issues regarding these measures that evolved during the     global financial crisis.1  First  the state of Japan's banking industry is discussed in section 2. In     section 3  an outline of Japan’s banking regulations is provided. Then  in section 4  we explain     actions regarding banking policy that responded to the global financial crisis. Finally  section 5     presents the conclusion.          ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013                       Aaa       Aa1       Aa2       Aa3       A1       A2       A3       Baa1       Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013     Table 1     Japanese Banks’ Credit Ratings (Moody’s Credit Rating)     1988     1993     1998     2006     2013     DaiIchi Kangyo      Sumitomo  Fuji      Mitsubishi  IBJ      Norinchukin     Sanwa  Mitsubishi Trust      Sumitomo Trust     Tokai  Tokyo  LTCB      Mitsui Trust                                               Mitsubishi      Yasuda Trust  Toyo Trust      Sanwa  Tokyo      Shizuoka  Shoko     Yokohama  Shizuoka     IBJ  Shoko     Chukin     Chukin  Shizuoka     Shoko Chukin                                               Shizuoka  Shoko Chukin      Chugoku  Sumitomo Mitsui      Mitsubishi UFJ Trust      TokyoMitsubishi UFJ                                 DaiIchi Kangyo      Sanwa  Tokyo     Sumitomo  Fuji      Mitsubishi      Norinchukin     Norinchukin     Norinchukin      Shinkin Central  Chiba      TokyoMitsubishi     Norinchukin  Higo  Mizuho     UFJ  Sumitomo     Corporate  Mizuho  Mizuho Trust      Mitsui  Shizuoka      Trust and Custody Services      Mizuho Corporate      Sumitomo Mitsui Trust  Japan     Chuo Trust     Trustee Services  Yokohama     Sakura  Tokai      Sumitomo      Higo  Sumitomo     Gunma  Joyo  Resona  Minato      Asahi     Nippon Trust     Trust     Kinki Osaka  Saitama Resona         Daiwa  LTCB      DaiIchi Kangyo      Yokohama     IBJ  Yokohama     Mitsubishi Trust      Sumitomo Trust      Toyo Trust     Sakura  Fuji      Toyo Trust      Sumitomo Trust      Asahi  Tokai     SanIn Godo  Daishi  Hyakujushi      Kansai Urban     Ogaki Kyoritsu  Citibank  Suruga      Hiroshima  Fukuoka       Shinsei  Resona      Chuo Mitsui Trust      Mitsui Asset Trust      Yokohama          Aozora  Suruga      Hiroshima  SanIn     Godo     NishiNippon City      Ogaki Kyoritsu      Baa2              Hokkaido     Takushoku     (Takugin)      Nippon Credit      Mitsui Trust      Yasuda Trust      Chuo Trust      Nippon Trust     Baa3                     Mitsui Credit     Kiyo  Hokuriku      Aozora       Hokkaido  North     Pacific     Ashikaga            Nippon Credit      Hokkaido     Takushoku  Chuo     Trust  Yasuda     Trust  Daiwa      LTCB     Ba1                                 Shinsei       (Source) Moody’s.     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013     Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp. 5990  2013          Figure 1     Changes in the Balance of NonPerforming Loans     trillion yen     (Note) The figure shows the risk management loans of banks at the end of March of each year.

Overview of the Banking Industry in Japan2     2.1. Industrial Structure of the Japanese Banking Industry     Figure 4 shows the basic structure of the banking industry in Japan.       Private banks can be divided into several categories based on such factors as business functions     or historical background. The distinction among city banks  regional banks  and member banks     of the Second Association of Regional Banks (regional banks II) is not a legal one but rather is a     customary classification for the purposes of administration and statistics. City banks are large in     size   with  headquarters  in  major  cities  and  branches  in  Tokyo   Osaka   other  major  cities   and     their immediate suburbs. Regional banks are usually based in the principal city of a prefecture      conduct the majority of their operations within that prefecture  and  have strong ties with local     enterprises  and  local  governments.  Like  traditional  regional  banks   regional  banks  II  serve     smaller companies and individuals within their home regions. Most of these banks converted the     legal status from mutual savings banks into ordinary commercial banks in 1989.       In  addition  to  these  commercial  banks   there  are  cooperative  financial  institutions   including     credit  associations  (Shinkin  banks)   credit  cooperatives  (Shinkumi  banks)   and  agricultural     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013     5432101232000200120022003200420052006200720082009201020112012Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp. 5990  2013          cooperatives (JA banks). These financial institutions are established to serve certain sectors. For     example   Shinkin  banks  mainly  engage  in  providing  loans  to  small  and  mediumsized     enterprises (SMEs)  and agricultural cooperatives serve farmers.     Finally  Japan Post Bank is a unique financial institution. The government ran the postal savings     system until 2007  when Japan Post Bank was established as a private stock company. However      the  government  still  fully  owns  the  stock  of  Japan  Post  Bank 3  and  most  Japanese  depositors     regard  Japan  Post  Bank  as  a  publicly  supported  institution.  Furthermore   because  of  the     regulations  Japan Post Bank cannot extend SMEs and residential loans.       Figure  5  depicts  the  market  shares  of  each  of  the  categories  of  financial  institutions  in  the     Japanese deposit market. Major banks  including city banks and trust banks  have ¥332.8 trillion     in  deposits.  Regional  banks  have  the  second  largest  shares   followed  by  Japan  Post  Bank  and     Shinkin banks.     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013        Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013             Figure 4     Banking Industry Structure in Japan     Note  Based on the Japanese Bankers Association’s homepage data  we updated  the figures in     parentheses   which  represent  the  number  of  financial  institutions  in  each  category  at  various     points  in  time  from  March  2011  to  January  2013.

Banking Regulation and Supervision Before the Global Financial Crisis     Japan’s  financial  administration  has  gone  through  major  changes  since  1990.  We  discuss  the     transition  of  Japan’s  financial  administration  here  by  categorizing  these  changes  into  three     stages.     The  first  stage  occurred  approximately  between  1997  and  2002   when  the  administration  was     pressured to address difficulties in the financial system. In 1997  Hokkaido Takushoku Bank and     Yamaichi  Securities  went  bankrupt   followed  by  the  collapse  of  LongTerm  Credit  Bank  of     Japan  (LTCB)  and  Nippon  Credit  Bank  (NCB)  in  1998.  Despite  the  government’s  ¥10 trillion     capital injection and providing full protection on bank deposits  which was called the freeze on     the  “payoff  system”  in  Japan   concerns  regarding  the  soundness  of  major  commercial  banks     spread in an unprecedented manner during this time.       Responding  to  these  concerns   asset  evaluation  was  tightened  as  the  basis  of  the  information     disclosure  system   and  a  system  of  prompt  corrective  action  was  introduced  in  order  to     accurately assess the state of financial institutions. In this sense  it was the period in which the     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013        Major Banks32.2%Regional Banks21.3%Regional Banks II5.8%Shinkin Banks11.8%Shinkumi Banks1.7%Post Bank17.0%Labor Banks1.7%Agricultural Cooperatives8.5%Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013             financial  administration  began  to  depart  from  its  traditional  form.  Furthermore   financial     legislation was being adjusted to process liquidation of insolvent financial institutions.       Until  this  period   the  Ministry  of  Finance  had  been  responsible  for  financial  supervision  in     Japan.  However   with  growing  financial  turmoil  in  the  wake  of  the  collapse  of  the  bubble     economy   much  criticism  came  regarding  the  fact  that  the  Ministry  of  Finance  held  a  dual     function of financial administration and public financing. There was also an increasing criticism     regarding  the  discretionary  and  obscure  financial  administration  of  the  Ministry  of  Finance      which  had  led  to  the  collapse  of  the  bubble  economy.  Therefore   the  function  of  financial     supervision  was  removed  from  the  Ministry  of  Finance.  First   this  function  was  transferred  to     the  Financial  Supervisory  Agency.  Later   in  July  2000   the  Financial  Services  Agency  (FSA)     was  founded  and  given  authority  for  overall  financial  administration.  At  that  time   the  FSA     Commissioner   in  a  discourse  on  the  commencement  of  the  Financial  Services  Agency      promised     to  Japanese  citizens  “greater  clarification  of     rules   prompt  and  stricter     implementations  of  those  rules   as  well  as  improvements  on  the  transparency  of  the  policy     formulation  process  and  administrative  procedures.”  In  other  words   the  implementation  of  a     financial administration with a high transparency level  based on clarified rules  was a priority     issue.       A turning point from the first stage to the second stage was the launch in October 2002 of the     Financial Revitalization Program  under the Minister for Finance Services  Heizo Takenaka  as a     response  to  an  emergency  of  the  PostBubble  Financial  Crisis.  While  the  financial     administration was severely criticized for its strong intervention in the operations of individual     banks  under the Financial Revitalization Program  major banks were urged to accelerate their     disposal of nonperforming loans (with a balance reduction by half in three years).         The second  stage   which  began  with  the introduction  of  the  Financial  Revitalization  Program      was the period approximately between 2003 and 2007. In May 2003  the financial problems of     Resona  Bank  Group  surfaced   and  based  on  the  discussions  held  by  the  Council  on  Financial     Crisis Response  approximately ¥2 trillion of public funds were injected.4     In 2005  with the moderate revival of the economy  completely lifting the freeze on payoffs also     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013     Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp. 5990  2013          became  possible.  Repayments  of  public  funds  began  as  well.  It  was  a  period  in  which  the     stability of the financial system also began to be restored. The transition from emergency mode     to ordinary mode progressed.     Simultaneously   the  financial  administration’s  focus  shifted  gradually  from  the  revival  of  a     stable financial system to user or consumer protection. Administrative measures against banks     in this regard began to appear frequently.       The  third  stage  was  the  period  from  2007  to  2008.  In  December  2007   “Financial  Reform     Program—Challenges  toward  a  Financial  Services  Nation”  described  the  phase  of  the  current     financial  system  to  be  departing  from  emergency  responses  dealing  with  the  nonperforming     loan  problem  and  moving  into  a  futureoriented  phase  aimed  at  creating  a  desirable  financial     system for the future. To borrow a slogan from the FSA  the system was entering a phase that     saw “qualitative progress in financial regulation (better regulation).”       However  the third stage was suddenly terminated. In reality  the global financial crises directly     triggered by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers occurred  and financial regulations to respond     to the crisis had to be implemented again.                   3. Japanese Economy and Financial Institutions under the Global Financial Crisis     3.1. Macroeconomic Impacts of the Global Financial Crisis     As  shown  in  Figure  3   real  GDP  growth  rate  for  the  fourth  quarter  of  2008  was  negative.     Naturally   Japanese  corporate  performance  deteriorated.  As  shown  in  Figure  6   the  average     return on assets (ROA) sharply declined by 1.5%  from 4.0% for 2007 to 2.5% for 2008.       It is natural to expect that these sharp declines in economic activity would lead to a substantial     increase in corporate bankruptcies. The number of corporate bankruptcies is shown in Figure 7.     Although  the  number  increased  by  1 500  in  2008  from  the  previous  year   it  is  considerably     smaller  than  it  was  around  2001   when  the  figure  reached  over  19 000.  That  is   measured  in     corporate bankruptcies  the effect of the global financial crisis was not unprecedented.       A  direct  reason  for  this  unexpected  result  is  that  firms  could  borrow  new  money  and  obtain     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013        Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013             various  supports  from  financial  institutions   including  an  exemption  from  the  interest  rate     payment   a  grace  period  for  payment  of  the  interest   a  grace  period  for  reimbursement  of  the     principal   and  a  waiver  of  the  claim.  Therefore   in  spite  of  the  sharp  deterioration  in  business     conditions  funding difficulties for average firms only moderately worsened (See Figure 8).

Bank Loans     Figure 9 shows changes in loans extended by Japanese domestic banks and Shinkin banks. The     fourth quarter of 2008  when the Lehman shock hit Japan  saw the largest increase in bank loans.     Without this increase  the financing difficulties of Japanese firms might have been severer than     what Figure 8 shows.     Figure 10 shows borrowers’ side data. This figure shows that large firms borrowed substantial     money from banks during the peak of the global financial crisis  but small and mediumsized     firms  (SMEs)  did  not  increase  borrowing  at  the  same  time.  However   it  is  notable  that  SMEs     paid back lower amounts than before the crisis. Banks might support SMEs by giving SMEs a     period of grace.       Why  did  banks  extend  more  loans  to  borrowers  who  had  become  riskier  due  to  the  global     financial  crisis?  When  banks  conduct  a  business  model   called  transaction  banking   banks     evaluate  credit  risks  of  borrowers  on  a  timely  manner.  It  was  natural  that  banks  downgraded     credit  evaluation  of  most  borrowers  during  the  global  financial  crisis.  If  so   bank  loans  might     have  decreased.  In  reality   bank  loans  increased.  Most  of  Japanese  banks  perform  the     relationship  banking  business  model   where  banks  and  borrowers have  longterm  relationship      which mitigates information asymmetry. Banks can support firms who face temporal difficulties     because the banks believe that firms will become profitable after the crisis ends. Therefore  it is     natural that banks performing relationship banking tend to increase loans to longterm customer     during the crisis. This might be the case for Japan.     However   the  government  was  worried  about  whether  voluntary  supports  provided  by  banks     were  enough  to  keep  SMEs  afloat.  Rather   the  government  was  afraid  that  banks  might     overestimate  borrowers’  risks  and  hesitate  to  extend  supportive  loans.  The  Japanese  economy     experienced such situations during the financial system crisis in the late 1990s and early 2000s.     Therefore   the  government  decided  to  introduce  various  measures  to  protect  the  shocks  from     resulting in the greatest crisis in the century. We discuss these measures in the following parts of     this paper.     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013     Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp. 5990  2013          Figure 9     Bank Loan Changes (from the previous quarter)     trillion yen     (Note) This graph shows the changes in loans of domestic banks and Shinkin banks  including          trust accounts.

Public Guarantee Scheme     Japanese  government   which  was  not  sure  the  relationship  banking  response  was  substantial     enough   decided  to  establish  a  new  loan  guarantee  scheme   called  “emergency  guarantee”  in     2008.     In  Japan   there  are  loan  guarantee  schemes  in  which  public  corporations  (Shinyo  Hosho     Kyoukai)  guarantee  bank  loans.  Under the  general  guarantee  schemes   when  borrowers  fail  to     pay back loans  banks that extended loans to the bankrupt borrowers absorb 20% of the losses      and  public  guarantee  corporations  absorb  the  remaining  80%.  However   under  the  emergency     guarantee  scheme   banks  shoulder  no  burden  of  the  losses   and  the  public  guarantee     corporations absorb all losses. Furthermore  the rates of guarantee charges that firms should pay     to public guarantee corporations were set at a level that did not reflect the actual riskiness of the     borrowers. Namely  implicit subsidy was provided to risky borrowers.     Figure 11 shows that approval amounts of new loan guarantees sharply increased in fiscal year     (FY) 2008  reaching approximately ¥20 trillion. At the end of FY 2008  the total balance of loan     guarantees amounted to ¥34 trillion5.

Loans from Public Financial Institutions     Public financial institutions had played an important role in Japanese financial markets before     the  Koizumi  Cabinet’s  reform.  The  Koizumi  Cabinet  started  privatization  of  public  financial     institutions  because  they  believed  that  public  financial  institutions  were  inefficient  and  that     private financial institutions were able to play the same role more efficiently.       The new laws were passed in 2007  and Development Bank of Japan (DBJ) and Shoko Chukin     Bank  (Central  Bank  for  Commercial  and  Industrial  Associations)  were  converted  to  stock     companies  in  October  2008.  At  the  same  time   four  public  financial  institutions   such  as     National Life Finance Corporation and Small Business Finance Corporation  were merged into     one public institution  Japan Finance Corporation (JFC).     Ironically  just as these reforms began  the global financial crisis emerged  and the government     had to use public financial institutions to tackle the crisis. The government urged JFC to provide     special loans to corporate sectors. JFC provided more than ¥6 trillion to individuals and firms in     2009  which was almost twice the amount loaned in 2007  as shown in Figure 12. Furthermore      JFC started a new insurance scheme  the socalled “emergency operations.” Under this scheme      DBJ  and  Shoko  Chukin  Bank  could  transfer  loan  losses  to  JFC.  Actually   DBJ  and  Shoko     Chukin Bank  using this scheme  provided ¥1.4 trillion in credits to private corporations for the     latter half of FY 2008 and ¥3.9 trillion in credits for FY 2009.6            ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013        Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013             trillion yen     Figure 12     Loans Provided by JFC     (Note)  PSN  is  new  loans  by  National  Life  Finance  Corporation  and  its  incoming  business     department of JFC.

Regulatory Measures to Encourage Banks to Make Loans     Financial  markets  throughout  the  world  became  dysfunctional  after  the  Lehman  shock.  The     Japanese financial market was also exposed to a difficult situation  although not as difficult as     those  in  Europe  and  the  United  States. 7   A  critical  problem  in  Japan  was  the  possible     deterioration  in  financing  for  SMEs.  In  this  section  we  discuss  the regulatory measures taken     by the government to ensure a smooth supply of funds to SMEs during that period.8          4.1. Public Capital Injection     4.1.1. Brief Description of Capital Injections     Observers  recognized  that many  Japanese  banks  suffered from  insufficient capitals because of     huge losses caused by nonperforming loans and declines of assets prices. However  there were     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013     01234567FY200620072008200920102011SMEPSNJapanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp. 5990  2013          strong political criticisms that the government intended to save guilty banks  by the sacrifice of     taxpayers. The government experienced bitter negotiation to provide 700 billion yen and rescue     almost  bankrupt  housing  loan  companies  (Jyusen)  in  1996.  So   although  the  government     recognized that a scheme to inject public funds into weak but still solvent banks was necessary     to protect the financial system  it hesitated to propose the scheme to the congress.       To respond to the financial crisis that was aggravated by the failure of banks such as Hokkaido     Takushoku  Bank  in  November  1997   the  Financial  Functions  Stabilization  Act  was  finally     established. Based on the Act  the first injection of public funds into banks in Japan to increase     capital occurred in March 1998. Total public funds of ¥1.8 trillion were injected into 21 banks      including large city banks. However  because the injection was small  the weak management of     banks  such  as  LTCB  that  received  the  injection  remained  unresolved.  The  reason  why  the     injection was so small was that the government was still  concerning the political criticism and     that  banks  were  afraid  of  the  reputation  risk  that  capital  injection  would  be  a  signal  of  weak     banks and trigger depositors’ bank runs.       In  summer  1998   the  world  financial  crisis  that  originated  in  Japan  was  feared  due  to  the     increase in Japan premiums while international financial crises  including Asian currency crises      were  expanding.  Thus   the  Japanese  public  recognized  that  a  largescale  capital  injection  was     necessary  and the Act on Emergency Measures for Early Strengthening of Financial Functions     was enacted in October 1998. A total capital injection of ¥25 trillion was prepared based on the     Act. Beginning with an injection of ¥7.5 trillion for 15 banks in March 1999  by March 2002  a     total of ¥8.6 trillion was injected based on the Act.     After the bank recapitalization bill lapsed  the Financial Crisis Response ordained in the Deposit     Insurance Law was the only possible scheme for further injection of public funds into banks. An     amount  of  ¥2  trillion  public  funds  was  injected  into  Resona  Bank  in  May  2003  based  on  this     scheme.  Because  the  scheme  was  supposed  to  be  exercised  only  in  a  state  of  emergency   this     measure is taken only after a problem has occurred.     Therefore  the Financial Function Strengthening Act was approved in 2004  which enabled the     government to inject capital prophylactically into financial institutions that  are solvent but that     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013        Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013             cannot perform adequate financial functions due to insufficient capital.            4.1.2. Revised Act on Special Measures for Strengthening Financial Functions     Because  banks  in  Japan  are  subject  to  the  capital  adequacy  rule   they  are  required  to  hold     additional  equity  capital  to  increase  lending.  Therefore   after  the  Lehman  shock   the  concern     was  that  a  credit  crunch  or  credit  withdrawal  would  be  triggered  regarding  SMEs  given  this     capital adequacy rule. Moreover  if many banks had weak capital adequacy ratios  the financial     system would become unstable.     The Financial Function Strengthening Act  which enabled the government to inject public funds     for  prevention  purposes  based  on  applications  from  financial institutions   was  implemented to     strengthen  the  financial  condition  of  regional  financial  institutions  in  Japan.  The  Act  was  in     effect from the end of August 2004 to the end of March 2008. Unfortunately  when the Lehman     shock hit Japan  the Act was not in effect.  Given the seriousness of the  global financial crisis      the  government  decided  to  implement  a  new  Financial  Function  Strengthening  Act  (hereafter      the revised Act) in December 2008. The revised Act was scheduled to be in effect until March     2012.9     Because  the  old  Act  placed  significant  responsibility  on  the  directors  at  banks  that  received     public  funds   bank  managers  hesitated  to  apply  for  such  assistance.  Only  two  banks   Kiyo     Holdings   Inc.  (Kiyo  Bank)  and  Howa  Bank   received  public  funds.  Unlike  the  old  Act   the     revised  Act  does  not  impose  heavy  penalties  on  bank  executives  when  the  bank  applies  for  a     capital injection.       Table 2 lists the banks that received an injection of public funds under the revised Act.10  The     table  indicates  that  the  number  of  banks  that  applied  for  an  injection  was  much  higher  than     under  the  old  Act.  On  the  other  hand   because  penalties  imposed  on  management  and     shareholders  were  not  significant  under  the  revised  Act   there  was  concern  that  a  serious     problem of moral hazard may occur.11  Namely  the government assigned the highest priority to     making banks to continue to provide loans to SMEs.            ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013     Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp. 5990  2013          Table 2     Banks That Received a Capital Injection under the Revised Financial Function     Strengthening Act     Name of financial institutions     Date of capital injection  Amount (¥100 million)     Hokuyo Bank     Fukuho Bank     Minami Nihon Bank     Michinoku Bank     Kirayaka Bank     Daisan Bank     Shinkumi Federation Bank     (Yamanashi Prefecture Shinkumi)     Towa Bank     Kouchi Bank     March 2009     March 2009     March 2009     September 2009     September 2009     September 2009     September 2009     December 2009     December 2009     Fidea Holdings (Hokuto Bank)     March 2010     Miyazaki Taiyo Bank     March 2010     1 000     60     150     200     200     300     450     350     150     100     130     (Note) The capital injection into Shinkumi Federation Bank was made through purchasing trust     beneficiary rights.

Redefinition of NonPerforming Loans     In November 2008  the FSA revised several rules that defined nonperforming loans. Before the     revision  the regulatory rule generally classified loans to borrowers whose loan conditions  such     as payment schedule and interest rates  were changed as nonperforming loans. It is difficult for     banks  to  provide  new  loans  to  such  downgraded  borrowers.  Therefore   firms  hesitated  to  ask     banks  to  change  loan  conditions.  Banks  also  hesitated  to  change  loan  conditions  because they     had to write down these conditionchanged loans  resulting in lower capital ratio.       The new rules introduced wider exceptional instances under which banks were allowed not to     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013        Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013             classify conditionchanged loans as nonperforming loans. For example  under the new rule  if     the  borrowers  have  a  credible  restructuring  plan  and  are  confidently  expected  to  attain  the     normal  status  of  borrower  classification  within  approximately  five  years  (within  10  years  if     appropriate)   the  borrowers  whose  loan’s  condition  is  changed  are  allowed  to  be  classified  as     normal status.12       This  revised  rule  had  significant  impacts.  Figure  1  in  section  1  shows  that  the  balance  of     nonperforming  loans  increased  only  slightly  in  2008   despite  the  fact  that  the  economic     slowdown was significant. Regarding the FSA’s report on factors in changes of nonperforming     loans  ¥1.4 trillion in loans originally classified as nonperforming loans (i.e.  loans that require     monitoring) were upgraded to normal status in 2008 because a credible restructuring plan was     drawn up  while the figure for 2007 (before the rules changed) was only ¥0.2 trillion. Also  the     amount  of  loans  downgraded  from  normal  status  to  nonperforming  status  in  2008  was  ¥0.9     trillion  which was less than before the crisis. Namely  the figures in 2006 and 2007 were ¥1.0     trillion  and  ¥1.2  trillion   respectively.  This  suggests  that  many  borrowers  maintained  normal     status by drawing up credible restructuring plans amid the global financial crisis.         This regulatory measure is controversial. Downgrading likely damages borrowers and decreases     the chance for them to recover. It is also reasonable that loans to borrowers with truly credible     restructuring  plans  are  classified  as  normal  status.  Owing  to  this  measure   banks  can  support     borrowers without worrying about loss due to the writeoff. This measure enables the financial     system to continue functioning smoothly.       However  this measure has a downside. Speaking in the extreme  it is always possible to draw     up a 10year plan for a borrower to revitalize. By sweeping real issues under the rug  both banks     and  firms  might  not  be  forced  to  perform  painful  reforms.  Harada   Hoshi   Hosono   Koibuchi      and  Sakuragawa  (2011)   among  others   pointed  out  that  this  measure  damages  the     trustworthiness  of  Japanese  banks’  disclosure  because  it  is  subjective  to  judge  whether  a     restructuring plan is credible.13                 ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013     Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp. 5990  2013          4.3. Temporal Loosening of Capital Adequacy Ratio Regulation       The government released an Economic Policy Measure Package  named “Seikatsu Taisaku ” on     October  30   2008.  As  a  part  of  this  measure   the  government  decided  to  loosen  the  capital     adequacy  ratio  regulation  to  tackle  the  global  financial  crisis.  This  measure  was  scheduled  to     end by March 31  2012.14     Before the measure  banks following the domestic capital adequacy rule were forced to deduct     60% of valuation losses of “other availableforsale securities” from capital. However  after this     measure   banks  were  allowed  not  to  deduct  any  valuation  losses  of  “other  availableforsale     securities” from the capital. As securities prices sharply decreased during the crisis  many banks     suffered huge valuation losses of securities in their portfolio.15  Therefore  without this measure      the regulatory capital ratio of these banks would have fallen substantially.       The securities market did not function well during the crisis  and thus market prices of securities     seemed  to  temporarily  differ  from  fundamental  values.  In  this  sense   this  temporal  loosening     may be reasonable. However  this measure also makes bank disclosure opaque.            4.4. New Measures for Financial Facilitation     “New  measures  for  financial  facilitation”  were  announced  in  March  2009  to  facilitate  firms’     borrowing  because  business  conditions   not  only  of  SMEs  but  also  of  middlesize  and  large     firms   deteriorated  remarkably  during  the  recession  after  the  Lehman  shock.  There  are  three     main measures.     First   special  offsite  interviews  were  conducted  at the  end  of  FY  2008  to investigate  whether     banks were eager to supply funds to firms. Based on the results of the interviews  the operations     from  April  to  June  2009  of  major  banks  as  well  as  regional  financial  institutions  that  were     swamped with complaints were examined.16     Second  the FSA changed the risk weight given to emergency guaranteed loans for calculating     regulatory capital asset ratios. As emergency guaranteed loans were fully guaranteed by public     credit  guarantee  corporations  and  banks  hold  no  credit  risk  for  them   the  FSA  decreased  their     risk weight from 10% to an exceptional 0%. This measure intended to decrease amounts of risk     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013        Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013             assets  which is the denominator of the capital ratio.       Adding  to  the  temporal  loosening  of  capital  adequacy  ratio  regulation  discussed  in  4.3      regulatory  capital  ratio  of  regional  banks  actually  increased  for  FY  2008  when  they  recorded     negative  profits.  Namely   average  capital  ratio  of  regional  banks  (including  regional  banks  II)     rose from 10.5 % (at the end of March 2008) to 10.7% (at the end of March 2009).           Third  capital  injections  based  on  the  revised  Act   discussed  in  section  4.1  in this  paper   were     promoted during open hearings to financial institutions by requesting that they consider a more     positive use of the Act.          4.5. Act to Facilitate Financing for SMEs (Kinyu Enkatsuka Act)     An “Act on temporary measures to facilitate financing for SMEs” (hereafter  the SMEs Finance     Act) was implemented in December 2009 to assist SMEs that had difficulty with management     and finance as a result of the recession after the Lehman shock. The SMEs Finance Act imposes     obligations  on  financial  institutions  to  make  efforts  to  respond  to  requests  as  best  as  they  can     when  SMEs  and  mortgage  borrowers  apply  for  a  softening  of  borrowing  conditions   such  as     extensions of repayment deadlines.     The  SMEs  Finance  Act  could  cause  an  increase  in  nonperforming  loans.  Therefore   banks     might hesitate to respond to borrowers’ requests. Thus  some additional measures were taken to     promote  the  implementation  of  the  Act.  If  a  financial  institution  admits  softening  loan     conditions  it  does  not  have  to  classify  them  as  nonperforming  loans in  most  cases  under  the     Act.17  Moreover  although banks must make an effort to respond to borrower requests  a legal     penalty  on  banks  is  not  specified  if  they  fail  to  do  so.  However   banks  must  organize  their     implementation system  report their implementation results to the authorities  and disclose them     to the public. A legal penalty is imposed for false disclosures or reports.     Table 3 summarizes the implementation of the Act from the beginning of its enforcement to the     end of September 2012. The implementation ratio is at a relatively higher level because of the     supportive measures discussed above. However  from the point of view of financial stability  we     are concerned that banks hold many unreported nonperforming loans because substantial loans     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013     Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp. 5990  2013          with extended repayment periods may be classified as normal loans.     We can admit that the SMEs Finance Act has directly contributed to a decrease in the number of     corporate bankruptcies. If the difficulties borrowers face are cyclical  the costs of this measure     seem  moderate.  However   if  borrowers  face  structural  difficulties   procrastination  will  make     issues  harder  to  resolve.  Procrastination  often  disinclines  banks  and  borrowers  to  conduct     painful  restructurings.  Unfortunately   Teikoku  Data  Bank   a  Japanese  major  industry     information provider  reports that failures of firms that obtained  a softening of loan conditions     under the Act are increasing.18  It suggests that the costs of procrastination will be larger.       ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013        Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013     Table 3     Implementation Rate of the Act to Facilitate SME Finance (in cases where debtors are     SMEs) (until September 2012)                  Major banks (10)     Regional banks (106)     Other banks (26)     Credit associations (272)     Credit cooperatives (159)     1 (%)     2 (%)     97.3     97.3       90.7       97.6       98.1       92.2       92.8       86.9       93.5       94.3       Labor credit associations (14)     100.0       100.0       Credit federation of agricultural cooperatives and credit     federation of fisheries cooperatives (67)     Total (654)     98.8       95.8       97.4       92.9       (Note  1)  Column  1  displays  the  implementation  ratio  that  equals  the  implementation  number     divided by both the implementation number and the rejection number.

Although  the  Japanese  financial  system  weakened  significantly  after  the     collapse  of  the  economic  bubble  in  the  early  1990s   it  had  recovered  stability  and  soundness     before this global crisis occurred. Japanese financial institutions did not hold a large amount of     securitized  assets  related  to  subprime  loans   thus  direct  losses  related  to  these  assets  were  not     large  during  the  global  financial  crisis  of  2008.  Therefore   unlike  in  Europe  and  the  United     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013     Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp. 5990  2013          States  there was little need for the FSA to assist damaged financial institutions. However  bank     supervision regulations had to be changed in response to the financial crisis in Japan. Namely      as  SMEs’  business  conditions  deteriorated  sharply   the  government  had  to  encourage  banks  to     assist SMEs.       Historically  the main purpose of bank regulation is to keep the banking system stable and sound      but  the  FSA  had  to  shift  the  emphasis  from  prudential  consideration  to  economic  activity     consideration.19  Although there are some measures  such as the public capital injection scheme      that actually increase bank soundness  most measures are regarded as financial windowdressing      including  the  change  of the  definition  of  nonperforming  loans  and the exclusion  of  valuation     losses of securities from capital ratio calculations.       How should we evaluate these windowdressing measures? These measures mitigated negative     shocks   limiting  corporate  bankruptcies.  We  may  understand  that  the  FSA  implicitly  modified     procyclicality   which  the  Basel  II  capital  adequacy  regulation  is  criticized  as  having  done.     During  the  crisis   the  FSA  reduced  effective  capital  ratio  while  the  nominal  ratio  of  8%     remained  unchanged.  Without  these  measures   bad  economic  conditions  might  have  reduced     banks’ capital ratios  and banks with lower capital ratios would have been forced to cut lending      deteriorating  the  economy  further.  After  the  crisis   many  observers  criticized  the  capital     adequacy regulation for its procyclical nature. In this sense  the FSA was a pioneer.       However  as pointed out before  these measures make reported figures  such as badloan ratios     and capital ratios  opaque. It is now hard for depositors to know how much banks hold  in real     capital  and  bad  loans  based  on  the  disclosure  report.  The  true  financial  condition  of  Japanese     banks may be worse than what is disclosed. Fortunately  so far  this  ambiguity has not created     public distrust of banks. Additionally  procrastination of problems often damages motivations of     banks  and  borrowers  to  tackle  difficulties   and  therefore   the  possibility  to  resolve  problems     likely becomes smaller.       We also note that the FSA utilized the double standard  under which different rules are applied     for internationally active banks (i.e.  banks having overseas subsidiaries and branches) and for     domestically  operating  banks.  For  example   it  is  hard  for the  FSA to  modify  capital  adequacy     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013        Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013             rules for international banks  which are subject to the Basel international agreement. However      rules for domestic banks are not subject to the international agreement and the FSA can modify     the rules. When crisis hit Japan  the FSA had relatively high degree of freedom for modifying     regulatory  rules  that  were only  applied  for  domestic banks.  Responding  to  the crisis   the  FSA     could flexibly modify several regulatory rules. Furthermore  domestic banks are major lenders     to SMEs. Therefore  regulatory measures that mainly affected domestic banks were effective for     protecting SMEs.       Recently  IMF (2012) pointed out; “for domestic and internationally active banks  different     minimum capital levels and a different definition of capital are used  although a similar capital     adequacy framework applies. Triggers for early intervention measures due to a shortfall in     minimum capital levels are set at a too low level especially for domestic banks.” Then      IMF insisted “The authorities should seek to enhance the standards for capital adequacy  and to     streamline the rules applicable for domestically and internationally operating banks.” Implicitly      IMF criticizes the double standard approach taken by the FSA. In the future  we are not sure     whether the FSA’s approach is accepted by other countries20.       In  Sum   we  have  a  big  challenge.  We  have  to  search  for  a  policy  that  has  flexibility  or  a     countercyclical nature to stabilize the shortterm economic fluctuation but that does not hurt the     credibility of bank disclosure  which is necessary condition for longterm economic stability.     Furthermore  the Japanese economy  has  to  cope  with  recurring  crises  after the collapse  of  the     bubble economy. The Japanese economy is still stagnant  and it is more and more necessary to     stimulate the economy from the financial side. We need to search for new policy measures that     encourage  banks  to  take  more  risk  to  stimulate  the  economy  and  yet  also  effectively  prevent     banks from taking excess risk.

More technical  analyses  are  conducted  in  Ogura  and  Yamori (2010)   Yamori  and  Harimaya     (2009   2010a   2010b)   Yamori   Harimaya   and  Asai  (2006)   Yamori  and  Okada  (2007)      Yamori  Tomimura  and Harimaya (2011). Also  many studies analyze Japanese banking (e.g.      Hall  1999  2003  2007; Honda  2002; Uchida & Udell  2010).     2. See Yamori and Nishigaki (2008)  which describes the large changes that have occurred in the     financial  system  since  the  1990s   as  well  as  the  impacts  of  those  changes  on  banks   and     discusses the new challenges for Japanese banks.     3. To be more exact  the government holds 100% of the shares of the holding company  Japan     Post  and the holding company holds 100% of the shares of Japan Post Bank. A part of Japan     Post shares that the government holds is scheduled to be sold.       4. A detailed analysis was conducted by Yamori and Kobayashi (2007). According to the results      the market recognized that this capital infusion was a “too big to fail” type policy.     5.  Japanese  fiscal  year  starts  on  April  1  of  each  year  and  ends  on  March  31  of  the  following     year.       6.  Therefore   the  government  recognized  the  necessary  role  of  public  financial  institutions.     Initially  stocks of DBJ and Shoko Chukin Bank were scheduled to be sold in the market by     2015. However  while tackling the global crisis  the government changed the schedule. New     laws  which put off complete privatization of DBJ to around 2022  were enacted in 2011.     7.  The  FSA  reported  that  the  total  amount  of  subprimeloanrelated  products  Japanese     depository  institutions  held  as  of  September  30   2008   was  ¥797  billion   while  the  Tier  1     capital of these institutions amounted to ¥50.1 trillion.     8. A detailed discussion of the BOJ’s policies can be found in Yamori and Kondo (2011).     9.  The  Act  was  revised  in  2011  after  the  EastJapan  Great  Earthquake.  The  public  capital     injection scheme will be in effect until March 2017.     10.  Under  the  2011  revised  Act   many  banks  that  were  seriously  damaged  by  the  EastJapan     Great Earthquake obtained public funds.       11. Based on the Act  an Examination Board has been established to review the applications and     monitor  the  performance  of  banks.  Currently   Nobuyoshi  Yamori   an  author  of  this  paper      serves as a member of this Examination Board.     12. Strictly speaking  these assets are generally classified as “other performing loans with some     concerns for the future.”     13.  Spiegel  and  Yamori  (2006)  find  that  banks  with  larger  bad  loans  tended  not  to  disclose     figures  of  bad  loan  ratios  when  the  disclosure  was  not  compulsory.  Furthermore   Kondo     (2010)  also  showed  that  financial  institutions  with  more  bad  loans  tended  to  be  passive     ©Japan Society of Monetary Economics 2013        Japanese Journal of Monetary and Financial Economics Vol. 1  No. 1  pp.5990  2013                  regarding disclosure  especially if they were rated by foreign rating agencies.     14. In June 2012  the FSA decided to extend this measure until March 30  2014. It exemplifies     the difficulty in ending a “temporal” measure.       15.  According  to  the  Japanese  Bankers  Association   total  valuation  losses  of  “other     availableforsale  securities”  amounted  to  ¥1.9  trillion  at  the  end  of  March  2009   while     banks  held  ¥2.5  trillion  valuation  profits  at  the  end  of  March  2008.  As  Tier  1  capital  of     regional  banks   most  of  which  followed  the  domestic  capital  adequacy  rule   was  around     ¥13  trillion  yen  at  the  end  of  March  2009   this  measure  had  substantial  impacts  on  their     capital ratios.       16. “One Year of the Financial Services Agency (Fiscal Year 2008)” indicates that there were no     regional financial institutions that were swamped with complaints.     17. Under the Act  the definition of nonperforming loans was revised. Now  borrowers who     have no restructuring plan when they request a softening of borrowing conditions but who     will surely make a credible restructuring plan within one year are classified as normal status.     18. See Teikoku Data Bank HP at http //www.tdb.co.jp/report/watching/press/p120805.html.     19.  Of  course   in  the  sense  that  a  prosperous  economy  reduces  the  possibility  of  corporate     failures  these measures indirectly contribute to the soundness of the banking system.     20. The FSA has already implemented Basel III regarding internationally active banks. The FSA     plans to implement different  capital adequacy rules for domestic banks.  Regarding to  IMF     (2012)   “The  FSA  expects  the  IMF  to  understand  that  noninternationally  active  banks     engage in community based businesses and thus their minimum capital ratios should be set     to  balance  the  two  objectives  of  facilitating  their  financial  intermediary  function  in     respective regions and ensuring safety and soundness of those banks.”                        REFERENCES     Hall   M.
