b'herein fileFinTech/RegTechMachine Learning A Revolution in Risk Management and Compliance?Bart van Liebergen \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Associate Policy Advisor Institute of International FinanceAbstractMachine learning and artificial intelligence are big topics in the financial services sector these days. Financial institutions (FIs) are looking to more powerful analytical approaches in order to manage and mine increasing amounts of regulatory reporting data and unstructured data for purposes of compliance and risk management (applying machine learning as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegTech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) or in  order  to  compete  effectively  with  other  FIs  and  FinTechs. This article aims to give an introduction to the machine learning field and discusses several application cases within financial institutions based on discussions with IIF members and technology ventures credit risk modeling detection of credit card fraud and money laundering and surveillance of conduct breaches at FIs.Two tentative conclusions emerge on the added value of applying machine learning in the financial services sector. First the ability of machine learning methods to analyze very large amounts of data while offering a high granularity and depth of predictive analysis can improve analytical capabilities across risk management and compliance areas in FIs. Examples are the  detection  of  complex  illicit  transaction  patterns  on  payment systems and more accurate credit risk modeling. Second  the  application  of  machine  learning  approaches  within the financial services sector is highly contextdependent. Ample  highquality  data  for  training  or  analysis  are  not  always available  in  FIs.  More  importantly  the  predictive  power  and granularity of analysis of several approaches can come at the cost of increased model complexity and a lack of explanatory insight. This is an issue particularly where analytics are applied in a regulatory context and a supervisor or compliance team will want to audit and understand the applied model.60\\x0cMachine Learning A Revolution in Risk Management and Compliance?INTRODUCTIONIn  recent  years  machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence have  seen  increasing  interest  and  popularity  in  the  financial services community as hopes are that they can dramatically improve analytical capabilities and streamline and automate all kinds of business lines including credit underwriting compliance interaction with clients and risk management. The Institute of International Finance (IIF) has previously written about the use of machine learning/AI as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegTech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in banking and in the new business models of FinTech.1In past years the amounts of data gathered in financial institutions (FIs) have increased significantly as the detail of reporting requirements has mushroomed and digitalization of services is creating a large amount of highfrequency unstructured consumer data. As a result FIs have a clear need for more powerful analytical tools to cope with large amounts of data of all kinds of sources and formats while maintaining or improving granularity of analysis. Machine learning is widely seen in the financial services sector as a technique that may deliver that analytical power. It is a subfield of statistics that quickly gained prominence in the tech community in recent years. While elements of machine learning go back to the early 20th century widespread use picked up as computing innovations and greater availability of highfrequency data allowed it to model  complex  nonlinear  relationships  while  making  machine learning much easier to be applied.This  article  aims  to  shed  more  light  on  the  concept  of  machine learning and its uses within financial services machine learning\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  links  with  other  types  of  statistical  analysis  its possibilities  and  its  limits.  It  will  also  briefly  touch  on  deep learning a form artificial intelligence that has its roots in machine learning. Thereafter applications within banking will be discussed through three use cases of machine learning credit risk modeling detection of fraud and money laundering and surveillance of conduct breaches and abusive behavior within financial institutions.BACKGROUND TO MACHINE LEARNINGMachine learning comprises a broad range of analytical tools which  can  be  categorized  into  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csupervised\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunsupervised\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  learning  tools.  Supervised  machine  learning  involves building  a  statistical  model  for  predicting  or  estimating  an output  based  on  one  or  more  inputs  (e.g.  predicting  GDP growth based on several variables). In unsupervised learning a dataset is analyzed without a dependent variable to estimate or predict. Rather the data is analyzed to show patterns and structures in a dataset.2Machine learning is a particularly powerful tool for prediction purposes.  By  identifying  relationships  or  patterns  in  a  data sample it is able to create a model incorporating those relationships that lead to the most powerful outofsample predictions. Such a model is created by running variables and the model on subsamples of the data to identify the most powerful predictors and then testing the model on many different data subsamples.3  This  can  be  done  thousands  of  times  so  that the model can \\xe2\\x80\\x9clearn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from the data and improve its predictive performance. Due to its reliance on large datasets and heavy computing power machine learning is closely associated with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig data revolution.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d In all \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[t]he extraordinary speedup in computing in recent years coupled with significant theoretical advances in machinelearning algorithms have created a renaissance in computational modeling.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d4The  accuracy  of  some  supervised  machine  learning  approaches is further augmented through their ability to conduct nonparametric analyses which can flexibly fit any model to estimate  the  data.  This  is  in  contrast  to  some  conventional statistical  approaches  that  start  out  by  making  an  assumption about the relationship between the dependent and independent  variable.  Linear  regression  for  example  assumes that this relationship is linear while this does not necessarily need to be the case. Several machine learning approaches in contrast are also able to infer nonlinear relationships which makes them better able to fit the data.1  See IIF \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegtech in financial services technology solutions for compliance and reporting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d March 2016 at http//bit.ly/2mD0q39.

Tibshirani 2013 An introduction to statistical learning with applications in R Springer Texts in Statistics. The difference between both methods has also been described as the supervised ML being based on \\xe2\\x80\\x9clabeled\\xe2\\x80\\x9d data to train the algorithm while unsupervised ML lacks training data with such labels and has to determine correlations by itself. However this is the same as having a dependent variable or not labels in the training data are values of the dependent variable.3  Large datasets are typically divided into several separate samples to estimate a model (training) to choose the model (validation) and to evaluate how well the chosen model performs (testing).4  Khandani E.

Broadly speaking machine learning can be applied to three classes of statistical problems regression classification and clustering. Regression  and  classification  problems  both  can  be  solved through  supervised  machine  learning;  clustering  is  an  unsupervised machine learning approach.Regression problems involve prediction of a quantitative continuous dependent variable such as GDP growth or inflation. Linear learning methods try to solve regression problems including partial least squares5 and principal component analysis; nonlinear learning methods include penalized regression approaches  such  as  LASSO  and  elastic  nets.6  In  penalized approaches a factor is typically added to penalize complexity in the model which should improve its predictive performance.Classification problems typically involve prediction of a qualitative (discrete) dependent variable which takes on values in a class such as blood type (A/B/AB/O). An example is filtering spam  email  where  the  dependent  variable  can  take  on  the values SPAM/NO SPAM. Such problems can be solved by a decision tree \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich aims to deliver a structured set of yes/no questions that can quickly sort through a wide set of features and thus produce an accurate prediction of a particular outcome.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d7 Support vector machines also classify observations but  by  applying  and  optimizing  a  margin  that  separates  the different classes more efficiently.8In  clustering  lastly  only  input  variables  are  observed  while a  corresponding  dependent  variable  is  lacking.  An  example is exploring data to detect fraud without knowing which observations are fraudulent and which not. An antimoney laundering (AML) analysis may nonetheless yield insights from the data by grouping them in clusters according to their observed characteristics. This may allow an analyst to understand which transactions are similar to others. In some instances unsupervised learning is first applied to explore a dataset; the outputs of this approach are then used as inputs for supervised learning methods.9Table  1  classifies  popular  machine  learning  approaches  according  to  their  (un)supervised  learning  character  and  the types of problems they can be applied to.Prediction versus explanationMachine learning\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to make outofsample predictions does  not  necessarily  make  it  appropriate  for  explanation  or Linear methodsNonlinear methodsSupervisedRegression\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Principal components \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Ridge\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Partial least squares\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 LASSOClassificationSupport vector machinesPenalized regression\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 LASSO\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 LARS\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 elastic netsNeural networks and deep learningDecision trees \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 classification trees\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 regression trees\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 random forestsSupport vector machinesDeep learningepyt lmeborPUnsupervisedClustering*Clustering methods K and Xmeans hierarchicalPrincipal components analysisDeep learning* Since unsupervised methods do not describe a relation between a dependent and interdependent variable they cannot be labelled linear or nonlinear.Table 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Overview of machine learning methodsinference as well as statistical methods are typically subject to a tradeoff between explanatory and predictive performance. A good predictive model can be very complex and may thus be very hard to interpret.10 For predictive purposes a model would need only to give insight in correlations between variables not in causality. In the case of credit scoring a loan portfolio a good inferential model would explain why certain borrowers do not repay their loans. Its inferential performance can be assessed through its statistical significance and its goodnessoffit within the data sample. A good predictive model on the other hand will select those indicators that prove to be the strongest predictors of a borrower default. To that end it 5  PLS is used to find the fundamental relations between two matrices through linear regression.6  LASSO stands for least absolute shrinkage and selection operator. LASSO and elastic nets both perform variable selection yet apply different types of penalties for model complexity.7  Tiffin A. 2016 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSeeing in the dark a machinelearning approach to nowcasting in Lebanon\\xe2\\x80\\x9d IMF Working Paper WP/16/56 March8  Auria L. and R.

What matters is that it contains information about the ability to repay.Tackling overfitting bagging and ensemblesExcessively  complex  models  can  also  lead  to  \\xe2\\x80\\x9coverfitting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where they describe random error or noise instead of underlying  relationships  in  the  dataset.  Model  complexity  can  be due to having too many parameters relative to the number of observations.11  In  machine  learning  overfitting  is  particularly prevalent in nonparametric nonlinear models which are also complex by design (and therefore also typically hard to interpret). When a model describes noise in a dataset it will fit that one data sample very well but will perform poorly when tested outofsample.12approaches.  It  can  only  be  more  accurate  at  inferring  those correlations. However one observer has noted \\xe2\\x80\\x9c[i]f you have no idea what is behind a correlation you have no idea what might cause that correlation to break down.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d17Deep learning and neural networks from machine learning to artificial intelligenceSo far discussion has focused on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclassic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d machine learning methods that are applied to statistical problems with welldefined and structured datasets. Additionally machine learning approaches  have  been  advanced  and  combined  to  solve  all kinds  of  complex  problems  functioning  as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cartificial  intelligence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d One of the dominant approaches is deep learning a learning approach that can be based on both supervised and nonsupervised methods; all are nonlinear.18There  are  several  ways  to  deal  with  overfitting  and  improve the  forecast  power  of  machine  learning  models  including \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbootstrapping\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9cboosting\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbootstrap aggregation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (also called  bagging).13  Boosting  concerns  the  overweighting  of scarcer observations in a training dataset to ensure the model will train more intensively on them. For example one may want to overweight the fraudulent observations due to their relative scarcity when training a model to detect fraudulent transactions in a dataset. In \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbagging\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a model is run hundreds or thousands of times each on a different subsample of the dataset to improve its predictive performance. The final model is then an average of each of the run models. Since this average model  has  been  tested  on  a  lot  of  different  data samples  it should be more resilient to changes in the underlying data. A \\xe2\\x80\\x9crandom forest\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is an example of a model consisting of many different decision treebased models. Econometricians can take this concept even further by combining the resulting model with a model based on another machine learning technique. The result is a socalled ensemble a model consisting of a group of models whose outcomes are combined by weighted averaging or voting.14 It has been shown that averaging over many small models tends to give better outofsample prediction than choosing a single model.15 A theoryfree approach to analysis?Due to a typical lack of explanatory power and inherent complexity  of  machine  learning  models  the  discipline  has  been criticized by some as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca theoryfree analysis of mere correlations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinevitably fragile.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d16 Machine learning relies on found  insample  (past)  correlations  to  predict  outofsample (future)  correlations  without  always  offering  an  understanding of the relationship analyzed. In that sense it is as much a  backwardlooking  way  of  prediction  as  other  statistical In deep learning multiple layers of algorithms are stacked to mimic neurons in the layered learning process of the human brain. Each of the algorithms is equipped to lift a certain feature from the data. This socalled representation or abstraction  is  then  fed  to  the  following  algorithm  which  again  lifts out another aspect of the data.19 The stacking of representationlearning  algorithms  allows  deeplearning  approaches  to be  fed  with  all  kinds  of  data  including  lowquality  unstructured data; the ability of the algorithms to create relevant abstractions of the data allows the system as a whole to perform a relevant analysis. Crucially these layers of features are not designed by human engineers but learned from the data using a generalpurpose learning procedure.2011  For example R2 a goodnessoffit indicator tends to increase (and cannot decrease) with any variable that is added to the model whether or not it makes sense in the context.

The ability  to  crunch  large  amounts  of  raw  data  and  to  identify complex patterns in it makes it particularly wellplaced to analyze \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig data\\xe2\\x80\\x9d such as the user datasets of tech giants such as Google Microsoft and Amazon.Given that it was partly developed by the U.S. National Security Agency it is perhaps unsurprising that deep learning has proved  to  be  very  proficient  at  face  recognition  and  natural language  understanding  including  question  answering  and language  translation.  Upon  \\xe2\\x80\\x9coverhearing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  a  discussion  it  is able to classify the topic of discussion and the sentiments of the  speakers.21  While  some  conventional  machinelearning approaches can be equipped to solve nonnumeric problems as well (for example xmeans clustering has been applied to text mining) deep learning has often proved to be more accurate. However a typical deeplearning system is extremely complex and requires a dataset with hundreds of millions of labeled observations only to be trained. In many fields availability  of  sufficient  data  for  such  extremely  large  datasets  is hardly a given.Application within financial servicesIn  past  years  the  amounts  of  data  gathered  in  financial  institutions  (FIs)  have  increased  significantly  as  the  details  of reporting  requirements  have  mushroomed  and  digitalization of services is creating a large amount of highfrequency unstructured consumer data. As a result FIs have a clear need for more powerful analytical tools to cope with large amounts of data of all kinds of sources and formats while maintaining or improving granularity of analysis.After the financial crisis of 200809 many new regulations and supervisory measures were introduced that required FIs to report more detailed and more frequent data on more aspects of their business models and balance sheets. Under the new capital  regime  banks  report  large  exposures  liquidity  measures collateral and capital levels. Stress tests are based on all kinds of firm data including loanlevel balance sheet data and  qualitative  aspects  of  the  business  model.  The  Federal Reserve\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CCAR exercise requires FIs to consider the impact of more than 2000 economic variables on their business. For insurers Solvency II has dramatically increased reporting requirements. These processes create large amounts of reporting data that need  to  be  welldefined  and  structured  aggregated  across the group and delivered intime with supervisors. Regulators have  therefore  introduced  numerous  initiatives  to  improve the  quality  of  supervisory  data  and  the  ability  of  financial institutions to deliver these data. The Basel Committee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Principles for Risk Data Aggregation (Basel 239) sets standards for GSIBS to improve their IT systems and reporting structures. IFRS 9 aims to improve the quality of supervisory data.Apart  from  reporting  data  FIs  are  increasingly  able  to  gather large amounts of lowquality unstructured highfrequency data.  These  include  outputs  from  consumer  apps  and  other digital interactions with clients metadata from payment systems and external data sources such as social media feeds which can be mined to gauge insights on market sentiment. This type of data is typically called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig data.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWith  practically  all  aspects  of  FI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  business  model  regulated and  supervised  with  detailed  risk  metrics  running  a  bank insurer  or  asset  manager  is  increasingly  becoming  a  matter of  optimization  within  hundreds  of  constraints.  To  compete effectively they need to find this optimum while also mining consumer data for detailed insights on client preferences and behavior.The extensive set of machine learning approaches is well situated to deliver this analytical power in different contexts due to its ability to cope with (or better said its need for) extremely large datasets and the granularity of analysis. For the mining of highquality structured supervisory data more conventional machine learning techniques are typically applied. To mine high  frequency  low  quality  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbig  data\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  sources  Googlelike deep  learning  and  neural  network  techniques  are  applied which cope with these data due to their representation learning abilities. Below the state of play in three use cases of machine learning is  being  discussed  the  modeling  of  credit  risk  detection  of fraud and money laundering and the detection of conduct risk and abusive behavior within financial institutions.THREE USE CASESCredit risk and revenue modelingSince the early 2000s an extensive academic literature on the use of machine learning methods to model credit risk has developed.  To  give  just  a  few  examples  Angelini  et  al.  (2007) apply a neural network approach to model SME credit risk on 21  Ibid.64THE CAPCO INSTITUTE JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL TRANSFORMATION\\x0cMachine Learning A Revolution in Risk Management and Compliance?a small dataset of Italian SMEs. Auria and Moro (2008) assess company  solvency  using  support  vector  machines  and  find that  they  produce  more  accurate  outofsample  predictions than  existing  techniques.  Khandani  et  al.  (2010)  apply  generalized classification and regression trees (CART) to a large dataset  of  a  commercial  bank  to  build  consumer  credit  risk models.  These  combine  traditional  credit  factors  such  as debttoincome  ratios  with  consumer  banking  transactions which greatly increases the predictive power of the model. FIs have traditionally used linear logit and probit regressions to  model  credit  risk  for  capital  requirements  stresstesting and  internal  risk  management  procedures.22  Recently  many have  started  to  experiment  with  the  application  of  machine learning methods to improve financial risk predictions. Unsupervised methods are typically used to explore the data while regression  and  classification  methods  (trees  support  vector machines) can predict key credit risk variables as probability of default or lossgiven default. Banks normally have extensive records of loanlevel data to serve as inputs. Banks have sometimes also experienced that machine learning  can  be  hard  to  apply  as  methods  can  be  complex  and models sensitive to overfitting the data. Thereby the quality of data within banks is not always fit enough for advanced statistical analysis while banks are not always able to consolidate the data from across the financial group among others due to inconsistent data definitions across jurisdictions and the use of multiple systems. Nonparametric and nonlinear approaches (support vector machines neural networks and deep learning) and ensembles are so complex that they are practically \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack boxes\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that are hard if not impossible for any human to understand and audit from the outside. That makes these models hardly  useful  for  regulatory  purposes  such  as  the  development  of  internal  models  in  the  Basel  Internal  RatingsBased approach. Financial supervisors typically require risk models to be clear and simple in order to be understandable and verifiable and appropriate for validation by them.That  does  not  however  rule  out  the  use  of  machine  learning  to  optimize  parameters  and  models  with  a  regulatory function.  Linear  and  simple  nonlinear  machine  learning  approaches can be applied and still perform better than similar nonmachine learning approaches. Machine learning can also be applied to select variables and optimize parameters in existing  linear  regulatory  models.  Khandani  et  al  (2010)  stress that CART (tree) models produce easily interpretable decision rules  whose  logic  is  clearly  laid  out  despite  their  nonlinear character. Indeed there have been examples already of banks applying machine learning in a regulatory context. In a public example Citigroup hired an external vendor to build a revenue forecasting model for the 2015 CCAR exercise.23FraudOne  area  in  which  machine  learning  has  been  applied  for more  than  a  decade  and  with  significant  success  is  the  detection of credit card fraud. Banks have equipped their credit card  payments  infrastructures  with  monitoring  systems  (socalled workflow engines) which monitor payments for potential  fraudulent  activity.  Fraudulent  transactions  can  then  be blocked in realtime. The fraud models used by these engines have been trained on historical payments data.The  high  frequency  of  credit  card  transactions  provides  the large  datasets  required  for  algorithm  training  back  testing and  validation.  Furthermore  since  banks  are  able  to  verify unambiguously which transactions were fraudulent and which were not they can construct clear historical data with relevant fraud  and  nonfraud  labels  to  train  classification  algorithms. The  historical  transaction  datasets  showcase  a  wide  variety of predetermined features of fraud which distinguish normal card usage from fraudulent card usage ranging from features from transactions the card holder or from transaction history. The  detection  of  money  laundering  and  terrorism  financing through payments systems stands as a contrast to machine learning\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  longstanding  record  in  credit  card  fraud.  Many banks  are  still  relying  on  conventional  rulesbased  systems which  focus  on  individual  transactions  or  simple  transaction patterns. These systems are often unable to detect complex patterns of transactions or obtain a holistic view of transactions behavior on payment infrastructures. Due to their coarse selection methods the number of false positives created by these  systems  is  substantial.  As  a  result  significant  human capacity is required for the assessment of alerts and filtering false  positives  from  actual  suspicious  observations.  In  addition impediments to data sharing and data usage as well as longestablished  regulatory  requirements  have  complicated innovation in the AML/CFT area.2422  In a probit model the dependent variable is binary (can only take two values); in a logit model the dependent variable is categorical.23  Ayasdi \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCCAR stress test\\xe2\\x80\\x9d http//bit.ly/2m5n4y2 undated; and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfter yesterday CCAR less stressful for Citigroup\\xe2\\x80\\x9d March 6 2015 http//bit.ly/2mmbfph24  See the IIF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s forthcoming report on the use of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregtech for AML\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and submissions to FATF and the BCBS for more information on data sharing issues in AML/CFT on www.iif.com. 65THE CAPCO INSTITUTE JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL TRANSFORMATION\\x0cMachine Learning A Revolution in Risk Management and Compliance?Machinelearning systems have the potential to improve detection of money laundering activity significantly due to their ability  to  identify  complex  patterns  in  the  data  and  combine transactions  information  at  network  speed  with  data  from many  other  sources  to  obtain  a  holistic  picture  of  a  client\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activity.  Indeed  these  systems  have  already  been  shown  to bring false positives down significantly.25 However application so far in the AML space has lagged for several  reasons.  First  money  laundering  is  hard  to  define. There is no universally agreed definition of money laundering and financial institutions do not receive feedback from law enforcement agencies on which of their reported suspicious activities have turned out to be money laundering. It is therefore more difficult to train MLdetection algorithms using historical data  because  an  incidence  of  money  laundering  typically  is not  firmly  established.  As  a  secondbest  FIs  are  optimizing ML detection algorithms using lowerlevel suspicious activity reports as a depending variable for classification \\xe2\\x80\\x93 using classification between alerts that the bank could classify as false alerts and those that moved on to be submitted as SARs to law enforcement agencies. Unsupervised learning methods are also applied to AML/CFT as they \\xe2\\x80\\x9clearn\\xe2\\x80\\x9d relevant patterns from the data by clustering transactions  or  client  activity.  This  yields  additional  insights since laundering methods take all kinds of form and develop on a continuous basis. An example of such unsupervised learning is clustering. Clustering requires large datasets where it can automatically find patterns within the data without the need for labels. Clustering works by identifying outliers as points without any strong membership in any one cluster group thus finding anomalies within  subsets  of  the  data.  In  AML  clustering  is  one  of  the methods used to group together data; using other analytics such as topological data analytics and dimensionality reduction machine learning can reduce the significant amounts of false positives often associated with alternative methods. Surveillance of conduct and market abuse in tradingA third area in which machine learning is increasingly being applied within financial institutions is the surveillance of conduct breaches  by  traders  working  for  the  institution.  Examples  of such breaches include rogue trading benchmark rigging and insider trading \\xe2\\x80\\x93 trading violations that can lead to significant financial and reputational costs for FIs. In the last couple of years automated systems have been developed that monitor the behavior of traders in multiple ways and with increasing accuracy.The  capabilities  of  the  first  generation  of  these  surveillance systems were limited to monitoring trading behavior and only through assessing single trades. However the improved ability of machine learning approaches to identify large complex patterns in data has allowed a new generation of systems to analyze entire trading portfolios. These systems are also able to link trading information to other behavioral information of a trader  such  as  email  traffic  calendar  items  building  check in and check outtimes and even phone calls. Technologies such as natural language processing (typically based on deep learning) and text mining (which can be based on several learning algorithms26) have made those sources machinereadable and suitable for automated analysis. The outputs of the trading behavior and communications of one or multiple traders are then integrated and compared to a profile of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d behavior. When a trader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior or trading performance deviates from what is deemed normal the system will send an alert to the FI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s compliance team.There are several challenges to applying machine learning in this  space.  First  there  are  typically  no  labeled  data  to  train algorithms on as it is legally complex for financial institutions to share the sensitive information on past breaches with developers. Supervisory learning approaches are therefore hard to apply. Second a surveillance system needs to be auditable for supervisors and for compliance officers and needs to be able to explain to a compliance officer why certain behavior has set off an alert. For systems that are entirely based on machine learning that can be difficult due to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblack box\\xe2\\x80\\x9d character of learning approaches. In order for an alert to be interpretable and actionable for compliance teams it should ideally be linked to detection of a specific kind of behavior rather than based solely on a statistical correlation in the data. These  issues  can  be  addressed  at  least  partly  by  founding the  learning  system  on  a  behavioral  sciencebased  model which incorporates human decisions and behavioral traits. In a way such a model addresses the lack of explanatory power of machine learning approaches. Any alerts from the system will be based on deviations it has identified from the model. However the inclusion of machine learning approaches on top of the model creates a feedback loop in the system through which it can adapt to evolving behavior and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cget to know\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a 25  Adamson D. 2016 at \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMachine learning \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the future of compliance?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d panel discussion at Sibos conference September 2826  Bholat et al. 2015.66THE CAPCO INSTITUTE JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL TRANSFORMATION\\x0cthe detail with which data can be analyzed and outcomes predicted. Unsupervised approaches allow for exploration of data without a dependent variable. Running algorithms thousands of times on training data and combining models improves their predictive power while limiting overfitting and maintaining analytical granularity.Such improved often automated analytical capabilities allow FIs to gain better insights in business processes such as lending  risk  management  customer  interaction  and  payments. With  ever  more  data  produced  in  these  processes  machine learning can discover richer more complex patterns and relationships as in the analysis of transactions or credit risk or by connecting different datasets to draw more accurate overarching conclusions as in the monitoring of conduct breaches.Second the application of machine learning approaches within  the  financial  sector  is  highly  contextdependent.  Ample highquality data for training or analysis are not always available in FIs. More importantly the predictive power and granularity of analysis of several approaches can come at the cost of increased model complexity and a lack of explanatory insight. This  is  an  issue  particularly  where  analytics  are  applied  in  a regulatory context and a supervisor or compliance team will want to audit and understand the applied model. Fortunately simpler machine learning approaches do exist combining nonlinear analysis with simplicity. Indeed vendors of machine learning analytics in finance typically aim to combine machine learning\\xe2\\x80\\x99s depth of insight with model simplicity or add factor models to improve the auditability of their products. As it seems there is an algorithm for every problem.Machine Learning A Revolution in Risk Management and Compliance?trader as it ingests more data. That is a crucial difference with previous rulesbased systems which are unable to tailor their surveillance methods to changed probability distributions and correlations. Consequently these systems are typically based on more conventional types of machine learning which can be audited and explained more easily than complex types such as neural nets and deep learning.A practical barrier to the implementation of automated surveillance systems is the fragmentation and complexity sometimes found in FI\\xe2\\x80\\x99s IT systems. To gain a perspective on a trader\\xe2\\x80\\x99s behavior surveillance systems require information from many sources which are likely to be found in different systems that can be mutually incompatible or slow to deliver.CONCLUSION Machine  learning  and  artificial  intelligence  are  big  topics  in many  fields  of  business  these  days  including  the  financial services  sector.  FIs  are  looking  to  more  powerful  analytical approaches  as  they  need  to  manage  and  mine  increasing amounts of regulatory reporting data and unstructured data either for compliance purposes or in order to compete effectively with other FIs and FinTech\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.

Two tentative conclusions emerge on the use of machine learning in the financial sector \\xe2\\x80\\x93 tentative because the field is developing fast and many FIs are still experimenting with machine learning in some spaces.First machine learning comprises a range of statistical learning tools that are generally able to analyze very large amounts of data while offering a high granularity and depth of analysis mostly for predictive purposes. The ability of some approaches to infer nonlinear relationships and to conduct data analysis without making assumptions about the shape or form of the relationship between variables (i.e. nonparametric) increases 67THE CAPCO INSTITUTE JOURNAL OF FINANCIAL TRANSFORMATION\\x0c'
