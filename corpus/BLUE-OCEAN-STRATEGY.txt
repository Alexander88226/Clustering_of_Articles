Since 18th century Advisors have relied on expert knowledge and vast personal networks to source  deals.  However  due  to  the  trend  of  globalization  these  networks  are limited an advisor find it hard to know the perfect acquirer in Southeast Asia or Middle East or the right Chinese buyer for an European firm.   Not only does information asymmetry for crossborder deals exist there are speed barriers language barriers trust & reliability barriers as well as the fact that some hidden  gems  are  just  hard  to  find  (The  Economist  2014).  Currently  as  more dealmakers  and  deal  activity  are  using  online  M&A  platform  it  becomes increasingly important for M&A professionals to incorporate online deal sourcing into their broader dealmaking strategies (Intralinks 2015).   This paper attempts to use BOS as theoretical basis to analyse and examine the two Chinese online M&A platforms. In addition this paper will also introduce the creative  steps  for  conducting  a  productive  BOS.  Furthermore  Deutsche  Bank FinTech development will also be mentioned and will be analyzed through BOS. In the end opionions about what DG and MWG do how they perform and where they could go will be expressed.  The  paper  is  organised  as  follows  In  section  2  I  will  introduce  two  Chinese online dealsourcing platforms. In section 3 I will give the overall look of BOS which including its definition key analysis tools and six key principles. In section 4 I will build up a link between BOS and two Chinese online M&A platforms and try to use BOS theory to explain and examine the two Chinese startups. In section 5 I will introduce Deutsche Bank FinTech Strategy and try to use BOS to analyse  and  examine  its  development  and  enhance  its  execution.  Result  and outlook about the paper are in section 6.    1 \\x0c2  Background of companies in this industry 2.1 Market To start the topic of the market of online M&A and analytic platform a survey conducted by Intralinks can be a strong argument to analyze the overall opinions from public to this new industry from worldwide (Intralinks 2015).  Intralinks is a leading virtual data room for serving M&A community to simplify and accelerate the deal process with 20 years history. Intralinks started a global survey  in  2013  to  understand  how  technology  and  specialized  deal  networks impact M&A deal sourcing. Later in December of 2015 Intralinks conducted a followup  survey  to  measure  how  attitudes  towards  and  adoption  of  these technologies  have  changed  over  the  last  two  years.  Over  700  dealmakers  from worldwide have participated in this survey the conclusions are showed as follows  l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Cognized value of online deal sourcing is growing l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Online deal sourcing is becoming mainstream in the market l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Online deal sourcing has succeeded in closing transactions l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Conventional social media platforms are losing favor  In America online deal sourcing industry has been developed over 20 years. But in China it is almost a blank market (ibid.). According to J.P. Morgan\\xe2\\x80\\x99s report in 2016  China  becomes  the  most  dynamic  market  in  M&A  especially  for  the oversea  investments  (J.P.  Morgan  2016).  MWG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  founder  Yunfan  Wang believes that China is setting off a world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sixth wave of M&A. Different from the former five waves of M&A in the world the major player of the sixth wave is China. Chinese capital is expected to create a new history of M&A (Mr. Wang Y. 2017 pers.comm. 10 January). In following parts there are two Chinese online M&A platforms will be described in details. As most of Chinese online deal sourcing businesses are startups and most  of  which  have  developed  for  less  than  4  years  they  are  currently  still  in Venture  Capital  financing  stage  so  called  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cburning  money\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  which  is  a  very common  phenomenon  in  China  for  internet  startups  (ibid.).  In  view  of  such   2 \\x0csituation  financial  data  of  these  firms  are  not  available  but  some  KPIs  in  the following parts will be mentioned in details. 2.2 Development of companies over time  DealGlobe The first company will be introduced is DealGlobe. DealGlobe is a online deal sourcing platform launched in China and Europe for helping Chinese businesses  undertake  and  succeed  in  Crossborder  M&A  (DealGlobe  Company Website). DealGlobe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  founder  Lin  Feng  who  worked  before  on  sourcing  assets  on  the internet at Summit Partners during that time he started to think that the internet and  technology  could  play  important  roles  in  M&A  especially  giving  the  huge ammounts of \\xe2\\x80\\x9edigitally connected\\xe2\\x80\\x9c population in China. Later on Lin Feng met technology entrepreneur Alan Buxton in order to validate the concept of digitally focused M&A and founded it workable in both technogically and marketable. In February  2014  Mr.  Feng  founded  DealGlobe  with  Alan  and  Diane  Liu  as  cofounders (ibid.).  In  December  2014  DealGlobe  and  DG  China  opened  their  main  office  in Shanghai  and  technology  support  office  in  Beijing.  The  Mandarin  version  of DealGlobe  system  was  first  launched  in  March  2015;  one  month  later  English version could be used for foreign investors. The UK Trade & Investment Sirius Programme  was  very  supportive  in  the  early  development  of  DealGlobe  with DealGlobe receiving a 2015 UKTI Outstanding Achievement award (ibid.). Morning  Whistle  Group  is  also  an  online  platform  that  offer  information  on crossborder  investment  and  overseas  M&A  and  founded  by  Yunfan  Wang  3 years  ago.  Unlike  DealGlobe\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  founder  Lin  Feng  Mr.  Wang  was  a  Journalist instead of an investment banker before started his own business. Thus he is more focus on exploring ideas data new generation of information technology crossborder M&A investment in information infrastructure. These services cater to the transaction  buyers  such  as  Chinese  government  enterprises  and  buyout  funds sellers  such  as  foreign  governments  enterprises  and  private  equity  funds  and professional  institutions  such  as  investment  banks  law  firms  accounting  firms financial  adviser  companies  and  commercial  banks  (Mr.  Wang  Y.  2017 pers.comm. 10 January).   3 \\x0cWang\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  startup  story  is  a  typical  one  of  transforming  from  journalists  to entrepreneurs  in  China.  He  was  an  associate  editor  in  \\xe2\\x80\\x9e21st  Century  Business Herald\\xe2\\x80\\x9c before he founded Morning Whistle Group the No. 1 financial media in China.  Different  from  ordinary  people  journalists  are  more  sensitive  to information. The trigger point of starting the business is a report that Wang was responsible for. At that time just after European debt crisis his media company published a report of privatisation of Greece\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 50 billion stateowned assets. Then he  got  two  phone  calls  from  a  Chinese  stateowned  insurance  company  and  a private company in Zhejiang China. These two firms were complained about they have intention to do oversea investment but no channels at all (ibid.). At  that  time  European  assets  were  comparatively  cheap  due  to  european  debt crisis.  These  two  phone  calls  gave  Yunfan  Wang  two  feelings  1  There  were hardly any channels of oversea investments to Chinese stateowned companies. 2 The Chinese private companies have already the intention and ability to invest in oversea  markets.  Therefore  he  determined  that  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  development  will  bring huge  market  demand  on  crossborder  M&A.  The  market  existed  severe information  asymmetry  and  services  vaccum  which  makes  the  information related to deal be most valuable (ibid.). Yunfan Wang and his partners founded MWG by the end of year 2013 the new startup is strategically positioned to offer news and onestop services for crossborder M&A. 3 years later MWG has been able to grow as biggest online M&A platform  in  China  counts  crossborder  information  and  knowledge  plattform (Morning Whistle website) global assets trading platform (ChinaMerger) and six terminal informatiques among its units (Morningwhistle Company Website). 2.3 Business model  The  target  groups  of  Morning  Whistle  Group  are  composed  of  buysides  sellsides  and  professional  associations.  Sellsides  are  project  investments  and  the company  sellers  refering  mainly  to  overseas  governments  enterprises  and  PE funds. Buysides mean investments and acquirers they consist mainly of Chinese governments  enterprises  and  M&A  funds.  Professional  associations  include investment  banks law  firms  accounting  firms  Corporate  Finance  and commercial banks.  Their products and services consist of four major parts they   4 \\x0care  Information  platform  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  Morning  Whistle  projects  platform  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  ChinaMerger Research Reports market activities and Morning Whistle think tank (ibid.).  Differ  from  Morning  Whistle  Group  DealGlobe  are  more  focus  on  consulting services  and  matching  technologies  in  other  words  they  give  more  weight  to premium  private  services  rather  than  information  &  knowledge  spreading.  DG services consist of two layers DealGlobe and DG Capital. DealGlobe is classfield in two platforms. One is DCS (Deal Connect System) giving the online tools and information services the system provides a secure concise and globally way to interact with Chinese buyers for sellside advisors and asset owners. The service is  free  to  use  for  sellside  members  meeting  the  qualificated  requirements. Another is DG Marketplace offers free services for third parties to connect from buyside & sellside but doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t provide access to the DCS and Chinese buyers. DG  Capital  services  are  separated  into  three  parts  as  a  tranditional  Corporate Finance  they  are  buyside  advisory  in  representing  Chinese  clients  M&A financing  solution  for  Chinese  investors  and  sellside  advisor  for  oveaseas  PE investment banks and asset owners (DealGlobe Company Website).  From  the  perspective  of  business  model  with  aggregating  Chinese  enterprises resources  as  more  as  possible  MWG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  business  activities  are  rooted  in  China  and  pay  more  attention  to  information  &  knowledge  services  and  preliminary investment banking services. DG looked more like a traditional corporate finance with  the  help  of  maximizing  network  utility  in  using  online  deal  platform meanwhile its team building is more international. The different strategy between these two firms result in different profit model DG generates revenues mainly through online commission fees and offline consulting fees (Mr. Feng L. 2017 pers.comm. 7 January). But MWG place emphasis on charging  fees  of  subscription  advertising  knowledge  spreading  and  resource accessing. The both had one common their utimate aim is to charge membership fees (Mr. Wang Y. 2017 pers.comm. 10 January). The  both  firms  also  received  financial  supports  from  some  large  enterprises associations.  In  addition  to  this  the  Chinese  Ministry  of  Commerce  China Ministry  of  Industry  and  other  departments  have  offered  varying  degrees  of support.    5 \\x0c2.4 Key Performance Indicators of two startups DealGlobe Until to the beginning of 2017 DG owned over than 3500 members globally and more than 1500 members in Europe. More than 500 Chinese buyers have  subscribed  DG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  customized  services.  And  their  projects  reserves  covered over than 50 countries.  From 3 people in September 2014 the DealGlobe team today  numbers  over  40  people.  Except  for  charging  these  subscription  fees  and offline  consulting  fees  it  has  also  received  financial  support  from  the  UK Department of Trade and Investment and the British Trade Association (Mr. Feng L. 2017 pers.comm. 7 January). Morning  Whistle  Group  Until  to  the  beginning  of  2017  MWG  owned  5621 subscribed  Chinese  buyers  4648  overseas  sellers  and  11320  overseas  projects reserves are coverd in 93 countries. From 3 cofounders in September 2013 the overall team members are 89 people now. Except for the general subscription fees and advertising fees MWG has successfully charged annual member fees from 55 Chinese buyer with 0.2 million RMB which count ca. 1% of overall subscribed Chinese buyers. Furthermore it has also reveived varying degrees of support from some  wellknown  Chinese  financial  institutions  consulting  firms  big  four accounting firms and some other M&A houses (Mr. Wang Y. 2017 pers.comm. 10 January).  3  Blue Ocean Strategy 3.1 Definition of Blue Ocean Strategy This  paper  will  use  Blue  Ocean  Strategy  as  the  theoretical  background  and introduce its analytical tools and six key principles.  BOS  is  a  strategic  approach  of  distruptive  innovation.  The  goal  of  BOS  is  to create a new market space (blue ocean) yet keep costs low but not to outperform the competition in the existing industry (red ocean). The main ideas of BOS are all about value innovation promoting value for buyers while driving down costs for companies. Dialing up value for buyer means raising and creating elements the industry has never offered. Reducing costs stands for elimating and reducing the factors of current industry competition and achieving scale ecomomies via higher   6 \\x0csale volume. It tells firms that the best way to beat competition is to capture new demand make the competition irrelevant break the valuecost tradeoff and align the whole system of a firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s activities in pursuit of differentiation and low cost. (Kim et al. 2005 Page 13) BOS gives a key question to entrepreneurs Why do some companies succeed in creating new market space while others fail? The book found first the great firms fail because they are shortsighted on existing market and relustance of change. Second  the  profit  and  growth  consequences  of  creating  new  market  spaces  are significantly  higher.  And  third  market  spaces  can  be  created  by  all  types  of companies in all types of industries (ibid.).  3.2 Blue Ocean Analytical tools Strategic canvas is a diagnostic tool of building up a BOS. Drawing a productive strategic canva need to get three things done. Firstly it should show the strategic profile of an industry by listing the factors very clearly (including possible future factors) that affect competition among industry players. Secondly based on listed factors and strategic profile of current and potential competitors manager should identify which factors they invest in strategically. Finally drawing the value curve to show details of how strategy canvas invest in factors in the current competition even in the future (Kim et al. 2005 Page 2345)  Four actions framework To craft a new value curve managers usually have to anwser four questions so called here the four actions framework l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Eliminate which of the factors that the industry takes for granted should be eliminated?  l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Reduce  which  factors  should  be  reduced  well  below  the  industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standard?  l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Raise which factors should be raised well above the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s standard?   l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Create which factors should be created that the industry has never offered?  The Four actions framewok is a key tool to identify the actions towards creating a new value curve. Eliminate and Reduce represent the factors that manager should reduce  and  eliminate  strategically  thus  reducing  costs  Create  and  Raise  are  the factors that manager should invest in (ibid.).   7 \\x0cThree characteristics Finally a good BOS should consist of three characteristics they  are  focus  divergence  and  a  compelling  tagline.  Specifically  company should  not  diffuse  its  efforts  across  all  key  factors  of  competitions  but  instead shaping  of  its  value  curve  diverges  from  other  players  based  on  looking  across alternatives until the compelling tagline is clear and relevant (ibid.).  3.3 Six Principles to create a BOS There are six principles of formulating and executing BOS that allow companies to break from the competition and unlock uncontested market (Blue Ocean). The six paths are attempt to redress six assuptions that keep companies competing in red  oceans  (Kim  et  al.  2005  Page  4547).  Specifically  six  assumptions  are showed as following l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Define their industry similarly and focus on being the best within it   l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Look  at  their  industries  through  the  lens  of  generally  accepted  strategic groups and strive to stand out in the strategic group they play in   l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Focus  on  the  same  buyer  group  be  it  the  purchaser  (as  in  the  office equipment industry) the user (as in the clothing industry) or the influencer (as in the pharmaceutical industry)   l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Define  the  scope  of  the  products  and  services  offered  by  their  industry similarly   l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Accept their industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s functional or emotional orientation   l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Focus on the same point in time\\xe2\\x80\\x94and often on current competitive threats\\xe2\\x80\\x94in formulating strategy The  six  principles  will  be  introduced  separately  in  details  to  correct  above assumptions (ibid.).  1.  Principle  the  SIX  PATHS  to  reconstruct  market  boundaries  The  first principle of BOS is to reconstruct market boundaries which is try to solve search risk  many  firms  struggle  with.  Based  on  this  issue  the  book  found  six  paths framework  to  remarking  market  boundaries  instead  of  looking  within  these boundaries. Specifically to break out of the accepted boundaries top management should  look  across  alternative  industries  across  strategic  groups  across  buyer the groups  across  complementary  product  and  service  offerings  across   8 \\x0cfunctionalemotional orientation of an industry and even across time (Kim et al. 2005 Page 4780). PATH 1 Look across alternative industries means that the company dosen\\xe2\\x80\\x99t only competes  with  other  companies  in  same  industry  but  also  with  those  other companies in various industries that produce alternative products or services. But what  do  alternatives  mean?  In  the  one  hand  products  or  services  have  various forms but provide the same function which means these products or services are largely substites for each other. In the other hand alternatives also mean products or services that own different functions and forms but the same purpose.  PATH 2 Look across strategic groups within industry just as BOS can often be used  by  looking  across  alternative  industries  they  can  be  unlocked  by  looking across strategic groups. Strategic group stands for a group of companies within an industry that persue a similar strategy. The determination of same strategy group are mostly based on 2 dimensions price and performance. In this respect the key to look across existing strategic groups is to break out of narrow field of vision by understanding which factors determine customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decisions to trade up or down from one group to another. PATH 3 Redefines the industry buyer group In reality for most industries it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard  to  find  a  definition  of  who  the  target  buyer  is  though  there  are  chain  of buyers who directly or indirectly involved in the actual perchase decision. These chain  of  buyers  are  involved  in  purchasers  users  and  important  influencers. Somehow these three groups may overlapp but they often differ. Thus managers should redefine the industry buyer group but not only focus on buyers. PATH  4  Look  across  to  complementary  product  and  service  offering  In  most cases some other products or services for a company which not belong to their core  products  or  servicies  affect  their  customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  purchasing  behaviors.  So finding untapped value in complementary products and services is a key to define total solutions. That is manager should think about what happens before during after the products or services are used and offered. Most importantly they have to find  what  are  the  pain  points  and  how  can  they  eliminate  them  through  a complementary offering.   9 \\x0cPATH 5 Rethink the functionalemotional orientation of the industry Except for products or services companies in an industry also compete on appeal. The appeal is  usually  divided  in  rational  appeal  and  emotional  appeal  specifically  some industries  compete  strongly  on  price  and  function  other  industries  compete pricipally on feelings. In order to create a blue ocean manager should redefine or challenge functionalemotional orientation of their industry which means if their companies compete on emotions in an industry  the managers have to find the elements that perhaps can stripe out to become more functional and vice versa.  PATH  6  Participates  in  shaping  external  trends  over  time  Most  industries  or companies  are  subject  to  external  trends  or  einrivoments.  Based  on  observable current insights proactively identifies how trends will change value to customers over  time  is  a  key  question  can  show  manager  how  to  create  a  blue  ocean opportunities.  Decisive  to  business  irrevesible  and  clear  direction  are  three principles which are critical for company to assess  trends over time.  Managers should know how will these external factors impact the industry and how can they leverage them? 2. Principal focus on big picture beyond numbers. This principle is trying to mitigating  the  planning  risk  of  investing  a  lot  of  efforts  time  capital  and resources but achieving only tactical red ocean moves. It tends to reach a common understanding  of  current  position  and  where  to  head  to  based  on  drawing  a strategy canvas. This approach will align the creativity of a wide range of people within  an  organization  bring  a  strategy  the  best  practices  communicated  across business units make the strategy easy for execution untill blue ocean be created. In order to unlock people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s creativity the process of creating BOS involves a lot of visual stimulation which has four major steps they are visual awakening (AsIs Analysis) visual exploration (6 paths framework & identify divergent factors) Strategy fair (4 actions framework & ToBe strategic) and visual communication (beforeandafter  comparison  &  focus).  Specific  to  corporate  strategy  manager can use the pioneermigatorsettler map as viualization tool for mapping growth potential of portfolio (Kim et al. 2005 Page 81100).  3. Principal Reach beyond existing demand. In most cases as companies used to  embracing  customer  preferences  through  finer  segmentation  in  a  competitive   10 \\x0cenviroment  they  often  face  the  risk  of  creating  too  small  target  markets.  This principal is trying to minimize the scale risk by maximizing the demand for a new offering. To accomplish this manager should challenge two convetional strategy practices  of  focusing  on  existing  customers  and  finer  segmentation  instead accomodating  buyer  preferences  and  thinking  commonalities  over  differences; noncustomers  before  customers;  and  desegmentation  before  persuing  finer segmentation. Unlocking noncustomers offers big blue ocean opportunities  there are three tiers of noncustomers that can be transformed into customers based on differ  of  their  relative  distance  from  target  market  they  are  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSoon  to  be\\xe2\\x80\\x9d noncustomers  (tier  1)  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRefusing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  noncustomers  (tier  2)  and  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunexplored\\xe2\\x80\\x9d noncustomers (tier 3). All in all manager should not focus on a specific tier but should  look  across  tiers  instead.  The  rules  here  is  to  focus  on  the  tier  that represents the biggest catchment at the time in their industry. But they should also explore  whether  there  are  overlapping  commonalities  across  all  three  tiers  of noncustomers (Kim et al. 2005 Page 101116).  4.  Principal  Get  the  strategic  sequence  right.  This  principal  is  trying  to  put forward the strategic sequence and validate a commercially viable blue ocean idea. Company should build it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s BOS in the sequence of buyer utility price cost and adoption (Kim et al. 2005 Page 117146). 5.  Principal  Overcome  key  organizational  hurdles.  Compared  with  red  ocean strategy BOS represents a big difference from the status quo. So the challenge of execution  exists  which  brings  four  hurdles.  The  first  hurdle  is  from  cognitive waking those employees up whom feel uncomfortable of shifting certain strategy. The  second  hurdle  is  limited  resources.  The  third  is  motivational  hurdle  due  to unmotivated staff. The final hurdle is politics any reform will bring opposition from some powerful vested interests. But tipping point leadership is a productive approach  to  overcome  these  four  hurdles  fast  in  executing  a  break  from  statos (Kim et al. 2005 Page 147171). 6. Principal Build Execution into Strategy. A successed execution of BOS is not only up to top management but to everyone from the top to the front lines. The more removed people are from the top and the less they have been involved in the execution  of  the  strategy.  This  principal  can  help  managers  to  minimize  the   11 \\x0cmanagement risk of distrust noncooperation and even sabotage so introduction of a fair process is a key part in executing of strategy. There are three core elements that  define  E  principles  of  fair  process  engagement  (involving  individuals  into strategy) explanation (everyone should be explained) and clarity of expectation (state clearly the new rules of the game) (Kim et al. 2005 Page 171185).  4  BOS and Chinese Online M&A Platforms To link the Chinese online M&A platforms and the BOS we will focus on big picture in Three steps (Principle 2) /Kim et al. 2005 Page 81100)  I. II. III. Define Phase Define competitive factors key players and their strategic profiles in the Chinese M&A service sector Identify Phase Use Six Paths Framework to redefine market boundaries and identify divergent factors (Principle 1 and Principle 3) Establishment Phase Use Four Actions Framework to construct the new value curve  I. Define Phase In the case of the Chinese M&A services industry there are 9 principal factors (Factors of Competition) l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Geographies Global reach and local on the ground l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Sectors Complete coverage l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Relationships SMEs and large Corporates l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Transaction strategy and Execution services Buy/Sellside M&A Execution Coporate  strategy  advisory  Due  Diligence  Independent  capital  advisory legal advise l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Online services Information & Knowledge spreading Online Deal sourcing and matching l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Technology cloudbased live deal marketplace l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Price  commision  fees  consulting  fees  subscribtion  fees  and  membership fees l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Researches research reports on countries sectors and single company l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Market activities M&A Salon and customized market activities.   12 \\x0cThese factors are viewed as key to the promotion of their M&A services as more exclusive advisory services for the customers. Those clients in this case represent large Corporates (stateowned  listed and multinational companies) and SMEs (mostly  private  companies)  in  China.  That  is  the  underlying  structure  of  the Chinese M&A consulting service industry from the market perspective. Vertical axis of the strategy canvas captures the offering level that customer receive across all  these  key  competing  factors.  A  high  score  means  that  a  company  offers customers more and hence invests more in that factor.  II.  Identify  Phase  There  were  more  than  three  hundred  M&A  advisories participate in the Chinese M&A service industry but we can simply classify them as big four accounting firms Boutique M&A Advisors Bulge Bracket Banks and large Chinese securities firms according to their scale and scope of services (imaa 2016). Big four are the four largest accounting firms in the world they offering audit consulting advisory assurance tax actualrial corporate finance and legal services  (Christodoulou  2011  Page  57).  A  boutique  M&A  Advosors  are  the nonfull  service  investment  bank  that  specializes  only  in  M&A  services (Hutchinson  2009).  Bulge  Bracket    Banks  include  world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  largest  and  most profitable multinational investment banks whose investment banking clients are mostly  large  corporations  institutions  and  governments  (Wall  Street  Journal 2009). Chinese secrurities firms include firms whose principal lines of business are in securities brokerage financial advisory services investment banking and/or securities trading (Gao 2011 Page 1115). To fundamentally shift the strategy canvas of Chinese M&A service and persue both value and cost DG and MWG resist the old logic of competiting with local and  gobal  M&A  houses  and  choosing  between  highquality  service  and  low charged  fees.  By  contrast  DG  and  MWG  reoriented  their  strategic  focus  from looking competitors in M&A service industry to information sector (look across alternative  industries)  from  serving  Large  Corporates  to  SMEs  (look  across strategic  groups  within  industry)  from  helping  nonfinancial  enterprises  to  all involved parties including their main competitors such as financial institutions and M&A  houses  (redefine  industry  buyer  group)  from  conventional  corporate finance  services  to  Information  &  Knowledge  spreading  and  online  deal matching  services  (look  across  to  complementary  service  offering)  and  from   13 \\x0cfunctional orientation to emotional orientation furthermore they are participating in shaping external trends over time. Thus they gain insight into how to redefine the problem the industry focuses on and thereby reconstruct client value elements that reside across industry boundaries.  III.  Establishment  Phase  By  driving  DG  and  MWG  to  fill  in  Four  Actions Framework with actions of eliminating reducing raising and creating which are displicted as follows   l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Eliminate\\xef\\xbc\\x9aRelationships  with  Large  Corporates  Due  Diligence  Legal Advice l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Reduce M&A execution Corporte Strategy Advisory Independent Capital Advisory Price l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Raise  Global reach  Sectors  coverage  Relationships  with  SMEs Information & Knowledge Spreading Technology of cloudbased live deal l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Create Online Deal Sourcing and Matching  Figure  1  shows  the  extent  to  which  the  application  of  these  four  actions  led  to break from the competition in the Chinese M&A service industry. Here we can graphically compare DG and MWG\\xe2\\x80\\x99s BOS with the more than three hundred key players competiting in the industry (imaa 2016).   By looking across to complementary service offering and looking to alternative industries  DG  and  MWG  created  a  new  factor  in  the  sector  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  Online  Deal Sourcing  and  Matching  based  on  the  technology  of  cloudbased  live  deal marketplace  which  offers  the  Chinese  enterprises  the  easy  access  to  the  highquality overseas assets and projects by charging low subscribtion fees and raised the  services  of  Information  &  Knowledge  spreading  through  this  services Chinese  enterprises  got  more  redhot  news  and  professional  insights  regarding overseas  investments  projects  from  all  over  the  world  and  all  sectors  which shaped the great global reach and the extensive sectors coverage. Therefore they eliminated  and  reduced  the  specific  services  related  to  Transaction  strategy  and M&A Execuion which leads to low charged fees and less competition.     14 \\x0cBy looking across strategic groups within industry and redefining industry buyer DG and MWG established and maintained friendly and productive relationships with SMEs since other M&A advisors usually charge extreme high commision fees  to  their  customer  (generally  from  2%  until  to  7%  based  on  overall  deal volume) which caused a significant burdle to SMEs. In addition the both Chinese emerge online M&A platforms reached beyond existing demand by redefining the stratgic  buyer  goups.  As  MWG  only  offers  preliminary  investment  banking services  which  leave  a  big  room  for  other  M&A  advisors  of  providing  more specific  and  professional  services  to  enterprises  this  allows  MWG  transformed other competitors in the market into the customers.  Figure 1  The Strategy Canvas of DG and MWG (Own representation based on W. Chan Kim and Ren\\xc3\\xa9e Mauborgne 2005)  5  Blue  Ocean  Strategy  and  Deutsche  Bank  FinTech Development  5.1 Background  Information  of  Deutsche  Band  FinTech  Strategy  and its Innovation Pipeline Management Financial  Technology  nowadays  so  called    \\xe2\\x80\\x9cintech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  describes  a  business  that aims  at  providing  financial  services  by  making  use  of  software  and  modern technology.   15 \\x0cToday  fintech  companies  directly  compete  with  banks  in  most  areas  of  the financial sector to sell financial services and solutionns to customers. Mostly due to regulatory reasons and their internal structures banks still struggle to keep up with  fintech  startups  in  terms  of  innovation  speed.  Fintechs  have  realized  early that  financial  services  of  all  kinds  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  including  money  transferring  lending investing payments and so on \\xe2\\x80\\x93 need to seamlessly integrate in the lives of the techsavvy and sophisitcated customers of today to stay relevant in a world where business  and  private  life  become  increasingly  digitalized  (Aldridge  etl.  2017 Page 13). Especially millenials (people born between approx. the early 80s and late 90s) and the  following  generations  prefer  quick  and  easy  banking  services  rather  than walking  to  a  branch  making  appointments  with  bank  consultants  and  lenghty processes setting up accounts or putting together a portfolio (Dapp 2014 Page 37).  In  this  environment  DB  launched  Deutsche  Bank  Labs  (DBL)  it  is  a  shared platform for innovation and aim to accelerate the quick adoption of various new innovation  technologies  in  the  digital  age.  The  labs  form  part  of  the  digital element  of  Strategy  2020  under  which  the  Bank  plans  to  spend  up  to  EUR  1 billion  on  digital  initiatives  over  the  next  five  years.  Through  broadening relationships with external technology startups deepening partnerships within the innovation ecosystems and providing the ability to conduct rapid experimentation DBL could enhance DB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internal innovation capacities. DB has chosen to build labs both in the leading centers of entrepreneurships Silicon Valley London and Berlin and in their hub location Frankfurt New York and Bangalore. (Praetzas 2016 Page 115)  In  the  following  parts  I  will  try  to  use  BOS  to  analyse  and  examine  its development and enhance its execution. 5.2 Three principles of BOS of assessing external trends There is a saying being popular in SIX PATHS of BOS Participates in shaping external trends over time. Two types of firms exist in this changing world. One is affected by external trend. Another could proactively identify the external trends according  to  their  observable  current  insights  thus  they  have  enabled  them  to   16 \\x0cstay well ahead of competitors. DB is such a proactive company in case of Fintech Innovation Pipeline Management. In this case we will use three principles in BOS for assessing external trends over time they are Decisive to business irrevesible and  clear  direction  (Kim  etal.  2005  Page  4045).  Managers  should  know  how will these external factors impact the industry and how can they leverage them? Decisive  to  business  DB  identified  the  external  megatrends  with  a  deep understanding  for  younger  millennials  whom  are  more  likely  to  use  mobile devicies  when  interacting  with  their  banks.  A  survey  conducted  by  Oracle Financial Services showed that more than 68% of all millennials say desktop or mobile is their most frequent channel of interaction with their banks (). The result inspired banks that the developement of technologies both on desktop and mobile are decisive to their business (Praetzas 2016 Page 15).  Irrevesible  With  the  development  of  technology  and  financial  services  there were more than 1 million FinTech startups on the market as of today all over the world  this  sends  a  signal  This  is  a  irrevesive  trend  for  banks  to  dealing  with FinTech companies (ibid.). Clear  direction  A  Global  FinTech  Survey  published  by  PWC  answered  a quesition  How  are  you  currently  dealing  with  FinTech  companies?  The  three highest  ranked  solutions  are  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ewe  engage  in  joint  partnerships  with  FinTech companies\\xe2\\x80\\x9c (32%) \\xe2\\x80\\x9ewe do not deal with FinTech\\xe2\\x80\\x9c (25%) and \\xe2\\x80\\x9ewe buy and sell services to FinTech companies\\xe2\\x80\\x9c(22%). Giving the precondition of irrevesive trend with  developing  FinTech  the  solution  of  joint  partnerships  giving  DB  a  clear direction to dealing with FinTech (ibid.).  5.3 Three characteristics of accessing a good strategy In  BOS  a  good  strategy  should  consist  of  three  characteristics  they  are  focus divergence and a compelling tagline. In case that DB finds the suitable solution of  building  relationship  with  FinTech  companies.  DB  didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  diffuse  its  efforts across  all  ways  of  dealing  with  FinTech  such  as  acquiring  FinTech  launching own FinTech subsidiaries setting up venture funds to fund FinTech services and buying and selling services to FinTech companies.   17 \\x0cBased on rethinking functionalemotional orientation of FinTech DB shaped of its value curve diverges from other ways by engaging in joint partnerships with FinTech companies thus gives more flexibility and imaginary space to its joint startups and better adopt to internal Bank business lines (Kim et al. 2005 Page 2345). Finally DB came up with a clearly and relavantive tagline Discover Connect and Executive.  5.4 Get the strategic sequence right. As mentioned in fourth principal of BOS companies need to build their BOS in the sequence of customer utility price cost and adoption (Kim etal. 2005 Page 117146). Customer  utility  The  starting  point  is  customer  utility.  Does  DBL  offerring unlock exceptional customer utility? Is there a compelling reason for the mass of people to use its products and services? The anwser is an unequivocal \\xe2\\x80\\x9eyes\\xe2\\x80\\x9c as mentioned before the millenials are more likely to use desktop or mobile devices for  getting  quick  and  easy  banking  services  over  walking  to  a  branch appointments  with  bank  consultants.  DBLs  are  currently  focused  on  several emerging technology themes which are highly relevant to financial services such as  digital  retail  banking  Machine  learning  cloud  technology  and  services  API economy  Cyber  security  and  distributed  ledger.  These  new  technologies  will definitely  embrace  DB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  internal  technology  innovation  as  a  source  of  future differentiated value to their clients (ibid.). Price The key question here is this Is DB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innovative financial services with technologies offering priced to attract the mass of target customers so that they can pay less money for DB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s services? By eliminating or reducing intermediary agents and physicaldistributions with using various modern technologies related to financial services and trading FinTech charge the lower fees than convertinal banks which let the millennials have a compelling ability to pay for DB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s offering (Dapp 2015 713). Cost  Can  DB  produce  their  offering  at  the  target  cost  and  still  earn  a  healthy profit margin? The 2016 edition of McKinsey's annual report on Capital Markets   18 \\x0cand  Investment  Banking  found  that  extensive job  cuts  have  not  resulted  in decreases  in  operational  costs  in  the  industry  This  is  because  when  banks  cut jobs  there  are  some  costs  related  to  those  roles  that  remain.  In  addition  these banks are removing people that generate revenue and that leaves a smaller base from  which  to  cover  fixed  costs.  McKinsey  suggests  that  banks  should  look  to increase digitization to  achieve  savings.  The  economic  advantages  of  digital distribution  over physical  distribution  are  one  of  the  primary  advantages  for fintech  firms.  According  to  McKinsey  many  fintech  lenders  have  up  to  a  400basispoint cost advantage over banks because they have no physicaldistribution costs. This cost advantage enables fintech firms to pass savings to customers with regard to cost and time to process loan applications (McKinsey 2016 Page 1421). Adoption  The  last  step  is  to  address  adoption  hurdles.  What  are  the  adoption hurdles  in  rolling  out  FinTech?  Can  DB  address  these  up  front?  There  are  four approaches or options for banks to the FinTech challenges they are Buy Build Compete and Partnership and DB adopted partnership (Skan et al. 2015 Page 46) l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Buy Many banks have been actively investing in or absorbing startups. But it is difficult to success since slow decisionmaking in banks and a clash of cultures (European Commission 2015 Page 713). l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Build  A  number  of  banks  are  examining  the  methods  employed  by  tech leaders like Amazon Spotify Google and Zappos to imitate their prowess at innovation  flexibility  and  speed  to  market.  However  changing  employee behaviors is a major challenge (Accenture 2015 Page 611). l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Compete Advocated by Harvard professor Clayton Christensen in his book The  Innovator\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Dilemma  this  stance  suggests  that  the  banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99  digital channels  can  compete  directly  with  branches  and  independent  financial advisors.  While  many  banks  chosen  this  route  while  also  investing  in FinTechs they may struggle to overcome conservative behavior patterns. But intense competition locks those banks in the red ocean which costs money resources and energy (ibid.). l\\xef\\x81\\xac  Partnership DB highlights that one way banks can achieve digitization is by  partnering  with  fintechs.  On  the  one  hand  such  a  relationship  would   19 \\x0crelationships In  acceleratortype ensure full support from the bank partner and access to their clientbase. Yet exclusivity can limit the potential for growth in other markets and of course with  other  banks. for  example the  tradeoff  for  receiving  investment  may  be  a  bank  equity  stake  in  the fintech company \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a decision that can have longterm implications. Ideally a fintech  would  partner  with  an  institution  that  is  fully  engaged  but  open  to further collaboration where it is necessary to support the growth of both the fintech and partnership solution. For example the fintechbank might engage new players to roll out an offering in a region where the bank lacks a local footprint. Regardless these decisions need to be made and agreed upon by all stakeholders  early  on  in  the  partnership  process  and  must  remain  closely aligned to the fintech\\xe2\\x80\\x99s five and 10year plans throughout (Skan et al. 2015 Page 413).  5.5 Build Execution into Strategy. A successed execution of FinTech strategy is not only up to top management in DB like their COO or CGO but to staffs from the top to the front lines. There are three  core  elements  that  DB  should  consider  to  better  exucute  their  FinTech strategy engagement (involving individuals into strategy) explanation (everyone should be explained) and clarity of expectation (state clearly the new rules of the game) (Kim etal. 2005 Page 171184).  Engagement DB set up DBLs for indentiying the suitable FinTech startups staff from  the  DB  will  engage  with  startups  and  academic  institutions  to  evaluate potential technology solutions for the Bank and its clients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 business needs. They will then trial and develop this technology further in the labs collaborating with clients  where  appropriate.  Such  a  process  encourage  everyone\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  thinking  and builds  better  colletive  wisdom  and  results  in  better  strategic  decision  by management and greater commitment from all involved to execute those decisions (Dapp 2015 Page 623). Explanation  DB  should  present  everyone  the  meaning  and  important  of  thier FinTech strategy whom involved and affected in the project for example hold the roundtable  discussions internal  presentations.  The  deep seminars  or   20 \\x0cunderstanding  of  FinTech  allows  employees  to  trust  manager\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  intentions  and make them more confident that managers have considered thier opionions. Clarity  of  expectation  DB  managers  should  state  clearly  the  details  of  their FinTech  strategy  and  innovation  pipeline  management.  First  of  all  the  clearly goal  and  mission  are  required  The  accelerating  pace  of  technology  innovation combined with massive investment is causing disruption across most industries. New market participants are in many cases challenging established incumbents. Deutsche  Bank  is  embracing  technology  innovation  as  a  source  of  future differentiated value to our clients. Secondly setting up the DBLs and nominating top  management  let  the  people  know  who  is  responsible  for  it  is  also  extremly important. Putting  the  above  three  collectively  lead  to  judgments  of  fair  process  This inspires  them  to  cooperate  voluntarily  in  executing  the  resulting  strategic decisions.  6  Summary of results and outlook 3  years  ago  Yunfan  Wang  found  the  painpoints  that  Chinese  enterprises  are hardly to find the investment channels towards overseas market. 2 years ago as Lin Feng worked at sourcing deal online he started to think about building up an online deal sourcing plarform for helping Chinese buyers reach suitable oversea markets and overseas projects find the serious Chinese acquirers. Through using six paths to reconstruct market boundaries MWG and DG created new factor in the Chinese M&A service sector (online deal sourcing and matching based on cloudbased technology) raised existed competitive factors (Information & Knowledge Spreading DG highly global reach complete sectors coverage and good relationships with SMEs) and eliminated or reduced transaction execution services and price. All in all MWG and DG did not diffuse their services across all key factors of competition  but  mainly  focus  on  information  and  knowledge  spreading  and online  deal  matching  which  caused  their  value  curves  diverge  from  that  of  the other  players  in  M&A  service  industry  by  reconstructing  market  boundaries.   21 \\x0cFinally  they  conduct  a  clear  and  relevant  tagline  that  let  them  only  focus  on building  an  online  deal  sourcing  and  matching  platform  instead  offering conventional corporate finace services they all dedicated to charge membership fees as their core source of income rather than commission fees and subscription fees  just  as  they  both  aim  to  be  Alibaba  for  M&A  it  can  be  thought  of  as \\xe2\\x80\\x98Match.com for companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 helping users quickly find suitable investment targets and  partners  to  effectively  facilitate  crossborder  mergers  and  acquisitions  (Mr. Feng L. 2017 pers.comm. 7 January). The fast rising of Chinese online M&A platform benefited from huge crossborder M&A  wave  by  booming  Chinese  investors  and  introducing  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOne  Belt  and  One Road\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  policy  by  PRC  government.  But  if  the  tide  is  out  what  should  they  do? There  is  no  doubt  that  steppingout  of  overseas  market  is  a  longterm  trend  for Chinese enterprises both from macro (policy and external eviroment) and micro (enterprises) perspective meanwhile it will definitely be some changes somehow 3 years later information asymmetry will no longer be a problem 5 years later there will be a lot of Chinese startup offering the same services resulting in low profit  margin  in  this  industry.  However  there  were  two  core  competencies  that cannot  be  limited  and  substituted  easily.  One  is  that  these  two  platforms  have aggregated  broad  networks  and  huge  resources.  Another  is  that  both  companies have  established  the  cloudbased  live  deal  marketplaces  and  the  handful  of analytics  tools  offering  comprehensive  business  insights.  As  the  changes  could happen  somehow  due  to  policies  and  external  environments  as  long  as  their services and customers can cover more and more parts of the world they could mitigate the environmental risk significantly (Mr. Wang Y. 2017 pers.comm. 10 January).  In  the  end  people  should  believe  that  a  good  startup  could  awalys envolve and improve themselves in a constantly changing einvironment.        22 \\x0c References Accenture.  (2015).
