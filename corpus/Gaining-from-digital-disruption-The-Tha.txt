here  in file            Gaining from digital disruption     The Thai financial landscape in the digital era1         0     Thammarak Moenjak     Vorapat Praneeprachachon     Tanatas Bumpenboon     Pornchanok Bumrungruan     Chompoonoot Monchaitrakul     Abstract          This  paper  examines  competitiveness  of  the  Thai  financial  sector  through  the   dimensions of depth  access  efficiency  and stability  as compared to peers.  The paper finds   that while the Thai financial sector compares reasonably well with peers in most dimensions    it does not fare well in term of SME access to bank credit.  Using PanzarRosse HStatistic    the  paper  also  examines  competition  in  the  Thai  banking  sector  and  finds  that  the  level  of   competition in the Thai banking sector is consistently high over the sample period.  The results   raise  the  question   Why  does  SME  access  to  bank  credit  remain  low   despite  high  level  of   competition in the banking sector?  This puzzle is important since SMEs are a key driver of the   Thai economy.  Reviewing results from various studies and interviews with SMEs and bank   credit officers  the paper identifies several bottlenecks in the SME lending process that may   lead to market failures. Using data from 1.29 million individual SME loan contracts obtained   from 15 Thai commercial banks  and six Specialized Financial Institutions (SFIs)  the paper   finds that only a few banks attempt to penetrate SMEs at the lower tiers of loan size and income.    Although SME lending by SFIs are found to be a good complement to SME lending by banks    the  fact  remains  that  fewer  than  half  of  SMEs  in  Thailand  have  loans  from  these  financial   institutions.  The paper then discusses how several initiatives have been attempted to harness   the  power  of  technology  and  data  to  help  improve  SME  access  to  finance   whether  from   traditional banks or other types of players.  Lessons from the case of SME financing and from   other segments of financial sectors in selected countries are then drawn into common themes   that might help guide the design of financial landscape in the digital era.                                                                    1 The authors are grateful to Dr. Piti Disyatat  Dr. Krislert Samphantharak  Atchana Lamsam and all of the Puey Ungphakorn   Institute for Economic Research (PIER) staff for helpful comments and discussions.

The ability of the financial sector to perform its functions well has important policy     implications.  An economy  with a financial sector that can cheaply  and quickly  turn savings     into consumption and investment is often found to attain higher longterm growth2.  The level     of financial development is also found by many researchers to also influence income inequality      whether directly or indirectly3.      This  paper  first  presents  stylized  facts  of  the  Thai  financial  sector   before  assessing     competitiveness of the Thai financial sector in terms of depth  access  efficiency  and stability      using the framework proposed by Cihak et al. (2012).  Focusing on financial institutions  the     paper finds the Thai financial sector’s competitiveness to be in line with ASEAN5 on most     measures  except SME access to bank credit.     The paper also assesses degree of competition among Thai banks  dominant players in     the Thai financial sector.  Using PanzaRosse HStatistic framework together with consolidated     balance sheets of 15 Thai commercial banks and their subsidiaries  the paper finds the degree     of competition among the 15 Thai commercial banks to be quite high.  Thai banks and their     subsidiaries  do  not  seem  to  possess  much  market  power   and  have  been  competing  rather     intensely.     A puzzle thus emerges  if the 15 Thai banks are already competing intensely  why does     Thai  SME  access  to  credit  remain  low?    There  seems  to  be  market  failures   since  in  a     competitive market  theory dictates that SMEs’ demands for credit should be reasonably well     met.  Delving into the roots of these market failures is important because SMEs are a key driver                                                                  2 See for example  Knoops (2008)  Cihak et al. (2012)  Wongswan  Luengnaruemitchai  and Boonthaveepat (2013).   3 Cihak et al. (2012)  Belly & Lochner (2007)  Kerr & Nanda (2009)  Beck et al. (2007)  DemirgucKunt & Levine (2009).          of the Thai economy  accounting for around 80 percent of employment  and 40 percent of value     added in the GDP.  The paper thus investigates and analyzes what might be the causes of such     market failures in SME access to credit.     4     Reviewing  results  from  various  studies  and  interviews  with  SMEs  and  bank  credit     officers  the paper identifies several bottlenecks and market failures that are hampering SME     access to finance.  These includes burdensome manual processes  heavy paper documentation      and lack of data.  In particular  the latter is also a key bottleneck in term of credit decision  as     credit risk models rely heavily upon availability of reliable data.  In other words  information     asymmetry   frictions  in  processes   and  unintended  consequences  of  regulations  have  all     contributed to market failures in SME access to credit.  Our conjecture is that the presence of     these bottlenecks make SME lending costly  time consuming  and perhaps too risky for banks.       Using  data  from  1.29  million  individual  SME  loan  contracts  from  the  Bank  of     Thailand’s (BOT) SME Database (SMD) and Loan Arrangement Database (LAR) to check the     profile of these loans  the paper finds that only a few banks have attempted to penetrate SME     market at the lower tiers of loan size and income.  The paper observes that smaller SME loans     also incur more NPLs.  SFIs are observed to have stepped in and complement banks in their     lending to SMEs at the lower tiers.  Despite the presence of SFIs  fewer than half of the SMEs     use credit from banks or SFIs.        In the digital era  however  rapid development of digitization and process automation     offer promising potential to unlock those bottlenecks.  The paper thus reviews the efforts by a     number of Thai players including FinTech  banks  SMEs themselves  and regulators to harness     the power of technology and data to solve these bottlenecks  and help improve SME access to     finance.            By  reviewing  the  initiatives  being  implemented  in  Thailand   along  with  those  being     implemented  or  proposed  in  other  countries   the  paper  finds  that  digitalization  and  data  are     being leveraged to help alleviate market failures presented in the financial sector  not only SME     5     access to credit.       Ultimately   the  paper  identifies  three  common  themes  that  might  help  the  financial     sector harness the power of technology and data to improve competitiveness in the digital era.      These themes include  (1) interoperability  to reduce switching costs  encourage competition      and allow for better collection  flows  and usage of data; (2) a robust ecosystem with various     types of players collaborating  competing  and innovating to meet customers’ needs; and (3) a     more flexible and forward looking regulatory  framework to reduce unintended consequences     of regulations  while ensuring that stability and consumer protection are not compromised.                                            PART II – THE THAI FINANCIAL SECTOR  STYLIZED FACTS      6     Part  II  highlights  stylized  facts  regarding  the  Thai  financial  sector  which  reflect  the     underlying trend of competition within the Thai financial sector.  The stylized facts are shown     from both the macro view  reflecting the evolution of the Thai financial sector in terms of key     services providers  and micro view  reflecting the evolution of usage of financial services by     households and firms4.       1.  Macro view  Evolution of the Thai financial sector     The landscape of the Thai financial sector has undergone a number of transitions over     the  past  20  years  –  from  post1997  Asian  Financial  Crisis  reforms  that  strengthened  core     financial system and established important infrastructures to a number of initiatives that helped     improve  access   efficiency  and  resilience  of  the  financial  system.    Over  the  years   the  Thai     financial  sector   particularly  the  banking  sector   has  adopted  a  number  of  important     international standards and practices to comply with the Basel Core Principles.  Thailand has     also setup important infrastructures such as the Deposit Protection Agency to protect depositors     against failing of financial institutions  thus creating a resilient financial system in supporting     growth of the Thai economy.       Scanning the current landscape  the Thai financial sector consists of six main groups of     players  namely       1) Commercial banks (banks)       2) Specialized Financial Institutions (SFIs)       3) Other deposittaking institutions including saving cooperatives and credit unions                                                                    4 The macro view represents those regarding financial institutions and markets while the micro view represents those   associated with individuals.          4) Mutual funds       5) Insurance  and      7     6) Other nonbank financial institutions.       From regulatory perspective  formal financial institutions include banks  SFIs  mutual     funds  insurance  other depositing taking institutions and nonbank financial institutions under     the  regulatory  purview  of  financial  regulators.    Semiformal  financial  institutions  refer  to     financial institutions whose legal status are granted by specific laws and are supervised by other     government agencies  such as cooperatives  village funds  and leasing companies.   A break    down of the financial sector players and their asset sizes is displayed in Figure 1.       Banks and SFIs account for the majority of total financial sector assets  making up over     60 percent. At the end of 2018 total financial sector assets reached 270 percent of GDP. It is     worth noting that while banks continue to account for a sizable share of the financial sector  its     share of total asset has declined over the past decade.  This may reflect an important transition     in  the  Thai  financial  sector   that  banks’  competitiveness  is  being  challenged  by  greater     competition  from  other  players.    It  also  begs  the  question  whether  banks  can  remain     competitive going forward.      Figure 1 Asset shares of the Thai financial Sector 2010 and 2018      8          Review of financial system assets (Figure 1) shows that since 2010  banks’ share of     financial sector assets has declined by around 6 percentage points  from around 52 percent to     46 percent in 2018.  Instead  asset shares of mutual funds  SFIs  saving cooperatives and credit     unions have seen notable increase  likely diverting the funds that would have gone into bank     deposits and lending activities. Meanwhile  asset share of insurance companies has increased     markedly.       Figure 2 Compound annual growth rate of important financial sector participants          Figure 2 shows that while banks’ assets continue to grow  their growth rate is slower     than those of other players. Banks’ assets exhibit compound annual growth rate of 6.5 percent     since  2011   compared  with  the  average  growth  of  the  financial  sector  of  8  percent.  These     indicators suggest growing roles of nonbank players in the Thai financial system.      2.  Micro view  Thai financial services from the users’ perspectives     Analysis of the demand for financial services provides better clarity on the changing     financial  landscape.    For  households   the  Financial  Access  Survey  of  Thai  Households5     assesses households’ demand for financial services and access channel. The survey measures                                                                  5 Conducted by the Bank of Thailand and the National Statistical Office of Thailand           levels of households’ financial access6 to eleven key financial services 7 commonly provided     9     by financial institutions.      According  to  the  latest  survey  conducted  in  2018   banks  remain  the  overall  primary     provider of financial services for households (Table 1 and Table 2).  In fact  more households     are  using  banks  compared  with  the  2016  survey  result   while  access  through  other  players     remains largely unchanged. The most used financial services are deposits  payments  money     transfers  and loans  with reported usage of 80 percent  68 percent  45 percent  and 36 percent      respectively.            Banks   SFIs   Village Funds   Cooperatives          Deposits/ Saving   2018   2016   60%   64%   30%   29%   2%   1%   3%   4%             SFIs     Banks     Village Funds     Leasing companies   Table 1 Primary providers of financial services           Loans     2018   33%   19%   19%   11%     2016   38%   18%   19%   10%           Banks   SFIs   Epayment providers   Individual providers     Transfers     2018   79%   15%   2%   0%     2016   82%   15%   1%   0%                   Banks     SFIs     Epayment providers     Village Funds     Payment     2018   26%   15%   13%   7%     2016   25%   19%   10%   8%     Table 2 Primary providers of financial services (cont.)     Among these users  banks remain the primary service providers for deposits  transfers      and payment services.  For deposits  64 percent of household reported banks as the primary     service provider  a notable increase from 2016.  For payments and transfers services  banks are     also  the  primary  service  providers   with  reported  usage  of  26  percent  and  79  percent      respectively.  Banks’ dominance in these services is likely augmented by the introduction of                                                                  6 Defined as households who have used at least one financial service and those who have access to a financial service but   choose not to use any financial service.   7 The eleven financial services include (1) deposits/ savings  (2) loans (excluding credit cards)  (3) money transfers  (4)   payments  (5) credit cards  (6) life insurance  (7) nonlife insurance  (8) mutual funds  (9) government and central bank debt   securities  (10) private securities  and (11) rotating savings groups          PromptPay  payment  service  as  well  as  standardized  QR  Code  for  payment   which  allow     convenient and instant payments through banking mobile application at zero fees.       10     Another interesting observation is the increasing usage of payments through epayment     service  providers  including  banking  agents   counter  services  and  convenience  stores.  This     evidence  may  point  to  changing  structure  of  the  financial  landscape.    As  banks  transition     towards  greater  digital  adoption   they  may  outsource  basic  services  to  banking  agents  or     counterservices.   These  service points also  provide easy  access  points and convenience for     consumers to access financial services (Lamsam et al. 2018).       In terms of loan service  the household survey finds that SFIs remain the primary usage     channel for household loans.  Moreover  a large proportion of households reported usage of     semiformal service providers as their main loan providers.  In fact  35 percent of households     use semiformal financial institutions  including saving cooperatives  village funds  and leasing     companies  as the primary lending channel  a proportion far outweighed usage of banks.           While  households’  demand  and  usage  of  financial  services  can  be  analyzed  through     households’  survey   a  similar  analysis  for  corporate  is  made  more  challenging  due  to  data     availability.    Instead   this  paper  used  the  data  on  corporate  financing  activities  to  imply     corporates’  demand  and  usage  of  financial  services.  Figure  3  shows  corporate  financing     activities based on bank loans  corporate bonds  and equities. The figure shows that corporate     financing  through  commercial  banks  remains  the  primary  channel   but  its  proportion  has     declined substantially.       11          Corporates  have  relied  much  more  on  debt  and  equity  financing  compared  to  their     financing activities in the past.  Increased financing activities through the financial market are     likely a result of relatively eased financial market conditions in Thailand and globally while     domestic policy interest rate was kept near historical low – at 1.50 percent – from April 2015     to December 2018.  These have resulted in lower funding costs for corporate than in the past      as indicated by corporate new loan rates8 that continued to decline and remained at low level     during  the  BOT  ratecutting  cycle  (Figure  4).  Furthermore   corporate  credit  spreads  have     remained relatively rangebound since the end of 2009 (Figure 5).       Figure 3 Corporate financing activities          Figure 4 New loan rate and other rates                                                                  8 New loan rate (NLR) is the rate of interest payments on loan contracts excluding loans to households and financial   intermediaries and is weighted by loan size. It is calculated from the median rate of individual loan contract with credit   amount above THB 20 million from database of loan arrangements (LAR) reported to the Bank of Thailand from 14 Thai   commercial banks.                12     Figure 5 Average credit spread on THB Arating bond     From the supply of financial service perspective  the accessibility of financial products      including savings and credits  is supported by continued expansion of physical financial access     points  such as increases in numbers of branches  ATMs  and EDCs relative to the number of     adult population (Lamsam et al. 2018)).       However   there  is  a  large  variation  of  coverage  of  financial  service  infrastructures     across  different  regions  of  Thailand   with  higher  concentration  in  larger  cities.    In  fact   it      is  estimated that 23.2 percent  of villages in  Thailand do not  have access  to financial access     points within five kilometers.9  Nevertheless  twothird of these villages are located in areas     with  good  mobile  broadband  coverage   suggesting  potential  for  increasing  access  through     mobile and internet banking (Chantarat et al. 2018).                                                                    9 Access points include the formal channels such as banks and SFIs  semiformal channels such as cooperatives and village   funds  and potential banking agents such as convenience store  gas stations  postoffices  and shops with EDCs.       050100150200250300200 2010201120122013201 201 201 201 201 201 Average credit spread on THB Arating bond AAAAA+AAAAA+AA13          Moreover  continued increase in mobile and internet broadband usages also provides     support for further financial access through internet and mobile banking channel (Figure 6).      Thus far  increasing digitization of banking services along with establishment of key financial     infrastructures  –  such  as  the  PromptPay  fasterpay  infrastructure  –  have  enabled  greater     electronic payment usage by consumers. The volume of epayment has increased substantially     over the past five years  from around 35 transactions per person per year in 2014 to almost 90     transactions per person per year in 2018.

As  noted  by  YokoiArai  and  Yoshino  (2006)   competitiveness  of  the     financial sector can be an elusive concept  and hence reference to various indices will provide     a starting point for discussion.  This paper follows framework set by Cihak et al. (2012) for the     benchmarking  of  global  financial  systems   a  foundation  for  Global  Financial  Development     Database developed by the World Bank.       According to the framework  competitiveness of the financial sector could be assessed     through four dimensions  (1) depth  (2) access  (3) efficiency  (4) stability10.                                          Figure 7 Competitiveness of financial institutions (in terms of depth)     Figure 7 measures depth of the financial sector through the lens of domestic credit to     private sector by banks to GDP  deposit money banks’ assets to GDP  and liquid liabilities to     GDP.  Such measures reflect how deep the financial sector is embedded in the economy.  Using                                                                  10 Competitiveness of financial markets will need a separate paper on its own. These four characteristics can be measured on   two fronts  financial institutions and financial markets.  This paper will only focus on competitiveness of financial institutions.                 latest data from Global Financial Development Database  it could be seen that from 20132016      Thailand is around the ASEAN5 average for the period in all measures.     15     Figure 8 Competitiveness of financial institutions (in terms of efficiency)     Figure 8 measures efficiency of the financial sector through the lens of bank net interest     margin  bank return on assets  bank overhead costs to total assets  and bank return on equity.      These measures reflect the ability of banks to squeeze down their costs and generate returns.       It should be noted  however  that Indonesia is rather an outlier  whether in terms of bank net     interest  margin  and  bank  return  on  asset   pushing  the  average  of  the  sample  up  above     considerably  in  these  measures.    Among  ASEAN5   Thailand   on  average  over  the  sample     period  ranks third in terms of bank net interest margin  second on bank return on asset  and     fourth on bank return on equity.  It is thus safe to say that Thai banks are somewhat middling     in terms of efficiency.      Figure  9  measures  access  to  the  financial  sector  through  the  lens  of  percentage  of     population aged 15 and above with accounts at financial institutions  percentage of population     aged 15 and above who made or received digital payments in the last year  firms with a bank     loan or line of credit  and small firms with a bank loan or line of credit.  The first two measures          reflect financial access of households  while the last two reflect financial access of firms and     16     SMEs.                                         Figure 9 Competitiveness of financial institutions (in terms of access)     In terms of households  Thailand is above average in terms of both access to accounts     at financial institutions and usage of digital payments.  What should be noted is the significant     increase of percentage of those who made or received digital payments in Thailand from around     30 percent  in  2014 to  almost 60 percent  in  2017  reflecting the fast  rise  of  digital  access  in     Thailand.       However  in terms of firm access to a bank loan or line of credit and small firms with a     bank loan or line of credit  Thailand ranks last in both measures  excluding Singapore whose     numbers are not  available.  This  point will be explored in  depth  later in  the paper  as  small          firms and SMEs are a key driver of the Thai economy  and the inability of Thai firms to access     services from financial institutions warrant an investigation11.     17     Figure 10 Competitiveness of financial institutions (in terms of stability)     Figure  10  depicts  measurement  of  stability  in  terms  of  regulatory  capital  to  risk    weighted assets (CAR)  common equity tier 1 (CET1) ratio  liquidity coverage ratio (LCR)      and percentage of nonperforming loans (NPL) to total loans.  According to Figure 10  using     numbers from EMEAP  the Thai banking sector holds high buffers in terms of CAR  CET1      and LCR against possible shocks  ranking second in the three areas on average over the sample     period.  Thailand  however  ranks last in terms of NPL ratio.  The levels of Thailand’s NPL     ratio  however  is not much higher than the sample average  roughly about 1 percentage point     above.        From the assessment of the four dimensions of Thai financial sector competitiveness      namely  depth   access   efficiency  and stability  it  is  reasonable to  say that the Thai financial                                                                  11 Firms surveyed in World Bank Enterprise Survey include large  medium and small  with the number of small firms   dominating in terms of number.  It should be note large firms can also access financial markets as their external funding   source  while small firms typically cannot easily do so.          sector is performing in line with peers.  However  one notable weakness of the Thai financial     18     sector is its ability to serve SMEs.                           PART IV – COMPETITION IN THE THAI FINANCIAL SECTOR     19     Part IV assesses competition in the Thai financial sector.  Understanding competition     is important  as various studies have shown that competition in financial sector matters in terms     of  allocative   productive   and  dynamic  efficiency   as  well  as  depth.12    Part  IV  starts  by     reviewing several literatures on how competition might affect competitiveness of the financial     sector as reflected by access  efficiency  and stability.  Finally  Part IV measures the degree of     competition among Thai banks  dominant players in the Thai financial sector.      1.  Competition and competitiveness  Depth  access  efficiency  and stability     A  number  of  studies  have  attempted  to  establish  links  between  competition  and     competitiveness  of  the  financial  sector  particularly  in  terms  of  access   efficiency   and     stability13.      A.  Competition and access     Researches on the effects of competition on firms’ access to finance suggest complex     relationship between competition and financial access  with results depending on factors such     as the levels  of competition  development   and financial inclusion of the countries.     Many     findings indicate a positive relationship between competition and firms’ financial access  while     others present evidences otherwise.  Beck et al. (2003) finds for a panel of countries that bank     concentration  raises  firms’  financing  obstacles  and  thus  reduces  the  likelihood  of  firm’s     receiving  bank  finance  with  the  effect  being  exacerbated  by  more  restrictions  on  banks’     activities.    Based  on  data  from  16  countries   Claessens  and  Laeven  (2005)  finds  that  more                                                                  12 See for example  Beck et al. (2008).     13 It should be noted that there is not much literature that aims to capture the relationship between competition and depth of   the financial sector.  Financial depth captures the financial sector relative to the economy. It is the size of banks  other   financial institutions  and financial markets in a country  taken together and compared to a measure of economic output.  As   such  it could be said that competition does not have a direct influence on depth of the financial sector  but possibly works   through access  efficiency  as well as stability  since we would need to take account of both the size of the financial sector   and the size of economic output of the economy.     20          competitive banking systems exert a positive effect on firm access to finance.  Love and Peria     (2012)  using Lerner index for a sample of 53 countries  finds that competition is positively     related to firm’s access to finance.  Using data from a sample of        firms in    developing     countries  to  study  the  effect  of  financial  market  structure  and  financial  inclusion  on  firm     performance  Chauvet and Jacolin (2017) finds that more competitive banking systems favor     firm growth at only high level of financial inclusion  while bank concentration has a positive     impact on firm growth at low levels of financial inclusion.       In contrast   Fungacova et al (2017)  using both structural (e.g. concentration ratios) and     nonstructural (e.g. Lerner index) indicators for a panel of firms from 20 European countries     finds that competition increases the cost of credit and the effect is stronger for smaller firms.       Cetorelli  and  Gambera  (2001)  also  finds  that  more  concentrated  banking  systems  increase     firms’ access to finance.  However  lack of competition that leads to high switching cost may     strictly tie borrowers to an individual institution  making the borrowers less willing to engage     with other institutions (Petersen and Rajan  1994; and Boot and Thakor  2000).       B.  Competition and efficiency     Intuitively   competition  is  expected  to  provide  welfare  gains  by  reducing  monopoly     rents  and  cost  inefficiencies   and  thus  reducing  the  loan  rates  and  encourage  investment.      Despite such intuition  however  theoretical literatures provide arguments for both positive and     negative  relationships  between  banking  competition  and  efficiency.    The  intuitive  Hicks’     (1 3 ) “quietlife” hypothesis suggests that competition has a positive influence on efficiency      as  a  higher  degree  of  banking  competition  should  prevent  monopoly  power  of  banks   and     therefore  a  reduction  in  banking  prices.    An  alternative  “efficientstructure”  hypothesis     proposed by Demsetz (1973) suggests a negative impact of efficiency on competition as the     most  efficient  banks  would  benefit  from  lower  costs  and  therefore  higher  market  shares.           Furthermore  the reduced competition is argued to be an allowance for banks to benefit from     scale economies in monitoring and form a stronger relationship with customers.       21     The  relatively  scarce  empirical  literature  on  the  topic  of  the  relationship  between     competition  and  efficiency  also  suggests  mixed  results   with  both  positive  and  negative     relationships being found.  E.g. Berger (1995)  Goldberg and Rai (1996).  Using the data from     the  European  banking  industry   Punt  and  Van  Rooij  (2003)  finds  that  Xefficiency14  helps     improve both banks’ profitability and market share  as on average Xefficiency and profitability     have  improved  after  bank  consolidation.    However   Punt  and  Van  Rooij  (2003)  finds  no     indications of unfavorable price setting behavior as a result of increased market power.       C.  Competition and stability     Competition also has a complex relationship with stability.  While there is no consensus     on the definition of stability  or definite conclusion on the relationship between competition     and stability  some literatures opt to define stability by attempting to define its counterpart.  For     example  instability often refers to as individual or systemic banking distress.  See for example      Claessens (2009)  and Carneiro (2011).       Intuitively   when  banks  compete  to  attract  customers  by  relaxing  their  lending     standards   this  may  lead  to  bad  credit  culture  where  banks  underprice  risks.    Increased     competition can  for example  lead to more access  but also to weaker lending standards  as     observed in the subprime lending market in the US.  See for example  Dell’Ariccia  Laeven     and Igan (2008).  However  many of theoretical literatures prior to the depth of global financial     crisis of 20082009 suggest that tradeoff between competition and stability does not necessarily                                                                  14 Xefficiency theory is introduced by Harvey Leibenstein who suggests that under imperfect competition  firms can   maintain some degree of inefficiency or  in other words  “X” level of efficiency.            hold.  See for example  Carletti and Hartmann (2002)  Boyd and Niccolo (2005)  Allen and     Gale (2004)  and Perotti and Suarez (2002).       22     Theoretical arguments of these papers prior to the global financial crisis  often rely on     modelling  incentive  structures  of  bank  and  their  behavior.    Boyd  and  Niccolo  (2005)   for     example  argues that there exists fundamental risk incentive mechanisms that cause banks to     become riskier as their markets become more concentrated.  Perotti and Suarez (2002) suggests     that the behavior of banks today will be affected by both current and future market structure     and the contestability levels that their authorities impose  e.g. open system in the future.  In     such a dynamic model  concentration level at the present day does not necessarily reduce risky     lending.  On the other hand  an expected increase in future market concentration could lead     banks to pursue safer lending today.      Carneiro  (2011)  suggests  that  there  is  a  tradeoff  between  financial  stability  and     efficiency  of  financial  intermediation.    Specifically   large  buffer  on  stocks  of  capital  may     actually  curtail  intermediation  activity.    Carniero  (2011)  also  finds  that  nonhighincome     countries were more protected from the global financial crisis of 20072010  but that protection     appeared  to  be  originated  from  less  efficient   less  globally  integrated  but  more  capitalized     financial systems.  In designing a policy to encourage more competition  regulators thus need     to consider tradeoffs among competition  stability  and access.15       2.  Measuring competition in the financial sector     In practice  measuring competition is rather difficult.  Various measures used in several     literatures  can  be  broadly  classified  into  three  groups.    First  group  of  measures  are  market     structure  measures  such  as  concentration  ratios   number  of  banks  or  HirschmanHerfindahl                                                                  15 To reduce complexity  authors such as Carneiro (2011) sometimes collapse the potential tradeoffs among different factors   into that between efficiency and stability.          Indices  (HHI)  assessments.    Such  measures  consider  only  market  shares  without  allowing     inferences on the competitive behavior of banks.  For example  these measures do not take into     account that banks with different ownership behave differently  or banks might not compete     directly in the same line of business.     23     Second groups of measures  such as HStatistic  assess the reaction of revenue or output     prices  to  input  prices   and  thus  gauge  the  competitive  behavior  of  banks.    Under  perfect     competition  increases in input prices would cause marginal cost and marginal revenue to move     together  while in imperfect competition they do not.  HStatistic imposes certain restrictive     assumptions  on  the  banks’  cost  functions   and  is  only  valid  if  the  market  in  the  study  is  in     equilibrium.     Third  group  of  measures  are  indicators  of  the  regulatory  framework  that  provide     indications  of  market  contestability  of  the  banking  system.    Such  measures  include  entry     requirements  formal and informal barriers to  entry for domestic and foreign banks  activity     restrictions  and  other  regulatory  requirements   which  might  prevent  new  entrants  from     challenging incumbents.  Beck et al. (2008) also suggest that the wider institutional framework     such  as  contractual  and  informational  framework  could  also  be  included  among  these     indicators.     Complexity in measuring competition is further compounded by the question of how to     properly define the relevant market.      A.  Measuring degree of competition in the Thai banking sector using      HStatistic     While the stylized facts in Part II have shown that competition in the financial sector     seems to be growing  with banks now competing with financial market players  nonbanks  and     payment service providers  intensity of such competition is not clearly seen.  This section thus     24          uses  PanzaRosse  (1987)  HStatistic  framework   a  New  Empirical  Industrial  Organization     (NEIO)  approach  to  assess  the  degree  of  competition  within  the  Thai  banking  sector16.       The  framework  measures  the  degree  of  competition  directly  from  market  power  of  players     within the market.   According to PanzaRosse (1987)  degree of competition within a market     is high  if revenues of firms in the market are sensitive to changes in input costs.  That is  firms     need to pass on changes in input costs to their customers.  On the other hand  if revenues of      firms are not sensitive to changes input costs  firms are considered to have sufficient market     power as they can maintain their customers’ base without altering their product  prices even     when there are changes in costs.     HStatistic can be calculated by first estimating how revenues (TR/TA in the equation     below) are sensitive to different input costs (wi in Equation 1 below).                                Equation 1 HStatistic     HStatistic is then calculated as the summation of the elasticity of TR/TA to different     input costs            Equation 2 HStatistic (cont)     If Hstatistic is near zero  then changes in input costs do not affect revenues of firms in     the  industry.    Firms  are  thus  price  makers  as  they  have  high  degree  of  market  power.                                                                    16 Note that PanzaRosse (1987) HStatistic is different from the traditional approach such as the HerfindahlHirchman Index   (HHI) which measures the degree of competition indirectly through concentration ratio.          On the other hand  if Hstatistic is equal to one  then firms in the industry pass on all the changes     in input costs to the consumers. Thus  these firms are effectively price takers  operating in a     25     perfectly competitive market.     HStatistic     Competition Level     H ≤ 0     Monopoly or Collusive Oligopoly     0 < H < 1     Monopolistic Competition     H = 1     Perfect Competition     Table 3 HStatistic and competition level     HStatistic has recently been used as a preferred method for measuring the degree of     competition  within  the  banking  industry.    In  contrast  to  previous  measures  used  such  as      the HHI concentration index that infer the degree of competition indirectly from the level of     market  concentration   HStatistic  measures  the  degree  of  competition  directly  by  assessing     pricing behavior of the firms.17         In recent years  the use of HStatistic to measure degree of competition in the financial     sector   particularly  the  banking  sector  grown  in  popularity   and  has  been  applied  quite     extensively18.   Recent research such as Ventouri (2018)  using data from 20072016  suggests     that HStatistic for the Thai banking sector is quite high at 0.823.                                                                    17 It is also important to note that there is a strand of literature which argues that the level of concentration is a good indicator   of competition. For example  Neal  P. (2011) (‘Banking Competition  The Rhetoric and the Reality’. Adelaide) contends that   the level of concentration  measured by concentration ratios or by HHI  is not enough to determine the level of competition.   The article takes the view that contestability must also be examined  i.e.  evaluating the ability for firms to enter and exit   markets.  Contestability is an issue that will be examined in the next section on promoting competition.   18 See for example  Molyneux et al. (1994) for major European countries  Molyneux et al. (1996) for Japanese commercial   banks  Bikker and Haaf (2002) for 23 industrialized countries  Claessens and Laeven (2004) for a 50country study  and Liu   et al. (2012) for Southeast Asian banking markets.          To assess how degree of competition in the Thai financial sector might have evolved     over time  the authors apply the HStatistic framework on the data from consolidated balance     sheets of 15 Thai commercial banks from 2013Q1 to 2018Q4.19       26     The authors estimated HStatistic  using a mixed effect model to allow variations in the     coefficients of Equation 1 over time  to examine the dynamic of competition 20.  The dependent     variable  is  “Total  revenue  /  Total  Asset”  while  the  independent  variables  are  three  types  of     main costs  namely (1) funding costs  (2) labor costs  and (3) physical asset costs. The control     variables are (1) “Total Equity / Total Asset”  (2) “Fixed Asset / Total Asset”  and (3) “NPL     ratio” to reflect banks’ strategy and credit risk.           Figure 11 HStatistic for the Thai banking sector                                                                  19 Consolidated balance sheets also include data from the banks’ subsidiaries which include operations of their nonbank   subsidiaries such as credit card and personal loans.  Nonconsolidated balance sheets and income statements  in contrast    include only data from the banks’ own operations.   20 The estimation is done with Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) sampling  using Stan  the Baysian probabilistic   programming language  accessed through the brms package of the R programming language created by Bürkner (2017)  with   prior distribution of the coefficients assumed to be normally distributed with mean of zero and standard deviation of one    reflecting the fact that the authors do not assume much what the coefficients might be  but that extreme values of the   coefficients are assumed to be very unlikely.     27          Figure 11 indicates that the degree of competition in Thai banking sector remains high     over the sample period  although there are some intertemporal dynamics worth noticing.  The     HStatistic dropped from 0.76 in 2013 to the low of around 0.610.62 in 2014 and 2015 before     edging up to around 0.73 in 2018  suggesting that the degree of competition did change over     time.  Allowing for uncertainty surrounding different estimation methods (mixed effect model     with varying  coefficients  v. OLS)  the results of this paper are in line with Ventouri (2018)      which indicate that the sector is operating  under monopolistic competition and consolidated     revenues are relatively sensitive to changes in cost21.       B.  Limitations of the HStatistic as a measure for financial sector     competition     While recent figures for Thai banking sector’s HStatistic are relatively high  it should     be reminded that for most countries  data available for the calculation of HStatistic are only     banking sector data.  If anything   inferring degree of competition from the HStatistic above     requires at least two caveats.       First  while banking sector remains dominant in many countries  in Thailand  financial     services are being offered not only by banks  but increasingly also by nonbanks and financial     market players.  Competition in the banking sector as reflected by the HStatistic thus does not     wholly reflect degree of competition in the financial sector.      Second  high competition as reflected by high HStatistic does not necessary mean that     banks are all competing to serve all segments of the population.  Given that banks are deposit     takers  and  a  bank  failure  could  lead  to  contagion  and  financial  instability  that  impose great     costs to the economy   regulations are often put to restrict banking activities  limiting banks’     potential to diversify  exploit scale and scope economies (OECD  2011).  As such  banks are                                                                  21 Dashed lines in Figure 11 represent upper and lower bound of 95 percent confidence band of the HStatistic estimate.          only competing in limited segments of customers and markets (i.e. those allowed by regulations     and those with relatively low risk).        28     On this second point  it should be noted  that despite HStatistic of the Thai  banking     being found to be high  the percentage of SME access to bank finance remains low.  This is     quite puzzling since in a market where competition is high  demand should be reasonably well     met.  Low SME access to finance warrants attention  given that (1) SMEs are a considered a     key driver of the Thai economy  accounting for 80 percent of employment  and 40 percent of     value added in GDP and (2) in many recent surveys  SMEs identified financial constraints and     high  funding  costs  as  one  key  area  of  help  needed.    See  for  example   Angklomkliew  &     Phekanonth (2019)  Nuntramas et al. (2019).        As such  it could be said that competitiveness of the Thai financial sector can still be     very  much improved upon  at least in terms of SME financial access  even if banking sector     competition  is  already  quite  high  when  seen  through  the  lens  of  HStatistic.   In  Part  V   the     paper will explore more on the bottlenecks in SME bank finance  as it remains one key weak     point in competitiveness of the Thai financial sector.                                 PART V – A PUZZLE  SME LOW ACCESS TO FINANCE     29     Part V analyzes a puzzle arising from the analyses of Part III and Part IV.  Despite high     competition in the Thai banking  sector  SME access  to finance  remains a weak  point.  This     suggests  that  there  are  market  failures  in  SME  access  to  finance.    The  point  is  particularly     important since SMEs are important for the Thai economy  whether in terms of employment      or valueadded to GDP.        Part  V  delves  into  this  puzzle  of  SME  financing   by  first  examining  what  might  be     bottlenecks and market  failures that limit SME access  to finance.  This is done by  breaking     down  SME  loan  origination  process  and  identifying  bottlenecks  and  market  failures  using     results from surveys and interviews of SMEs and bank credit officers.  Part V then examines     the implications that the bottlenecks and market failures have on SME lending  using data from     1.29 million individual loan accounts to SMEs.   Later  Part V reviews various initiatives being     done by various players including banks  FinTech  SMEs  and regulators to harness the power     of  technology  and  data  to  help  alleviate  some of  the  key  bottlenecks  and  market  failures  in     SME financing.  Lastly  Part V discusses how technology and data might be used to help unlock     bottlenecks and eliminate market failures in the financial sector as a whole.     1.  SME bank financing  Where are the bottlenecks     As  discussed  earlier   there  seems  to  be  both  quantitative  and  qualitative  gaps  in  SME     financing  despite the result on Part IV indicating that competition in the Thai banking sector      as  measured  by  HStatistic   is  high.    As  such   it  is  worth  investigating  what  might  be  the     bottlenecks  that  cause  market  failures  in  SME  bank  financing   i.e.  why  both  quantity  and     quality gaps still appear.          A.  Obstacles to SME finance  A broad view      30     Reviewing various surveys and studies on Thai SME financing key obstacles to SME     access to bank finance are found to include22       (1)     The  practice  of  collateralbased  lending   whereby  banks  require  SMEs  to     pose assets such as real estate properties  manufacturing equipment  and financial securities as     collaterals  for  loans.    Such  practice  prevents  SMEs   including  those  with  high  business     potential   but  without  sufficient  amount  of  assets  to  be  posed  as  collaterals   from  accessing     bank loans.     (2)  High  borrowing  costs   which  partly  arises  due  to  the  absence  of  reliable     financial information owing to substandard accounting practices  lack of financial documents     for  verification  and  substantive  business  plans   the  operator’s  lack  of  relevant  experiences.      Such factors make banks deem SMEs as being high risk and more likely to become NPLs  and     thus charge SMEs higher borrowing costs.     Government and regulators  being well aware of the problems of SME financing  have     introduced  a  number  of  initiatives  to  reduce  obstacles  to  SME  financing   including  Credit     Guarantee  Scheme  by  Thai  Credit  Guarantee  Corporation  to  partially  eliminate  collateral     requirements  in  a  traditional  collateralbased  lending.    Several  credit  schemes  were  also     introduced to help reduce financing costs for targeted SMEs such as those operating in the ten     Scurve industries.  In addition  SMEs are provided with credits for investment in technology     and innovations and (R&D) to help enhance SMEs’ competitiveness  and credit for SMEs to     upgrade  their water   air  and waste treatment  systems  in line with the policies to protect  the     environment and promote energy conservation (Nuntramas et al.  2019).  Furthermore  several     SFIs have stepped in to help with SMEs financing  yet SME access to finance remains low.                                                                  22 See for example Angklomkliew & Phekanonth (2019)  and Nuntramas et al. (2019).          B.  Bottlenecks in SME loan origination  A micro view     31     While a number of schemes and measures have been introduced by the government and     regulators to eliminate obstacles to SME financing  such schemes and measures are rather at     the macro level.  To specifically address the SME financing issues  it might still be worthwhile     to drill down to check what could be the bottlenecks of SME financing at the loan origination     process  and determine how these bottlenecks might have caused market failures.  To do so      the  authors  review  several  surveys  done  on  SMEs  and  bank  credit  officers.    According  to     BOT’s Regulatory Guillotine Project on SME Financing conducted between June – September     2018  in which representatives of various SME coalitions and bank representatives  bottlenecks     in SME loan origination are summarized in Table 4 below.               Actions     Pain points     Market failures     32          Step in SME loan   origination   1.

These  bottlenecks  have  resulted  in  high  transaction  costs  in  loan     origination   whether  in  terms  of  time   money   and  opportunity  cost.    Furthermore   these     bottlenecks prevent effective use of data to construct accurate credit risk models.  Without a     good credit risk model  banks find it difficult to distinguish between those SMEs that might be     deserving of loans but might not have adequate collateral (“good” SMEs)  and those that might          not  be  so  deserving  (“bad”  SMEs).    Such  difficulty  compounded  with  the  fact  that  SMEs     themselves typically  have higher credit risk than large firms has resulted in SMEs’ failure to     33     access financing.      The  presence  of  bottlenecks  in  SME  loan  origination  suggests  that  SME  lending  is     costlier  more timeconsuming  and riskier when compared to large corporate loans.  In large     corporate  lending   banks  often  have  more  reliable  information  at  hand   possibly  owing  to     ongoing relationship  as well as public information and audited financial statements that can     be used to assess the risk of the loans  and can price the loans more accurately.  It is also quite     safe to say that for a bank to lend THB 1 billion to a large corporate in a single transaction  it     would  take  much  less  time  and  effort  than  to  lend  to  100  SMEs  at  THB  10  million  each.      Furthermore   large  corporate   being  large  and  wellorganized  entities   with  verifiable  and     public information  tends to be less risky for banks to lend to  when compared to SMEs that     are still young  not wellsupported  and with less verifiable information.       These  obstacles  to  SME  access  to  bank  finance  reflect  market  failures  in  various     dimensions   (1)  information  asymmetry   where  banks  are  unable  to  easily  assess  risks  of     consumers  well  enough  and  thus  are  opted  to  collateralbased  lending;  (2)  behavioral     distortions resulting from high transaction costs  whereby banks neglect SME lending in favor     of other types of lending  despite potential immense demand from SMEs.        2.  Implications of market failures in SME bank financing     To assess how market failures might have affected SME bank financing  this paper uses     data from 1.29 million individual SME loan contracts from BOT’s SME Database (SMD) and     Loan  Arrangement  Database (LAR)   to assess how SME loans are distributed  where SMEs     are defined according to the criteria set by Thailand’s Ministry of Industry in 2002.  These loan     contracts are collected from 15 Thai commercial banks as well as six SFIs.                     34          Mapping  our  SME  loan  contract  data  to  SME  data  from  Office  of  SME  Promotion     (OSMEP)  the paper finds that a mere 16 percent of SMEs use loans from banks  26 percent     use  loans  from  SFIs   while  the  majority  (56  percent)  do  not  use  loans  from  banks  or  SFIs      reflecting either selfexclusion or lack of access to loans  or they do not use loans at all.  Despite     the fact that the authors cannot distinguish SMEs that selfexclude from usage of loans from     banks or SFIs  and those who actually lack access to loans  the fact that more than half of SMEs     do not use loans from banks or SFIs should raise some concerns.  SMEs often rely on bank or     SFI credit for external funding  as they typically cannot easily raise funds in financial markets     or other means.  See for example YokoiArai and Yoshino (2006) and Nuntramas (2019).                                                                  Figure 12 SME loans provided by commercial banks  by location          From Figure 12  it could be seen that SME loans provided by Thai commercial banks     concentrated mainly in Bangkok and its vicinity  and the central region of Thailand.     35     Figure 13 Size of new SME loans provided by banks          Drilling down to SME loan sizes as originated by banks  the results suggest that most     of the banks concentrate on SME loan size larger than THB 500 000 (Figure 13).  Although     the number of loan below THB 100 000 grew rapidly in the past few years  from less than 20     percent  in  2015H2  to  more  than  70  percent  in  2018  H2   it  is  found  that  only  two  banks     concentrated in this small loan segment.                  Figure 14 Income of SME customers who got new loans          Considering income of SMEs who got new loans in Figure 14  the number of SMEs     with income between THB 15 million who are able to get loans has risen considerably over     time.  Again  loans to the lower income tiers (less than one million baht and THB 15     million) concentrated mainly among two banks.        36     Figure 15 NPLs of new SME loans over time     Looking at NPLs of SMEs by loan size  we could also see that smaller SME loans are     riskier than larger SME loans (Figure 15).  This is consistent with our hypothesis that higher     transaction costs and higher credit costs of lending to smaller borrowers would lead banks to     lend to larger firms with larger loan size.     Figure 16 SME loan size provided by banks v. SFIs          From Figure 16  the results suggest that for tiny loan sizes  SFIs are key players to meet     SMEs financing needs.  SFIs account for around 80 percent of SME loans with size less than     THB  100 000   and  more  than  70  percent  of  SME  loans  with  size  between  THB  100 000    37     500 000.                                        Figure 17 SME customers of Banks and SFIs     Figure 18 SFIs' contribution to SME financing               38     Table 5 SME customers of Banks and SFIs     Figure 17 indicates that mediumsized enterprises use bank loans rather than SFI loans      while the reverse is true for smallsized enterprises.   However  the presence of SFIs is found     to  greatly  contribute  to  SME  financing  especially  SMEs  in  areas  where  banks  are  not     concentrated.  For example  rural areas outside Bangkok  as illustrated by Figure 18.  Table 5     illustrates that banks and SFIs serve distinct groups of SMEs.  Only 4 percent of SMEs have     loans from both banks and SFIs.       3.  Addressing SME financing challenge using technology and data  Banks      borrowers  FinTech  and regulators     Despite having SFIs stepped in to address market failures in SME lending  it is worth     exploring whether bottlenecks and market failures identified in the previous section could also     be  addressed  by  harnessing  the  power  of  technology  and  data.    Digital  disruption  that  is     ongoing  in  various  industries  are  also  starting  to  pervade  into  the  financial  sector.    Digital     disruption has brought  about  innovative solutions that harness  the power of technology  and     data to solve pain points in various industries.  In SME financing  the success in harnessing the     power of technology and data seems to require various players to work in tandem.          A.  Banks     39     In  recent  years   banks  in  many  countries   acting  alone  or  sometimes  working  with     FinTech  have come up with a number of solutions that could help unlocking the bottlenecks     in  SME  financing.    Some  of  the  solutions  to  relieve  bottlenecks  in  SME  credit  origination     identified from the BOT’s Regulatory Guillotine Project on SME financing are summarized in     Table 6 below  with many include the use of technology and data.

Borrowers     Apart from banks  in this age of digital disruption  SMEs themselves  as borrowers  also     have  the  potential  to  leverage  technology  and  help  alleviate  bottlenecks  in  SME  loan     origination  process.      Among  other  things   SMEs  could  digitize  their  businesses   leverage     cloudbased  platforms  for  accounting   adopt  digital  payments   and  automate  invoicing  and     settlement  processes  to  create  digital  footprints   substantiate  their  business  activities  and          become  eligible  for  finance.  Digitalization  and  adoption  of  technology  by  SMEs   however      might require right incentives  since they could incur shortterm costs for SMEs before longer    40     term benefits  including access to finance  are realized.     C.  FinTech     In Thailand  FinTech players have also started to emerge – acting alone or working with     banks  –  to  provide  solutions  that  help  SMEs  digitize  their  businesses  and  create  digital     footprints  as well as help banks analyze those footprints using artificial intelligence (AI) and     machine learning (ML) algorithms.  Many of these FinTech firms focus on providing solutions     that allow SMEs to focus on their core businesses  by taking care of peripheral but necessary     activities  e.g. accounting and logistics for SMEs.   For example  FlowAccount is a cloudbased     platform for business accounting.  It is an online account management system that is linked to     SME  businesses.  At  the  end  of  each  day   total  sales  turnover  and  cost  are  updated  on     FlowAccount.  SMEs spend almost no time in bookkeeping  effectively control their income     and expenses  while account reports can be viewed anywhere and anytime.  Currently  a large     Thai commercial bank already allows its API to link the accounts of FlowAccount’s customers     to its SME online application.      Lenddo  Credit OK  and SCB Abacus  on the other hand  are Thai FinTech players that     have emerged to leverage AI and ML on various sources of data including those from social     network platforms  and telecom companies  to build credit scores which will make it easier for     lenders to verify and make credit decisions for SMEs and micro entrepreneurs.  Such FinTech     also often work with banks  with SCB Abacus itself being a subsidiary of another large Thai     commercial bank.           Apart from those FinTech players that work with banks  there are also FinTech players     that compete with banks  at least indirectly  by offering alternative sources of SMEs financing.      41          In recent years  peertopeer (P2P) lending technology has taken root in Asia  particularly in     China  Singapore  and Indonesia.  P2P business models allow lenders and borrowers to link up     via an online platform.  For borrowers  this means that the underbanked are able to secure loans     where previously a lack of credit history posed considerable obstacles.  This may lead to faster     access  to  capital  for  SMEs  and  a  much  simplified  process  for  reaching  a  broader  base  of     potential investors  rather than solely reliance on banks.            In  Thailand   the  BOT  first  announced  their  intention  to  regulate  P2P  lending  in     September  2018   and  the  BOT  issued  Notification  4/2562  regulating  P2P  lending  on  April     2019.    The  Notification  imposes  requirements  and  conditions  for  P2P  platform  providers      borrowers  and lenders.  The applicants must also enter and pass the BOT regulatory sandbox     before launching their services to the general public.     D.  Regulators     Regulators are also looking for ways to help banks and FinTech leverage technology to     help mitigate SME financing problems.  Both the Bank of Thailand (BOT) and Securities and     Exchange Commission  (SEC) of Thailand have  established regulatory sandboxes that allow     banks and FinTech to test new innovations that have the potential to help alleviate bottlenecks     in SME financing  from eKYC to P2P debt financing and crowd funding platforms.               42     Figure 19 Reducing market failures using technology  data  and new players       The case of SME financing     E.  The importance of data and data sharing     One  key  market  failure  that  occurs  throughout  the  SME  loan  origination  process  is     information asymmetry.  Data is essential in reducing asymmetric information  and reduce the     degree  of  uncertainty  associated  with  credit  extension.    The  accuracy  of  credit  risk  models     tends to increase as data pool becomes larger.  More and better data should help lenders more     precisely identify the probabilities of loan defaults and nondefaults  and thus reduce Type I     and Type II error in lending.       (1) SME databases     To  create  more  value  from  data   many  advanced  economies  have  opted  to  create  a     platform to integrate  generalize  and share SME data among financial institutions and other     players  such as FinTech firms.  In Japan  for example  the Japan Risk Data Bank (RDB) and     Credit Risk Database (CRD) cover most financial institutions including credit unions.  Japan’s     RDB anonymously covers credit information on 910 000 companies  and the CRD covers 2.4     million  companies  (Nemoto  and  Koreen   2019).      In  addition  to  financial  data   data  on          transactions  through  companies’  bank  account  information  are  collected  and  constantly     43     updated.       In France  the FIBEN (Fichier bancaire des enterprises) database collects a relatively     comprehensive set of data on SMEs (Nemoto and Koreen  2019).  Such data has been used for     loan reviews  interest rate setting  and portfolio management.  They have also contributed to     the advancement of credit risk analyses by banks.  In Thailand  OSMEP is in the process of     trying to connect databases that are pertinent for SME credit analysis  but the final design is     yet to be decided.      (2) Efactoring platforms     In recent years  there have also been initiatives in various countries including Mexico      Japan  and India to create “efactoring” platforms  harnessing the power of data and technology     to make factoring more efficient23.  Through factoring  SMEs can obtain working capital by     selling their account receivables (the rights to receive payments from buyers of SME products)     to  factors  (i.e.  lenders)   at  a  discount.    Pain  points  in  a  typical  factoring  process  include     information asymmetry and search cost.  SMEs and factors might not know each other.  It could     take time to verify whether the account receivables are legitimate  and that they had not already     been sold to someone else (i.e. doublefinancing problem).  The electronic nature of efactoring                                                                  23 Factoring is one of the main types of SME lending identified by Berger and Udell (2006)  which include  (1) Financial   statement lending  which is lending based on informative financial statements and expected future cash flow); (2) Small   business credit scoring  i.e. lending based on hard information about the SME’s owner as well as the firm; (3) Relationship   lending  i.e. lending based on information through contact over time with the SME  its owner  and the local community;  (4)   Assetbased lending  where a subset of the firm’s assets is pledged as collateral and as a primary source of repayment; ( )   Factoring  involves the purchase of account receivables from an SME  by a “lender” known as a factor; ( ) Fixed asset   lending  i.e. lending  against assets that are longlived and are not sold in the normal course of business  e.g. equipment    motor vehicles  or real estate; ( ) Leasing  which involves the purchase of fixed assets by a “lender” known as a lessor and   then simultaneously enters into a rental contract with the lessee  i.e. the “borrower” that specified the payment schedule.  The   first three are already informationbased lending which could be directly enhanced with technology and data  while the latter   four typically are seen as more collateralbased types of lending.          platforms ensure that  the process  is  cheaper  faster   more transparent   and more secure than     44     normal factoring process.       In an efactoring platform  data on account receivables are verified and entered into the     platform by a trusted party  in a secured way  and shared only on a needtoknow basis  among     SMEs  buyers of SME products  (whose account  receivables are issued against)  and  factors     (which may include banks  and also FinTech in some case).  Parties can work seamlessly based     on the data presented on the platform.       In  some  of  the  efactoring  platforms   SMEs  can  even  post  their  account  receivables     onto the platforms  and interested factors (including banks) could come in and bid  for those     account receivables.  Those account receivables that have been successfully bided are marked     as such.  In the case of India  three licenses have been by the central bank to banks and FinTech     firms to operate efactoring platforms  and each of the platforms’ databases are connected to     each other  and records are ensured consistency using distributed ledger technology (DLT) to     guard against doublefinancing and fraud  (See Ruksapol et al.).                                     PART VI – LESSONS LEARNED  POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS  AND CONCLUSION     45     In Part V  we have discussed SME finance as a key pain point reflecting a gap in Thai     financial sector competitiveness.  We have discussed the bottlenecks that might have hampered     the ability of banks to efficiently lend to SMEs  and explore how technology and data might     help  alleviate the bottlenecks.   As discussed in  Part V  to harness the power of technology      data  and competition to help improve SME finance  various players would need to work in     tandem  whether banks work with FinTech to come up with new solutions  or SMEs work with     FinTech  and  banks  to  create  digital  footprints.    Competition  from  FinTech  in  alternative     finance should also spur more innovations from banks themselves.       Going  forward   given  the  ongoing  digital  disruption   it  is  legitimate  to  ask  how  the     ability to harness the power of technology  data  and competition to unlock bottlenecks in SME     financing might be applied to reduce market failures in other parts of the financial sector.  In     Part VI  drawing from the analysis done in Part V  along with reviewing lessons learned from     various countries  the authors tease out guiding principles that might be applied to help reduce     market failures and improve a country’s overall financial sector competitiveness.       Lessons learned and guiding principles for policy recommendations     The  key  question  here  is   how  do  we  harness  the  power  of  technology   data   and     competition  to  help  reduce  market  failures  and  improve  the  competitiveness  of  the  Thai     financial sector in the digital era?  Reviewing the case of SME financing  along with initiatives     in  various  countries  to  harness  the  power  of  digital  disruption   we  identify  three  guiding     principles that might help guide the Thai financial sector improves its competitiveness in the     digital era.          A.  Interoperability     46     Interoperability in this context means the ability for data to be shared  or transactions     to  be made  across different  platforms.   Interoperability is  beneficial to  the improvement of     financial sector competitiveness in at least three areas  reduction of information asymmetry;     collaboration and competition among different players; the capture of network value.     (1) Reduction of information asymmetry      As discussed in Part V  the ability to integrate  generalize  and share SME data among     various players would allow for more efficient loan reviews  interest rate setting  and portfolio     management by lenders  as well as contribute to the advancement of credit risk models.   As     such   this  well  help  reduce  information  asymmetry   which  is  a  key  market  failure  in  credit     origination.  This concept applies not only to SME financing but also to retail  and corporate     financing.  In the digital era  more digital footprints are being created in a variety of ways  and     most likely in different platforms  including social media  ecommerce  epayments  and in the     near future  with the arrival of 5G  the internet of things (IoT).  To capture the most value from     such  immense  and  diverse  sources  of  data  requires  seamless  integration   generalization  and     sharing across platforms.  In other word  interoperability among different platforms will be key     to  help  harness  data  that  arise  from  separate  digital  platforms   and  reduce  information     asymmetry.      (2) Collaboration and competition     Apart from  reduction of  information  asymmetry   interoperability could  also  enhance     collaboration and stimulate healthy competition.  In the Australia  UK  Hong Kong  and EU      interoperability through open banking and standard API initiatives has also been highlighted     as  a  key  to  ensure  collaboration  and  competition  among  banks  and  FinTech.    While  open          banking  has  many  meanings   the  gist  is  that  it  allows  data  of  a  customer  in  one  bank  to  be     shared electronically to another bank or FinTech firm  if the customer gives consent.       47     In terms of lending  this means a customer can give consent for its financial statements     held in one bank to be seamlessly shared with another bank  so that the other bank can have a     more  complete  view  of  the  customer   and  offer  lending  terms  that  are  more  attractive  and     accurate to the risk of that customer.  The concept can also be applied to a customer desiring     to  optimize  his  savings  and  investments   whereby  the  customer  gives  consent  allowing  a     FinTech firm to aggregate and present information from his accounts (savings  securities  and     mutual  funds) at  several  banks in  one place  and help  him optimize his  allocations of funds     among the accounts.      Interoperability  could  help  spur  collaboration  as  FinTech  could  work  with  banks  to     provide innovative products.  Interoperability could also spur competition  as there will be a     lower switching cost for customers shopping products from one bank or another as they see fit      and  thus  banks  (and  FinTech)  will  compete  to  innovate  and  improve  the  efficiency  of  their     services.       (3) Capturing network value     Interoperability is also essential to capture network value.  In China  the emergence of     BigTech  companies  such  as  Alibaba  and  TenCent  highlights  the  issues  of  interoperability.      Data from Alibaba and TenCent cannot be integrated and shared.  The lack of interoperability     between the two means that data from one platform cannot be easily combined for even more     accurate analysis.  Payments also cannot be made directly across accounts on the two platforms.      The  humongous  size  of  these  two  platforms   however   compensates  for  the  lack  of     interoperability.  Both  Alibaba and TenCent  have their own separate ecosystems  each  with     many  hundreds  of  millions  of  users.    In  a  typically  country  whose  size  of  the  population  is          much less than 100 million  the lack of interoperability could result in the inability of players     to effectively capture network value as market becomes too fragmented.     48     B.  A robust ecosystem      As  seen  in  the  case  of  SME  financing   different  players  play  different  roles      collaborating   and  competing   to  help  bring  the  power  of  technology  and  data  to  help  solve     bottlenecks and market failures.  At a broader financial sector perspective  to harness the power     of digital disruption  a robust ecosystem will also be needed.  FinTech can bring in technologies     and knowhow e.g. in payment solutions  biometrics  AI and ML  to help alleviate bottlenecks     in  other  domains  besides  SME  financing.    Banks   meanwhile   can  also  adopt  process     automation in many of their business processes  and collaborate with FinTech.  Banks can also     collaborate with ecommerce or social network platforms of BigTech companies in areas such     as customer acquisition  behavioral data analysis  and colending.     In many countries  the regulators also introduced new types of licensing to encourage     new players with new technologies to come in the financial sector and serve the underserved     segments   including  SMEs  and  retail.    For  example   Hong  Kong  and  Singapore  recently     introduced Virtual  Bank licenses  for new types  of banks  with  no physical  branches.   These     banks will rely on digital channels for interfacing with their customers  and thus save costs on     staff and physical premises.  Being startups  these new types of banks will also not be burdened     with  costly  and  inefficiency  legacy  systems.    They  can  operate  at  fractions  of  the  costs  of     traditional  banks   and  are  more  likely  to  be  able  to  serve  very  small  customers.    With     digitalization and the use of technology  they will be able to assess the customers in a more     granular manner  and thus provide products that are tailored to individual customers’ needs      whether  terms  of  the  loans  (which  may  be  priced  daily)  or  deposits  (which  can  offer  more     attractive rates to nudge saving behavior).     49          Meanwhile  the success in harnessing the power of technology and data also requires     widespread adoption of technology by the users of financial services themselves.  For users to     adopt  any  new  technology   they  would  need  to  see  that  benefits  would  outweigh  the  costs.      Given that many of the benefits of technology adoption might occur at a later stage (e.g. the     digital footprints that will enable the users to access financial services at cheaper costs later)      while  some  of  the  costs  are  upfront  (e.g.  the  cost  of  upgrading  the  systems   and  the  costs     associated  with  digitalization  process)   right  incentive  structures   whether  from  financial     services providers or from the regulators will be key.      C.  Adaptive  forward looking  and agile regulatory framework     Given a more diverse players in this ecosystem  many regulators are still grappling with     the complexity that the new ecosystem might bring.  On the one hand  the regulators might     need to adopt  a more activitybased approach to  regulations  rather than purely entitybased     regulations.  In this new ecosystem  banks  nonbank players  FinTech  and BigTech might be     competing with banks in certain market segments  e.g. lending  and payment.  In such activities      regulations might need to ensure that there is a level playing field  e.g. between KYC of bank     payment services and KYC of wallet provider services.  However  given limited resources of     the  regulators   the  regulators  might  also  need  to  regulate  on  the  basis  of  riskbased     proportionality  e.g. supervisors might need to emphasize more on examination of systemically     important institutions  which may not necessarily be banks.  However  in many cases  financial     regulators might not necessarily have the legal power to examine  for example BigTech firms      unless they have pertinent licenses issued by the regulators.                50               Figure 20 How can technology  data  and competition be harnessed at a broader level in the order to reduce     market failures?     Conclusion     The paper assesses competitiveness of the Thai financial sector in four dimensions      depth  efficiency  access  and stability.  The paper finds the Thai financial sector to compare     reasonably well to those of ASEAN5 peers  except access to bank credit by firms and small     firms.  This point is particularly poignant since SMEs are a key driver of the Thai economy.       The paper also assesses the degree of competition among Thai banks  the dominant     players in the Thai financial sector  using PanzarRosse HStatistic framework.  The paper     finds consistently high degree of competition over the sample period  20132018  with     relatively high HStatistic throughout the period.     The high degree of competition  taken together with SME lack of access to bank     financing creates a puzzle  If competition among Thai banks is high  why does SME access to     bank credit remain so low?  Analyzing results from various studies and interviews  the paper     identifies various bottlenecks present in SME loan origination process  including manual          process  paper documentation  and lack of data.  These bottlenecks make SME lending costly      51     timeconsuming  and risky.       Using data from 1.29 million individual loan contracts from 15 Thai banks and six     SFIs  the paper finds that only a few banks are attempting to penetrate the SME market at     lower tiers of loan size  and income.  Smaller SME loans  however  are found to be also     riskier  as their percentage of NPLs are higher.  Bank lending to SMEs are also found to be     concentrated in Bangkok and large provinces.  The paper finds SFIs to be a good complement     to commercial banks  both in terms of their focus on smaller size loans offered to SMEs and     their geographical coverage.  Still  when mapped to SME data from OSMEP  more than half     of SMEs are not using credits from banks or SFIs.       In the age of digital disruption  however  the paper finds that banks  FinTech  SMEs     and regulators are all attempting to harness the power of technology and data to help alleviate     the bottlenecks in SME lending.  In Thailand  banks are automating their processes.  Some of     Thai FinTech firms are collaborating with banks to offer innovative solutions and products      while others are competing with banks by offering platforms for alternative finance.  SMEs     themselves are also automating their process and create digital footprints.  Regulators      meanwhile  are also adopting a more agile and forward looking approach to regulation  in     order to reduce unintended consequence of regulations.     Teasing out lessons learned from various initiatives aimed to help alleviate     bottlenecks in SME financing  along with lessons learned from other countries in other     segments of the financial sector  the paper identifies three common themes that should help     guide the design of financial landscape in the digital era  Interoperability of infrastructures     that will help reduce information asymmetry  allow for collaboration and competition  and     create network value; Robust ecosystem with various types of players (including new types          of digital players) competing and collaborating to better serve the needs of customers; and     adaptive  forward looking  and agile regulatory framework that will help foster innovations     that serve customer needs without compromising financial stability or consumer protection.     52                                                                  APPENDIX     53     Appendix 1  Equilibrium test     Based  on  Panzar  and  Rosse  (1987)  methodology   the  model  valid  if  market  is  in     equilibrium. The equilibrium test can be estimated from equation below;                                    Equation 3 Equilibrium test (Panzar and Rosse)     where ROA is pretax return on asset. Due to the fact that ROA can be negative value      the  authors  apply  (1+ROA)  instead  of  ROA  to  avoid  the  negative  value.  The  dependent     variables are “funding costs”  “labor costs”  and “physical asset costs”  denoted by W1 W2 and     W3  respectively. The control variables are “Total Equity / Total Asset”  “Fixed Asset / Total     Asset”  and “NPL ratio”.          The summation of coefficients of W1 W2 and W3 represents EStatistic. If EStatistic     equal to zero  the market is in equilibrium  otherwise  no equilibrium.      Value of EStatistic     Equilibrium Test     E = 0.00     Equilibrium     Table 7 EStatistic and equilibrium test     Table 7 shows the result of equilibrium test from consolidated financial statement for     15 commercial banks. The result indicate that Thai banking sector has long run equilibrium.     Thus  the measurement of competition in Thai banking sector can be measured by Panzar and     Rosse Model.                    BIBLIOGRAPHY      54     Allen   G.  and  Gale   D.
