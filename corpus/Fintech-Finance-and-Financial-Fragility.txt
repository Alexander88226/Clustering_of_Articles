b'herein fileFintech Finance and Financial Fragility  \\xe2\\x80\\x95 Focusing on China  Rose Neng Lai* University  of Macau  And   Robert Van Order George Washington University    Abstract Financial  Technology  (Fintech)  is evolving  quickly  within  the financial  system  giving  rise to new forms  of  lending  and opening  up a version  of shadow  banking.  This  is  particular ly true  in  China.  While  Fintech  finance  and  shadow  banks  can  improve  a  banking  system they  can  also  become  new  sources  of  fragility.  This  paper  aims  to  provide  a  theoretical analysis  of risks of Fintech  finance  to financial  sectors with  particular  examples  for China.  These  risks  are most  likely  to be important  when  Fintech  moves  beyond  its  technologica l focus  and performs  financial  intermediation  particularly  banklike  functions.  We provide implications  for  the evolution  of  Fintech  finance  as new sources  of payments  and funding. We propose \\xe2\\x80\\x9cringfencing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  as an approach to mitigate  risks  from  contagion.

Sironi  (2016) (p. 5) defines  Fintech as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9c\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  a  global  phenomenon  born  at  the  intersection  between  financial  firms  and technology  providers  attempting  to leverage  on digital  technology  and advanced  analyt ics to  unbundle  financial  services  and  harness  economies  of  scale  by  targeting long tail consumers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Fintech  firms  have  emerged  as providers  of  services  and  funding  includ ing retail  lending  payments  analytics  personal  finance  and  Roboadvisors.  Investme nt strategies  directed  at pools  fitting  particular  client  demands  (as opposed to say  strategies designed  to  outperform  the  market  as  a  whole)  called  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGoalbased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  investing  have become  the  Fintech investor  core  philosophy  (see  Sironi  (2016)  for  more  detailed description  of Fintech  Roboadvisors  and investing).  A major  trigger  for  this  evolution  has been the loss  of confidence  in  the traditional  banking system  after  the  Global  Financial  Crisis.  The  evolution  has also  begun  outside  of countries hit  by the  crisis  such  as China  where  for  instance  small  and medium  enterprises  (SMEs) that  have  growth  potential  do  not  have  easy  access  to  the  regular  banking  system. Furthermore  in  the  current  low  yield  environment  investors  are  motivated  to  seek more direct  lending  and  investment  platforms  that  offer  lower  transaction  costs  than  regular financial  intermediation  and can avoid  regulated  deposit  rates. Technology  particularly  in the  ability  to  process  large  data  sets  has  made  direct  lending  easier.  The  idea  is  to  use technology  to  analyze  value  and  risk  of  the  pools  that  would  suit  clients\\xe2\\x80\\x99  needs  more rapidly  and with  lower  transaction  costs.  As we shall  see this  can also  entail  externalit ies and agency  costs.   An  example  of Fintech  is  for  lenders  to use  automated  underwriting  models  for  mortgage financing  via  more  accurate  and  detailed  checking  of  house  buyers  due to easy  access  to enormous  databases and better pricing  models.  Borrowers  and lenders  can spend less  effort in  loan  origination  and are willing  to spend more in  order to obtain  convenient  service  from Fintech  lenders  (Philippon  (2015) and  Buchak  et. al.  (2017)).  In  the  case  of  peertopeer (P2P)  finance  cryptocurrencies  (e.g.  Bitcoin  and  Ethereum)  blockchain  crowdfund ing \\x0cand  other  digital  wallets  funds  are  directly  transferred  from  fund  providers  to fund  users without  the  need  of  any  financial  intermediaries.  This  also  implies  that  credit  risks  are borne directly  by the creditors  (fundproviders)  and not the P2P platform  (also hence  called \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccredit  disintermediation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).    This  has  stimulated  increases  in  shadow  banking  as a way  of  intermediation.  By  shadow banking  we  mean  financial  institutions  that  perform  banklike  intermediation  functio ns but  outside  the  regular  banking  system.  Key  differences  are  absence  of  bank  regulatio ns such  as  lending  and  deposit  rate  ceilings  as  well  as  portfolio  restrictions  and  deposit insurance  and  other  forms  of  liability  guarantees.  The  last  two  features  are  especially crucial  since  the  absence  of  insurance  and  guarantees  makes  shadow  banks  more susceptible  to runs.  Of  particular  importance  are lower  costs  (e.g.  information  costs)  for intermediation  services  relative  to regular  banks an ability  to offer  higher  rates than  those allowed  by  formal  institutions  due  to  government  restrictions  and  a  broader  range  of regulatory  arbitrage  for instance  avoiding  regulated  capital  requirements.    Fintech  finance  facilitates  underwriting  and information  benefits  with  big  data in  making loans  and valuing  other assets  that  are prime  targets  for substitutes  for  traditional  financ ia l intermediation  where investors  are essentially  depositors  in  banklike  businesses.  In China it  can  create  an  elastic  source  of  funding  for  SMEs and  real  estate.  However  because  the Fintech  firms  are  outside  the  scope of  banking  regulations  and  deposit  insurance  default can trigger  depositors\\xe2\\x80\\x99  flight  to quality  causing  a contagious  collapse  of  the Fintech  firms.   We develop  models  in  the  spirit  of  the  network  models  of  Eisenberg  and  Noe (2001) and Acemoglu  et  al.  (2015)  to  analyze  whether  Fintech  finance is  complementary to  the financial  system  in  the  sense  of  expanding  funding  availability  and/or  disruptive  which might  affect  the  stability  of  the  banking  sector  as a whole.  We pay  particular  attention  to contagion  in  different  states of interconnectedness.  Our modeling  is largely  taxonomic  we exploit  existing  models  to clarify  how shadow banking  and Fintech  are connected  and their implications  with  a focus  on  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  recent  experience.  We also  develop  analogies  with \\x0cstructures  used  in  the  U.S.  before  the  Great  Recession  which  can  be  used  as  qualitat ive reference  points  for understanding  risk.  It  is  clear  that  much  of  this  is  not  new.  The  current  Fintechshadow  bank  structures  are similar  to the  special  purpose  vehicles  (SPVs)  used  to fund  mortgagebacked  securities  a decade ago. The use of data to evaluate  credit  risk  of mortgages  is reminiscent  of the move in  the  U.S. in  the  1990s toward automated  underwriting  (see Straka (2000)). Our networkbased  analysis  of  fragility  and  Fintech  and  the  ensuing  susceptibility  of  a  system  to instability  from  large  shocks  is  also  related  to earlier  analysis  by Leijonhufvud  (1968 and revisited  in  2009) of \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccorridor  effects\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  in  which  systems  adjust  in  a stable  manner  to small shocks  within  some  range  but react in  an unstable  manner  to shocks  outside  the range.    Our  models  show  that  shocks  to Fintech  financing  have  to pass some  threshold  (in  terms of number  of failed  SMEs and the amount  they  owed) before  failure  is contagious.  Hence a highly  interconnected  banking  network  is  a necessary  but  not  a sufficient  condition  for system  failure;  the  magnitude  and closeness  of the connections  matters  and the  size  of the corridors  depends on the nature  of the networks.  Given  the potential  instability  we suggest ringfencing  a recently  popular  approach  to financial  regulation  as a solution  to mitigate the  power  of  contagion  from  failure  of  Fintech  finance  to the  banking  sector.  To the  best of  our knowledge  this  is  the  first  study  to formalize  the  link  between  Fintech  finance  and the  financial  system.      2.  Background  of Shadow  Banking  and  Fintech  Financing Shadow  banking  has  been  accused  of  being  at  the  center  of  the  Global  Financial  Crisis leading  to the  Great  Recession  in  the  U.S and subsequently  tanking  a sizable  share  of  the global  economy.  On  the  other  side  of  the  world  shadow  banking  in  China  has  rapidly expanded  filling  a void  in  supplying  credit  to SMEs  that  are not  able  to borrow  from  the big  four banks and other commercial  banks that are mostly  designed  to fund  StateOwnedEnterprises  (SOEs) and big  corporations.   \\x0c Credit  for  small  businesses  in  China  has  surged  since  2008  with  government  support  to combat against  the ripple  from  the Global  Financial  Crisis.  According  to the People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bank of  China  loans  to  small  enterprises  reached  29.4% of  the  total  loans  by  the  end  of  2013 (Yao 2016). Another  group  actively  participating  in  shadow  banking  is local  governme nt financing  platforms (LGFPs)  which  are  trust  funds  borrowing  on  behalf  of  local governments.  The  Central  government  initiated  fiscal  stimulus  in  2009 in  order to combat the  potential  economic  downturn  after  the  Great  Recession.  Seventy  percent  of  this stimulus  package has to come from  the local  governments  which  have to utilize  the LGFPs for  funding  sources.  Many  nonbank  financial firms  such  as  trust  companies  and microfinance  companies  that  lend  to  SMEs  are  funded  from  investors  in  the  form  of Wealth  Management  Products  (or WMPs).   Apparently  because of the  caution  taken  after  the Crisis  Fintech  finance  has grown  slower in  the  US than  in  Europe  where  there  are more  lax  regulations  governing  Fintech  finance. In  China  different  forms  of  Fintech  finance  have  emerged  and  grown  with  the  notable examples  of  mobile  payment  and  crowdfunding.  While  the  Fintech  finance  market  is currently  small  relative  to  the  general  banking  sector  the  rapid  increase  in  its  depositors and borrowers  suggests  a bigger  market  relatively  soon. This  is especially  due to easy entry and  exit  coupled  with  high  yield  on  deposits  and  relatively  easy  access  to funds  on  the borrower side. A recent study  shows  that Fintech  investment  grew by 75% globally  in 2015 with  a  44%  increase  in  the  US  but  445%  in  China  although  the  latter  represents  only around  USD2 billion  while  the  former  is  US4.5 billion  (Accenture  (2016)). In  2016 Ant Financial  alone  poured  in  USD4.3 billion  (Wintermeyer  (2017)).  The  Fintech  firms  with  which  we are most  concerned  began  as ecommerce  firms  (such  as etailing  platforms) that  have  evolved  into  financial  intermediaries  through  collecting customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  (depositors)  funds  and  redistributing  them  in  the  form  of  loans  and  therefore have  emerged  as a basis  for shadow banking.  One can think  of the basic  structure  as similar to  a  Special  Purpose  Vehicle  (SPV)  used  in  securitization  models  (Ashcraft  and Scheierman  (2008)  and  Brunnermeier  (2009))  although  in  the  Fintech  case  the  asset \\x0cstructure  setup  is  provided  with  more  detailed  information  than  has  been  provided  by historical  SPVs. The liability  side can be thought  of as similar  to tranching the structure  in the  SPV rather  like  CMOs and CDOs. In our  case the structure  is  divided  into  equity  and a depositlike  pieces  like  a simple  commercial  bank.  These  structures  are  also  similar  to those  used in  Repurchase  (Repo) markets  and structured  investment  vehicles  to fund  pools of  mortgages  or other  assets.  In  China  the  structuring  has  been  stimulated  by  growth  of SMEs  which  thirst  for  more  direct  funding  from  investors  hopefully  cutting  down intermediation  costs and avoiding  regulation.  2.1  Players and Products More  recent  participants  in  Fintech  are  ecommerce  companies  and  Internet  companies. Alibaba  is  an  example.  It  sets up a microlending  business  for  SME loans  that  are funded by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdeposits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  by  Alibaba  customers  whose  small  accounts  are used  for  purchases  online. Relative  to traditional  shadow  banking  Alipay  the  payment  platform  for  Alibaba  covers many  investors  but  mostly  small  amounts  (could  be  as  small  as  RMB1.00).  With  their Fintech  advantage  through  their  huge  customer  database  in  ecommerce  retailing  (or  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cetailing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) they  are  able  to  develop  credit  assessment  models  to  evaluate the  credit performance  of their  borrowers. The deposits at Alibaba  are what generate  the shadow bank and they  are largely  unregulated  and uninsured.  Another  popular  source  is the  P2P lending platforms  for  investors  looking  for  high  returns  and  small  firms  that  need  quick  funding bypassing  regulations  on microcredit  firms.  These  usually  operate with  high  leverage  with loan  sizes  exceeding  registered  capital.     Wealth  Management  Products  (WMPs)  are unsecured  financial  products  like  bond  funds rather  than  short  term  deposits  usually  sold  to small  investors  seeking  higher  returns  than those  offered  by  bank  deposits.  They  have  been  offered  by  many  banks  and  financ ia l institutions in  China.  Some  are  forms  of  shadow  banking  (when  these  products  are subsequently  transferred  to trust  funds  so as not to be recorded on the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 balance  sheets and  then  funded  with  tranched  liabilities).  Online  WMPs  became  popular  when  ecommerce  companies  started  to accept  deposits  on  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cewallets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  of  customers  of  the  etailing  business.  An  example  is  the  Yu\\xe2\\x80\\x99E  Bao  (a  Chinese  term  meaning  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTreasure  from \\x0cRemaining  Balance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)  of  Alibaba  which  has  a large  share  in  the  etailing  market  in  China and offers  online  WMPs.   WMPs have low entry  barriers;  there is no minimum  for investment  amounts  for customers who  are the  depositors.  Because  nonfinancial  institutions  are  not  subject  to interest  rate restrictions  investors  can be promised  an annual  interest  rate of 5% to 7% (or even  higher) a very  high  rate when  compared  to the  oneyear  deposit  rate of  3.3% in  China.  Borrowers from  Alibaba  through  AliLoan  are  normally  sellers  in  the  etailing  platform  of  Alibaba called  TaoBao  (Chinese  term  for  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDigging  Treasure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  This  is  an  example  of  how  an institution like  Alibaba  can  utilize its technology  and  big  data to  analyze the creditworthiness  of these borrowers  who can be small  businesses  with  high  risks  (Alibaba later  merged  all  its  efunding  business  into  Ant  Financial  in  2014). Another  competitor  is the  TenPay  and  WeBank  of TenCent  one of the  largest  social  network  provider  in  China.  2.2   Market Structure A simple  representation  of incentives  behind  market  structure  is that the major banks ration credit  and are heavily  regulated.  They  charge  a (regulated)  price  that is  too low  to clear  the market  pay a low  regulated  deposit  rate and are subject  to capital  and other  requireme nts. As a result  there is  an excess demand  for credit  and a private  market  can emerge  to fill  the gap  even  if  it  is  at  a  competitive  disadvantage  in  terms  of  cost  of  funds  (banks  raising money  via  guaranteed  deposits).  The  shadow  banking  market  is  free  to pay  deposit  rates that  are above regulated  bank deposit  rates and charge  higher  rates to their  borrowers.   The  rise  of  Fintech  firms  that  offer  banklike  functions  is  a threat  to traditional  regulated financial  intermediaries  as they  can use  service  and speed to take business  away from  the regular  banking  system  while lending  at  higher  rates.  Flexibility  from  the  lack  of regulatory  bodies  the  much  wider  customer  and debtor  bases and the  unlimited  scope of expansion  in  terms  of accessibility  forms  and modes  have  blurred  the  boundaries  among lenders  borrowers  and  intermediaries  of  traditional  banking  system.  Even  though  bank and  nonbank  financial institutions  have  joined  the  trend  of  adopting  more  financ ia l technology  in  order to maintain  their  competitive  positions  they  do not  possess the  same \\x0ctechnology  and  flexibility  as the  Fintech  firms  that  possess  both  technological  expertise and big  data on extracting  information  on a wide  range  of SMEs and investors.    The  advantages  of  Fintech  finance  are also  sources  of risk  to the general  financial  system. For  instance  epayment  platforms  (such  as  Alipay)  charge  very  small  transaction  costs relative  to other  bank  card payments  but  that  means  it  is  easy  to move  money  around.  A risk  is  that  the  sellers  of  commodities  bought  via  the  platform  will  have  trouble  obtaining their  payments  from  consumers  if  the  platform  fails  or are at risk  of failing  because  of the credit  business.  Fintech  firms  as shadow  banks  often  lack  expertise  in  financial  services while  simultaneously  significantly  broadening  the  number  and  type  of  borrowers.  In  the case  of  equity  crowdfunding  the  businesses  involved  are  usually  very  risky  and  the potential  return  is  estimated  with  very  low  precision  over  usually  at least  a five  to  seven year  startup  period.  Blaseg  and  Koetter  (2016)  for  example  conclude that  equity crowdfunding  is  a  main  source  of  financing  for  smaller  ventures  and  those  with  fewer tangible  assets.   Acharya  et al.  (2017) mentions  that  WMPs have  caused  financial  institutions  to be more closely  connected  than  ever  and  thus  the  rollover  risks  of  WMPs  increase  the  risk  of contagion  across financial  institutions  in  a way  that  is  similar  to  shadow  banking  via  for instance  securitized  banking  in  the  Repo market  in  the U.S. in  2007 and 2008 (Gorton  and Metrick  (2012)).  This  can  create  illiquidity  problems  and  a  sudden  lack  of  capital  can result  in  difficulty  in  rolling  over  of  loans  and  default  of  the  guaranteed  principal  for investors  which  can  lead  to  fragile  banking  if  the  capital  of  their  business  comes  from traditional  banks.   Some  Fintech  companies  therefore  seek strategic  partners  to mitigate  the  problem  of  lack of  financial  expertise  and  capital.  For  example  Alibaba\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Ant  Financial  partners  with several  banks  such  as China  Minsheng  Bank  so that  the  former  can  collect  funding  and pass it on to the latter  to lend out in  return  for a high  enough  rate on the online  WMP. Even though  accounts  in  YuE  Bao are small  ranging  from  a few to a few thousand  US Dollars the  Ant  Financial  money  market  fund  generated  a return  of  3.93% in  the  first  quarter  of \\x0c2017. This  attracts  more  of  its  customers  to deposit  their  money  to  YuE  Bao  creating  a big  fund  that  is directly  connected  to the formal  banking  sector. Another  important  issue  is that  investors  particularly  small  investors  tend  to  rely  heavily  on  explicit  and  implic it guarantees  (Buchak  et al. (2017)) to manage  their  risk  and moral  hazard  concerns.  If there is  a market  downturn  and  guarantees  are \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccalled\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  this  fund  could  make  a big  withdrawa l from  associated  banks.  Hence  (implicit)  guarantees  pose a threat  to the  Chinese  banking sector.  Companies  like  Alibaba  can be either  too big  or too  connected  to fail.  Zhou  et al. (2015) provides  a thorough  narration  of the change  in  regulations  in  coping  with  the change in  Fintech  in  China  which  is  still  far  from  optimal.  While  there  has  been  a  rapidly  developing  literature  about  how  Fintech  works  and  how different  platforms  have  preempted  the credit  market  there is  scant research  about whether Fintech  finance  can help  expand  or threaten  the banking  industry.  Philippon  (2016) is one of  the  first  to  study  how  Fintech  can  change  the  banking  system  by  providing  cheap transparent  and  easily  accessible  funding  in  contrast  to  expensive  traditional  banking services  which  still  rely  heavily  on implicit  and  explicit  government  guarantees.  Buchak et al. (2017)  compare  Fintech  and  nonFintech  shadow  banks  and  focus  on  how  Fintech firms  have  penetrated  into  the  mortgage  refinancing  business.  Tasca  et al. (2016) offers  a comprehensive  collection  of Fintech  finance  from  different  perspectives.  2.3  Systemic Risks Interconnectedness  that  increases  systemic  risk  leading  to  contagion  has  been  widely explored  especially  after  the  Global  Financial  Crisis  (see  for  example  Allen  and  Gale (2000)  Gai  and  Kapadia  (2010)  Acemoglu  et  al.  (2015)  and  Roukny  et  al.  (2016)). Studies  of  how  different  forms  of  banking  networks  can  lead  to  varying  degrees  of contagion  and financial  fragility  are also plentiful.  For example  Elsinger  et al. (2006) finds that  (1) highly  correlated  portfolio  exposure  is a more  crucial  reason for contagion  (2) this could  be small  given  low bankruptcy  costs (3) there are effective  measures  to combat crisis and  (4)  costs  of  being  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9clender  of  last  resort\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  could  be  much  smaller  than  previously thought.    \\x0cGlasserman  et al. (2015)  concludes  that  either  the  shock  to the  network  must  be large  or the  affected  bank  must  have  small  net  worth  to  trigger  contagion  and  that  deteriorated credit  quality  can  speed it  up.  Kaister  (2016) argues  that  the  potential  for  bailouts  creates incentives  that lead  to a more fragile  financial  system  although  prohibition  of bailouts  can also  lead  to  welfare  reduction  and  higher  probability  of  crisis.  Bernard  et  al.  (2017) suggests  conditions  under  which  nointervention  threats  by  the  regulatory  body  can  be helpful  and  when  bailins  are actually  better  than  bailouts  in  stopping  contagion  across various  banking  networks.     3.  Banking  and  Networks  In  order  to  provide  a  theoretical  analysis  of  the  potential  risk  of  Fintech  finance  to  the financial/banking  sector we first  need to know how  banks are connected.  Figure  1 depicts some  examples  of  possible  financial/banking  network  systems  (see for  example  Roukny et al. (2016)  for  modeling  with  different  network  structures).  For simplicity  we  assume that  the system  consists  of four  banks denoted  as nodes 1 to 4. The  first  example  is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstar network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  in  which  all  banks  are linked  only  to Bank  1. A typical  example  is for  Bank  1 to be the central  bank or quasicentral  bank of a city  state or country.  Another  example  would be for  this  Figure  to be a snapshot  of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTooBigtoFail\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  bank  in  a large  system  where  a very  big  bank  is  linked  to other  possibly  nearby  very  small  banks.  The  second one  is  the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cring  network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  where  each  bank  is  connected  with  pairwise  liabilities  only  with  its  two adjacent  banks.  In  reality  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstar  network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cring  network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  banking  systems  are  very unlikely  because banks work closely  together  and banking  systems  work globally.  The last one  in  our  discussion  is  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete  network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  in  which  all  banks  are connected  to each other  with  pairwise  liabilities.  Other  possibilities  are somewhere  in  between  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstar\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cring\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  network  and  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete  network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  in  that  banks  are connected  to more  than  one or two but  not all  banks  in  the  systems.  3.1 The Banking  Network Model We model  the  links  among  banks  in  a banking  system  in  the  spirit  of  Eisenberg  and  Noe (2001) Acemoglu  et al. (2015) and Bernard  et al. (2017). Suppose there are n banks such \\x0cthat  bank  i = 1 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 n has  interbank  obligations  of  Lij  which  is  what  bank  i owes  to any other  bank  j. Obviously   Lij = 0 for  i  = j. Note however  that  bank  i does  not  necessarily have  interbank  obligations  with  all  n \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1 banks in  the system  in  which  case Lij = 0 for some ij\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. For instance  in  the  simplest  case of a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cstar  network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  as depicted  on  the  left  of  Panel 1A of Figure  1 bank  i can  be any  of  node 2 3 or 4 which  has  interbank  obligations  only with  node 1. At the other  extreme  all  banks in  the  network  have  obligations  with  the other n \\xe2\\x80\\x93 1 banks  in  which  case the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete  network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  on the  right  of  the  panel  in  the  Figure applies.  Let . The  relative  liability  share  is   .    (1) Denote  other  financial  commitments  such  as wages  and operating  expenses  as part of  but more senior  liabilities  of the bank by  wi. Bank i also has cash on hand  ci and market  value from  outside  investments  (i.e.  not interbank  loans)  Ai which  generates  a random  return  of xi.   Suppose  all  payments  have  to  be made  on  the  same  date.  If  Pji is  the  repayment  of  the liability  from  bank j to bank i the total  cash flow  of  bank i is   .     (2) where  Pii = 0 and Pji \\xef\\x82\\xa3 Lji. If  it  cannot  meet  all  its  committed  payments  that  is  it  will  have  to liquidate  some of its  outside  investments.  Suppose only  a fraction  \\xef\\x81\\xa1i of the fundamental  value  of  outside  investments  can  be recovered  (because  of  fire  sale  or sale within  a  short  time).  Bank  i  does  not  have  to  default  as  long  as  the  relatively  junior interbank  liabilities  can  be  covered  by  liquidating  just  enough  of  outside  investme nts provided  that  the  senior  obligations  are  covered.  Otherwise  it  would  have  to  sell  all  its investments  to repay all  debts. That  is its  liquidation  would  be determined  based on \\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbdnjijiLL1\\xef\\x83\\xaf\\xef\\x83\\xae\\xef\\x83\\xaf\\xef\\x83\\xad\\xef\\x83\\xac\\xef\\x80\\xbe\\xef\\x80\\xbdotherwiseLifLLiiijij00  \\xef\\x81\\xb0\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xabnjjiiiPxc1iinjjiiiwLPxc\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbc\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd1\\x0c   (3) where  the  first  term  (in  the  parentheses)  in  the  minimum  function  is  the  required  amount but  is  less  than  if  liquidating  all  investments  while  the  second part times  \\xef\\x81\\xa1i is the  amount that  could  be obtained  from  liquidating  all  assets.  If  the  latter  is  still  not  enough  to cover all  interbank  liabilities  the  bank is assumed  to have  to default.    When  bank  i  defaults  whatever  is  left  over  after  the  senior  obligations  are  met  will  be distributed  among  banks  for  fulfilling the  interbank  liabilities.  Hence  for  any  bank  j in  the  interbank  system  payment  from  bank  i to bank j is     (4) Otherwise  banks  in  the  network  if  nothing is  left  from  bank  i.  For simplicity  let   which  is  similar  to  the  partial  recovery  of  interbank  claims  in Bernard  et al.  (2017). Expression  (4)  also  means  that  whether  any  bank  i  defaults  or not depends not only  on the return  from  external  investment  xi or \\xef\\x81\\xa1i the fraction  of assets that could  be  liquidated  but  also  and  crucially  on  whether  other  banks  in  the  system  are solvent  and pay back bank i and hence  if \\xef\\x81\\xa2ij is  close  to 1.  3.2  Network  Fragility Network fragility  is  a property  of  banks in  a banking  network  that  are risky  in  the sense  of being  subject  to large  losses  quickly  due for example  to taking  too many  risky  investme nts and/or  having  too much  leverage  or being  subject  to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctail  risk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  from  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfat  tail\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  return distributions.  Fragility  is  important  in  explaining  the  collapse  of  a banking  system  when defaults  of some  banks in  the system  cause other  banks to default.    Recall  that any  bank i has outside  investment  that provides  a random  return  of xi. Following Acemoglu  et al. (2015) we assume  this  investment  return  to be  \\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xa5injjiiiiiiiAPxcLwMinl11\\xef\\x81\\xa1ij\\xef\\x82\\xb9\\xef\\x80\\xa2  \\xef\\x83\\xba\\xef\\x83\\xba\\xef\\x83\\xbb\\xef\\x83\\xb9\\xef\\x83\\xaa\\xef\\x83\\xaa\\xef\\x83\\xab\\xef\\x83\\xa9\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xa5iiiinkkjiiijijLwlPxcMinP1\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x81\\xb0ijPij\\xef\\x82\\xb9\\xef\\x80\\xa2\\xef\\x80\\xbd    0ijijijLP\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x81\\xa2ij\\xef\\x82\\xb9\\xef\\x80\\xa2  \\x0c where  representing  some  shocks  is  i.i.d.. The  upper  bound  of \\xef\\x81\\xa5i is such  that  the  outside  investment  returns  nothing  while  the  lower  bound  implies  that  the return  together  with  liquidating  the  asset should  at least  cover  the senior  obligation.  This is different  from  Acemoglu  et al. (2015) which  assumes  that all  banks have the same shock and  therefore the  same  outside investment  values liquidation  fractions  and  senior obligations.  We allow  all  these  parameters  to be bank specific.    Following  some  number  of  shocks  si  for  bank  i  (here  for  simplicity  we  assume  each shock of bank i is of the same magnitude  for si times)  the total  value  of the banking  system is      (5) which  is  the  sum  of  all  cash  inflows  and  asset  values  in  the  whole  banking  system  minus those  for  banks  that  experience  shocks  from  their  outside  investments  and  therefore  are subject  to liquidating  some assets. In the extreme  when  liquidation  is not possible  the  value  of  the system  becomes  where  D is the  group  of  banks that  default.  3.3 Contagion  and  Fragility Contagion  happens  when  defaults  by  some  banks  in  the  system  spread  to  other  banks. Instability  arises  when  contagion  effects  are  amplified  rather  than  dampened  i.e.  when shocks  come  from  outside the  corridors.  in  (4)  suggests that the  more interconnected  banks  are  in  terms  of  more  pairwise  liabilities  among  more  banks  in  the system  the  more  likely  the  network  will  be  contagious.  This  is  not  necessarily  true however  as more  banks in  the  system  can share  the losses  from  the  failed  banks provided that  most  of  the  banks  are resilient  enough.  Nevertheless  the  smaller  is  the  total  value  of the banking  system  in  (5) all  else equal  the more fragile  is the system  (because  small  value iiiax\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9iiiiiiaAwa\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x83\\x8e\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbdniiiiiiiilsAacU11\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x81\\xa50\\xef\\x80\\xbdi\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\x8e\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbdDiiniiiiiiAsAacU1\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbdnjijP1\\x0cmeans  small  cushion  for  fragility).   It is not the purpose  of this  paper to prove what  kind  of networks  will  be more  contagious  and fragile  than  others  and  under  what  circumstances. Rather  we  take  for  granted  the  findings  from  Acemoglu  et  al.  (2015)  which  are  also confirmed  in Bernard  et al. (2017) to analyze  the situations  in our Fintechbank  partnership network.  Acemoglu  et  al.  (2015)  define  two  different  systems  System  1 and  System  2  with  the same number  of banks n different  in  U in  (5) such as U1 and U2 respectively.  Then  System 1  is  more  stable  than  System  2  if  both  experience  similar times  of  shocks  si  but  conditional  on  the  realizations  of  \\xef\\x81\\xa5i.  Furthermore  System  1  is  more resilient  than  System  2 if  conditional  on  taking  the  magnitudes  of \\xef\\x81\\xa5i for  all  of  the si. Hence  fragility of  a bank  network  depends  on the  original  \\xe2\\x80\\x9chealth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  of  the banks  in  terms  of  quality  of  their  assets  (stability)  magnitudes  of  the  shocks  (resilience) and the  structure  of the  network  (interconnectedness).   Given  this  Acemoglu  et al. (2015) show  that for small  enough  shocks a complete  network (as in  Panel  1A) is the most  resilient  and stable  type of financial  network  because the  small shocks  will  be shared  by  many  banks  in  the  system  thereby  exerting  minimal  effect  to individual  banks. On the other  hand a ring  network  (Panel  1A) in which  any  bank is linked only  to  two  other  banks  in  the  system  is  least  resilient  and  least  stable.   They  also  claim that  higher  similarity  in  the  pairwise  liabilities  among  banks  generates  less  fragility.  This provides  an  explanation  of  why  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToo  Big  to Fail\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  banks  might  not  be good  for  financ ia l systems  because  other  smaller  banks  in  the  system  will  not  be  able  to  resist  the  shocks spread from  these  big  banks.1    On the other  hand high  magnitudes  of shocks \\xef\\x81\\xa5i and interbank  liabilities  (Lij) lead to both complete  and  ring  networks  being  least  stable  while  a  network  structure  somewhere  in between is relatively  more  stable  and  resilient.  This is  because the  weaker interconnectedness  ensures  that the losses  from  the defaulting  banks are taken by distressed                                                                  1 This does not take into account some endogeneity issues in risktaking.  For instance big banks might  take on less risk because of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfranchise value.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa921UEUE\\xef\\x82\\xb3\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa921UMinUMin\\xef\\x82\\xb3\\x0cbanks that  have  to liquidate  some assets but not by all  banks because not all  are connected with  the  distressed  banks.  A  complete  network  allows  shocks  to  some  banks  to  be completely  transmitted  to  the  entire  system  hence  increasing  systemic  risk.  In  addition more  evenly  distributed  pairwise  liability  adds to faster  contagion.    Finally  Acemoglu  et al. (2015) introduces  \\xe2\\x80\\x9charmonic  distance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  as the  closeness  of a bank with  another  bank  in  terms  of  both  distance  and  intensity  of  the  liabilities.  A bank  that  is close  to  all  other  banks  with  a  smaller  \\xe2\\x80\\x9charmonic  distance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  is  the  most  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csystemica l ly important\\xe2\\x80\\x9d;  any  possible  default  of  this  bank  will  be most  contagious  an  explanation  of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cToo  Systemic  to Fail\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  banks.   4. Fintech  Networks and  Shadow  Banking In  this  section  we expand  on the  previous  section  to illustrate  various  forms  of  intra  and internetwork  connections  within  the  Fintech  financing  and across  to banks  respectively. We  model  how  the  banking  network  model  is  linked  to  Fintech  finance  when  the  latter becomes  a form  of  shadow  banking.  We then  formulate  a general  model  of  Fintechbank partnership  shadow  banking.  4.1   Networks Panel  1B  of  Figure  1  illustrates the  structures  of  most  Fintech  networks  with  the rectangular  boxes  in  both  diagrams  as  the  Fintech  firms  that  facilitate the  financ ing platform.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFintech  Network  1\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  applies  when  their  functions  are  merely  providing technology  platforms  to enhance  financial  services  but not as intermediaries.  For example it  can represent  the etailing  platform  of Alipay.  Consumers  pay the  retailers  through  their ewallets  managed  by  Alipay  through  the  etailing  platform  called  TaoBao  and  retailers make  sure  the  products  are  delivered  to  the  consumers  or  else  their  etailing  record  on TaoBao  will  be affected  through  the  negative  reviews  from  consumers.  Another  example of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFintech  Network 1\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  is the  P2P platform.     \\x0cFunds can also be collected  via Fintech  firms  from  one end to the other. Take crowdfund ing as  an  example.  Crowdfunding  can  be  classified  into  \\xe2\\x80\\x9clendingbased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequitybased \\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\xe2\\x80\\x9crewardbased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdonationbased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  In  the  first  two  investors  expect  to have  returns  in the future  whereas  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdonationbased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  crowdfunding  as the name  implies  is not associated with  payoffs  although  investors  of  \\xe2\\x80\\x9crewardbased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  crowdfunding  hope to have  rewards  in the  future  should  the  venture  business  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblossom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Hence  a  graphical  representation  of crowdfunding  is similar  to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFintech  Network 1\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where investors  know about the nature of the  business  ventures  of  the borrowers  through  the  Fintech  crowdfunding  platform  (the rectangular  box). In  the  case of  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdonationbased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  crowdfunding  the  arrows  in  the  Figure point  in  one  direction  from  investors  to borrowers  because  the  borrowers  do not  have  to pay back the  investors.    In both \\xe2\\x80\\x9clendingbased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cequitybased\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  crowdfunding  investors  expect to earn returns  and will  take opportunity  costs into  account  and the  Fintech  firm  will  act as the  financ ia l intermediary  in  facilitating  collection  and  distribution  of  funds.  In  that  case the  network will look  like  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFintech  Network  2\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  whereby  the  Fintech  platform is  not  only  an intermediary  for  facilitating  financing  but  is  also  responsible  for  the  banking  function  of ensuring  investors  are paid their  returns.  As mentioned  before  some  investors  would  have implicit  guarantees  from  the  Fintech  platform  as well.  4.2  Shadow  Banking Fintech  finance  becomes  a form  of  shadow banking in  cases  where  investors  can join  the money  market  fund  for which  the Fintech  firm  acts as financial  intermediary  for instance to lend  to SMEs  and to promise  returns  to investors.  The  network  looks  like  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFintech Network 2\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in  Figure  1. For example  investors  place their  money  through  deposits  in  YuE Bao  of  Alibaba  through  which  Ant  Financial  lends  directly  to SMEs  (borrowers  in  the Figure)  via  its  AliLoan  branch  (the  rectangular  box  in  the  middle).  Ant  Financial  is  now functioning  like  a traditional  bank  funding  longterm  loans  with  shortterm  deposits  and hence  performing  (shadow)  banking functions  of  maturity transformation liquid it y transformation  leverage  and credit  risk  transfer   (because  YuE  Bao promises  an  annual interest  return).   \\x0c When  Fintech  firms  create  money  market  funds  or  WMPs  through  banks  the  Fintech platform  is  more  complicated  than  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFintech  Network 2\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  because  it  will  be connected  to a banking  network such  as that depicted in  Panel  2A of Figure  2. As an illustration  a Fintech firm  joins  two banks Bank 2 and Bank 3 in  the banking  network.  The Fintech  firm  collects funds  from  the  investors  (such  as YuE  Bao  of  Alibaba)  and passes  the  funds  to  Banks  2 and 3 to lend  to SMEs that  are required  to pay higher  loan  rates than  other big  corporations  (arrows  of  flow  of  funds  to SMEs are omitted  in  the  Figure).  Upon  collecting  the  interest payments  the  banks  withhold  some  fees  and  pass  the  rest  on  to  the  Fintech  firm  which then  withholds  some  fees  before  distributing  the  rest to the investors  as investment  return. This  return  is  in  general  in  the  form  of  a  promised  interest  rate  that  is  higher  than  bank deposit  rates.   Panel  2B shows  how  a banking  system  can support  Fintech  in  an  example  of  two Fintech finance  firms.  The  dark thick  arrows  show  the  connections  of Fintech  Firm  1 with  Banks 2 and  3 and  Fintech  Firm  2 with  Banks  1 and  4. Of course  one bank  can  also  choose  to serve  more  Fintech  firms;  and  not  all  banks  are connected  to Fintech  firms.  Furthermore the  banking  network  does  not  have  to  be  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  network.  It  is  the  extensive connections  between  Fintech  shadow banking  and banking  networks  and the  potential  for significant  expansion  of Fintech  finance  that create contagion  risks  from  the Fintech  sector to the  traditional  banking  sector.   5.  A Model for  a FintechBanking  System Here we develop  Fintechshadow  banking  models  and analyze  implications  to the Fintechbanking  system  after  the  occurrence  of shocks.  5.1 The Fintech  Liability Borrowing  from  the  notation  used in  the  banking  network  in  Section  2 the  cash  flow  of a Fintech  financing  firm/platform  at any point  in  time  when  payments  are settled  is  given  by \\x0c     (6) where  M is  the  number  of SMEs to which  the firm  lends  and hence  is  the  return  from SME  i  \\xef\\x80\\xa2  i  = 1 to  M  and  X is  the  amount  of  return  that  the  Fintech  firm  guarantees  the investors/depositors.  The  remaining  balance  is  the  surplus  of  the  firm.  If  some  SMEs  are not  able  to  make  their  payments  the  Fintech  firm  can  request  them  to  liquidate  some  of their  assets. Suppose  sales  of assets  of  T SMEs are triggered  (where  T is  the  total  number of  troubled  SMEs)  from  which  full  recovery  in  value  cannot  be obtained  as in  Section  3. Suppose the  fraction  of recovery  is  and the asset value  is  for SME j and note  that once  liquidation  is  triggered  the  SMEs will  no longer  be able  to make  the  usual  payment. Then  the cash  flow  of  the Fintech  firm  is     (7) If the proceeds from  these  failed  SMEs are still  not enough  then  the Fintech  firm  will  have to use its  own cash  on hand  to cover  payments  to investors.  Suppose  cF is the  cash at hand. The  Fintech  firm  will  have  to default  in  the  worst case if   .    (8) This  is what  happened  to China  Credit  Trust  Co. which  claimed  that  it  would  have  to sell five  coal  mining  properties  before  it  could  return  the  money  to the investors  (Zhu  (2014)). Adding  to the  complication  is  that  the  investment  product  involved  was  sold  through  the Industrial  and  Commercial  Bank  of  China  (ICBC  one  of  the  big  four  banks  of  China). However  in  this  case ICBC does not  have  an  obligation  to repay  the investors  because  it served  only  as the sales  platform  of  the WMPs.  Notice  that  even  though  the  China  Credit  Trust  Co. is a shadow bank  case and not  related to  the  Fintech  firm  the  investment  products  and  channels  are  similar  to  what  we  have discussed  before.  A  recent  example  related  to  Fintech  finance  as shadow  banking  is  the negotiation  of Huishan  Dairy  in  China  with  its  eight  creditors  including  Hongling  Capital a P2P lender  to delay  paying  its  loans  (Bloomberg  News (2017)).  As  mentioned  earlier XxMiFi\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd1FixFj\\xef\\x81\\xa1FjAFjxXAxMTMjFjFjTMiFi\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd11\\xef\\x81\\xa1XAxcMTMjFjFjTMiFiF\\xef\\x80\\xbc\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd11\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\x0cP2P  Fintech  financing  is  just  a  platform  that  transfers  funds  from  investors  directly  to borrowers.  However  in  many  cases  particularly  in  China  investors  are  told  that  their investments  have  very  low  risks  if  not  riskfree  and  so  investors  assume  implic it guarantees  from  the WMPissuing  firms  or banks through  which  the WMPs are sold  (Wee and Guo  (2017)).   5.2 FintechBank  Partnership We now connect  the Fintech  network  and the banking  network  to represent  the case where a  Fintech  finance  firm  partners  with  a  bank  to  lend  to  SMEs  as  shown  in  Panel  2A  of Figure  2. The  cash  flow  of  the  Fintech  firm  is similar  to (6) except  that  the returns  are not from  the  SMEs  directly  but rather  from  a total  of B partnering  banks  (two banks  in  Panel 2A). That  is  cash flow  is given  by          (9) where represents  the  return  from  the  SME  investments  that  bank  i  pays  back  to  the Fintech  firm.  For partnering  Bank  i the cash  flow  in  (2) now  includes  the  return  from SME  k   which  is  separated  from  its  other  outside  investments  because  of higher  risk  and  to highlight  the  fact  that  the  funds  are from  the  Fintech  firm.  Formally cash flow  of Bank  i becomes Its committed  cash  flow  is  now .       (10) (11) where  represents  what  Bank  i gains  from  this  partnership.  If  T of  the  M  SME  loans  are  not  performing  while  other  outside  investments  are  fine depending  on  the  partnership  agreement  with  the  Fintech  firm the  bank  does  not necessarily  have  to liquidate  its  assets even  if XXBiFi\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd1FiXFkixMk\\xef\\x81\\x8c1  \\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xa2\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xabMkFkinjjiiixPxc11FiMkiiFkinjjiiiXwLxPxc\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd11FiMkFkiXx\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd1\\x0c.   (12) If  the  agreement  is  for  the  Fintech  firm  to be fully  responsible  then  Bank  i will  liquidate the  assets of the  T nonperforming  SMEs even  if    and the  situation  goes  back to expressions  (6) to (8). The  Fintech  firm  will  have  to default if  enough  SMEs from  the  B partner  banks default  that  is if . In  this  case the  Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  return  through  this  funding  will  be minimal.  That  is will  be close  to zero.  At the  other  extreme  Bank  i is  to bear all  credit  risks  of all  external investments  including  the loans  to SMEs. That  situation  will  be shown  in  the next  section.      5.3  A More Fragile  Bank Suppose Bank  i is  not  able  to meet  its  obligations  because  some  (T) SMEs in  the  Fintechbank partnership  default  that  is .   (12\\xe2\\x80\\x99) Then  Bank  i will  have  to liquidate  some  of  its  assets  in  addition  to liquidating  the  T nonperforming  SMEs. Suppose  only  a fraction  of  the value  of SME investment  k can be recovered  and  the  market  value  from  the  SME  investment  is .  Then  the  liquida t io n decision  for  Bank  i in  (3) is  modified  as Note that  unlike  (3)  which  can  contain  investment  assets  other  than  loans  (and  therefore can be added to (13) albeit  becoming  more  lengthy)  the  two summation  terms  in  (13) are the cash flows  from  (M \\xe2\\x80\\x93 T) SMEs that  are performing  and those T that are nonperforming. .

Expression  (13) shows  how Fintech  financing  can be harmful  to a bank. When  the (highly) risky  SMEs  default  their  liquidation  values  are usually  low  as can  be realized  by a small value  for . Given  that  the  WMPs  guarantee  high  interest  return  it  is  mostly  the  case that  is not  only  true but  big  in  absolute  value.  This  highlights  the  fact that  the bank involved  in Fintech  finance  will  have  to liquidate  more  of  its  own  outside  investment  assets inducing more  risk  to its  asset  profile.    Paying  back the interbank  liabilities  in  the interbank  system  is  not as straightforward  as in (4) because  to Bank  i the interbank  system  is  now n banks plus  the  Fintech  firm  (referring to Figure  2). The relative  liability  for  Bank  i now  becomes    and      \\xef\\x80\\xa2  j = 1 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 n . The first  expression  above gives  the relative  liabilities  for individual  interbank  loans  while the  second  one  is  that  for  the  Fintech  firm.  The  amount  to be  paid  back by  Bank  i  to all other  banks and the  Fintech  firm  is  extended  from  expression  (4) to the following  (14) where   j = 1 \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 n F. This  means  that  each  bank that  is  connected  to  Bank  i with  interbank liability  receives  less  than  if  Bank i is  not involved  in  the  Fintech  financing.

Suppose  the random  return  of  investment  from  SME  k is  given  by  a constant  and  a random  term. Then  we have  where  such  that  the  return  on  investment  is  bounded  below  by zero  and  above  by  the  liquidation  value.  As  mentioned  before  we  assume  that  SME  k defaults  and is hence  liquidated  once it experiences  a shock. Of course if  Bank 1 defaults completely  then  the value  of  the banking  system  is  the  same  as that  in  (6). If  Bank  1 does not  default  and  if  it  and other  banks  in  the  system  also  experience  other  shocks  then  the total  value  of the  banking  system  following  expression  (5) becomes .   (15) With  the  last  term  in  (15)  this  means  that  the  overall  value  of  the  banking  system  is increased  because of the involvement  of  Bank 1 in  Fintech  finance  as long  as the total  loss of  those  SMEs  that  experienced  shocks  is  not  as  big  as  the  value  of  all  other  surviving SMEs.  On  the  other  hand  if  many  SMEs  experience  shocks  the  overall  value  will  be smaller  than  without  Fintech  financing.  Now suppose Bank  1 and Bank  2 are both in  the Fintechbank  partnership  (as Panel  2A of Figure  2).  The  total  value  of  the  banking  system  in  the  case  of  both  banks  needing  to liquidate  some  assets becomes .   (16) The  same  applies  to an  increased  number  of  Fintech  firms  joining  the  partnership  which can also  be reflected  in  the  form  of more SMEs involved  (i.e.  larger  M in  expression  (16)) or more  banks  involved  in  which  case (16) becomes Fka1Fk1\\xef\\x81\\xa5FkFkFkax111\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9FkFkFkFkFkaAa11111  \\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x83\\x8e\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbdMTMkFkTMkFkniiiiiiiiAlsAacU111111\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbd211111jMTMkFkjTMkFkjniiiiiiiiAlsAacU\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\x0c  (17) where  there  are  N  (with  N  \\xef\\x82\\xa3  n)  banks  and  H  Fintech  firms  joining  the  Fintechbank partnership  allowing  the  possibility  that  one bank  can partner  with  more  than  one Fintech firm  and each Fintech  firm  can partner  with  more than  one bank.   It is obvious  from  expression  (17) that whether  Fintech  financing  adds value  to the banking system  in  the presence  of  shocks very  much  depends  on whether  the  last  term    is  positive  which  depends  on (1)  the  quality  of  assets  of  and  (2) the  shocks  experienced by the SMEs involved  in  the Fintechbank  system.  Once there  is a wave  of failure  in  SME businesses  this  term  becomes  smaller  or even  negative  resulting  in  a reduction  in  overall value  of the  banking  system.  The  risk  of  contagion  follows the  argument  discussed  in  Section  2.3  albeit  not  as straightforward.  Recall  that  contagion  happens  if  the  banking  system  is  fragile  while  a highly  interconnected  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccomplete  network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  where  more  banks  are  resilient  in  absorbing shocks  from  failed  bank can be safe  from  contagion.  In the  case of a Fintechbank  system as long  as the Fintech  platforms  are strong  enough  to absorb defaults  from  some  SMEs or as long  as the  banks  involved  can  be more  resilient  to the  failures  from  the  Fintech  firms particularly  if  there  is  a  wellinterconnected  network  then  the  overall  system  is  safe  in general.  However  with  a more  fragile  banking  system  once the shock at some point  in  the SMEs  and/or  Fintech  platform  is  big  enough  the  impact  from  contagion  will  be greater and  faster  a kind  of  corridor  effect.  Further  as seen  from  the  second  part of  expression (17) more  Fintech  financing  and therefore  more  SMEs in  the pool induce  extra  fragility  to the  banks involved.    Contagion is  more likely if  banks in the  system  are  more interconnected. Interconnectedness  can  be seen  from  the  liquidation  decision  term  li in  expression  (17). Given  N banks and H Fintech  firms  we have \\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x80\\xa8\\xef\\x80\\xa9\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbdNjHhMTMkFkjTMkFkjniiiiiiiihhAlsAacU111111\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xadNjHhMTMkFkjTMkFkjhhA1111\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\x0cand    (18) . (19) Expressions  (18)  and  (19)  show  that  the  liquidation  decision  depends  not  only  on  SME performance  under  the  Fintech  finance  but  also  on interbank  payments  from  other  banks which  are also affected  by the SME performances  in  their  individual  portfolio.  Hence more SMEs defaulting  across more banks  that join  the  Fintechbank  partnership  not only  causes more  banks  to  be  more  fragile  but  because  of  the  interconnectedness the  interbank liabilities  imply  a higher  possibility  of  contagion  and destabilizing  adjustment  through  the more  fragile  banking  system.  2    In  other  words  as shown  in  Section  2 a banking  system  where  more  Fintech  business  is involved  particularly if  the  TooBigtoFail  or  TooSystemictoFail  banks  are  also involved  will  bear  higher  potential  risk  of  failure  even  if  the  interconnectedness  within the  banking  system  has  not  changed.  Our  model  can  be  easily  extended  to  a  global perspective.  Considering  the  interconnectedness  of  banking  systems  globally  the  number of banks involved  in  Fintech  N and the number  of Fintech  firms  H can represent  a global setting.  All  our arguments  for contagion  throughout  a banking  system  can then  be extended to contagion  across countries.  While  this  sounds  remote  at the moment  fear and skepticism of  contagion  leading  to another  global  financial  crisis  because  of  Fintech  financing  is  not without  ground  given  the  very  rapid  development  and expansion  of  Fintech  and a history of  similar  turbulence  during  the  Financials  Crisis  in  2007 and  2008 in  the  U.S. that  was based on similar  structures.                                                                   2 We have ignored in our model  the possibility that business defaults among SMEs can be contagious too which is more likely  in economic downturn when few SMEs could perform  well  and SMEs forming  a supply chain among themselves will  spread the failure  from  the origin  throughout the chain. \\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5injjiHhMTMkFkiFkiTMkFkiiiHhFiiiiiAPAxxcXLwMinlhhhh111111\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x83\\xba\\xef\\x83\\xba\\xef\\x83\\xbb\\xef\\x83\\xb9\\xef\\x83\\xaa\\xef\\x83\\xaa\\xef\\x83\\xab\\xef\\x83\\xa9\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbdHhFiiiHhMTMkFkiFkiiinkkjHhTMkFkiiiijijhhhhXLwAlPxxcMinP111111\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\xef\\x81\\xb0\\x0c 6.  Potential  Threat  and  the Need for Regulatory Policies   From the previous  section  we see that  on the one hand a more rapid  and bigger  expansion in  Fintech  increases  the funding  of SMEs and more investors  can enjoy  returns  higher  than (artificially  low)  bank  deposit  rates.  On the  other  hand  because  the  SMEs  are  relative ly riskier  investments  default  of  a  noticeable  number  of  these  SMEs  can  bring  about nontrivial  losses  to  investors.  This  can  have  a big  social  impact  because  many  of  these investors  are small  investors  who  aim  for  higher  return  but  are  not  sophisticated  enough to  understand  that  their  investments  are  in  risky  assets.  When  Fintech  firms  also  act  as financial  intermediaries  such  SME default  might  also  trigger  failure  of the  Fintech  firms although  the  banking  system  will  not be affected.     6.1   Bringing  Banks In When  banks  are  involved  the  Fintechbank  partnerships  as  in  expression  (17)  show higher  overall  value  of the  banking  system  with  expansion  of  Fintech  financing  as long  as no  SMEs  fail  as  shown  by  the  second  grand  summation  term.  However  also  shown  in Section  5.4 this  same  term  is  also the  one that  induces  increased  fragility  into  the  banking system.  Some banks  and Fintech  firms  might  also  collapse.  In the  worst  case investors  in the  WMPs  under  the  Fintechbank  partnership  cannot  be repaid.  It  is  therefore  crucial  to have  appropriate  governance  to avoid  regulatory  arbitrage  especially  because  Fintech  has grown  so  rapidly.  For  example  as  of  the  first  half  of  2017  funds  from  Yu\\xe2\\x80\\x99E  Bao  have surpassed JP Morgan  to become the largest  money  market  fund  in  the world (Lucas  (2017)) implying  that  it  has involved  a lot  of small  investors  putting  their  savings  (though  perhaps small  in  magnitude  that might  represent  a major  part of their  wealth)  into  the hands  of Ant Financial.  A related  issue  that  is  not covered  in  detail  in  this  study  is  investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99  confidence  and bank runs.  As  in  most  bank  run  models  this  can  come  from  a range  of  sources  as is  modelled in  the  classic  Diamond  and Dibvig  (1983) paper. Their  model  has  two equilibria  one with confidence  and  deposits  remaining in  the  bank  and  one  without  confidence  where \\x0cdepositors  move  out of  deposits.  There  is no  clear  preference  for  one equilibrium  over  the other  and  the  bank  does  not  need  to  be  insolvent  to  experience  a  run.  As  long  as some depositors  lose  confidence  in  the bank they  will  withdraw  their  funds  possibly  trigger ing other  depositors  to withdraw  as well.  By  the same token if  some of the investors  in  WMPs in  the  Fintechbank  partnership  panic  then  some  investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99  \\xe2\\x80\\x98flight  to quality\\xe2\\x80\\x99  will  trigger others  to withdraw  funds  too. Hence  there  do not  need to be defaults  from  many  SMEs or the Fintech  firm  in  case a bank is  not  involved  to trigger  liquidation  of  assets  in  order to  meet  investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99  withdrawals.  The  more  fragile  the  banking  system  and/or  the  Fintech firm  the easier  is the  collapse  of the system  due to a bigger  magnitude  of \\xe2\\x80\\x98flight  to qualit y\\xe2\\x80\\x99 from  a big  group  of Fintech  \\xe2\\x80\\x98investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  Depending  on accounting  regulations  investments  do not have  to be on the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 balance sheets  if  they  can  form  subsidiaries  to  become  their  shadow  bank  branches.  As  in  the Hongling  Capital  P2P lender  example  in  Section  3 Fintech  firms  themselves  can pose high risk  as shadow  banks.  In  China  some  WMPs  are  financing  \\xe2\\x80\\x9czombie  firms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (that  do  not produce  anything  or  are  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdying\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  companies)  or  industries  experiencing  oversupply  (e.g. steel  and real estate)  but the funds  are not held  on the balance  sheets of the  banks because this  can  be done  under  some  trusts  formed  by the  banks3. Such  financial  intermediation  is not governed  under  normal  banking  regulations  and there is no deposit  insurance  to protect investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99  funds  (worse if  investors  are told  that their  investments  are mostly  very  low risk and they  assume  implicit  guarantees  from  the  Fintech  platform  or the  banks).   Even  though  some  banks claim  that  they  only  help  to sell  the  WMP products  and  have  no obligation  for  the  failure  of  the  investments  as long  as these  banks  are  large  a valuable reputation  might  mean  that  they  cannot  simply  walk  away.  For example  Minsheng  Bank one of the partnering  banks of Ant Financial  has been pointed  out  as one of the  aggressive lenders  through  WMPs. This  is  a big  alarm  not only  for the  ever growing  shadow  banking sector  in  China  but  also  its  Fintech  platform  especially  when  investors  assume  implic it                                                                  3 As reported by Deutsche Welle Business Column  (2017)  the Financial  Stability  Board  is very concerned about the growth of shadow banking in China  which is the fourth largest in the world but the second fastest growth at 31%  in 2016. \\x0cguarantees.  The situation  is analogous  to that of some structured  investment  vehicles  (SIVs) in  the U.S. before  the recent  crash  which  were  off  balance  sheet  but  which  sponsor  banks nonetheless  felt  obligated  to support  perhaps  for  reputation  reasons.  This  can  be thought of as a case of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpinkyswear\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  recourse  where sellers  make legally  unenforceable  promises that  are  not  subject  to  capital  regulations  or perhaps  close  scrutiny  and  can  be  broken under  stress.4  6.2  Policy Overall  interconnectedness  within  and among  banks shadow  banks and Fintech  coupled with  the  very  speedy  development  in  technology  and  innovation  are  possible  sources  of amplifying  banking  risks.  There  have  been  a lot  of  proposals  on  how  to regulate  Fintech and  shadow  banks.  Here  we  suggest  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cring fencing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  a  proposed  remedy  to  the  Global Financial  Crisis  as  a  measure  to  tackle  the  risk  of  financial  contagion  from  Fintech financing.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRing fencing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  in  the  Vickers  proposal  (Independent  Commission  on Banking of  the  United  Kingdom)  5  refers  to  separating  some  banking  activities  as  well  as  the investors  of  these  activities  from  the  rest of the  banking  activities  and their  corresponding risks.  In the Liikanen  proposal  (European  Commission)6  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cring  fencing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  is meant  to restrict banks from  taking  risks  associated  with  wholesale  financial  services.    The  idea of ringfencing  is  to separate the  risky  investments  from  the low  risk  investme nts to  protect  investors/depositors\\xe2\\x80\\x99  assets  from  being  affected  by  the  failure  of  those  risky investments.  When  applied  to the Fintechbank  partnership  ringfencing  is  the dotted oval surrounding  the  Fintech  network  and  the  banks  connected  to  this  network  in  Figure  3. Mathematically  we  suggest  isolating  the  Fintech  financing  for  the  SMEs  so  that  the overall  value  of the  banking  system  in  expression  (17) will  not be affected  by                                                                    4 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPinky  swear\\xe2\\x80\\x9d refers  to a childhood version of  sealing a deal  by linking  small  fingers  (the pinkies)  as a presumably special sort of promise.  It was used for instance in secondary mortgage markets  in the U.S.  in part as a way of giving partial  recourse without having to hold capital against the ensuing risk. 5 The Final  Report of the Independent Commission  on Banking is available  from http//bankingcommission.independent.gov.uk/ 6 Highlevel  Expert  Group on Reforming  the Structure of the EU  Banking Sector Chaired by Erkki  Liikane n  FINAL fro m http//ec.europa.eu/internal_market/bank/docs/high level_expert_group/report_en.pdf. Brussels REPORT available October 2012 2 \\x0c . It is  true  that  the  banking  system  value  is  now  smaller  provided  this  term  is  positive  (i.e. more  performing  SMEs  than  the  nonperforming  ones)  but  it  is  also  true  that  the  system will  be healthier  in  the  face  of shocks  because  li and Pij in  expressions  (18) and  (19) will be free  from    and     will  depend on the  performances  of the  SMEs under  the  Fintech  financing.  There  are several  ways  of ringfencing  in  this  case. A direct  way is  to separate  the Fintech finance  sector completely  away  from  the  banking  system  so that  it  will  not  be affected  by whether  there  are any  bailins  or bailouts  of  the  Fintech  firms.  When  banks  are involved an approach  is  to separate  the  SME business  from  their  core business  which  is  less  risky. This  is similar  to the Volcker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Rule  for shadow banking  branches  of banks. This  however requires  very  clear  regulation  in  identifying  and  separating  the  risky  investments  with SMEs  from  other  bank  investments.  Otherwise  opaque  differences  will  make  actual implementation  of  ringfencing  difficult.  A  third  approach  is  to  allow  only  some  banks typically  smaller  ones to be involved  so that  these  banks are completely  ringfenced  from the  rest of the  banking  system.  In  times  of trouble  it  would  be up to the  regulatory  bodies to determine  if  bailins  or bailouts  for these  small  banks were appropriate.    Bernard  et al. (2017) proposes a model  that  determines  when  government  bailins  or bailouts (or threat  not to intervene)  are the best solutions.  Our model  can be adjusted to fit  their bailin/out  decisions.  In  any  case  the  regulatory  bodies  will  be dealing  with  only  a  subsector  of the  banking  system  rather  than  having  the  problem  contagious  across the  whole system.  Ringfencing  loses  its  effectiveness  however  when  many  banks  big  and  small join  Fintech  financing.  Hence  ultimately  clear  regulations  should  be set up as to the  kind \\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xadNjHhMTMkFkjTMkFkjhhA1111\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbdHhFihX1\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xabHhMTMkFkiFkiTMkFkihhhAx111\\xef\\x81\\xa1\\x0cof  SMEs  with  specified  types  and  levels  of  risk  that  could  be  funded  through  Fintech financing  so as to obtain  a high  positive  value  for   with  higher  probability.  This  will  however  restrict  the  original  characteristics  of  the  free entry  and innovation  of  Fintech.    We note  here  that  we do not  consider  the  role  of liquidity  in  our model  because  our  focus is  on  the  impacts  of  defaults  of  SMEs  on  the  Fintechbanking  system  rather  than  the liquidity  issues  of  the  banks.  Further  one  may  consider  the  situation  of  the  governme nt being  the  lender  of last  resort. This  could  easily  be incorporated  into  the model  in  terms  of enlarging  the  left  hand  side  of  expression  (12\\xe2\\x80\\x99)  such  that  liquidation  of  some  assets  does not have  to take place.   7.  Conclusion There  has  been  a  rapid  expansion  in  China  of  Fintech  firms  as  a  source  of  financ ing especially  for  SMEs  particularly  because  of  the  availability  of  big  data  making  asset evaluation  (particularly  regarding  credit  risk)  much  easier  and  faster  and because  of  easy entry/exit  into  the  market  which  traditional  banking  cannot  provide.  Much  of  this  is  not new and bears a strong  resemblance  to the U.S. private  label  mortgage  market  not too long ago. That  market  also  grew  quite  rapidly  before  exploding.    The  tools  used  in  the  U.S. then  particularly  the use  of technology  for  analysis  and pricing of  credit  risk  of  pools  of  loans  (automated  underwriting)  and  the  use  of  special  purpose vehicles  and the Repo market  for funding  are quite  similar  to tools being  used now in  China. An  issue  then  was overly  enthusiastic  application  of technology.  It is  clear  in  the  U.S. that loan  originators  and  sellers  as  well  as  borrowers  gamed  the  newly  evolved  automated underwriting  systems  by  exploiting  things  not  covered  in  the  models  and/or  by  outright \\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x83\\xa5\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xab\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x80\\xad\\xef\\x80\\xbd\\xef\\x83\\xb7\\xef\\x83\\xb8\\xef\\x83\\xb6\\xef\\x83\\xa7\\xef\\x83\\xa8\\xef\\x83\\xa6\\xef\\x80\\xadNjHhMTMkFkjTMkFkjhhA1111\\xef\\x81\\xa5\\x0clying  and cheating.  It is  also  clear  that  risk  was often  hidden  in  the  complicated  structures that  were used to fund  the  pools.    A  question  is  whether  China  is  headed  for  a  similar  experience.  These  are  reasonable worries  for  China.  Problems  with  how  those  structures  handled  shocks  and  fragility  are similar  to issues  about  corridors  in  networks  raised  above inside  of  which  adjustment  to shocks is stable  but  outside  of which  adjustment  is unstable.  We note though  that  in  China Fintech  and shadow banking  are still  quite  small  relative  to the size  of the Chinese  economy. There  do not  appear to be data that  can shed  light  on the  likelihood  of China  being  similar to the  U.S. and  we have  no insight  into  how  policymakers  might  react to  fragility  from Fintech.  The main  purpose of the paper is to look at how Fintech  financing  is linked  to the traditio na l banking  system  and to consider  how  to model  whether  Fintech  creates more  value  or risk to  society.  The  paper  suggests  a  general  network  model  that  can  be  flexibly  applied  to Fintech  financing  with  and without  involvement  of the banking  sector given  various  forms of interconnectedness.  We show  how  the expansion  of Fintech  financing  and its  extension to shadow  banking  can create contagion  to the  banking  sector when  many  borrowers  (e.g. SMEs) default.    We contribute  to  the  literature  by  providing  to the  best  of  our  knowledge  the  first  study that  models  Fintech  financing  using  network  models  and which  is  applied  to the  Chinese economy.  We  show  how  the  network  reacts  to  increases  in  Fintech  firms  and/or  banks involved  in  the  Fintechbank  partnership.  This  will  be  crucial  for  regulatory  bodies  to determine  policies  to  mitigate  increased  risks  and  yet  allow  financing  to  SMEs.  The network  models  can  also  be  applied  for  consideration  of  bailins  and  bailouts  of  the banking/financial  system  due  to  Fintech.  Finally  we  suggest  ringfencing  as  a  way  to isolate  Fintech  financing  from  the rest of the banking  business  so that  failure  in the Fintech finance  need not  be contagious  to the rest of  the system  particularly  as sophisticated  tools for  capital  and risk  management  are not currently  available.    \\x0c   \\x0cReferences Accenture  (2016).
