A longitudinal study of SME growth facilitation     Annabeth Aagaard & Martin Senderowitz    Abstract  The objective of this paper is to obtain applicationoriented knowledge of what   creates growth in small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs). The paper aims at   identifying and describing key internal business processes that contribute to growth   through a longitudinal study of eleven SME case companies located in a lowgrowth   region. The findings of the study reveal six key growthfacilitating themes that are   critical when actively supporting firm growth in a lowgrowth region.    Key words  Growth factors  small and medium size enterprises (SME’s)  longitudinal multiple   case study    1. Introduction  In recent years  a large number of studies of smallfirm growth have been performed   and reviewed (Delmar  1997; Wiklund and Shepherd  2003; SadlerSmith et al.  2003;   Davidsson et al.  2010; Love and Roper  2014). Although the topic of smallfirm growth   has received quite extensive attention  several reviewers deliver with relatively critical   accounts. The criticism concerns both theoretical and methodological shortcomings   (Storey 1994; Gilbert  et al.  2006; Davidsson et al.  2010; McKelvie and Wiklund  2010;   Wright and Stigliani  2013). In spite of the longitudinal and process nature of the   concept of »growth«  many growth studies are crosssectional. In growth and entrepre  neurship research  there is a general wish for more longitudinal »real time« research   (Davidsson et al.  2010; Wright and Stigliani  2013). As described in the theory section   below  a large number of firm growth factors exist (Gilbert et al.  2006; Davidsson et   al.  2010). These growth factors can both be internal/organisational factors and exter  nal market factors and they can act both as positive drivers of  growth  and  as nega  tive barriers or obstacles for growth.     21    Extant growth and SME literature has extensively addressed how firms’ grow is   related to favourable external conditions and how firms do not grow due to unfavour  able market conditions (barriers) (Wright and Stigliani  2013). However  current em  pirical research on firm growth in adverse conditions is scarce  and knowledge of how   firms may grow (i.e. the mechanisms and drivers) in spite of generally unfavourable    external conditions is limited (Bamiatzi and Kirchmaier  2014). This explorative study   investigates key drivers of growth for SMEs in an external context characterised by   low growth and economic recession. The study investigates how a number of Danish   SMEs have achieved high growth rates in spite of unfavourable external conditions.   These SMEs are facing the specific challenges of few highly specialised employees    low funding opportunities for SMEs  few large companies from which to attract larger   groups of employees  and educated/specialised citizens moving to highgrowth regions   with more possibilities. Growth in the context of lowgrowth regions is an unexplored   area within SME and growth research  and the findings presented here are relevant   and applicable for managers in SMEs as well as for policy makers and institutions   supporting growth and business development in lowgrowth regions. This paper pro  vides insight into the key facilitators of growth in Danish SMEs in a lowgrowth area.   The research question of this paper is  »How can SMEs in lowgrowth regions actively   support firm growth and which facilitating activities are applied?«    To answer this research question  we examined eleven Danish SMEs over a period   of 18 months within a specific region of Denmark characterised by low growth and a   less favourable socioeconomic situation compared to growth rates and the financial   situation in the rest of the country. In the next section of the paper  we discuss and   elaborate on the theoretical perspectives of firm growth and SMEs  including internal   and external growth factors. After the theoretical discussion  we present the methods   applied in the study. We then present the empirical findings  and we conclude with a   discussion of the results and the implications of the study.    2. Firm growth and growth facilitators  From the review of growth studies (Penrose  1959/95; Gilbert et al.  2006; Garnsey   et al.  2006; Davidsson et al.  2010; Senderovitz  2010; Wright and Stigliani  2013)  it   is clear that growth factors can make out a very long »laundry list« of factors that   may facilitate or hinder growth. Growth factors can roughly speaking be divided into   internal (within the firm) and external (environmental) factors  even if it may in some   instances be difficult to determine what is truly external and truly internal (Davidsson   et al.  2010). The industry development is usually seen as an external factor  whereas   in a Porterian world  industry affiliation is seen as a strategic choice made by the firm   (Porter  1980  1985). Similarly  opportunities may be viewed as external factors  i.e. fac  tors »out there« to be discovered  or as factors that the firm should create and develop   internally (Shane and Venkataraman  2000; Dew et al.  2009).    22    Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015How can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?    2.1 Internal growth factors facilitating or hindering growth  In her seminal work on firm growth  Penrose (1959/95) argues that firm resources play   a key role in achieving growth and competitive advantages. Limited resources mean   limited possibilities for growth. It is through the internal resources in general and   management resources in particular that the firm may develop unique entrepreneurial   (managerial) services which are  in turn  seen as a prerequisite to firm growth and to   achieving competitive advantage. According to Penrose  the internal resource use is a   key determinant of firm growth. Internal inducements to expansion arise from the ex  istence of currently unused productive services  resources and specialised knowledge   which  according to Penrose  are always to be found in any firm (Penrose 1959/95  p.   66). The issue of management capacity has been elaborated on and categorised by   Storey (1994) as management motivation  education  management experience  number   of founders and functional skills. A number of studies have investigated the relation  ship between growth aspirations and actual growth. These studies in general find that   managers with higher aspirations achieve higher actual growth. In this view  it is up   to the management of the firms to lay the foundations for growth (Wiklund and Shep  herd  2003; Delmar and Wiklund  2008; Stam and Wenneberg  2009).    2.2 External factors facilitating or hindering growth  External factors also influence growth. These factors include macroeconomic devel  opment  market conditions  environmental dynamism  access to external financial   capital  access to other external resources and network  and access to general human   capital (education level) and specific human capital (experience) (Wiklund and Shep  herd  2003). Growing ventures are highly dependent on the local environment for   resources needed for their operations  and the ability to acquire resources locally has   substantial implications for the levels of growth the firms will attain. The growth of   the individual firm is also influenced by the growth of the industry and the economic   and financial situation of the country and region as well as the industry dynamism   (Gilbert et al.  2006; Bamiatzi and Kirschmaier  2014). In general  firm growth appears   to correlate with the general macroeconomic and regional financial trends.     Summarising  from a theoretical perspective we argue that achieving growth may be a   matter of management capacity  growth aspiration  willingness and skills  but that fun  damental facilitators and obstacles in the environment play a key role for firm growth.    3. Methodology and empirical context  The objective of the paper is to obtain applicationoriented knowledge of what creates   growth in SMEs. To investigating this  we use an exploratory longitudinal multiple   case study design. This article is based on a research project conducted in collabora  tion with Danish Regions (Danske Regioner) with an aim to enhance SME growth in   a lowgrowth region. The research project falls in two phases. The first phase identi    23    fied growth processes in SME growth companies in the specific lowgrowth region   of South and Western Zealand in Denmark  where 38 randomly selected companies   were contacted. The case companies were selected based on their size  (private SMEs)     their location in or in close proximity to the region of South and Western Zealand  a   positive growth record during the past 3 years  and  finally  case companies were se  lected representing different industries. The fourth criterion was included because in  dustrial characteristics may affect growth potential. We contacted 38 case companies    expecting that approximately half of them would accept the invitation to participate   in an interview. Out of the 38 case companies  20 companies accepted to participate   in the project and through site visits and individual interviews with the CEOs and   other key personnel  we made extended company portraits of these 20 companies. The   data collected during the interview sessions were analysed using meaning categorisa  tion (Kvale and Brinkman  2009)  where similar statements from the interviews were   grouped within related themes  and six key growth themes were derived through an   abductive process (Danermark et al.  2002)  going »back and forth« between theory   and the empirical evidence (company portraits and data from the interviews).    These themes were explored further during the second phase of the project in which   11 out of the 20 firms were selected for further indepth longitudinal analyses (see   Figure 1). The eleven firms were selected based on relevance to the project objectives    variation across different industries (four production/retail  five service/knowledge   service and two building & construction)  and willingness and ability to participate in   the indepth studies.    We investigated the 11 firms over a period of 18 months  where management and   employee representatives were interviewed to explore the specific contents of the   identified growth themes and the actual growthfacilitating activities involved. The   data derived from the interview sessions were analysed through meaning–categorisa  tion  and the facilitating activities within each of the six growth themes are explained   in detail in the findings.     3.1 The empirical context  The firms in this study are located in the Southern and Western part of Zealand. The   four key growth and socialeconomic challenges of this region are related to low pro  ductivity in the region’s own businesses; globally oriented industries gradually mov  ing to other regions; difficulty attracting and retaining highly skilled employees; and   finally that innovation is concentrated on a few  but very innovative companies. In ad  dition  the region is challenged by the demographic development. If the projections of   the age composition hold  the reduction in the number of people in the working age   (as predicted by 2015) will significantly decrease the level of prosperity and growth in   the region (Copenhagen Economics  2005).    24    Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015How can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?    4. Findings   In the following section  we will describe the growth facilitating activities accord  ing to the six growth themes and the contexts in which the activities unfold for the   respective firms. Figure 1 shows the case companies with an indication of primary   and secondary growth themes as some growth themes were of higher priority in some   of the case companies. The identified growth themes include  1. Strategic thinking  2.   Selfmanaged teams  3. Management of public fundraising  4. Open source innovation    5. Middlesourcing and 6.

Existing research underlines that the SMEs’ approach to strategy is inherently differ  ent from that seen in large companies (Hofer and Charan  1984; SadlerSmith et al.    2003; Evald and Senderovitz  2013). The management in a small firm usually consists   of a single or very few individuals who then  naturally  have to carry out all manage  rial and strategic tasks and responsibilities. One of the important issues in terms of   strategic thinking is how to balance the tension between strategic planning and goal   setting for setting targets and giving the firm a clear sense of direction on the one   side  and to stay flexible and improvisational for being able to explore and exploit the   unexpected events and contingencies on the other side. Managing this balance may be   one of the most important factors influencing smaller firms’ growth and competitive   advantages (March  1991; Hitt et al.  2011).    How do SMEs work with strategic thinking in practice?  Ostebørsen’s ability to improvise and make quick iterative moves according to the   changes in food trends and customers’ taste has made them competitive and able   to achieve high growth rates. However  as the organisation is growing  the manage  ment feels that too many decisions are made going in various directions; and they   need to become more structured and have a more formal  clear strategy and work   in one  unified direction. The challenge is to plan ahead and remain flexible and   agile. In this process  the two owner managers have started mapping the individual   functional areas of the company including the related actions and each employee’s   required competences and responsibilities while leaving room and flexibility for   each team of employees to make their own independent decisions. They thereby   try to maintain a balance between improvisation and planning.    Growth facilitating theme 2  Selfmanaged teams  What does the establishment of selfmanaged teams imply?  Establishing selfmanaged teams means deliberately giving autonomy and formal   decisionmaking power to a team of employees without the classic direct supervision   of a line manager. By giving responsibility to small teams of employees and allowing   them to exercise a high level of selfmanagement  the team should – according to the   firms – carry out key decisions without management’s involvement and the firm thus   attain a higher level of flexibility and efficiency. The informants from all eleven case   companies indicated that they had been able to ensure higher growth through the ap  plication of selfmanaged teams in different functions of their organisations.     26    Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015How can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?    How do SMEs work with selfmanaged teams in practice?  GeoCenter Møns Klint applies selfmanaged teams in its development and innovation   function. In this function six people with very different skills (e.g. biology  geology  pro  ject management  financial management and creative skills) are put into play by their   collaboration on specific projects. The growth potential in the application of selfman  aged ad hoc based teams at GeoCenter Møns Klint lies in the benefits that come with   the small and flexible organisational way in which the eventoriented businesses of the   company are organised. This allows them to be more efficient  more flexible and have   fewer fixed costs than would be the case with a permanent development organisation.     Growth facilitating theme 3  Management of public fundraising  What does management of public fundraising imply?  SMEs’ ability to attract external funding for development projects  particularly from   the public sector  is a way to overcome the regional resource scarceness within the   private sector. Public funding can help the SMEs obtain growth by financing and sup  porting firmb ased development projects serving  e.g.  a cultural or a leisureoriented   purpose. Some of the companies have experienced declining sales in recent years;   however  with effective project management targeted towards public project funds  the   companies have been able to develop and grow strategically into other businesses and   industries. In order to obtain adequate public funds  it is important to duly prepare   project descriptions  which includes integrating »administrative« public procedures   and obtaining publicprivatecollaboration experience with new technologies; and it is   important to develop personal relations (local  regional  national) for project collabora  tion and fundraising.      How do SMEs manage public fundraising in practice?   Kragerup Gods has developed and created growth through an investment project   in an experience centre offering »Gohigh activity areas« and they have developed   an integrated course programme. Owing to a publically funded investment project    Kragerup Gods has been able to develop and attract new business and reach new tar  get groups  which has improved their competitive advantage and corporate branding   in comparison to other  traditional conference centres.    Growth facilitation theme 4  Open source innovation  What does working with open source innovation imply?   Open source innovation focuses on the interaction between producers and users of in  novation  and employeedriven innovation is focused on innovation initiated and facil  itated by staff. These two innovation approaches conceptualise companies’ processes   of interactive learning at the micro level (Lundvall  2009). Both research and practice   show that both a formal and an informal approach to these innovation processes may     27    be taken (Smith  Ulhoj & Kersting  2012). In the present cases  active and continuous   dialogue with customers to detect their needs is a key growthfacilitating activity that   generates new solutions. The customer is  indeed  the key driver of the innovation   processes  providing input for tailored services and products to suit the specific needs   of customers whenever possible. This approach gives smaller firms a potentially com  petitive advantage compared with larger companies with more formalised processes   that lend themselves less readily to such flexibility.    How do SMEs work with opening the innovation processes in practice?   Vilcon is experiencing a growth dilemma  the owner is a key driver of the business   innovation processes  but may become a bottleneck hampering the company’s contin  ued innovation and growth. The solution for Vilcon has been to create an open and   forthcoming culture  where ideas can come from anyone inside or outside the organi  sation; and once »matured« the ideas may be integrated quickly and efficiently owing   to the firm’s flat and teamoriented structure which promotes the implementation   of userproducer and employeedriven innovation. At Vilcon  customers’ needs and   requests and customers’ interaction with the employees often initiate ideas for new   products or services.    Growth facilitating theme 5  Middlesourcing  What does working with middlesourcing imply?  Middlesourcing occurs when similar production/operations are taking place simulta  neously in two (or more) different – but collaborating – companies. Middlesourcing   may be seen as an »alternative« to outsourcing  where the production of (part of)   a product is removed completely from the focal firm. In SMEs  outsourcing may be   counterproductive for various reasons; first  because transaction costs may be higher   than expected; second  because smaller firms may encounter difficulties dealing with   the management challenges of international outsourcing cooperations; and  finally    companies which have experienced ongoing improvements and efficiencies in a   Danish context  may find that this may not necessarily continue when production is   outsourced to foreign countries. To address these challenges of outsourcing  middle  sourcing is emerging as a viable alternative that achieves competitive advantage and   flexibility while minimising productionrelated risks and maintaining the potential for   continued improvement.     How do SMEs work with middlesourcing in practice?   The two companies FM Fintech and Hardi are in the same line of business and they   produce similar (albeit not identical) products. Originally  Hardi planned to outsource   their production completely to FM Fintech. However  the two firms decided to engage   in middlesourcing instead to stimulate the flexibility and the competitive advantages of   both companies. By applying middlesourcing  they assist each other in gaining access     28    Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015How can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?    to larger customers  and they both minimise their individual risks. They can enhance   flexibility and potentially exploit each other’s production capacity in peak situations   and enhance flexibility and reduce costs. For FM Fintech and Hardi  a positive side ef  fect is that the production and business stay in the local region (as opposed to outsourc  ing to other countries/regions)  which creates a local demand for skilled labour.     Growth facilitating theme 6  Local /regional relations based networks  What does working with local/regional relation based networks imply?  SMEs are highly dependent on local/regional relationbased networks in their pur  suit of growth and development. A key challenge of SMEs relates to the fact that   they have fewer internal knowledge resources because of the smaller number of their   employees. The local/regional relationbased networks do not only provide opportuni  ties for collective learning and knowledge development  they also provide access to   resources and potential collaboration. This creates a good foundation for innovation   and growth among the SMEs – both as individual organisations and as groups (Kee  ble & Wilkinson  1999). Characteristic of success in these types of networks is a high   level of mutual trust and interest among the networking partners  as the networks   are not based on formal contractual relations. However  a regulative factor is proxim  ity  as ‘everybody knows everybody’ in local/regional communities. So if one network   partner does not deliver or live up to the expected level of cooperation  that partner   may be excluded. The incentive to be trustworthy as a network partner may therefore   be expected to be relatively high in these types of networks.    How do SMEs work with local /regional relationbased networks in practice?   Toftebo is actively networking with similar companies that otherwise could be seen   as direct competitors. Such cooperation with the »competitors« is based as much   on social relations as on business deals. In this network  solutions are created in a   mutual and flexible process that does not rely on formal agreements or contracts. This   network helps Toftebo gain competitive advantages  flexibility and access to more and   larger assignments and contracts that they would otherwise be able to carry out them  selves. In Toftebo’s local region  demand is rather confined  and collaborating with   other similar  otherwise competing firms makes it possible to gain largerscale orders   outside the local area in with they normally operate.    In summary  the eleven case companies revealed that a logical and hierarchical or  der of the six growth factors exists. Fundamentally  the case companies all had clear   growth intentions and shared an interest in strategic thinking and worked diligently   on nurturing their strategic growth potential through various strategic initiatives.   This appeared to be a prerequisite for their success and growth. The lack of resources   in these small firms was accommodated by organisational designs focusing on self  managed teams. By allowing the employees room to explore and to take on responsi    29    bilities  the case companies gained access to more knowledge and innovation potential   from their dedicated employees.     The strategic thinking combined with the selfmanaged organisation of employees   was supported in particular by three key activities  open source innovation  middle  sourcing and fundraising. Open source innovation was applied by all the case eleven   case companies in various ways and resort to selfmanaged teams  allowed the firms   to ‘think outside the box’ and to open up the development and innovation potential.   Middlesourcing was applied as a way to ensure flexibility  primarily by the produc  tion companies. Furthermore  fundraising was applied to gain access to resources for   new development activities  yet primarily by the service companies. However  all three   activities were undertaken in an attempt to gain flexibility (either financial  innova  tion/resourcewise and/or to achieve production flexibility) and as a way to navigate   effectively as a local/regional SME in a lowgrowth region in a postfiscal crisis time.   Finally  the case companies’ local and regional based networks contributed to all the   other five growth facilitators by providing knowledge  collaboration  innovation and   by facilitating joint growth; hence  the networks were therefore used extensively   by all eleven case companies. Figure 2 below illustrates the logical order of the six   growthfacilitating themes.     5. Discussion  The study reveals that firms achieve growth by applying an interplay of internally and   externally oriented activities. The different characteristics of the eleven case compa  nies indicated variations in which growth facilitators were most optimal in supporting   growth in the specific context  industry and situation of the case companies. In line   with contingency theory (Galbraith 2012; Van de Ven et al. 2013)  the practical implica  tions of the findings stress the need for SMEs to identify and develop their unique set   of combinations of growth facilitating activities in pursuit and support of growth  as   no one solution or specific set of growth facilitators fits everybody. However  a larger   comparative study would have to be carried out to be able to identify the correlations   between industry  company situation and growth facilitating activities.     Strategic thinking is a key element in ensuring growth in SMEs. Existing research has   stressed that strategy in SMEs is different from strategy in large organisations. How  ever  little is known about how SMEs actually apply strategic thinking  manage their   organisations on a daily basis and to which extent they use emergent and/or planned   actions. The findings of the present study revealed different combinations of actions   where the SMEs were combining their flexile emergent actions with more planned   activities to various degrees. These findings are not conclusive  and a large study of   strategic thinking among SMEs could provide  further knowledge  in  relations  to how   combination of  planned  and emergent  actions  or  combinations  hereof  generate      30    Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015Figure 2  The six growth facilitation activities    How can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?

The successful ap  plication of the autonomous teams and selfmanagement as growth facilitators implies    in practice  that SMEs invest in developing the employees’ professional skills to be able   to handle more and different assignments  including their ability to organise  plan and   communicate at many different levels. The new project economy may be an important   and neglected growth facilitator for SMEs. The study show that administrative capa  bilities and effective processes encompassing preparation of project descriptions that   include integration of public procedures  as well as the use of personal network (local    regional  national) for project collaboration and fundraising  are important for attract  ing new public funding.    It is a common theme in the public debate that wage competition (primarily in the   industry) from lowwage countries constitutes a serious challenge for maintaining and   expanding employment in Denmark. Conversely  the case companies have applied   middlesourcing activities to ensure a movement in the opposite direction – maintain  ing flexibility as well as production and jobs in Denmark. Middlesourcing as a business   strategy is perhaps one of the findings with the greatest growth potential. It is also a   phenomenon that is not (yet) wellidentified and included as part of the economic pol  icy efforts. The recommendation is therefore to consider this opportunity and to further   examine how middlesourcing may take place in a Danish lowgrowth regional context.     In regard to userproducer and employeedriven innovation  SMEs need to be aware of   the fact that the lack of process formalisation and involvement of external knowledge     31    (apart from that of the customers) may represent challenges. Knowledge sought pri  marily among a few company employees may represent a potential limitation to new   innovative solutions. If you ask the same people each time  then you are like to only get   the same response and approach. This finding stresses that extended interaction with   external partners is important to ensure innovative solutions and development. How  ever  the customer’s knowledge – or lack of knowledge – may potentially be a barrier   to radical innovation if companies focus too much on solving each customer’s here  andnow needs. As a business strategy  userproducer and employeedriven innovation   may demand the fewest resources for generating positive growth for businesses. The   findings of the present study support the existing research  suggesting that SMEs par  ticipating in networks enhance their competitive advantage and growth. Conversely    much of present research focuses on the professionalization and formalisation of the   networks. However  the cases presented here show that there is a wide selection of col  laborative networks that are informal  and the findings stress the need for companies   to nurture their local networks and harvest the growth potential even more. The infor  mal networks should not necessarily be changed into more formal ones  as it appears   that the level of informality may actually be the strength of the networks for the SMEs.     The six growthfacilitating themes were present in all the case companies. However    some of the case companies portrayed these growth themes to a much larger ex  tent than the others and some of the themes were critical to their ability to generate   growth. The growth themes and facilitating activities identified in the present paper   will hopefully inspire both theoretical and applied studies in the field of SME growth.    6. Conclusion  The findings provide demonstrate a chronology of growth facilitators  and the iden  tified six growth themes and related activities may serve as inspiration for SMEs.   A longitudinal study of eleven cases may be considered acceptable for preliminary   and exploratory conclusions; yet  no statistical generalisation can be made based on   the present study. The findings and contributions of this paper offer suggestions for   future research. Of particular interest would be to perform similar research across   different companies and industries to determine whether the present findings are ge  neric or industry/contextspecific. One could speculate whether the industrial context   would emphasize certain growth facilitators over others because of the similarities in   industrial context and characteristics. This study was performed in a regional context   of Denmark  and the findings may therefore also be influenced by regional/national   characteristics. Given the implications of the present study  a quantitative  compara  tive study of applied growth facilitators across different industries and different   regional/national contexts is called for to test the combinations and generalisability of   the six growth factors.    32    Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015How can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?
