Banks  the  leading  player  in  the  financial  system  use  their financial strength to make economies volatile due to excessive risk transfer and  money  creation.  To  stabilise  markets  Islamic  finance  offers  an alternative  model  of  a  financial  market  and  economy  with  its  Shariah concepts  and  adoption  of  Fintech  innovation  which  in  this  case  is crowdfunding.  Design/methodology/approach  This  paper  details  the  foundations  of  Islamic  finance  that  differentiate between conventional and Islamic crowdfunding. Secondly the viable and innovative  structures  of  crowdfunding  are  examined.  This  is  followed  by discussing the challenges of Islamic crowdfunding in the financial system.  Findings  We have proposed two different Islamic P2P models namely Mudh\\xc4\\x81rabah (equitybased)  and Mur\\xc4\\x81ba\\xe1\\xb8\\xa5ah  (salebased)  based  crowdfunding  models. Also  we  identified  several  challenges  in  Islamic  P2P  crowdfunding consisting  of  regulatory  issues  project  management  secondary  market fraud cases and Shariah issues.                                                              a Istanbul Sabahattin Zaim University Istanbul Turkey  b INCEIF The Global University of Islamic Finance Malaysia. c Corresponding author at Department of Islamic Economics and Finance Istanbul     Sabahattin Zaim University Istanbul Turkey.

Keywords   P2P lending Islamic crowdfunding Islamic Finance  Introduction  Islamic  finance  is  founded  on  Shariah concepts  of  justice  and  public interest. This creates its significant appeal and has driven its rapid growth especially after the events of the 2008 financial  crisis for which many are still  recovering.  In  spring  2009  Queen  Elizabeth  of  the  United  Kingdom raised the simple question \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy did no one see it coming?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and nobody at the Economics Department of the London School of Economics could give a satisfactory answer (Turner 2016). What the event does tell us is that the current  financial  activities  instruments  and  money  creation  can  have unpredictable and farreaching impacts on society.  The  debt  contract  plays  a vital  role in  financial activities  as  evidenced  by the industrial revolution in the midnineteenth century. However according to  Bank  of  England  in  2012  only  14%  of  bank  lending  went  to  the  real business sector and the other 79% went to mortgages and realestate loans and  the  remaining  7%  was  used  for  ordinary  consumer  credit.  Such practices  are  risky  but  despite  such  risks  banks  continue  to  be  the backbone  of  the  economy.  Perhaps  this  very  character  that  makes  them harmful is also what makes them valuable. One must remember that a debt contract  in  the  conventional  system  is  interestbased  meaning  that  it  does not  depend  on  the  value  of  the  underlying  asset.  It  also  means  that  it  can create  a  sudden  stop  in  economic  activity  and  result  in  depression  and  a deflationary debt overhang effect (Turner 2016).  Banks  have  evolved  from  household  savings  to  power  purchaser  by creating  credit  and  intangible  money.  It  has  expanded  its  reach  from households  to  businesses  by  making  all  transactions  through  the  banking system.  As  a  result  the  bank  has  a  significant  influence  on  economic activity  since  they  make  all  the  decisions  concerning  the  allocation  of financing.  This  enormous  influence  creates  an  unsuitable  relationship  to empower  real  economy  given  that  the  banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99  tendency  to  loan  to  sectors other than the real economy. 470The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3  \\x0cIslamic Crowdfunding Fundamentals Developments and Challenges This paper argues how the Islamic financial system supports a sustainable and  valid  real  economy  in  addition  to  adopting  current  innovation  and technology in the financial industry to achieve its mandate. With the rise of online  fundraising  platforms  Islamic  finance  has  embraced  peertopeer (P2P)  crowdfunding.  This  paper  explores  the  current  development viability  and  challenges  of  the  Islamic  version  of  P2P  crowdfunding  to embrace  the  financial  market  which  as  a  result  adds  value  to  the  real economy.  Foundation of Islamic Finance  Compared  to  the  conventional  financial  system  Islamic  finance  must comply  with  the  Shariah  principles  that  promote  competency  and sustainability.  It  also  has  to  comply  with  the  Shariah  rulings  to  avoid interest  (Rib\\xc4\\x81)  gambling  (Maysir)  uncertainty  (Gharar)  and  all  other prohibited matters (Haram). It promotes competency in the sense of having clear resources in the form of the Quran and Sunnah and sustainability as per the five higher objectives of the Shariah namely the protection of life religion intellect lineage and wealth.  In  Islamic  banks  the Rib\\xc4\\x81  on  a  conventional  loan  is  transformed  into  a return from financing as a consequence of risk sharing and the utilisation of profitandloss  (PLS)  between  Islamic  banks  and  their  business  partners. Thus  Islamic  modes  of  financing  that  take  the  form  of  debt  (like Mur\\xc4\\x81ba\\xe1\\xb8\\xa5ah Tawarruq Ij\\xc4\\x81rah etc.) equity (like Mu\\xe1\\xb8\\x8d\\xc4\\x81rabah Mush\\xc4\\x81rakah) and  service  financing  (like  Wak\\xc4\\x81lah Haw\\xc4\\x81lah Kaf\\xc4\\x81lah  etc.)  should support  real  economic  activities.  One  Islamic  banking  model  takes  the following form (Ismal 2013)    Where IPI stands for industrial production index that  is used as economic output FIN refers to total financing of Islamic banks whereas DEP is the variable of total deposit of Islamic banks. Lastly PLS is the profitsharing ratio  for  the  depositor  as  an  indicator  by  the  banks  to  control  their financing performance.  Ismal (2013) found that there are strong longrun relationships between IPI and  the  movement  of  DEP  FIN  and  PLS  which  means  that  Islamic banking financing channels do exist and support the real sector. Secondly there  appears  to  be  a  positive  response  from  the  findings  that  any The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3471  \\x0cBuerhan Saiti Muhammad Hamal Musito Ensari Y\\xc3\\x9cCEL innovation  in  financing  and  real  sector  activities  are  responded  to positively by the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 depositors which means Islamic banking business pay careful attention to the progress of the economic performance. Lastly this finding is a warning to regulators to consider PLS as a potential source of Islamic monetary policy since it relates closely to the other variables.  Conventional and Islamic Crowdfunding  New  business  requires  resources  to  succeed  and  one  of  the  most fundamental aspects is capital (Gompers and Lerner 2004).  Conventional bank  financing  is  becoming  more  and  more  difficult  due  to  stricy regulations and high collateral requirements. For that entrepreneurs try to find new sources of financing. In recent years crowdfunding has emerged as an original means for an entrepreneur to secure funds without having to look  for  venture  capital  or  other traditional  sources  of  venture investment (Mollick 2014).  Conventionally  the  four  forms  of  crowdfunding  are  rewardsbased crowdfunding  donationbased  crowdfunding  equity  crowdfunding  and debt crowdfunding. Table 1 defines the various types of crowdfunding.  Table 1 Definitions of the various types of crowdfunding  Source Ethiscrowd.com  Lending  via  crowdfunding  has  been  the  fastest  growing  mode  of  lending with  the  total  crowdfunding  market  of  22.2%  in  2012  rising  to  68.3%  in 2014  globally  (Massolutions  2015).  The  Shariah  accepts  the  first  three types  of  crowdfunding  (reward  donation  and  equitybased).  However conventional debt crowdfunding is not permissible in Islamic  because it is based  on  interest  (rib\\xc4\\x81).  Table  2  summaries  the  differences  between conventional and Islamic crowdfunding 472The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3  \\x0cIslamic Crowdfunding Fundamentals Developments and Challenges Table 2 The differences between conventional and Islamic crowdfunding Source Authors  In  response to this  prohibition  of  interest in  Islam  Islamic  finance comes up  with  Islamic  P2P  crowdfunding  based  on  Islamic  contracts  in  the transaction  not  only  to  avoid  interest  but  also  to  serve  as  an  alternative pathway  to  grow  the  real  economy.  The  statement  can  be  verified  by deriving the formulation of Islamic banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 functions (Ismal 2013)   Except  for  intermediaries  in  the  Islamic  P2P  crowdfunding  there  is  no need  for  a  deposit  account  as  well  as  financing  in  the  transaction.  The European  Banking  Authority  (EBA)  in  its  published  Opinion of the European Banking Authority on lendingbased crowdfunding  in  2015 pointed out that crowdfunding platforms seek to limit their role merely to that  of  an  intermediary  bringing  the  investor  and  business together.  Thus the econometric function can be shown as follows   This  new  function  depicts  that  the  industrial  production  index  is  equal  to the profitandloss sharing that happens in the transaction. Since there is no \\xe2\\x80\\x98holding\\xe2\\x80\\x99 of a fund that will be transacted into the business account every transaction  that  occurs  in  Islamic  P2P  crowdfunding  will  affect  the economic activity directly.  With  that  equation  it  proves  that  the  correlation  between  Islamic  P2P crowdfunding  and  economic  activity  is  strongly  positive.  However  the The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3473  \\x0cBuerhan Saiti Muhammad Hamal Musito Ensari Y\\xc3\\x9cCEL practices  of  this  financial  model  are  hard  to  find  since  crowdfunding  is very  challenging  and  requires  a  considerable  commitment  of  time  and resources especially in places where crowdfunding is a new phenomenon. Therefore  it  is  important  to  understand  the  development  viability  and challenges  of  crowdfunding  before  understanding  the  concept  of  Islamic P2P crowdfunding.  Development of Crowdfunding  Since  the  rise  of  Fintech  peertopeer  (P2P)  financing  has  become  a popular model in the financial service industry. It channels funds with the help  of  the  technology  that  can  create  a  decentralised  communication model in which both parties have the same capabilities and equal treatment for  the  service  given.  One  of  the  rising  stars  in  this  P2P  model  that  has successfully disrupted the current financial system is crowdfunding.  Schwienbacher and Larralde (2010) identify crowdfunding as an open call through an online platform for the provision of financial resources either in the form of donation or in exchange for several forms of reward or voting rights in order to support initiatives for specific purposes. There are various subtypes  in  the  crowdfunding  market  which  include  lending  equity  and mortgagebacked models as well as nonprofitable types such as charitable donations and rewards crowdfunding.  Regarding  market  development  the  total  volume  in  the  online  alternative finance  market  in  Europe  as  of  2015  reached  EUR  5.4  billion  up  from EUR  2.8  billion  in 2014  with an  annual  growth  rate of  92%  according  to the  Cambridge  Centre  for  Alternative  Finance  in  2015.  The  UK  remains the  largest  market  for  alternative  finance  within  Europe  providing  EUR 4.4 billion for 2015 followed by France at EUR 319 million (Zhang et al. 2014). Developing countries also have significant potential with the World Bank  report  in  2013  titled  Crowdfunding\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Potential for the Developing World estimating a crowdfunding market in the developing world valued at USD 96 billion by 2025.  In the Islamic financial system the Securities Commission Malaysia in its Islamic Fund and Wealth Management Blueprint awarded six P2P licences one  of  which  was  the  world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  first  licence  for  Shariahcompliant  P2P lending.  This  particular  licence  was  awarded  to  EthisKapital.com  and licenced  Islamic  P2P  crowdfunding  that  focused  on  funding  small 474The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3  \\x0cIslamic Crowdfunding Fundamentals Developments and Challenges businesses  and  realestate  development  projects.  The  growth  prospect  for Islamic  P2P  crowdfunding  is  vast  considering  the  relatively  small  market and massive demand for crowdfunding type of financing. As a comparison according  to  KapitalBoost.com  the  estimated  total  Islamic  crowdfunding in 2015 reached USD 30 million versus the total crowdfunding  market of SGD 34 billion.  1.  Viability of Islamic Finance in Crowdfunding  The rapid growth of this kind of Fintech extends beyond the innovative use of  technology.  Fintech  platforms  provide  the  customer  with  a  seamless experience  with  easy  accessibility  especially  in  crowdlending  sectors. There are four distinct advantages for P2P lending (Milne and Parboteeah 2016).  It  has  higher  returns  than  bank  deposits  for  lenders  with  low  fees easier  access  to  finance  borrowers  who  are  not  bankable;  it  offers  ethical and social perception and accessibility on a variety of devices with no time limitations. These attributes make a compelling case for Islamic finance to offer P2P lending products through Islamic P2P crowdfunding.  This disruption is also a chance for Islamic crowdfunding to answer to the public  as  an  economic  multiplier.  According  to  Cortese  (2011)  money spent  directly  to  business  as  opposed  to  a  traditional  banking  chain circulates locally rather than being leaked out of the community to coffers of  a  distant  headquarters.  As  Islamic  crowdfunding  influences  economic activity  directly  it  creates  an  economic  boost  which impacts  not  only  the entrepreneur but also the local economy.  Moreover  Islamic  crowdfunding  can  reach  a  wider  community  is  not limited  by  geography  and  is  a  crucial  enabler  to  support  and  mobilise wealth.  As  such  it  supports  community  participation  in  developing businesses.  With  this  concept  there  is  a  huge  potential  for  Islamic crowdfunding to offer unique value to the Muslim Ummah. As a reminder nine  out  of  the  ten  companions  of  the  Prophet  Muhammad  (PBUH)  who were guaranteed heaven were entrepreneurs.  2.  The Innovation of Islamic P2P Crowdfunding  With this potential Islamic finance needs to explore crowdfunding  further since it is mathematically proven to impact real sectors. Although there are many doubts in this sector as to whether crowdfunding is revenueintensive The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3475  \\x0cBuerhan Saiti Muhammad Hamal Musito Ensari Y\\xc3\\x9cCEL or  not  Islamic  finance  has  to  aggressively  penetrate  the  market  to  match the momentum (Cowen 2011).  Lendingbased  crowdfunding  is  treated  differently  in  this  case  since  it  is clear  that  Islam  prohibits  interest  at  all  cost.  With  Mu\\xe1\\xb8\\x8d\\xc4\\x81rabah (equitybased)  and Mur\\xc4\\x81ba\\xe1\\xb8\\xa5ah (salebased)  based  crowdfunding  models  Islamic finance  is  responding  to  that  in  the  two  most  prominent  Islamic crowdfunding  platforms  namely  Kapitalboost.com  and  Ethiscrowd.com. Both companies will screen every project and give a risk rating as well as the expected return for each investment activity. Based on the principle of Mu\\xe1\\xb8\\x8d\\xc4\\x81rabah  all  capital  is  unguaranteed  and  in  the  case  of  default  all  the materials in the business will be liquidated and returned to the investor.    Figure 1 Partnership through Mu\\xe1\\xb8\\x8d\\xc4\\x81rabah  On  the  other  hand  in Mur\\xc4\\x81ba\\xe1\\xb8\\xa5ah crowdfunding  capital  from  the  crowd will  be  collected  as  the  fund  to  buy  all  assets  necessary  to  establish  the campaigner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  business  and  sell  it  to  campaigners  with  the  costplus methodology. This methodology is a safer way to become involved in P2P lending  yet  there  will  be  no  interest  involved  and  it  complies  with  all Shariah requirements. With this concept there will be real profitandloss sharing within the business since all of the parties bear the risk.  476The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3  \\x0cIslamic Crowdfunding Fundamentals Developments and Challenges Figure 2 P2P Lending through Mur\\xc4\\x81ba\\xe1\\xb8\\xa5ah  Although the risk exposure in Islamic crowdfunding tends to be higher the demand  to  participate  in  this  kind  of  investment  is  surprisingly  high. According  to  the  Ethiscrowd\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  website  total  investors  already  reached 17000 private investors within two years who invest mainly in affordable housing  commercial  projects  commercial  property  and  ecohousing  in emerging  Asia.  As  for  Kapitalboost.com investment segmentation  is  for  SME  business  and  private  crowdfunding  where  it provides a lot of job creation across all economic sectors.  their  central 3.  Challenges of Islamic P2P Crowdfunding  There are several challenges in Islamic P2P crowdfunding as illustrated in Figure 3 such as regulatory issues project management secondary market fraud case and Shariah issues. In this section we elaborate on these issues and challenges.  The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3477 \\x0cBuerhan Saiti Muhammad Hamal Musito Ensari Y\\xc3\\x9cCEL  Figure 3 Challenge of Islamic P2P Crowdfunding  4.  Regulatory Issues   Of  all  the  issues  raised  by  crowdfunding  regulatory  issues  are  the  most challenging.  The  US  Securities  and  Exchange  Commission  (SEC)  has established  regulatory  principles  on  crowdfunding  which  cover  four  main points;  crowdfund  limit  investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  financial  background  intermediaries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 role  investment  eligibility.  Meanwhile  in  developing  countries  like Indonesia however the regulation on crowdfunding or Fintech appears to be stricter where ten points are proposed in its Financial Service Authority Regulation 2016 No.77. Malaysia has  regulated the Islamic crowdfunding in  the Guidelines on Recognised Markets  by  Securities  Commission  (SC) where it states that all the Islamic financial service must comply with IFSA 2013.  Looking  at  the  regulation  Islamic  crowdfunding  has  its  potential  and challenges  in  its  various  conditions.  For  example  the Financial Service Authority Regulation 2016 No.77 mentions  risk  mitigation  is  required  in the credit risk where the crowdfunding operator shall take credit insurance or  credit  guarantee.  Since  Islamic  crowdfunding  uses  the  Mu\\xe1\\xb8\\x8d\\xc4\\x81arabah 478The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3  \\x0cIslamic Crowdfunding Fundamentals Developments and Challenges model  it  is  a  big  question  as  to  how  the  model  can  guarantee  the  profit returned to comply with the law.  Also  in  Malaysia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Guidelines on Recognised Markets  the  SC  regulates the  fundraiser  as  well  as  fundraising  limit  in  P2P  crowdfunding  business. This  guideline  creates  an  underlying  perception  that  P2P  crowdfunding should  not  overlap  the  existing  banking  business.  Therefore  rather  than becoming a solution to support real economic development this regulation holds back the P2P business to contribute more to society.  5.  Shariah Issues  The  business  activity  is  the  first  concern  in Shariahbased crowdfunding. Some  of  the  businesses  proposed  in  the  current  crowdfunding  are  not Shariahcompliant  such  as  liquor  businesses  found  on  Indiegogo.com. Thus there is a need for Shariah screening of crowdfunding campaigns to comply with the Shariah.  In  lendingbased  crowdfunding  the  primary  challenge  for  Islamic crowdfunding  is  replacing  the  interest  rate  and  guaranteed  capital.  Since this  type  of  crowdfunding  is  the leading  practice  in  the  market  where  the Massolution report in 2015 stated that it holds USD 25.1 billion over a total of USD 34.44 billion Islamic crowdfunding should be concerned with this particular type of funding. One solution  practised by Ethiscrowd.com and Kapitalboost.com the Mu\\xe1\\xb8\\x8d\\xc4\\x81arabah  and  Murabaha  models.  However  since  the  capital  is  not guaranteed there can be huge differences of perception in the market.  interestbased  model  with is  changing the 6.  Project Assessment  For  project  assessment  Islamic  crowdfunding  mainly  uses  the  banking concept of financing. The business should involve an underlying asset that is  publicly  known  and  market  suitable  such  as  clothes  trading.  This  is established in Ethiscrowd.com where it  involves more significant projects like property business. Thus it is still a challenge for Islamic crowdfunding to  select  an  innovative  and  out  of  the  box  project  like  Oculus  Rift  which has  raised  ten  times  more  than  its  USD  250000  which  was  funded  on Kickstarter.com in 2012.   The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3479 \\x0cBuerhan Saiti Muhammad Hamal Musito Ensari Y\\xc3\\x9cCEL Nevertheless some onlinebased credit assessments have been established to complete the demand of rating agencies in the crowdfunding campaigns such as CreditMonk.com or modefinance.com. However the perception of investors of the business is still in the stage of \\xe2\\x80\\x98ability to pay\\xe2\\x80\\x99 not \\xe2\\x80\\x98intention to pay\\xe2\\x80\\x99. Therefore it is still  difficult for crowdfunding entities to create  a trustbased transaction in its platform.  7.  Fraud Cases in Crowdfunding  One  of  the  most  notable  issues  in  crowdfunding  is  scams.  Because crowdfunding  is  built  on  trust  it  is  challenging  to  maintain  trust  in  the event  of  fraud.  The  most  wellknown  example  of  crowdfunding  fraud occurred in the US where an oil and gas company named Ascenergy raised USD  5  million  from  crowdfunding  platforms.  About  USD  1.2  million  of that  was  spent  by  the  founders  on  nonbusiness  materials  as  well  as payments  to  other  companies.  In  late  2015  SEC  froze  the  assets  of  the company for fraud.  Another  example  in  August  2016  which  revealed  that  Skully  a  San Francisco  startup  designed  a  motorcycle  helmet  using  augmented  reality and used fraudulent bookkeeping practices designed to trick investors. The startup had raised USD 2.5 million from Indiegogo.com and an additional USD  11  million  in  a  succeeding  round  of  venture  financing.  It  is  alleged the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s founders used the funds to cover personal expenses and it has since filed for bankruptcy.  These situations reveal the natural risk for investors of startup companies that do not demonstrate the same operational controls as an established and more tightlyregulated organisation. Many \\xe2\\x80\\x98campaigns\\xe2\\x80\\x99 websites are being established  for  unveiling  scams  in  crowdfunding  and  related  online financial  markets  such  as  Kickscammed.com  Facebook\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  GoFraudMe pages  and  AndroidPolice.com.  However  since  the  Shariah  is  all  about prevention  rather  than  treatment  it  emphasises  the  significance  of  robust due  diligence  in  the  fundraising  process  as  well  as  the  need  for  risk management controls and assurance.  8.  Need for Secondary Market  Since  the  crowdfunding  platforms  launched  the  need  for  a  secondary market to trade as liquidity management was recognised as being essential. 480The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3  \\x0cIslamic Crowdfunding Fundamentals Developments and Challenges However currently there is no fully functioning and competent secondary market leaving crowdfunding investors with no options to trade their shares or  credit  line.  This  condition  will  result  in  a  detested  state  of  play  for investors who do not like their money to be tied up for the longterm.  According to Crowdfunding Hub (2016) there are currently two scenarios on  how  this  secondary  market  can  be  developed.  Either  the  leading platforms  will  establish  an  internal  market  to  trade  liquidity  from campaigns  on  their  platform  or  specific  secondary  markets  will  be launched.  However  due  to  strict  regulations  these  initiatives  will  most probably be created or backed by existing stock exchanges. If the existing stock exchanges successfully create the secondary market; Islamic finance may  be  at  a  disadvantage  since  compliance  with  the  current  secondary market  is  already  an  issue.  In  the  near  term  it  is likely  that these  models will  coexist  where  it  will  create  fragmentation  within  the  industry  and continuing difficulties for investors seeking to trade their assets.  Conclusions and Recommendations  Islamic finance has the capacity to face the unpredictable impact of current financial  activities  on  the  economy.  With  the  help  of  technology  Islamic finance  can  compete  for  necktoneck  with  the  conventional  system. Crowdfunding can be one of the main game changers in this industry since it  has  disrupted  the  financial  systems.  By  introducing  Islamic  P2P crowdfunding  Islamic finance can  promote the real value of the Maqasid Shariah  in  the  current  financial  market  by  promoting  a  real  impact sustainability and competency in the real economy.  Islamic  crowdfunding  also  faces  many  challenges  to  compete  with  the current crowdfunding system since the regulators are more concerned with the  majority  of  industry  players.  For  example  Malaysia  regulates crowdfunding  business  as  a  secondclass  player  in  the  market  by  limiting the funds raised and the fundraiser. Therefore it is recommended to have regulation  supporting  both  banking  and  crowdfunding  players  and combining the expertise in technology and financing business.  Furthermore  one  of  the  strengths  of  Islamic  financial  institutions  is  the presence  of  Shariah  members.  This  strength  impacted  the  public  greatly since  all  solutions  are  derived  from Shariah  principles.  With the  presence of Shariah  members  in  Islamic  crowdfunding  it  can  make  their  platform The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3481  \\x0cBuerhan Saiti Muhammad Hamal Musito Ensari Y\\xc3\\x9cCEL from investors to  Fintech  business more  interactive  with  distinguishable  engaging  interactions.  For  example engaging the Shariah department staff to give realtime feedback on issues that arise within a transaction or give realtime Shariah screening on each business offered. Thus one of the strengths of Islamic finance is its Shariah workforce which can be utilised effectively in Islamic crowdfunding.  To  protect fraudulent  crowdfunding  campaigns crowdfunding  institutions  should  carefully  screen  the  business  offered  in its  webpage.  Regulators  can  introduce  regulations  for  crowdfunding  to make  periodic  checks  on  the  campaigns  offered  to  the  public.  Other  than that the crowdfunding entity can create a stricter application or use unique credit  scoring  available to  prevent  scams. Crowdfunding  can  also  create  an  open  discussion  on  the  platform  for  the investor  as  well  as  the  entrepreneur  to  produce  a  transparent  system  of investment.  Crowdfunding  players  could  also  create  a  secondary  market  as  an  exit strategy  in  the  business.  Regulators  could  create  an  online  platform  as  a secondary  market  for  crowdfunding  investors.  This  could  include  two sections  which  are  equitybased  and  debtbased  crowdfunding.  In  this platform the crowdfund holders could market and trade their assets. Due to transparency in the crowdfunding instrument speculative activities can be minimised  in  this  particular  market  since  all  trading  depends  on  business activities that occur in the real world.                 482The Islamic Quarterly Vol 62 No. 3  \\x0cIslamic Crowdfunding Fundamentals Developments and Challenges References                                                             \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Bank  of  England.  2012.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStatistical  Interactive  Database\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Interactive Database.
