There are a variety of different sources for financing SMEs  internal   and  external.  The  insufficient  internal  resources  determine  the   European  SMEs  rely  heavily  on  access  to  external  finance  in  order  to   run  and particularly to expand  their businesses.    There  is  a  range  of  external  financing  products  available  to  SMEs   which  include  bank  loans   overdrafts   leasing   factoring   venture   capital  business angels etc. In the last years  factoring has gained   more  and  more  importance  taking  into  consideration  its  main   advantages.  Thus   factoring  offers  more  than  simply  finance   through   matching  finance  with  professional  credit  management  services   and  in   some cases credit protection  factoring stands out as unique from the   other competing sources of external finance.   Being  a  simple  financing  technique   based  on  invoices   not  being   necessary  the  collaterals   with  the  immediate  payment   the  SMEs  can   use factoring in order to improve their cashflow  without increasing   the  debt  level.  Besides   in  the  condition  of  financial  crisis   the   restrictive  conditions  imposed  by  the  banks  and  the  low  level  of   liquidities  on  the  market  makes  the  factoring  an  important  financing   alternative for the SMEs.      Keywords  financing  factoring  advantages  limits  SMEs  Romania      JEL Classification  G32  L25  M13    Introduction      SMEs  are  vital  in  promoting  economic  growth   competitiveness    entrepreneurship  and  innovation   and  in  creating  new  jobs.  Ensuring   adequate  access  to  finance  so  that  SMEs  can  grow  and  develop  their   full potential is central to achieving the objectives of the renewed   Lisbon partnership for growth and jobs.      Most of the European SMEs consider access to finance as a barrier to   growth.  The  problem  is  strongly  exacerbated  by  the  financial  and   economic  crisis  as  SMEs  and  entrepreneurs  have  suffered  a  double   shock   a  drastic  drop  in  demand  for  goods  and  services  and  a   tightening  in  credit  terms   which  are  severely  affecting  their  cash   flows.      The  suitable  financing  source  remains  an  obstacle  especially  for  the   growth of innovative SMEs  a problem known as the “SME financing gap”   (OECD   2006).  There  are  significant  numbers  of  SMEs  that  could  use   funds  productively  if  they  were  available   but  cannot  obtain  finance   from the formal financial system because the lack of track record and   collateral against which to raise debt finance.         MIBES 2010 – Oral        13           Vasilescu  13  23     Addressing  the  "financing  gap"  is  increasingly  important  in  the   context  of  a  knowledgebased  economy  in  which  innovative  SMEs  with   high  growth  potential  are  key  in  raising  productivity  and  in   maintaining  competitiveness.  One  of  possible  solutions  is  using  the   financing  alternatives  (such  as  leasing   factoring   trade  credit)  to   cover the SMES’ financing gap.       The studies revealed the fact that the use of trade credit (Van Horen    2004)  and  the  potential  for  factoring  services  (DemirgucKunt  and   Maksimovic  2002) is higher in countries with greater barriers to SME   financing  particularly during periods of financial distress.       Factoring is used in both developed and developing countries. Although   absolute  factoring  turnover  (and  relative  to  GDP)  is  smaller  in   emerging  markets  than  in  developed  countries  factoring  might  play  a   relatively  more  important  role  for  SMEs  and  new  firms  in  emerging   markets that often have difficulty to access bank financing.       Clearly   stimulating  a  competitive  financing  environment  for  all   companies  is  an  essential  element  in  promoting  an  entrepreneurial   economy and strengthening economic growth.    2. External financing sources for SMEs      Financing  is  necessary  to  help  SMEs  set  up  and  expand  their   operations   develop  new  products   and  invest  in  new  staff  or   production facilities.       There  are  a  variety  of  different  sources  of  finance  for  SMEs.  A   distinction  can  be  made  between  internal  and  external  financing   sources.       While  many  SMEs  are  reliant  upon  internal  sources  of  financing    including  cashflow   to  fund  investment  in  their  development  and   growth  particularly at the startup and early growth stage  they will   necessarily  have  to  consider  external  financing  sources  as  they   progress through the development phases of the SME lifecycle.      The external financing sources can be differentiated in       informal  financing  sources  (for  example  money  raised  externally   through  the  socalled  three  F's  –  “friends   families  and  fools”   and/or through Business Angel investment)        formal sources of external financing that include    o  traditional  debt  finance  in  the  form  of  loans  from  bank  and  other   financial institutions  micro credits (loans of less than € 25 000)   leasing and hire purchase;    o  other  external  financing  sources  include  risk  capital  (venture   capital   equity  financing  and  mezzanine  instruments)   which  may  be   appropriate for highgrowth firms  factoring and trade credit.         Often   SMEs  will  need  to  use  a  combination  of  financing  sources    depending  on  the  sector   and  the  stage  in  their  growth  and   development.  A  key  consideration  in  choosing  the  source  of  new   business finance will be to strike a balance between equity and debt   to ensure the funding structure suits the businesses needs.      Whilst marked differences occur between Member States  SMEs typically   rely  on  external  financing  for  more  than  50%  of  their  balance  sheet        MIBES 2010 – Oral        14           Vasilescu  13  23     value.  Traditionally   this  external  finance  has  predominantly   comprised bank loans and overdrafts (figure 1).      100    80  79    0    20    40    60    24    Banks  Leasing/Renting companies  Public institutions  Private investors  Private companies  Venture capital companies  Others  NA    11    7    12    4  2  2       Figure 1. Institutions used by SMEs for external financing EU15     Source  EOS Gallup Europe  SMEs Access to Finance  Flash                    Eurobarometer  174  Oct. 2005      Banks  take  a  dominant  position  regarding  external  loan  finance.  Bank   loans  are  used  for  financing  investments   working  capital  and  stock   financing. Bank lending may be secured or unsecured and will depend on   the credit rating of an SME.       The  second  largest  source  of  external  finance  is  leasing  and  hire   purchase.  Hire  purchase  or  leasing  represents  secured  financing     based on the existence of a tangible asset. By its nature the finance   is secured on the leased asset so it can provide an effective source   of  finance  to  a  SME.  Leasing  improves  cash  flow  and  it  is  easier  to   finance  than  purchases.  Before  extending  a  capital  equipment  loan    banks will usually want to see two to three years of financial records   –  which  most  new  companies  do  not  have.  Leasing  companies   on  the   other  hand   usually  require  only  six  months  to  a  year  of  credit   history before approving a car  furniture or office equipment lease.      Trade credit is an important way of financing stock inventory held by   SMEs.  By  using  trade  credit   SMEs  are  able  to  postpone  payments  for   goods and services purchased  which is useful in managing cash flow.      Venture  capital  is  provided  by  fulltime   professional  enterprises   (venture  capitalists)  or  private  persons  who  invest  both  capital  and   management  expertise  in  ambitious   fastgrowing  companies  with  the   potential to develop into significant businesses.      Factoring  is  a  financial  transaction  whereby  a  business  sells  its   accounts receivable (i.e.  invoices) at a discount. The factor usually   charges  the  seller  a  service  charge   which  is  interest  based    depending  on  how  long  the  factor  must  wait  to  receive  payments  from   the debtor.       Factoring differs from a bank loan in three main ways    − First  the emphasis is on the value of the receivables (essentially   a financial asset)  not the firm's credit worthiness.   −  Secondly   factoring  is  not  a  loan    it  is  the  purchase  of  a   financial asset (the receivable).   − Finally  a bank loan involves two parties whereas factoring involves   three.        MIBES 2010 – Oral        15           Vasilescu  13  23        Many SMEs confront problems when attempting to gain access to external   funding because of the difficulties faced by financial institutions in   producing  consistently  reliable  riskassessment  processes.  Particular   problems  for  firms  may  be  experienced  in  the  management  of  working   capital.  In  an  attempt  to  alleviate  such  problems  many  firms  have   considered alternative forms of finance – factoring  by pledging an   important  element  in  their  working  capital   that  of  accounts   receivable. The incidence of asset based finance – including factoring   –  has  been  increasing  rapidly  over  the  past  decade  and  factoring  is   specifically targeted and suitable for smaller businesses.      3. Factoring – financing alternative for SMES      3.1. Factoring  characteristics  types  evolutions      Factoring  is  an  alternative  route  to  the  other  external  financing   sources  available  for  SMEs  (banking  loans   leasing   venture  capital)   by which a business can increase its cash flow to fund expansions.       Factoring is a form of commercial finance whereby a business sells its   accounts receivable (in the form of invoices) at a discount.       Factoring  is  a  complex  financial  operation   which  supposes  the   participation of three parts  such as      the factor is the factoring company;     the customer  also called “adherent”;     the debtor.   The factoring involves the followings operations      the  existence  of  certain  receivables  (materialized  in  invoices)   which the supplier has to recover from his clients;     the  transfer/sale  of  these  receivables  to  a  commercial  bank  or  a   specialized financial institution;     services  provided  by  the  factor  in  exchange  of  a  fee   which  may   include  the  following  services   financing  invoices   transferred   receivables  management   recovering  debts  from  debtors  and  hedging   against the risk of accounts not being settled.     advice to clients on credit management  pursue late payers);        The factor has three main functions      financing (pay their clients for their invoices as they are issued);     provide  services  (collect  payment  from  their  customers   provide     protect the client against bad debts.       This  means  that  the  benefits  of  factoring  do  not  simply  include  an   immediate  cash  payment.  If  the  factor  provides  credit  management   services too  then there is also the prospect of an improvement in the   speed at which debts are collected  giving a further positive impact   on cashflow  and reduced interest charges.       There  are  different  types  of  factoring  products  on  the  market  which   can be classified from various criteria.       a.  Depending  on  method  of  collection  and  debt  management   there  are   the following types of factoring                   MIBES 2010 – Oral        16           Vasilescu  13  23            Partial Factoring – the invoices are selected  not all are accepted   for  buying;  the  obligation  to  cash  the  invoices  belongs  to  the   customer because the factor do not take their administration;     Total  Factoring  –  al  the  invoices  are  taken  by  the  customer  and   administrated by the factor. The factor will cash the invoices from   the debtor  finance the operation and cover the credit risk.      b. Depending on the moment of payment the debts by the factor  there   are following forms of factoring         Oldline  factoring  (classical  factoring)–  the  factor  pay  the   invoices in the moment he takes them;     Maturity factoring – the debts of customer are paid in the moment of   their maturity;     Mixt  factoring  –  the  factor  pay  a  part  of  the  invoices  value  as   advance (not less than 85% from their value)  the difference being   paid at a later date.         c.  Depending  on  the  participants  to  the  factoring  operation   there   are          Domestic factoring – at the basis of this operation there is not an   international  trade  contract   it  is  done  on  the  same  country  and   there is a single factor      International  factoring  –  suppose  the  existence  of  a  international   trade contract  in the operation will be two factors (the import and   the export one). The export factor buy the exporter debts.          d. Depending on the recourse weight of the bank on the adherent  there   are         Nonrecourse  factoring    offers  the  client  full  credit  management   service  cover  on  approved  debts  against  the  eventuality  of  the   factor being unable to secure full payment of factored invoices;     Recourse  factoring    involves  a  factor  taking  responsibility  for   their clients’ debt collections but retains the right to seek full   recourse  from  the  client  for  any  bad  debts.  The  client  may  buy   credit insurance separately but no cover is provided by the factor;     Invoice Discounting  this enables SMEs to borrow on the security of   invoices  addressed  to  customers.  Since  the  invoices  are  drawn  on   customers  which  may  be  larger   more  credit  worthy  organizations    this source of financing can be attractive to SMEs.        Two alternative  but related and similar products were also mentioned   as being used by some Member States (DG Enterprise  2003)        Discounted Bills of Exchange – is an unconditional order in writing   addressed by one person (the supplier) to another (the buyer). It is   signed by the person giving it (the supplier) requiring the person   to whom it is addressed (the buyer) to pay on demand (or perhaps at   a fixed or determinable future time) a sum of money to a specified   person.      Confirming    is  a  type  of  finance  where  a  financial  body  confirm   orders  placed  by  buyer  to  the  seller  –  i.e.  funding  the  purchase   ledger rather than the sales ledger. The financial body guarantees   payment to the seller whilst offering credit to the buyer.            MIBES 2010 – Oral        17           Vasilescu  13  23          2006     2007     2005     Neither  Bills  of  Exchange  nor  Confirming  are  substitutes  for   factoring.  In  the  case  of  the  former   it  is  simply  factoring  using   “bills”  rather  than  invoices  as  assets.  In  the  case  of  the  latter    Confirming is used for the financing purchases  rather than sales.      At  the  global  level  the  domestic  factoring  registered  an  increased   turnover  in  the  period  20042008   sign  that  these  operations  became   more  attractive  for  the  companies  and  for  the  financing  institutions   table nr.1).

On  structure   the  nonrecourse  factoring  represent  38%  from  the   domestic  factoring   followed  by  the  invoice  discounting  (32%)  and   recourse factoring (26%)in 2008.        The  international  factoring  increased  2.5  times  its  turnover  in  the   period 20042008 that demonstrates a major development of financing by   this  technique.  The  export  factoring  registered  a  fast  increase  and   represent 61% from the international factoring in comparison with 15%   registered by the import factoring.       Regarding  the  geographical  distribution  of  the  factoring  operations    the  FCI  (Factors  Chain  International)  reports  indicate  that  the  most   developed  factoring  market  is  in  Europe   holding  67%  of  the  world   volume. Following in the top there are AsiaPacific area with 20% and   the Americas with 12% in the world volume (figure 2).

In  the  actual  global  context   when  financial  crisis  drills  into  the   companies’  profits   the  main  risk  for  the  factoring  market  is  fund   costs’  raise  up  to  a  level  that  invoice  payers  may  consider   prohibitive.      3.2. Advantages and disadvantages of factoring       Using  of  factoring  offers  many  advantages  to  the  firms.  In  fact    factoring  offers  more  than  simply  finance.  Through  matching  finance   with professional credit management services  and in some cases credit   protection  factoring stands out as unique from these other competing   sources of external finance.      The advantages of factoring are the followings         the  possibility  to  obtain  financing  on  a  very  short  term   without   taking into consideration the debt level of the company and without   supplementary  guarantees.  Thus   factoring  companies  give  the  funds   on  the  day  the  invoice  is  handed   after  signing  the  factoring   agreement;    the improvement of the cashflow  because the period of getting the   cash shorter than for a credit;     unlike banking credits  the funds obtained by factoring should not   be  used  for  a  specific  destination   they  could  be  invested  in   function of the immediate needs of the client;    the number of documents that must be filled out in by the adherent   and presented to the factoring company is much smaller than it is in   the case of applying for a regular bank credit;    after analyse the documents  the factor can refuse the services only   in the case of existence of a shareholder relation between adherent   and debtor or in the case of conditioning the payment on sales;    through factoring  the companies benefit from the fact that they can   concentrate  on  the  development  of  the  business  by  expanding  the   production  and  sales   while  the  factor  deals  with  tracing  the   settlement of the account and the records of the debtors;     protection  against  the  risk  of  invoices  not  being  paid   which  is   taken over by the factor entirely; factoring can be a powerful tool   in providing financing to highrisk  informational opaque sellers;   (cid 31)protection  against  the  exchange  rate  fluctuation  risk   in  the  case   of international factoring;     factoring  can  provide  important  export  services  to  local  SMEs.   Factoring  companies  can  provide  exporters  with  credit  protection    working  capital  financing  and  collection  services.  These  pooled   services  might  also  allow  local  exporters  to  enter  new   riskier   markets.         There are also some disadvantages of the factoring for both the SMEs   and for the factoring company.       For  the  SMEs  the  main  disadvantage  is  the  high  costs  involved;  the   amounts  allocated  for  this  operation  could  be  used  by  the  SMEs  for   their business.       One solution to these barriers to factoring is the “Reverse Factoring”   which  allows  SMEs  to  receive  more  financing  at  lower  costs.  In  this        MIBES 2010 – Oral        19           Vasilescu  13  23     case   the  lender  purchases  accounts  receivables  only  from  specific   highquality  buyers  and  the  factor  only  needs  to  collect  credit   information and calculate the credit risk for selected buyers.       During  the  debt  collections   especially  if  there  is  delay  on  the   payments  the factoring company can have a tolerant attitude regarding   the debtors and this can lead to loss of customers on long term.       Factoring is a contract with some imposed conditions and there is not   too much place left for negotiations.       For the factoring company  it assume the risk of debtors insolvability   which can generate difficulties in recuperate the money. In the case   of classic factoring  the company should assume the credit risk  too.       Factoring relies less on collateral and is particularly attractive in   financial  systems  with  weak  commercial  laws  and  enforcement.  The  use   of factoring services is higher in countries with greater barriers to   SME financing  particularly during periods of financial distress.        Factoring  may  still  be  hampered  by  weak  contract  enforcement   institutions  and  other  tax   legal   and  regulatory  impediments.  For   example   factoring  generally  requires  good  historical  credit   information on all buyers; if unavailable  the factor takes on a large   credit risk.       Another  problem  in  the  factoring  industry  is  fraud  and  weak  legal   environments and nonelectronic business registries or credit bureaus   which  make  it  more  difficult  to  identify  these  problems.  An   alternative usually used in emerging markets is for the factor to buy   receivables  with  “recourse”   which  means  that  the  seller  is   accountable in the event that a buyer does not pay its invoice and the   seller of the receivables retains the credit risk. However  this may   not  successfully  reduce  the  factor’s  exposure  to  the  credit  risk  of   the seller’s customers  since in the case of a customer’s default  the   seller may not have sufficient capital reserves to repay the factor.     4. Romanian factoring market       The  opening  of  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  to  the  international   financial  and  credit  market  has  brought  factoring  operations  into   participants’ attention. Even the factoring market is still emerging    is  noticed  an  increase  in  the  interest  for  this  financing  source  in   many Central and East European countries.      But despite the numerous advantages of this financing alternative  the   Romanian firms did not use these products till 2001 when the factoring   turnover  registered  98  mil.  Euro  (FCI   2006).  Since  then   the   factoring  volume  registered  an  upward  trend  and  in  2008   the  total   volume  was  1 650  mil  Euro   from  which  domestic  factoring  represents   79%  and  the  international  factoring  21%  (table  nr.  2).  The  growth   rhythm  of  the  domestic  factoring  operations  increased  year  by  year    which  confirms  the  harmonization  of  the  Romanian  market  with  the   international market trend.      Despite the positive evolution  in the region  only Bulgaria is less   developed.  In  the  same  time   other  countries  such  as  Poland   Czech   Republic   Hungary  registered  a  better  situation  regarding  the   transaction volume.

In  fact   the  lack  of  the  banking  offer   represented a serious barrier against the factoring expansion. Also  a   proof of the use on a small scale of the financing mechanism through   factoring  is  also  the  gap  in  the  local  legislation.  But  in  the  last   years   the  fast  growth  rate  of  the  revenues  obtained  by  banks  from   factoring  operations  indicates  both  the  intensification  of  trade  and   the  firms’  need  for  liquidities   as  they  are  facing  an  ever  more   fierce competition.

The  domestic  factoring  in  our  country  is  a  product  addressing  the   Romanian  suppliers  of  goods  and  services  with  partners  within   Romania’s  territory  and  from  whom  payments  are  received  within  a   maximum  of  180  days  (the  situation  is  different  from  one  bank  to   another). The size of the cash advance is established according to the   documentation handed in  by observing the ceiling of maximum exposure   established for each debtor – a maximum of 80%90% of the gross value   of  the  factorized  receivables.  In  order  to  accept  the  debtors   the   bank’s  inspectors  will  analyse  the  creditworthiness  of  buyers   the   financialeconomic  situation   the  clearance  indices   as  well  as  the   nonfinancial aspects that characterize their activity (Duca  2009).        750     550        MIBES 2010 – Oral        21           Vasilescu  13  23     The new restrictive credit rules applied by the banks in the context   of  financial  crisis  and  the  low  level  of  liquidities  on  the  market   determined  many  SMEs  to  not  be  able  to  get  a  banking  credit   which   decrease  dramatically  their  possibilities  to  develop  and  even  their   chances to survival on the market. In these conditions  the factoring   can be a solution for the firms with a viable business plan but which   can not finance from their own resources.       The  main  disadvantage  of  factoring  for  Romanian  companies  is   represented by the high cost. The factoring firms have to consider the   risk and the commissions depending on the contract conditions.    The  cost  required  for  the  factoring  operations  is  formed  by  two   commissions (Moraru  2006)  such as      factoring  commission that applies to the nominal value of the paid   invoices and represents 0.51% for the domestic factoring services (in   national currency) and 1 2% for the export factoring ones (in foreign   currency). The commission for the export factoring services relies on   the  size  of  the  activity  that  will  develop  through  factoring   the   number of debtors and the number of traded invoices;     financing  commission  applies  to  the  financed  value   namely  to  the   8090% of the invoices countervalue  for the contract period. This is   comparable  with  the  interest  applied  to  short  term  credits  (in   national  or  foreign  currency)  and  it  is  negotiable  accordingly  with   each transaction.       The lack of liquidities on the market affects the factoring companies    too. Therefore  many of them have to reduce their clients’ portfolio   or  to  limit  to  the  permanent  clients.  Because  the  lack  of  financial   resources   some  of  the  Romanian  factoring  companies  focused  more  on   the debt recovery.       The factoring market in Romania has quite a high potential but still   remains at a reduced and undiversified level  with a small amount of   activity  and  an  insufficient  number  of  companies  offering  these   services  (10  companies  in  2008  accordingly  with  FCI)   mainly  due  to   the banking institutions’ lack of experience and tradition  the legal   provisions in the field and also the restrictive conditions regarding   the  access  to  this  form  of  financing  small  and  mediumsized   enterprises.    5. Conclusions      Factoring  is  a  complete  financial  package  that  combines  working   capital  financing   credit  risk  protection   accounts  receivable   bookkeeping and collection services.       Factoring  is  now  universally  accepted  as  vital  especially  to  the   financial  needs  of  small  and  mediumsized  businesses  and  startups.   Factoring  can  be  a  replacement  for  the  classical  banking  credit  and   the most important advantage is that it allows the firms to cash their   debts.  Thus   factoring  is  a  simple  financing  technique   based  on   invoices  without being necessary the collaterals.       Being  a  financing  source  with  the  immediate  payment   the  SMEs  can   improve their cashflow  without increasing the debt level. This means   that they can concentrate on their business development and take the   competitive advantage.            MIBES 2010 – Oral        22           Vasilescu  13  23     Even  in  the  case  of  a  startup   but  with  a  viable  business   with   growth  potential   can  beneficiate  on  this  financing  type  because  the   factoring company  takes the financing decision based on the viability   of  the  business  plan  of  the  client  not  only  the  financial  analysis.   Thus   if  the  firm  will  use  the  factoring   they  will  beneficiate  on   complete  services  of  debt  collection   consulting  and  juridical   assistance on the commercial contract  as well as the debt risks.       Although  factoring  companies  remain  highly  specialized  institutions    nearly  all  major  banks  now  have  factoring  subsidiaries.  This  has   enabled the industry to promote its services with great success and to   work for businesses of every size.      Factoring  has  become  well  established  in  developing  countries   in   particular  in  those  that  are  highly  industrialized.  In  various  Asian   countries   the  growth  of  factoring  has  been  dramatic  while  in  Latin   America  financial institutions continue to join the industry. Similar   growth  has  occurred  in  Central  Europe   the  Baltics  and  the  Middle   East.      At present  almost every industry can profit from factoring. Textiles   and clothing are the most popular but manufacturers of industrial and   farm  equipment   office  equipment   electronics  and  processed  food  are   increasingly turning to factoring.      The opportunities for the factoring industry increase accordingly with   the  trade  transactions.  There  is  plenty  of  evidence  to  suggest  that   fastgrowing  salesdriven  organizations  appreciate  the  improved  cash   flow  efficiency and profitability that factoring can offer.
