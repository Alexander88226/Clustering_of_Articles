INTRODUCTION     The management style that is emerged in the form of family business has been the driving force for   entrepreneurship  and  production  all  over  the  world.  Due  to  its  contribution  to  the  country's   economy  SME’s also have a significant share in Turkish economy. 90% of all registered companies   in  Turkey  and  94.1%  are  SME’s.  (Karpuzoglu   2004   43)  The  share  of  SMEs  in  all  registered   businesses  in  Turkey  is  99.9%   therefore  the  central  role  of  the  sector  in  the  economy  is  evident.   (Ari   2013)  According  to  the  Banking  Regulations  and  Supervision  Agency  (BRSA)  data   3 85   million of the 4.1 million enterprises in the definition of official  (sales of up to TL40 million and   up to 250 employees) are SME’s.      “SME’s in Turkey provide at least 75% of total GNP and 85% of employment. (DÜNDAR  2016)   However  despite the importance in Turkish economy  the number of family companies that reached   the fourth generation in Turkey is extremely low due to their problems  and the rate of reaching the   third family in Turkey is 10%. (www.bloomberght.com  2014) The average life span of companies   is 18 years in Germany and 9 years in France. In Turkey  80% of enterprises cannot reach 5th year    96% cannot reach 10th year. (www.capital.com.tr  2015)     It is possible to examine the advantages of SME’s under two headings below (Bilgin  2007  912;   Karpuzoğlu  2001  2224)            277     Social Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume  3          Issue 11         pp 277287   Financial Advantage  The financial resources required in SME’s are usually provided by the family   members. Equity is an important part of the company's capital for the SME’s  and the way to solve   financial  problems  in  the  family  gives  a  stronger  position  against  the  company's  competitors.   Besides   when  financial  problems  are  encountered   SME’s  can  reveal  their  resources  more   sacrificially in order to solve the problem. Because of the survival of the business  they can easily   give  up  both  family’s  and  entrepreneurial  assets.  SME’s  operates  in  the  countries  that  has  a  less   developed capital market is attempts to solve financial problems by inhouse sources.      Managerial Advantage  SME’s have an advantage in that they can make financial decisions faster   by  using  their  own  resources  and  fast  processes.  The  founder  of  the  company  may  take  a  more   active  role  in  decision  making  during  the  implementation  phase   as  there  are  not  too  many   bureaucratic  obstacles  in  the  company.  Regarding  the  family  members  are  also  employees  at  the   same time the company generates much more synergy than the other competitors. An entrepreneur   controlling  a  large  portion  of  the  business  can  decide  faster  in  technical   administrative  and   investment  matters as the family member works  with  the professionals.  Since SME’s do not  have   bureaucracy in their bodies  they do not experience any delay in taking decisions. Since SME’s are   futuretargeted organizations  they concentrate on the existence of capital and a strong structure that   will be left to next generations.     The two major advantages mentioned above may also turn into disadvantages of SME’s at the same   time.  SME’s  are  encountered  with  major  challenges  such  as   technical  knowledge    institutionalization and financing during the growth process. In the SME’s hiring and working with   professionals  can  be  problematic  and  expensive  as  well.  In  time   entrepreneur’s  exception  of  the   company as a child  makes the company dependent to him however this kind of attitude also makes   him dependent to the company.     The aim of this study is  to  make a system suggestion as solution  for institutionalization  financial   management and access to technical information  which are identified as the biggest problems in the   development process of the SME’s.       2. IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF SME’S     Huge  Amount  of  Small  and  Medium  Sized  Enterprises  consists  of  Familyowned  businesses  and   these  firms  are  very  important  parameter  in  order  to  understand  economic  situation.  SMEs  have   important  responsibilities  which  accelerate  social  development   economic  growth  and  decrease   unemployment.  These activities can be succeed via progressive SMEs which are capable of making   well financial decision.     In order to make financial decision properly  firms need to possess financial information in terms of   financial  statements   cash  flow   capital  expenditures  and  cost  report.  Right  information  can  be   provided  via  effective  financial  management  and  consensus.  Todays   Small  and  Medium  Sized   Enterprises suffer from absence of information or wrong information about financial activities. For   this reason  wrong financial decision occurs and this lead to risk for firms.      Especially   familyowned  businesses  face  a  dilemma  owing  to  lack  of  definite  financial  planning.   Small and Medium Sized Enterprises which play an essential role on country’s economy need to be   managed  financially.  Otherwise   firms  will  not  work  effectively  and  this  situation  will  affect   country’s  economy  negatively.  Therefore   small  and  medium  businesses  should  work  efficiently   and have efficient financial structure.     Familyowned businesses prevent SMEs from improving their perception and result in dilemma for   firm.  Long and short range plans  debt management  management of receivable  financial forecast   and similar important financial activities become complicated tasks due to dilemma.     Furthermore  members of familyowned business do not tend to investigate financial data and news.   It is obvious that financial data and news are very important components for management of Daily     http //www.ssdjournal.org     Social Science Development Journal     ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com          278     Social Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume  3          Issue 11         pp 277287   financial  activities  and  risk  management.  Change  of  currency   interest  rate  and  macroeconomic   indicators  should  be  followed  for  financial  decision  and  risk  management.  This  situation   emphasizes importance of Financial Literacy.     Nowadays  success of SME’s performance are measured via use of Information Technologies  use   of  source.  Effective  use  of  source  can  be  possible  thanks  to  efficient  use  of  Information   Technologies. In free market economy  use of Information Technology has become requirement  at   any sectors.     3. DEFINITION  FEATURES AND THE PROBLEMS OF SME’S IN TURKEY     SME’s are those in  which multiple members of the same family are involved as major owners or   managers   either  contemporaneously  or  over  time.  (Miller   LeBreton  Miller   Lester   Canella    2007) According  to  other  definition  SME’s  are  those  in  which  the  family  controls  the  business   through  involvement  in  ownership  and  management  positions.  Family  involvement  in  ownership   (FIO) and family involvement in management (FIM) is measured as the percentage of equity held   by family members and the percentage of a firm’s managers who are also family members (Sciascia   and Mazzola  2008) Despite the different definitions of family business there is not a significant and   unique measure of the size and the impact in economies all over the World. In turkey  94.1% of are   SME’s and therefore  we can take  the official SME definition at  the same time for calculating the   size and impact of this type of entrepreneurships in Turkish economy.     In accordance with the relevant legislation  SME is defined as an enterprise that employs less than   250  employees  per  year  and  either  its  annual  net  sales  revenue  or  balance  sheet  value  does  not   exceed  40  million  Turkish  Liras.  However   in  this  press  release   enterprises  with  less  than  250   employees hired without any criteria for financial size (annual net sales or balance sheet value) are   defined as SMEs. The press release includes statistics such as the number of enterprises  number of   persons employed  turnover  foreign trade and technology usage in the SMEs. Small and Medium  Sized Enterprises (SMEs) constituted 99.8% of total number of enterprises  73.5% of employment    54.1%  of  wages  and  salaries   62%  of  turnover   53.5%  of  value  added  at  factor  cost  and  55%  of   gross investment in tangible goods in 2014. (http //www.turkstat.gov.tr  2017)     Some basic features of Turkish SME’s which is provided by Turkish Statistics Institute      ✓  99 8% share in total enterprises   ✓  93 5% internet accessing   ✓  65 2% has a web page   ✓  39 2% share in total wholesale and retail trade   ✓  59 7% low technology user     Institutionalization  refers  to  the  management  of  the  organization  within  the  framework  of  certain   systems   principles  and  values   in  line  with  specific  goals  and  objectives   regardless  of  persons.   Institutionalization  is  the  sum  of  policies  and  practices  that  guide  the  organization  in  making   strategic  decisions   running  company  activities  and  setting  the  principles  and  values.  Most  of  the   SMEs in  Turkey  are  founded by the family members  not  managed by the professional  managers.   Especially  the main problems that are manifested by institutionalization and access to finance are   deepened by constraints on accessing technical information and welleducated staff. The patriarchal   structure of the SME’s in Turkey is not based on professional management principles of decision  making mechanisms  but on the basis of family balance  lack of formal and professional structure.   On  the  other  hand   regarding  the  OECD  report  about  Turkey   one  of  the  major  priority  area  for   SME  policies  has  been  access  to  financing.  (OECD   2004)  The  most  important  reason  why  the   SME’s cannot be passed on to future generations is the lack of planning and institutionalization that   is ending with the entrepreneur’s die or disability to work. (DUNDAR et al.  2016)      The stability of the SME’s  which have such an importance in the economy  the compatibility with   the  environmental  conditions  and  the  continuity  affect  the  integrity  of  the  economic  life.  But   the     http //www.ssdjournal.org     Social Science Development Journal     ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com          279     Social Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume  3          Issue 11         pp 277287   lifetimes of SME’s are generally short in Turkey. The main reason behind the short lifetime is based   upon  confusion  of  business  management  and  family  relations  with  each  other.  (Pazarcık   2004)   Although   almost  all  the  businesses  are  SME’s  in  Turkey   regarding  the  Customs  and  Trade   Ministry’s  declaration   65%  of   five  years.   (www.hurriyet.com.tr   2013)  And  80%  of  all  enterprises  are  being  failed  managing  by  the  first   generation is based upon the results of a research. (Koçak  2012)     in  Turkey  are  closed     the  businesses     in     4. WEB BASED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR   SME’S     This study focuses on how businesses can be institutionalized in a fast  cheap and standard way and   also aims to provide a fintech solution for the survival of the business without being dependent on   the founder family members.      Fintech   or  financial  technologies   has  emerged  as  the  name  given  throughout  the  software  and   initiatives  that  provide  endusers  with  access  to  financial  products  and  financial  institutions.   Although it has been reinvented for the last two years  however it has a long history of 70 years in   the  world.  With  the  development  of  the  internet  and  communication  technologies   financial   technology is increasingly on the agenda with the intention of attracting an intense entrepreneurial   interest  especially nonbanking financial institutions.     One of the most important  elements  supporting this  development  is  the increasing  rate of internet   access  of  SME’s.  The  formation  of  Turkey's  population  structure  by  youth   encouragement  of   entrepreneurship as well as the support given by the state and angel investors facilitated access to   information and financial resources and created equal opportunity.     The client and solutionoriented approaches of niche areas created by financial institutions that meet   the needs of  customers  or making decisions and at  the same time the initiatives in  this ecosystem   have  made  financial  solutions  accessible  not  only  to  corporate  enterprises  but  especially  to   individuals and SME’s as well. The reason why the number of enterprises not exceeding 10 in 2015   is over 200 today is due to this simple need.     After 2008  the beginning of the global financial crisis  there is increasing uncertainty in the local   and the global markets which brings greater risks for SMEs. And therefore  need for financial and   risk management applications for SME’s has increased. Unfortunately  making financial decisions   sometimes requires complex practices and expensive solutions of the consultants.      The  innovative  aspect  of  the  suggested  webbased  system  is  to  make  complex  financial  decisions   and  risk  management  practices  accessible  for  SME’s  (SMEs).  It  aims  to  provide  fast   cheap    standard fintech solutions such as financial decision support and risk management services in order   to institutionalize the businesses which lack of financial sources  technical information and finance   professionals.     With  the  system  which  is  called  “Head  of  Finance”  (HoF)   company  owners  and  managers  can   control and monitor company’s daily financial activities on internet by computers  tablets and smart   phones from all over the world. The system can operate in a highsecurity cloud environment or on   an  enterprise’s  server  and  it  is  constantly  updating  and  developing  according  to  the  company's   needs  and  business  requests.  HoF  is  not  designed  as  a  bookkeeping  software   but  it  also  does   everything a bookkeeping software can do.     The software  which came out with a 2year study and a team of 4 software developers out of ten    was tested for 6 months on 14 companies operating in different sectors and different sizes. Software   modules and screen designs have been developed in accordance with the needs of SME’s  in order   to make the software easy and ready to use.     The level of utility that is assessed by the family business owners or managers and characteristics of   the test group are as follows      http //www.ssdjournal.org     Social Science Development Journal     ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com          280     Social Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume  3          Issue 11         pp 277287     Table 1.

The participatory demographics of 14 enterprises are as follows      ✓  100% was established as a family business.   ✓  2 out of 14 people participating in the study are female and 12 are male.   ✓  60% of participants are married  90% are above 40 years old.   ✓  35% graduated from Vocational School and university  20% have master / doctoral degree.   ✓  35% of participants are managers and 75% are partners in the company.   ✓  Three of the companies are textile producers  three are doing trade  three of them are metal   machinery  producers   two  are  consulting  companies   two  are  construction  companies  and   one is a packaging company.     ✓  9  out  of  14  companies  are  declared  the  utilization  score  as  5  have  an  average  30  years  in     business. These companies have 57 employees in average.      ✓  70% is a limited liability company and 30% is a joint stock company.   ✓  79% is managed by the 1st generation.     5. MODULES OF THE SYSTEM     HoF  consists  of  three  main  modules   cash  management   customer  analysis  and  scoring  and   Financial calculations.      5. 1. Cash Management Module     The first module of HoF is cash management. The biggest problems of Turkish SMEs are that they   cannot follow cash flows clearly  cannot follow receivables and debt maturities and cannot manage   sales policies and pricing correctly. These problems will be automatically tracked in seconds with   the  cash  management  module  right  after  extraction  of  excel  forms  from  any  bookkeeping  or   accounting software.     Poor cash management is one of the main reasons for business failures. But differs from the official   bookkeeping concept  we recommend companies to use their actual figures while making financial   decisions.  In  Turkey  as  a  developing  country   SME’s  are  using  avoid  paying  taxes  as  a  way  of   alternative  finance  in  business  activities.  Understanding  the basic  concepts  of  cashflow will  help   SME’s make plans for the unforeseen eventualities that nearly every business experiences. Business   liquid assets are mostly used in both business and personal needs of the owners. Therefore  instead   of  avoiding  actual  figures  to  take  cash  position  is  make  sense  in  our  decision  support  system     http //www.ssdjournal.org     Social Science Development Journal     ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com          281     Social Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume  3          Issue 11         pp 277287   calculations. It is not inventory  it is not accounts receivable  and it is not property. Cash flow refers   to  the  flow  of  total  cash  into  and  out  of  a  business.  Monitoring  the  cash  inflows  and  outflows   instantly  wherever  the  company  owners  and  managers  need  is  one  of  the  most  important   management tasks for any businesses.     Some features included in the module are      Picture 1. Customer Followup     ✓  Preparing customer information cards   ✓  Detailed tracking of customers and suppliers    ✓  Figuring out average maturity and due dates   ✓  Warnings for extension of maturities   ✓  Customer payment performance followups   ✓  Customer and supplier concentration tracks   ✓  Collateral and warranty tracks   ✓  Payment history and payment problems in cheques and bills checks   ✓  Customer risk based pricing   ✓  Foreign currency change effects on financials   ✓  Value added tax calculations     With  these  functions  we  also  want  to  raise  risk  awareness  in  SME’s  which  is  very  low.  Risk   awareness  is  the  foreseen  of  risks  and  the  active  process  of  reducing  or  eliminating  those  risks   which is caused by company or environment. The business owner might be thinking “why do I need   to know about possible risks and how do I reduce those risks?” Risk awareness has a close relation   with the concepts of experience  business culture and education. One of the idea behind the project   is also to increase SME’s awareness about risks then show how to prevent and prepare for it.  we   wanted to implement basic risk management applications into SME’s life as well.                      http //www.ssdjournal.org     Social Science Development Journal     ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com          282     Social Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume  3          Issue 11         pp 277287     Picture 2.

Customer Scoring And Analysis Module     Picture 4. Foreign Currency Change Effects on Financials      The  second  module  of  HoF  system  is  customer  scoring  and  analysis  module.  This  module  gives   SMEs an opportunity to evaluate themselves from the perspective of the banks as well as customer   scoring.  By  OCR  document  reading  system  in  this  module   it  is  also  possible  to  upload  PDF   formatted yearend financials in seconds for financial analysis.     Some features included in the module are      Picture 5.

The concepts such as correct financial   calculations  reconciliation with banks  investment analysis  company valuations are very technical   and requires experienced personnel. However  this module is designed in order to make all complex   financial calculations very easy for SME’s.      http //www.ssdjournal.org     Social Science Development Journal     ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com          285     Social Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume  3          Issue 11         pp 277287   By  HoF   businesses  can  easily  make  the  calculations  below  when  they  need  to  make  decisions  in   financial management      ✓  Present value and future value   ✓  Periodic return and net return   ✓  Breakeven analysis   ✓  Making payment plans and    ✓  Making decisions among the alternatives   ✓  Calculating principals  installments and maturities   ✓  Cash flow and EBITDA calculations   ✓  Company valuation     6.
