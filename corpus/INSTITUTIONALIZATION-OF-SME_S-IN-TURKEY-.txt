INTRODUCTION The management style that is emerged in the form of family business has been the driving force for entrepreneurship  and  production  all  over  the  world.  Due  to  its  contribution  to  the  country's economy SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also have a significant share in Turkish economy. 90% of all registered companies in  Turkey  and  94.1%  are  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  (Karpuzoglu  2004  43)  The  share  of  SMEs  in  all  registered businesses  in  Turkey  is  99.9%  therefore  the  central  role  of  the  sector  in  the  economy  is  evident. (Ari  2013)  According  to  the  Banking  Regulations  and  Supervision  Agency  (BRSA)  data  385 million of the 4.1 million enterprises in the definition of official  (sales of up to TL40 million and up to 250 employees) are SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in Turkey provide at least 75% of total GNP and 85% of employment. (D\\xc3\\x9cNDAR 2016) However despite the importance in Turkish economy the number of family companies that reached the fourth generation in Turkey is extremely low due to their problems and the rate of reaching the third family in Turkey is 10%. (www.bloomberght.com 2014) The average life span of companies is 18 years in Germany and 9 years in France. In Turkey 80% of enterprises cannot reach 5th year 96% cannot reach 10th year. (www.capital.com.tr 2015) It is possible to examine the advantages of SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s under two headings below (Bilgin 2007 912; Karpuzo\\xc4\\x9flu 2001 2224)   277 \\x0cSocial Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume 3          Issue11         pp277287 Financial Advantage The financial resources required in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s are usually provided by the family members. Equity is an important part of the company's capital for the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and the way to solve financial  problems  in  the  family  gives  a  stronger  position  against  the  company's  competitors. Besides  when  financial  problems  are  encountered  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  can  reveal  their  resources  more sacrificially in order to solve the problem. Because of the survival of the business they can easily give  up  both  family\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  and  entrepreneurial  assets.  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  operates  in  the  countries  that  has  a  less developed capital market is attempts to solve financial problems by inhouse sources.  Managerial Advantage SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have an advantage in that they can make financial decisions faster by  using  their  own  resources  and  fast  processes.  The  founder  of  the  company  may  take  a  more active  role  in  decision  making  during  the  implementation  phase  as  there  are  not  too  many bureaucratic  obstacles  in  the  company.  Regarding  the  family  members  are  also  employees  at  the same time the company generates much more synergy than the other competitors. An entrepreneur controlling  a  large  portion  of  the  business  can  decide  faster  in  technical  administrative  and investment  matters as the family member works  with  the professionals.  Since SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s do not  have bureaucracy in their bodies they do not experience any delay in taking decisions. Since SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s are futuretargeted organizations they concentrate on the existence of capital and a strong structure that will be left to next generations. The two major advantages mentioned above may also turn into disadvantages of SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s at the same time.  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  are  encountered  with  major  challenges  such  as technical  knowledge institutionalization and financing during the growth process. In the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hiring and working with professionals  can  be  problematic  and  expensive  as  well.  In  time  entrepreneur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  exception  of  the company as a child makes the company dependent to him however this kind of attitude also makes him dependent to the company. The aim of this study is  to  make a system suggestion as solution  for institutionalization financial management and access to technical information which are identified as the biggest problems in the development process of the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.   2. IMPORTANCE OF INSTITUTIONALIZATION OF SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99S Huge  Amount  of  Small  and  Medium  Sized  Enterprises  consists  of  Familyowned  businesses  and these  firms  are  very  important  parameter  in  order  to  understand  economic  situation.  SMEs  have important  responsibilities  which  accelerate  social  development  economic  growth  and  decrease unemployment.  These activities can be succeed via progressive SMEs which are capable of making well financial decision. In order to make financial decision properly firms need to possess financial information in terms of financial  statements  cash  flow  capital  expenditures  and  cost  report.  Right  information  can  be provided  via  effective  financial  management  and  consensus.  Todays  Small  and  Medium  Sized Enterprises suffer from absence of information or wrong information about financial activities. For this reason wrong financial decision occurs and this lead to risk for firms.  Especially  familyowned  businesses  face  a  dilemma  owing  to  lack  of  definite  financial  planning. Small and Medium Sized Enterprises which play an essential role on country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy need to be managed  financially.  Otherwise  firms  will  not  work  effectively  and  this  situation  will  affect country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  economy  negatively.  Therefore  small  and  medium  businesses  should  work  efficiently and have efficient financial structure. Familyowned businesses prevent SMEs from improving their perception and result in dilemma for firm.  Long and short range plans debt management management of receivable financial forecast and similar important financial activities become complicated tasks due to dilemma. Furthermore members of familyowned business do not tend to investigate financial data and news. It is obvious that financial data and news are very important components for management of Daily http//www.ssdjournal.org Social Science Development Journal ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com  278 \\x0cSocial Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume 3          Issue11         pp277287 financial  activities  and  risk  management.  Change  of  currency  interest  rate  and  macroeconomic indicators  should  be  followed  for  financial  decision  and  risk  management.  This  situation emphasizes importance of Financial Literacy. Nowadays success of SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance are measured via use of Information Technologies use of  source.  Effective  use  of  source  can  be  possible  thanks  to  efficient  use  of  Information Technologies. In free market economy use of Information Technology has become requirement at any sectors. 3. DEFINITION FEATURES AND THE PROBLEMS OF SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99S IN TURKEY SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s are those in  which multiple members of the same family are involved as major owners or managers  either  contemporaneously  or  over  time.  (Miller  LeBreton  Miller  Lester  Canella 2007) According  to  other  definition  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  are  those  in  which  the  family  controls  the  business through  involvement  in  ownership  and  management  positions.  Family  involvement  in  ownership (FIO) and family involvement in management (FIM) is measured as the percentage of equity held by family members and the percentage of a firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s managers who are also family members (Sciascia and Mazzola 2008) Despite the different definitions of family business there is not a significant and unique measure of the size and the impact in economies all over the World. In turkey 94.1% of are SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and therefore  we can take  the official SME definition at  the same time for calculating the size and impact of this type of entrepreneurships in Turkish economy. In accordance with the relevant legislation SME is defined as an enterprise that employs less than 250  employees  per  year  and  either  its  annual  net  sales  revenue  or  balance  sheet  value  does  not exceed  40  million  Turkish  Liras.  However  in  this  press  release  enterprises  with  less  than  250 employees hired without any criteria for financial size (annual net sales or balance sheet value) are defined as SMEs. The press release includes statistics such as the number of enterprises number of persons employed turnover foreign trade and technology usage in the SMEs. Small and MediumSized Enterprises (SMEs) constituted 99.8% of total number of enterprises 73.5% of employment 54.1%  of  wages  and  salaries  62%  of  turnover  53.5%  of  value  added  at  factor  cost  and  55%  of gross investment in tangible goods in 2014. (http//www.turkstat.gov.tr 2017) Some basic features of Turkish SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s which is provided by Turkish Statistics Institute \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  998% share in total enterprises \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  935% internet accessing \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  652% has a web page \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  392% share in total wholesale and retail trade \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  597% low technology user Institutionalization  refers  to  the  management  of  the  organization  within  the  framework  of  certain systems  principles  and  values  in  line  with  specific  goals  and  objectives  regardless  of  persons. Institutionalization  is  the  sum  of  policies  and  practices  that  guide  the  organization  in  making strategic  decisions  running  company  activities  and  setting  the  principles  and  values.  Most  of  the SMEs in  Turkey  are  founded by the family members not  managed by the professional  managers. Especially the main problems that are manifested by institutionalization and access to finance are deepened by constraints on accessing technical information and welleducated staff. The patriarchal structure of the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in Turkey is not based on professional management principles of decisionmaking mechanisms but on the basis of family balance lack of formal and professional structure. On  the  other  hand  regarding  the  OECD  report  about  Turkey  one  of  the  major  priority  area  for SME  policies  has  been  access  to  financing.  (OECD  2004)  The  most  important  reason  why  the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s cannot be passed on to future generations is the lack of planning and institutionalization that is ending with the entrepreneur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s die or disability to work. (DUNDAR et al. 2016)  The stability of the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s which have such an importance in the economy the compatibility with the  environmental  conditions  and  the  continuity  affect  the  integrity  of  the  economic  life.  But  the http//www.ssdjournal.org Social Science Development Journal ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com  279 \\x0cSocial Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume 3          Issue11         pp277287 lifetimes of SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s are generally short in Turkey. The main reason behind the short lifetime is based upon  confusion  of  business  management  and  family  relations  with  each  other.  (Pazarc\\xc4\\xb1k  2004) Although  almost  all  the  businesses  are  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  in  Turkey  regarding  the  Customs  and  Trade Ministry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  declaration  65%  of five  years. (www.hurriyet.com.tr  2013)  And  80%  of  all  enterprises  are  being  failed  managing  by  the  first generation is based upon the results of a research. (Ko\\xc3\\xa7ak 2012) in  Turkey  are  closed the  businesses in 4. WEB BASED FINANCIAL MANAGEMENT AND DECISION SUPPORT SYSTEM FOR SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99S This study focuses on how businesses can be institutionalized in a fast cheap and standard way and also aims to provide a fintech solution for the survival of the business without being dependent on the founder family members.  Fintech  or  financial  technologies  has  emerged  as  the  name  given  throughout  the  software  and initiatives  that  provide  endusers  with  access  to  financial  products  and  financial  institutions. Although it has been reinvented for the last two years however it has a long history of 70 years in the  world.  With  the  development  of  the  internet  and  communication  technologies  financial technology is increasingly on the agenda with the intention of attracting an intense entrepreneurial interest especially nonbanking financial institutions. One of the most important  elements  supporting this  development  is  the increasing  rate of internet access  of  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  The  formation  of  Turkey's  population  structure  by  youth  encouragement  of entrepreneurship as well as the support given by the state and angel investors facilitated access to information and financial resources and created equal opportunity. The client and solutionoriented approaches of niche areas created by financial institutions that meet the needs of  customers  or making decisions and at  the same time the initiatives in  this ecosystem have  made  financial  solutions  accessible  not  only  to  corporate  enterprises  but  especially  to individuals and SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s as well. The reason why the number of enterprises not exceeding 10 in 2015 is over 200 today is due to this simple need. After 2008 the beginning of the global financial crisis there is increasing uncertainty in the local and the global markets which brings greater risks for SMEs. And therefore need for financial and risk management applications for SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s has increased. Unfortunately making financial decisions sometimes requires complex practices and expensive solutions of the consultants.  The  innovative  aspect  of  the  suggested  webbased  system  is  to  make  complex  financial  decisions and  risk  management  practices  accessible  for  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  (SMEs).  It  aims  to  provide  fast  cheap standard fintech solutions such as financial decision support and risk management services in order to institutionalize the businesses which lack of financial sources technical information and finance professionals. With  the  system  which  is  called  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHead  of  Finance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (HoF)  company  owners  and  managers  can control and monitor company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daily financial activities on internet by computers tablets and smart phones from all over the world. The system can operate in a highsecurity cloud environment or on an  enterprise\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  server  and  it  is  constantly  updating  and  developing  according  to  the  company's needs  and  business  requests.  HoF  is  not  designed  as  a  bookkeeping  software  but  it  also  does everything a bookkeeping software can do. The software which came out with a 2year study and a team of 4 software developers out of ten was tested for 6 months on 14 companies operating in different sectors and different sizes. Software modules and screen designs have been developed in accordance with the needs of SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in order to make the software easy and ready to use. The level of utility that is assessed by the family business owners or managers and characteristics of the test group are as follows http//www.ssdjournal.org Social Science Development Journal ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com  280 \\x0cSocial Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume 3          Issue11         pp277287 Table 1.

The participatory demographics of 14 enterprises are as follows \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  100% was established as a family business. \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  2 out of 14 people participating in the study are female and 12 are male. \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  60% of participants are married 90% are above 40 years old. \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  35% graduated from Vocational School and university 20% have master / doctoral degree. \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  35% of participants are managers and 75% are partners in the company. \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Three of the companies are textile producers three are doing trade three of them are metal machinery  producers  two  are  consulting  companies  two  are  construction  companies  and one is a packaging company. \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  9  out  of  14  companies  are  declared  the  utilization  score  as  5  have  an  average  30  years  in business. These companies have 57 employees in average.  \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  70% is a limited liability company and 30% is a joint stock company. \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  79% is managed by the 1st generation. 5. MODULES OF THE SYSTEM HoF  consists  of  three  main  modules  cash  management  customer  analysis  and  scoring  and Financial calculations.  5. 1. Cash Management Module The first module of HoF is cash management. The biggest problems of Turkish SMEs are that they cannot follow cash flows clearly cannot follow receivables and debt maturities and cannot manage sales policies and pricing correctly. These problems will be automatically tracked in seconds with the  cash  management  module  right  after  extraction  of  excel  forms  from  any  bookkeeping  or accounting software. Poor cash management is one of the main reasons for business failures. But differs from the official bookkeeping concept we recommend companies to use their actual figures while making financial decisions.  In  Turkey  as  a  developing  country  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  are  using  avoid  paying  taxes  as  a  way  of alternative  finance  in  business  activities.  Understanding  the basic  concepts  of  cashflow will  help SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s make plans for the unforeseen eventualities that nearly every business experiences. Business liquid assets are mostly used in both business and personal needs of the owners. Therefore instead of  avoiding  actual  figures  to  take  cash  position  is  make  sense  in  our  decision  support  system http//www.ssdjournal.org Social Science Development Journal ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com  281 \\x0cSocial Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume 3          Issue11         pp277287 calculations. It is not inventory it is not accounts receivable and it is not property. Cash flow refers to  the  flow  of  total  cash  into  and  out  of  a  business.  Monitoring  the  cash  inflows  and  outflows instantly  wherever  the  company  owners  and  managers  need  is  one  of  the  most  important management tasks for any businesses. Some features included in the module are Picture 1. Customer Followup \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Preparing customer information cards \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Detailed tracking of customers and suppliers  \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Figuring out average maturity and due dates \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Warnings for extension of maturities \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Customer payment performance followups \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Customer and supplier concentration tracks \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Collateral and warranty tracks \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Payment history and payment problems in cheques and bills checks \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Customer risk based pricing \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Foreign currency change effects on financials \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Value added tax calculations With  these  functions  we  also  want  to  raise  risk  awareness  in  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  which  is  very  low.  Risk awareness  is  the  foreseen  of  risks  and  the  active  process  of  reducing  or  eliminating  those  risks which is caused by company or environment. The business owner might be thinking \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhy do I need to know about possible risks and how do I reduce those risks?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Risk awareness has a close relation with the concepts of experience business culture and education. One of the idea behind the project is also to increase SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s awareness about risks then show how to prevent and prepare for it. we wanted to implement basic risk management applications into SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s life as well.      http//www.ssdjournal.org Social Science Development Journal ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com  282 \\x0cSocial Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume 3          Issue11         pp277287 Picture 2.

The concepts such as correct financial calculations reconciliation with banks investment analysis company valuations are very technical and requires experienced personnel. However this module is designed in order to make all complex financial calculations very easy for SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  http//www.ssdjournal.org Social Science Development Journal ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com  285 \\x0cSocial Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume 3          Issue11         pp277287 By  HoF  businesses  can  easily  make  the  calculations  below  when  they  need  to  make  decisions  in financial management \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Present value and future value \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Periodic return and net return \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Breakeven analysis \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Making payment plans and  \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Making decisions among the alternatives \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Calculating principals installments and maturities \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Cash flow and EBITDA calculations \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Company valuation 6. CONCLUSION Picture 8. Loan Calculator Web  based  financial  management  and  decision  support  system  development  project  that  is conducted  between  April  2015  and  June  2017  has  successfully  completed.  In  the  second  step  we started to test the product over internet (www.finansmuduru.com.tr) by free trials. The name of the system and domain is officially registered.  Expected outcomes of the project are as follows \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  With  a  cheap  and  easytouse  fintech  solution  institutionalize  and  train  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  as  fast  as possible  \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Change the way of doing business in the market by adding financial institutions as a thirdparty solution partners on our portal \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Increase the risk awareness in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Reduce the negative effects of potential market and business risks \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Use the system training tool for university students \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Reduce costs for SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Reduce nonperforming loans of the financial institutions \\xe2\\x9c\\x93  Developing new solutions for SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s by the effect of big data management Participants  in  the  survey  considered  the  family  business  as  an  advantage  pointing  to  quick decision making and establishing a relationship based on mutual trust with their employees as the most important advantages. Another important finding from the survey is that family members who http//www.ssdjournal.org Social Science Development Journal ssdjournal.editor@gmail.com  286 \\x0cSocial Science Development Journal            2018 August         Volume 3          Issue11         pp277287 are not on duty in the company are not allowed to intervene in the company management but it is also not preferable to have nonfamily professionals in the top management of the business. 9  enterprises  with  64%  of  participants  gave  the  highest  utilization  score  5.  2  business  scored  4  2 business scored 2 and 1 business scored 3 in the survey. The lowest scorers were service businesses and the highest scorers were metal manufacturing construction companies and trade businesses.
