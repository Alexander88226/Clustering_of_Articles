b'herein file   SME Credit Guarantee in China and Risk Evaluation Yvonne (Yinghong) Zhang1  Please do not circulate Abstract As a product of the development of the market economy credit guarantee is relatively new to China and there are some defects in the system. It is of significance to construct and  improve  the  current  credit  guarantee  system  which  helps  to  improve  the  credit rationing of banks and to solve the financing problem of SME (small and mediumsized enterprise)  effectively.  This  paper  provides  a  comprehensive  analysis  of  the  current situation  of  domestic  and  international  credit  guarantee  market  with  a  focus  on  its development  in  China.  I  discuss  current  credit  evaluation  models  and  extends  the pricing method into multistage based on the current twostage VaR (Valuation at Risk) model.  Overall  this  paper  provides  suggestions  conducive  to  SME  credit  financing system design.

As a product from the development of the market economy credit guarantee proves the credibility and asset combined  responsibility.  In  the  market  economy  it  is  the  objective  requirement  of various trading activities in credit and social risk management. be distinguished from insurance as guarantee institutions are responsible to pay back the loan after the date of maturity while insurance companies bear limited responsibility. should It   With the improvement of the financial market SME (small and medium enterprise) credit  guarantee  is  becoming  more  common.  SME  credit  guarantee  is  a  specialized guarantee for SMEs to get loans from financial institutions mainly by the government funding. It is a variety of means and measures to realize and protect the creditors\' rights to  ensure  the  payment  of  the  debt  on  the  basis  of  the  property  (or  capital).  The fundamental  function  of  credit  guarantee  institutions  is  to  bridge  between  SMEs  and financial institutions so as to solve the financing difficulty for SMEs and resolve the worries from the financial institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 side. 1.2 Significance of SME credit guarantee (1) Effectively solve the problem of high financing cost for SMEs   Once credit guarantee system is established the cost of financing for SMEs is only loan bank  interest  plus  a  certain  amount  of  the  fee  much  lower  than  the  cost  of  private funding  thereby  reducing  the  cost  of  financing  for  SMEs.  Results  in  Mu  Yibin[1] suggested that credit guarantees influenced significantly firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to maintain their size and increase their survival rate. (2) Reduce the bank\'s management costs and operational risks; develop new business. The credit guarantee agencies can simplify the procedure of lending from bank to SMEs. Also the institutions deal effectively with the bank\'s solvency crisis which reduces the  1 \\x0cbank\'s  nonperforming  loans  and  hence  stimulates  the  banks  to  open  up  new  credit business. (3) Serve as an economic lever Compared  to  nonprofessional  guarantee  and  general  corporate  institutions  credit guarantee  system  overcomes  the  shortcomings  of  spontaneity  fragmentation  of  the credit guarantee system. Its magnification function makes credit guarantee work as an economic  leverage  in  the  process  of  social  resource  allocation  which  helps  with government  regulation  of  the  development  of  SMEs.  In  general  the  higher magnification  ratio  the  greater  it  contributes  to  society.  A  balanced  credit  guarantee system  means  that  guarantee  institutions  undertake  risk  systematically  in  accordance with the specific goal of SMEs its own strength and reputation.   (4) Benefit the construction of social credit system   Finance is the core of modern economy while credit is the core of the financial sector. The guarantee industry is an extension of the financial industry. Credit guarantee as a starting point in the economic life of the most sensitive areas directly urges businesses or  individuals  to  increase  credit  awareness  concern  and  attention  to  their  own  credit building. (5) Promote the development of the credit rating agencies Credit  rating  is  part  and  parcel  of  the  social  credit  system.  Financial  institutions  and guarantee  agencies  take  full  account  of  the  evaluation  from  the  rating  agencies  in selecting  customers  and  guarantees.  For  financial  institutions  and  guarantee  agencies the rating process saves the cost of collecting information. For SMEs they prove their creditability to obtain a qualification. For rating agencies although they do not have to be responsible for the legal consequences caused by the evaluation reports they must bear  the  survival  risk  for  their  own  evaluation  quality.  Therefore  the  potential  risk propels them to improve the scientific evaluation system and evaluation quality.  Above all it is significant to analyze the credit guarantee market thoroughly both for the SMEs and the entire market system. The study is designed to solve the dilemma  2 \\x0cof SME credit guarantee and to provide valuable theoretical reference and suggestions for policymaking departments. 1.3 Domestic and international situation of SME credit guarantee the first  professional  credits  guarantee institution  was In  November  1993 establishedChinese  Economic  and  Technological  Investment  Guarantee  Co.  Ltd. During the short history of fewer than twenty years SME credit guarantee industry has a rapid development. At of the end of 2008 according to statistics of the Ministry of Industry and Information Technology the national SME credit guarantee institutions has reached  4247  the  guarantee  funds  of  233.4  billion  yuan  the  cumulative  amount  of guarantee  SME  loans  reached  1.75  trillion  yuan  and  the  cumulative  number  of guaranteed  enterprises  is  90.7  million.  In  late  2011  the  total  institutional  national financing guarantee corporations reached 8402 an increase of 39.3% compared to the end of 2010; ensure the balance of a total of 1.912 trillion yuan an increase of 39.1% compared to early 2011. As at the end of June 2012 a total national financing guarantee industry institutional 8538 representing an increase of 136 from the beginning of the year;  financing  guarantee  loan  balance  of  1.3569  trillion  yuan  an  increase  of  9.2% compared with the beginning of the year. Figure 1.1 Quantity of Chinese Guarantee Agencies 20052011 (Source\\tResearch\\tIn\\tChina)\\t   3 \\x0c  With  the  fast  expansion  of  funding  and  volume  of  business  credit  guarantee institutions still adhere to SMEs. In 2008 nearly 384000 deals were among the total 400000 deals (the total amount of guarantee fund reached 800 million) accounting for 96%. Besides the scale is still in accelerating expansion. What we should be aware is the risk of the "boom" a disorderly growth. According to the survey  [3] at the end of 2001 in the small and mediumsized enterprises of the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China for credit rating a credit rating of A more accounted for only 16.2% in the BBB  and  below  accounted  for  83.8%.  Over  the  same  period  small  and  medium enterprises to obtain credit from stateowned commercial banks account for only 38% less than 20% only in the incremental credit. credit transactions paradox of objective interpretation  of  the  source  of  financing  difficulties  of  SMEs  shows  that  at  the  same time  the  credit  market  urgently  needs  professional  intermediaries  to  build  the  bridge between SMEs and bank credit.  Another  problem  arose  as  there  were  few  credit  rating  assessments  for  SMEs  in China and consequently banks had little information about the SME\'s credit records. On the other hand SMEs do not have incentives to establish their own credit reputation as no one evaluates their credit situation and whether they honor loan contracts did not make  much  difference  in  their  future  borrowing.  This  has  caused  poor  quality  of  the loans  to  SMEs  and  made  banks  reluctant  to  extend  loans  to  SMEs.  To  get  rid  of  the vicious  cycle  due  to  low  credit  ratings  or  lack  of  credit  report  of  SMEs  China established  a  nationwide  credit  assessment  system  for  SMEs  on  April  26  2001.  This system is designed to collect assess and report the credit situation. As with the international situation Levitsky Jacob (1987) [3] provided information  on  a  variety  of  credit  guarantee  schemes  in  27  developed  and  developing  countries. Together  with  other  references  to  SME  studies  [1][2]  the  following  characteristics  of relatively developed schemes are noted (1) Standard management. Many developed countries not only established strict access systems but also formulated specialized legal safeguards and norms to regulate agencies.  4 \\x0cFor example American SME Law and SME Investment Law have clearly defined the guaranteed object purpose amount of the guarantee and the premium standards; Japan SME Credit Guarantee Association Act explicitly stipulated the functions and role of the Guarantee  Associations  as  well  as  the  rules  for  the  guarantee  process.  Canada  SME financing  bill  build  SME  policyoriented  guarantee  system.  In  contrast  China\'s guarantee market is lack of regulations. (2)  Specification  on  the  objects  supported  by  SME  guarantee  institutions  and  policy objectives. They stipulate a criterion on the size and quality of the guaranteed SMEs. The supported enterprises comply with national or local industrial policies which are generally  focused  on  SMEs  that  earn  foreign  exchange  through  exports  or  expand employment.  Besides  given  the  different  stages  of  development  and  management system of the SMEs different nations provide some special support. In the USA for example  there  are  SMEs  guarantee  institutions  especially  for  women  the  disabled veterans minorities and poor areas. In contrast the standard of the SMEs guaranteed and policies in China are vague. institutions.   (3)  Regular  support  and  supervision  of Policyoriented governments have formulated a series of preferential policies to support the  guarantee  institutions  such  as  tax  policy  macromanagement  and  regular monitoring and inspection of guarantee institutions for SMEs. the  SMEs  guarantee (4)  Different  structures  of  guarantee  system  according  to  domestic  conditions.  For instance  the  United  States  implements  "onelevel  guarantee  system"  setting  up  local branches;  while  in  Japan  "sublevel  guarantees  system"  is  adopted  with  guarantees from the public treasury of the Central Credit Insurance and local credit associations. (The public treasury provides reguarantee for the local credit associations in the ratio of 70% 80%.) (5) Cooperation between guarantee institutions and bank. In other countries the banks share  the  risk  with  guarantees  agencies  based  on  the  size  and  duration  of  the  loan.  5 \\x0cGenerally  the  amount  of  the  guarantee  of  the  SME  credit  guarantee  institution  is  no more than 75% 80% of the loan; in the Japan Association it is no more than 70% 80%. In  economically  developed  countries  there  is  a  more  developed  financial  system  to establish a longterm stable relationship with banks. There are a number of specialized regional  financial  institutions  to  provide  financing  for  SMEs  which  are  actively involved in the SME Credit Guarantee Scheme.   1.4 Literature Review Credit  guarantee  industry  is  internationally  recognized  as  a  highrisk  industry  in addition to its risk stems from the features of the guarantee itself but also closely relates to guaranteed objects and external conditions.    In  China  many  scholars  analyzed  the  major  impediments  for  SMEs  to  access finance and provided some suggestions on how to make China\'s CGSs (credit guarantee schemes)  sustainable.  For  example  Mu  Yibin[1]  analyzed  examined  the  evolution categories legal basis operating characteristics and key concerns of CGSs in China. The author argued that the lack of collateral credit information and economies of scale of SME loans coupled with high political risks associated with SME loans are the four major impediments for China\'s SME finance. Xiong  [2] used comparative analysis and empirical  analysis  from  the  microlevel  analysisthe  system  of  commercial  bank credit; middlelevel analysisthe game under asymmetric information between banks and  enterprises;  macrolevel  analysisinstitutional  arrangements  and  SME  credit demand dilemma. Levitsky Jacob and Ranga N. Prasad (1987)[3] provided information on  a  variety  of  credit  guarantee  schemes  in  27  developed  and  developing  countries. Their study enabled us to understand the essential elements scope and variety of such schemes and the problems they face in their operations. The paper is organized as follows stressing the issue both at the micro and macro  level.  In  Section  2  the  paper  provides  macrolevel  analysis  in  terms  of  two  major impediments\\xe2\\x80\\x94government  invention  lack  of  proper  supervision  and  interest  rate  6 \\x0ccontrol. From the micro perspective in section 3 the paper investigates the credit needs of  financing  environment  the  SME\'s  own  weaknesses  and  credit  guarantee  system defects. Further with aims to provide solutions to the problems concerning the credit pricing section 4 provides a pricing method based on VaR model. The paper considers two stages credit guarantee and extends the model into multistage. Besides the paper discusses  the  credit  rating  system  extracting  credit  factors  and  introducing  models. Finally  the  paper  provides  suggestions  conducive  to  SME  credit  financing  system design.    7 \\x0c2 Macrolevel analysis of SME credit guarantee The structural deficiencies and functional defects of SME credit guarantee epitomized at the macro level. Mu Yibin  [1] argued that CGSs (Credit Guarantee Schemes) in China have become important tools for local governments to ensure credits to SMEs. However government intervention lack of proper supervision and regulation as well as interest rate control may impede the development of CGSs. 2.1 Government intervention According to Oh Inha et al. (2009)[14] the belief that capital markets do not provide adequate  funds  for  new  businesses  is  one  of  the  rationales  for  government  loan assistance programs to SMEs. In the past China\'s LMEs can directly use the national credit bank loans as endogenous financing. With the establishment and development of the market economy system this error has been corrected linking the credit of LMEs\' financing  to  its  assets.  However  it  goes  to  the  other  extreme  putting  too  much government  credit  on  SMEs  could  result  in  the  burden  of  government  finances amplification  of  government\'s  risk  the  weakening  of  the  market\'s  function  in  risk management.    As  we  know  the  market  itself  has  superior  management  and  risk  diversification. But  when  the  government  excessively  undertakes  the  risk  that  could  originally  be managed  and  decentralized  by  the  market  it  will  inevitably  weaken  the  market\'s functions. In China a multiplication of 4.12 times for the credit guarantee is far away from  the  international  standard  of  10  times.  Meanwhile  too  much  government guarantee will induce speculative behavior of SMEs increasing the risk of moral hazard and  SMEs\'  dependence  on  government.  Due  to  the  large  quantity  of  SMEs  and  the extensive  aspects  covered  demand  for  loans  of  SMEs  has  been  personalized.  As  a macrocontroller  and  social  manager  in  the  market  economy  system  the  government regulates the market and makes the market rules. But it is hard for the government to offer sufficient financial resources to dominate the guarantee system for SMEs.    8 \\x0cAll  in  all  the  dominant  role  of  government  guarantee  institutions  in  the  whole  system negatively affects the function and efficiency of the credit guarantee system.   2.2 Lack of proper supervision and interest rate control Some  credit  guarantee  schemes  (CGSs)  may  cause  the  \'moral  hazard\'  issue  as  they weaken the will and commitment of the borrowers to repay the loan when they know that a guarantee fund will reimburse the lending institution. [15] There is also a danger of moral hazard on the part of the lending bank which has less incentive to supervise the loan properly or to pursue vigorously the collection of repayments. Proper supervision benefits the SMEs by reducing unnecessary transaction cost. Currently the commercial banks are allowed to charge a maximum of 30% mark up  over base rate which is insufficient to encourage the banks to lend to SMEs and reward for the transaction cost and the credit risk. [1] Domestically most guarantee institutions charge half of the bank interest rate. It becomes a comparative advantage for guarantee institutions to attract SME. However this may introduce the problem of overlending if the institution fails to recognize the credit risk. Optimize the interest rate spread in the form  in  line  with  the  credit  risk  but  it  should  be  commensurate  with  the  risk  for companies that are faced with the situation of credit allocation. Interest payment makes SMEs get access to external funds more easily.    9 \\x0c3 Microlevel analysis of SME credit guarantee To some extent guarantee fee can be considered as a kind of risk compensation for credit guarantee  institutions  especially  for  SMEs.  Smaller  business  enterprises  in  both industrialized and developing countries have difficulties in obtaining financial assistance from banks and financial institutions.    The  reasons  are  concluded  as  follows  (1)  The  uncertainties  facing  the  small industry the high mortality rate of such enterprises and their vulnerability to market and economic  changes  make  banks  reluctant  to  deal  with  them  and  there  is  a  parallel reluctance  on  the  part  of  SMEs  to  borrow  from  banks.  (2)  Banks  and  financial institutions are biased in favor of lending to large corporate borrowers as there are links between banks and corporate borrowers that take the forms of joint directorships joint ownership  and  various  other  joint  financial  dealings.  (3)  The  administrative  costs  of lending to small enterprises are high and cut deep into the profitability of such loans. (4) SMEs  seeking  loans  are  unable  or  unwilling  to  provide  accounting  records  and  other documentation required by banks or to provide securities or collateral for the loans. In an attempt to overcome some of these problems particularly the perceived high risks of lending  to  small  enterprises  and  their  inability  to  provide  collateral  credit  guarantee schemes (CGS) have been introduced. [3] Except for these reasons stems from the nature of SMEs operational defects and  standard credit pricing on the institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 side are worth noting. SME credit guarantee system operating defects are mainly concluded in four ways   3.1 Lack of financial compensation and risk diversification mechanism   The main income sources for guarantee institutions come from local government funds the guarantee fee as a supplement resource. Governmental guarantee institutions run not for profit intention and hence they are more competitive by charging low for SMEs. Most  commercial  guarantee  institutions  regard  guarantee  fee  as  a  source  of  financial compensation part of the guarantee institutions charge at half the rates as bank loans in  10 \\x0cthe same period. For most of the international countries the guarantee fee is around 1% France  0.6%.  And  it  is  only  0.5%  in  Taiwan  and  Hong  Kong  Special  Administrative Region (SAR) in China.  Due to the lack of a clear specification on responsibility with the side of guarantee agencies the guarantee institutions are in a weak position on negotiations with banks. The consequence is that they should take on more risks of SME loans some even forced to undertake the full credit risk. International guarantee agencies generally bear only 80% of the loan obligation the United States 80% France 50% Germany and Japan 50% to 80%.  Guarantee  institutions  are  also  lack  of  risk  diversification  mechanism.  The majority  of  agencies  especially institutions  seek counterguarantee contracts to diversify risk or charge more the guarantee fee to transfer the risk. the  commercial  guarantee 3.2 Information asymmetry Information asymmetry between SMEs guarantee institutions and banks is considered as another defect. As Busetta Giovanni and Alberto Zazzaro (2012) argued about the adverse selection during the guarantee process [5] Xiong [2] theoretically and empirically justified  that  the  credit  market  incentive  and  restraint  mechanisms  asymmetry  is  an important cause of formation of SME credit financing difficulties. Low ratings or lack of specific credit reporting system for SMEs impedes financing for SMEs. Also there are few credit rating assessments for SMEs in China and consequently banks have little information about SME\'s credit records.  Take  the  example  of  a  guarantee  company  in  Jiujiang  Developing  District.  Its cooperated bank would double check the guaranteed SMEs to ensure their credibility. In another word both the guarantee agency and the bank inspect the SMEs\' management investigate  their  financial  statements  and  analyze  their  prospects  etc.  However guarantee  institutions  for  SMEs  in  China  almost  bear  100%  of  the  loan  risk.  Many cooperate banks couldn\'t get full from SMEs or guarantee institutions. According to the  11 \\x0csurvey  at  the  end  of  2001  among  the  SMEs  guaranteed  a  credit  rating  of  A  only accounted for 16.2% in the BBB and below accounted for 83.8%. (The credit rating is provided  by  the  Industrial  and  Commercial  Bank  of  China).  The  credit  transactions paradox objectively explained the source of financing difficulties of SMEs which also implied  the  urgent  need  for  professional  intermediaries  to  build  the  bridge  between SMEs and bank credit on the credit market. [13] 3.3 Lack of collateral varieties SMEs lack eligible collateral for loans. Banks have the duty to protect depositors\' funds and  are  naturally  risk  adverse.  In  China  the  main  categories  of  the  collaterals  are properties  owned  by  the  borrowed  or  whoever  else  pledges;  the  right  to  the  use  of stateowned land equipment or transportations vehicles which are at the disposal of the borrower; stateowned etc.    Other  countries  however  their  guarantee  variety  includes  business  loans  bills discounting  scientific  and  technological  development  loans  equipment  loans  and technological innovation loans. Varieties of collaterals facilitate the process for SMEs to get adequate loans. 3.4 Lack of professionals Some officials in local governmentfinanced guarantee institutions are not familiar with the  guarantee  business.  But  to  achieve  capital  preservation  or  gain  profit  guarantee institutions  need  experts  to  manage  and  implement  the  marketoriented  operation. Meanwhile there is still no guarantee qualification system and penalizing mechanism which leads to the lack of ability and quality.    12 \\x0c4 Supporting systems\\xe2\\x80\\x94Pricing and Credit Rating From  the  above  analyses  it  makes  sense  to  evaluate the risk of credit guarantee.  The supporting  systems\\xe2\\x80\\x94Pricing  and  Credit  Rating  naturally  become  indispensable.  If guarantee agencies charge too low they will assume excessive risk compensating for the agencies; while high fees will resist a large number of enterprises to be guaranteed. Therefore  the  reasonable  price  of  the  guarantee  is  the  basis  of  the  existence  and development  of  the  guarantee  industry.  In  the  U.S.  creditrelated  investments guarantees securities consultants fund institutions operate through the credit rating of the company and the rating results directly affect the market requirements guaranteed. While in China it is still in the elementary period. 4.1 Pricing of credit guarantee 4.1.1 Comparisons of different pricing models Domestic credit guarantee industry is still in its startup phase so there are few studies about  the  pricing  of  credit  guarantee.  Mei  Qiang  Tan  Zhongming  (2002) [8]  analyzed compensatory rates and recovery rates under the cases of different guarantee rates and margin  rates.  It  assumed  that  the  margin  rate  compensatory  rate  recovery  rate  and interest  rates  can  be  used  to  determine  the  guarantee  rate.  But  the  method  can  only determine the interval of guarantee rate rather than the exact rate. In recent years we have witnessed an unprecedented surge in the usage of  risk management practices.  The main  pricing  methods  of  credit  guarantee  are  the  option  pricing  model  based  on experience or VaR (Value at Risk).   (1) BlackScholes model Scholars  considered  guarantee  as  the  put  option  and  hence  relative  pricing  models could be utilized. However the BlackSholes model relies on two main points firstly the price of underlying asset obeys logarithmic normal distributions; secondly  continuous adjustment  for  asset  in  infinite  short  period  in  case  of  riskfree  arbitrage.  For  the guarantee institutions aiming to serve SMEs (i) the assets income in one period can be  13 \\x0cmuch  higher  than  another  period  due  to  the  growth  of  an  enterprise;  (ii)  it  is  also impossible to adjust copy assets continuously.[167]Therefore the BlackSholes cannot fit any more.   (2) Experiencebased pricing   Domestic  credit  guarantee  industry  pricing  is  based  primarily  on  The  Guidance  to establish  SME  credit  guarantee  system  generally  charging  of  SME  credit  guarantee institutions guarantee fees should be controlled within 50% of the interest rates of bank loans over the same period. According to the National Guarantee Institution charging standard survey guarantees rates typically 1% to 3% national average about 2.5%. The pricing is based on the experience of judgment multiply the total guarantee amount by a  certain  percentage  and  then  make  adjustment  to  the  base  price.  [6] This  method  is practical  in  some  sense  but  it  only  sets  the  price  without  any  explanation  why  just lacking  of  convincing  reasons.  With  the  development  of  the  guarantee  industry  and fierce competition in the market this method is limited because of its arbitrariness and high cost of negotiation.   (3) VaRbased pricing Dennis Weatherstone  clearly stated the basic question \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow much can we lose on our trading portfolio by  tomorrow\\xe2\\x80\\x99s close?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  VaR describes the loss that can occur over a given period at a given confidence level due to exposure to market risk. [7] Dietsch M Petey J.[4] computed the probability density function of futures losses  and  VaR  measures  in  a  portfolio  of  220.000  French  SMEs  and  proposed  specific solutions  dealing  with  the  most  important  peculiarities  of  these  portfolios.  While  in China Xiaohong Chen(2005) [6] was a pioneer of VaR pricing model of credit guarantee which  provided  the absolute VaR method.  Later  a  twostage  model  (the relative VaR method) was approved to be more accurate.  Compared with absolute VaR pricing model the comparative VaR method also takes into  account  the  deferred  liability  risk  (the  risk  during  the  guarantee  period  as  the  14 \\x0cdeviation from the average yield rate of the asset) which is similar to consider the budget of the time value of the asset. If the average yield rate is of positive value the method would be more accurate and closer to the reality.   4.1.2 Mathematical Introduction of VaR model   We list the basic definitions and assumptions as follows (referred to [4]) (1) stationarity.   A related assumption is the random walk assumption of intertemporal unpredictability; or equivalently this can be represented as the assumption of a zero expected rate. (2) nonnegativity.   This stipulates that financial assets with limited liability cannot attain negative values. (3) risk limit.   We assume that a guarantee institution is constrained to maintain the VaR of horizon wealth at a prespecified level.   ()=D \\xc2\\xa3 prob CVaR aThe formula is where  CD   is the variance value of assets  in a given period that is ROA (return on assets). It illustrates that the probability that the loss exceeds VaR is  a or at the prob level of  1a the maximum loss of asset is VaR.  Suppose  the  initial  value  of  an  asset  is  W  the  expected  return  rate  is  l  the volatility rate is  s and the minimum return rate under the significance level of  1a  is f w  then r   ((we can get   r < ). If the probability density function of the return of the assets is0) 1a +\\xc2\\xa5\\xc3\\xb2=rf w dw() Typically  we  suppose  that  deviation rate  d of  r and distribution can be expressed as f w   obeys  normal  distribution (lr)d= then   s  (1) ( )zF   then  the  15 \\x0c                              1a +\\xc2\\xa5\\xc3\\xb2=rf w dw()\\xc3\\xb2= Fd+\\xc2\\xa5z dz( )                               (2) So  under  the  assumption  of  normal  distribution  and  significance  level  of  1a + . Suppose the initial net 0W  its guaranteed loan is  G  other debt total to  every deviation rate  d   corresponds to a return rate  rasset of the guaranteed enterprise is z . Value of the discount rate of liquidation is liqudation value we have ds l=l =book value VaR W ds l) ||=\\xc2\\xb4 +0( (3)   If the future return is i.i.d. then  VaR of different time periods is related to each  other and satisfying the relationship    TVaR=TVaR (4) 4.1.3 Twostage VaRbased pricing model   The existing absolute VaR method only considered the original debt risk this section presents a twostage pricing model of credit guarantee which considers both the original debt risk and the extended debt risk. (referred to [11]) When the enterprise in debt fails to pay back its debt to the financial institution the guarantee institution should pay for the guaranteed enterprise. After that the institution can  get the recovery right or ask the enterprise for bankruptcy liquidation or extend the period to pay back. Therefore for the institution  under  the  condition  to  ask  for  bankruptcy  liquidation  the  risk  for  the guarantee is only the risk of bank loan default i.e. the original debt; under the situation to extend the payback period the risk will also include deferred liability risk. 0T  1T   and Suppose 2T   are  respectively  the  contract  date  the  due  date  of  the V V V are respectively the 0X X are the promised payback amount at 12T .

[6 11] 4.2 Multistage VaRbased pricing model   In China with the growth and maturity of the industry the compensatory fee becomes the recurrent  expenditure  gradually.  Consequently  it  makes  sense  to  consider  deferred liability risk in the multistage situation.

The intuition is similar to longterm loan or portfolio as the time period could be regarded as a kind of risk. The above model provides a standard approach for the risk valuation  of  credit  guarantee.  The  extension  to  multistage  pricing  reflects  a  more flexible credit guarantee market. However the twostage model is enough sufficient for the current credit guarantee market which barely provides guarantee for SME for more than two periods. The accuracy of the multistage needs further investigations.   4.3 Credit Rating In actuality credit rating system directly affects the length of the period of the guarantee loans. One of the reasons that the guarantee institutions hesitate to provide longterm guarantee is that they lack a credible record of the SME.   Most  other  countries  provide  longterm  guarantees  of  bank  loans  to  SMEs generally  more  than  2  years.  The  longest  warranty  period  is  17  years.  In  contrast  in China most guarantee loans are within the periods of six months up to one year. The guarantee  institutions  are  unwilling  to  provide  guarantee  sometimes  especially  if  the enterprise  default  at  the  first  time  which  will  turn  down  some  potentially  successful enterprises. Building a rational credit rating system will be helpful.    19 \\x0c On  the  one  hand  rating  assessment  according  to  historical  record  provides guarantee institutions a reliable reference towards financing for the enterprise. On the other hand SME borrowers will fear being denied further loans if they fail to repay and hence try their best to enhance their performance. The following diagram concludes the credit factors       external\\tfactorinternal\\tfactorcredit\\tfactoreconomic\\tsituation\\t&\\tfinancial\\tfactorcoverage\\tinsurancemanagement\\tfactorcredit\\tperformance     charactercapacitycapitalcalleteralFigure 4.1 illustration of credit factors  All  these  factors  decide  the  assessment  of  the  guaranteed  SME.  Historical  credit data are recorded to evaluate the SME which is related to the level of credit risk. In this section we will introduce a simple credit rating system where historical credit data are used to select variables and weighting schemes.     Michel Dietsch (2002) [4] built two alternative models the ordered probit model and  a  model  which  assumes  a  gamma  distribution  of  the  systematic  factor.  Firstly classify SME credit guarantee by their credit quality. The credit evaluation is obtained by internal risk rating system of the bank. We assess the probability that the borrower will move to the "default class" over a given planning horizon.    Secondly measure the likely exposure of each loan and calculate the proportion of the exposure that would be lost if the borrower defaults. To capture the behavior of the portfolio  as  a  whole  it  is  necessary  to  measure  the  correlations  between  losses.  [4] Assume  that  exposures  and  default  are  independent.  We  concern  the  correlations  20 \\x0cbetween defaults by measuring the volatility of PD (probability of default) in each risk class around its longrun stationary value.   Finally according to the credit record of each SME the guarantee institution or the  bank should adjust their plans towards providing financing for the enterprise.  This section provides an outline of the first model with the assumption of a normal distribution  of  the  risk  factors  and  a  correlation  between  defaults.  Each  enterprise\'s default  (or  not)  is  determined  by  systematic  risk  factor  and  idiosyncratic  risk  factor. Define an unobserved latent random variable V as a linear function of the two factors+   where  x   and  e  stand  for  systematic  risk  factor  and  idiosyncratic  risk V( )f   is the standard normal CDF the unconditional PD factor respectively.    Suppose for a borrower belonging to a given risk class  n   is np . Therefore a borrower makes default when   xb e=  ex+b12+b<1f(pn) Then we can compute the individual PD asp x( )n=  (16) (pnx)]b [ 11f bf+2The  typical  process  and  case  analysis  are  discussed  in  detail  in  Michel  Dietsch  (2002)  [4].  It  is  worth  stressing  the  method  to  measure  the  volatility  and  correlations between  losses.  For  a  couple  of  corporations  a  comparative  approach  could  be  used. Chi  Guotai  Yong  Cao  and  Libin  Zhou[12]  shed  light  upon  the  calculation  of  the correlation coefficient matrix utilizing the default distances (DD) and Gaussian copula function. Let Zi be the standardized latent variable of loaner i. For two enterprises i and j with the same rating grade the covariance is given by   cov(Z Zij)=E Z Z(=ij)  E Z E Z(()i)j2b1+2b (17) 21 \\x0c The  aggregate  shocks  result  in  the  correlation  and  the  shape  of  the  value distribution  is  skewed  to  the  right  which  is  directly  determined  by  the  weight  of  the systematic risk factor  b.    22 \\x0c5 Conclusion and Policy suggestions From the macro point of view the government financial guarantee institutions dominate the SME credit guarantee system in China which causes the low proportion of private capital guarantee institutions. Additionally lack of proper supervision and interest rate control handicaps the development of the system. The existing operating system defects also limit the demand in the credit guarantee  market  exacerbate  moral  hazard  and  adverse  selection  and  hence  affect  the performance  of  the  SME  guarantee  system  and  its  sustainable  development.  The proposed pricing model based on VaR and the corresponding credit rating system (in section  4)  is  conducive  to  establish  a  standard  method  to  charge  SMEs  for  credit guarantee. Particularly with the development of credit guarantee system and increasing demand  for  credit  guarantee  from  SME  the  extended  multistage  model  would  be applicable  to  accurately  reflect  the  value  of  the  credit  guarantee.  The  paper  proposed several policies as follows. 5.1 Institutions management   (1) Reasonable incentives and clear definition of the relationship between the guarantee agencies the government banks and enterprises.   This includes elements such as the ratio of government funding for guarantee agencies guarantee agency management operating mode the reasonable sharing of risks between the  lending  bank  and  credit  guarantee  institutions  the  proportion  of  credit  guarantee magnification and guaranteed rates.   (2)  Good  collaboration  between  guarantee  institutions  and  banks  is  one  of  the prerequisites for the successful operation of the guarantee system.   This  suggestion  is  to  reduce  the  moral  hazard  and  adverse  selection  mainly  due  to information  asymmetry  and  distrust.  Banks  need  an  opportunity  to  learn  more  about SMEs their problems and their operations to help improve their handling of SME loan  23 \\x0cportfolios. It is also helpful to reduce transaction costs which in return will increase the lending to SMEs. Only when the three participants keep in a good relationship will the guarantee process be efficient on the basis of mutual trust. \\tguarantee\\t deposit\\t compensate\\t\\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t \\t   guarantee\\tpay\\trequire\\tcompensation\\t when\\tfee\\tprovide\\tguarantee\\tprovide\\tloan\\tprovide\\tantiguarantee\\tapply\\tfor\\tloan\\t   Figure 5.1 Relationship between guarantee institution cooperate bank and SME (3) The broader scope of the guarantee business. Guarantee institutions can learn from the strengths of foreign guarantee industry. They determine their main business and the direction of development and properly conducted guarantee business in accordance with the international trend such as transfer of foreign exchange guarantee contract performance guarantee export guarantee the customs tax payment guarantee guarantee etc. (4) Introduction of professionals. The  improvement  of  SMEs  credit  guarantee  also  depends  on  the  standardized management and operation. They are responsible for analyzing the performance of the SMEs commanding the market supply and demand and managing a business in line with national industrial policy and standards. (5) Risk prevention\\xe2\\x80\\x94pricing and credit rating.   As  shown  in  section  4  building  the  standard  pricing  and  credit  rating  system  is necessary to regulate the guarantee business. The establishment of credit rating system  24 \\x0cas a supportive measure creates effective incentives by keeping track of credit records which  is  advisable  to  limit  the  SMEs  that  could  be  guaranteed.  They  can  also  take measures  to  strengthen  SMEs  risk  liability  such  as  mandatory  antipersonal  property collateral in order to constrain the conduct of operations managers.   5.2 Government management and market mechanism It is significant for the government to manage the fine line between support and control encouragement and interference.   (1) Expansion and development of the commercial guarantee institutions.   The  government  funding  is  indispensable  to  the  success  of  credit  guarantee  in  any country. However a soft budget constraint problem handicaps its growth and efficiency. It  should  be  subjected  to  extensive  supervision  for  budgets  like  how  much  could  be invested for guarantee institutions every fiscal year. In addition it is recommended to reduce the proportion of the government guarantees in the whole security system and to increase  the  proportion  of  mutual  guarantee  and  commercial  guarantees  to  secure private capital in the entire security system.   (2) Improve the reguarantee system improve risk diversification mechanism. The  gradual  establishment  of  reguarantee  institutions  effectively  disperses  guarantee risk.  At  the  same  time  the  reguarantee  institutions  can  transfer  their  risks  through gaining  guarantee  from  the  other  reguarantee  institutions.  Moreover  we  need  a government compensation mechanism which includes managing the size and degree of dispersion of SME guarantee fund.   (3) Active and innovative forms to develop credit guarantee career. To promote SME development a liberalized interestrate regime is preferable. In that case  the  market  forces  will  determine  the  cost  for  any  borrower  according  to  the relative credit risk. We also expect more innovative forms to build a sustainable credit guarantee system and to improve the market competitiveness globally.  25 \\x0cReference [1] Mu Yibin.
