Failure  to  comply  with  existing  regulations  is  costing  the  industry  billions  with  60%  of   profits  being  paid  in  fines  and  payments  to  customers  since  2011.  Such  problems  are  caused  by   fundamental information system failures  be they people  process  or technology in origin. This design   science  research  study  addresses  these  problems  by  designing  a  standardsbased  methodology  for   interpreting  regulatory  texts.  The  methodology’s  constructs   model   methods  and  related  guidelines   form the architectural  basis  of  an information  technology artefact   or instantiation   called  Ganesha.   Based on the Object Management Group (OMG) standard  the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and   Rules  (SBVR)   the  methodology   guidelines   and  related  IT  artefact  enable  practitioners  to  capture   regulations  in  a  Regulatory  Natural  Language  (RNL)   that  is  both  human  readable  (in  structured   English)  and  machine  readable  (in  XML  and  OWL).  The  methodology  and  guidelines  have  been   evaluated through application in several regulatory domains and the results presented to major actors   in  the  financial  industry.    Their  instantiation in  Ganesha  therefore  enables  knowledge  elicitation  by   legal  and  financial  subject  matter  experts  to  facilitate  knowledge  sharing   training  and  decision   making around regulatory compliance in financial services organisations.

The institutional response to the financial crisis in 2008 was industry   reform and increased regulation on a global scale (Grant & Wilson  2012). Kendall (2013) reports that   “most  of  the  largest  banks  understand  that  they  not  only  have  inadequate  capabilities  to  address  the   regulations  that  have  already  been  imposed   but  that  even  more  regulation  is  inevitable.”  The   consequences  of  this  are  significant   as  financial  institutions  have  been  paying  over  60%  of  their   profits  in fines  and  payments to  customers  since  2011.  In  the  US   for  example   over  $251  billion in   fines  were  levied  by  US  regulators  since  2008;  in  the  UK   £41  billion  of  fines  and  charges  were   incurred by banks. While the regulatory compliance failures of Global Systemically Important Banks   (GSIBs—Top  tier  banks)  hit  the  headlines   those  of  Domestic  Systemically  Important  Banks  (D  SIBs—typically  second  tier  institutions)  and  other  financial  institutions  are  no  less  significant.   Regulatory  compliance  is  top  of  the  agenda  across  the  industry.  Take   for  example   that  JP  Morgan   Chase are spending $4 billion to “boost staff and fix compliance and riskcontrol problems”; in people   terms  HSBC has 24 300 staff specialising in risk and compliance  almost 10% of its entire workforce.   Hence  while  fines  are  a  charge  on  profits   regulatory  compliance  is  costing  firms  dearly   as  they   comprise  anywhere  from  520%  of  total  operating  costs.  Such  are  the  scale  of  the  regulatory   compliance challenges   banks  such  as  HSBC   Standard  Chartered  etc.  are  withdrawing  from  smaller   markets.       Our  unpublished  research  indicates  that  IS  support  for  regulatory  compliance  is  patchy  at  best.  Just   30% of USbased financial technology (FinTech) are focussed on compliance and risks  with support   for key regulatory compliance processes the exception  rather than the norm. Hence  major GSIBs are   investing  in  more  people  than  technologies  due  to  the  gap  in  the  FinTech  market.  Evidence  of  the   widespread failures to apply people  processes and IT comes from  the Basel Committee on Banking   Supervision  viz.  “One  of  the  most  significant  lessons  learned  from  the  global  financial  crisis  that   began in 2007 was that banks’ information technology (IT) and data architectures were inadequate to   support  the  broad  management  of  financial  risks…This  had  severe  consequences  to  the  banks   themselves and to the stability of the financial system as a whole.” Researchers and practitioners argue   that  traditional  information  technologies  are  not  up  to  the  task  of  addressing  what  are  significant   regulatory  compliance  challenges  facing  the  industry  (cf.  Bamberger  2010   Bennett  2011   2013    Kendall  2014).  The Financial Industry GRC Technology Centre (GRCTC) was established in 2012    as an industryoriented   governmentfunded research centre  to conduct R&D on the use of semantic   technologies for regulatory compliance in the financial industry. One of its core objectives is to design   and build semantic technologies to enable sensemaking of complex regulations by actors in order to   facilitate compliance in financial organisations.       This  paper  presents  the  findings  of  our  design  science  research  initiative  on  the  development  of  a   methodology (which includes the elaboration of concepts)  guidelines  technical specification and IT   artefact  which  enables  legal  and  financial  subject  matter  experts  to  express  complex  legislation    regulations and rules in a regulatory natural language (RNL). This RNL is expressed according to the   Object Management Group’s Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) standard  making   it both human and machine readable and understandable. Specifically  we describe the Design Cycle   of our research (Winter  2008)  which is tightly coupled with the Rigour Cycle of the design process   (Hevner   2007)   underpinned  as  it  is  by  adherence  to  an  industry  standard  and  the  theory  of               3          interpretation (described in AbiLahoud et al. 2014). Another output of the design cycle helps address   the  vocabulary  and  translation  problems  in  the  design  of  traditional  IS  (see  Furnas  et  al.   1987;   Bamberger  2010)  as it illustrates how legal  business and financial subject matter experts (SMEs) can   capture  domain  knowledge  of  directives   regulations     rules   and  regulatory  guidance  in  a  structured   regulatory  natural  language.    This  SBVRbased  RNL  can  also  be  transformed  into  the  Resource   Description Framework (RDF) or Web Ontology Language (OWL) for inclusion in a knowledge base.   The  design  artefacts  are  also  applicable  to  other  domains   as  indicated  by  insights  obtained  in  the   Rigour Cycle of our research.       The  remainder  of  this  paper  is  structured  as  follows.  Section  2  first  describes  the  motivation  and   context  of  this  design  research  study  and  includes  a  short  overview  of  design  science  research   perspectives and their application in this study. Section 3 presents the findings of this design science   research  study   which  involved  two  research  phases   or  iterative  design  (DR)  processes   which   produced several DR artefacts  culminating in the design of an IT artefact called Ganesha in Phase 2.   The final section discusses the findings and offers concluding thoughts.           2     Motivation and Research Approach     The  widespread  failure  of  operational  and  regulatory  compliance  information  systems  across  the   financial industry contributed to the financial crisis in 2008 (Bamberger  2010). However  there were   also global failures in regulatory oversight (Campbell  2011). Following the global financial crisis  the   velocity  volume  and variety of regulations increased across all regulatory domains (Grant & Wilson    2012). It is clear that big regulation has led to big fines  which are a charge on profits—typically 60%   for larger banks. This in turn led to an industrywide recruitment drive for regulatory compliance staff   and an upsurge in demand for GRC and related information systems (KPMG  2012). Such GRC IS are   typically  developed  using  traditional  information  technologies.  Sheth  (2005)   however   argues  that   traditional GRC IS are incapable of delivering the type of risk and compliance functionality required   by financial services organisations—the solution  he argues  lies in capturing the semantics of risk and   regulatory compliance. Bennett (2011  2013)  Kendall (2014)  and Atkin (2015) also identify problems   with  traditional  approaches  to  GRC  IS  or  data  management  in  the  financial  industry  and  argue  for   solutions  based  on  semantic  technologies.  Take   for  example   Bamberger  (2010   p.  706)  that   traditional  IS  are  deficient  due  to  “problems  of  translation…  regarding  the  translation  of  both  legal   mandates and business understandings of risk into computer code and actionable controls.” Hence  one   of  the  key  challenges  facing  financial  services  organisations  and  others  servicing  the  sectors  is  in   understanding  the  regulatory  compliance  implications  of  increasing  volumes  of  local  and  global   legislation   regulatory  rules   and  various  forms  of  ‘soft’  law  (Brummer   2010).  The  translation   problem  arises  due to  primordial challenges  involving  the interpretation  of  regulatory  texts  industry   rules  and  standards   such  as  IFRS  9   by  legal  and  financial  subject  matter  experts  (SMEs).  This   problem  is  magnified   however   when  software  engineers  attempt  to  translate  rules  and  compliance   imperatives  into  IS   as  the  IS  development  process  is  plagued  with  poor  communication  and  bias   (Friedman & Nissenbaum  1996).      It  was within this context that  GSIBs  DSIBs  GRC  and FinTech firms supported the institution of   the  Financial  Industry  GRC  Technology  Centre  (GRCTC).  As  indicated   GRCTC  is  a  government  funded  research  centre  whose  purpose  is  to  investigate  the  design  of  semantic  technologies  for   regulatory compliance and risk data aggregation in the financial industry. Industry members sit on the   steering  board  and  inform  the  Design  Research  programme.  Thus   these  organizations  are  also   collaborating  in  the  initiative  as  coresearchers.  In  the  context  of  the  current  DR  study     a   multidisciplinary team of 2 IS researchers  2 knowledge engineers  2 software engineers  and 4 legal   researchers from GRCTC undertook a programme of research to make financial laws and regulations   human  and  machine  readable.  It  is  significant  that  this  study  was  conducted  with  the  initial   participation of two of the primary authors of the OMG’s SBVR standard. It is also significant that one   of the research artefacts from the first phase of the study  the SBVRbased methodology for regulatory               4          interpretation   was  applied  as  part  of  a  ProofofConcept  (PoC)  on  Regulation  W  in  the  US  by  the   OMG’s Financial Domain Task Force and the Enterprise Data Management Council (EDM Council).   While  Section  3  illustrates  the  process  and  product  of  the  Design  Cycle   the  participation  of  the   standardsmaking  bodies  and  industry  associations  indicate  the  transition  through  both  Rigour  and   Relevance Cycles  as indicated next.         2.1     A Design Science Research Approach     According  to  Winter (2008   p.  471)  design  research (DR)  is  aimed  at  “creating  solutions  to  specific   classes of relevant problems by using a rigorous construction and evaluation process” while “design   science reflects the design research process and aims at creating standards for its rigour.” This Design   Research  (DR)  project  accords  with  Winter’s  (2008)  categorisation  of  this  form  of  research.  The   design  artefacts  being  produced  in  this  study  include  (1)  Constructs  (i.e.  regulatory  concepts  in  a   vocabulary);  (2)  Relationships  between   and  rules  constituted  by   these  concepts;  (3)  Models   represented  in  the  Semantics  of  Business  Vocabulary  and  Rules  (SBVR);  and  (4)  Methods  (an   approach to the construction of concepts  relationships and models). Hevner (2007) argues that design   science  research  must  incorporate   (1)  a  Design  Cycle   which  involves  the  core  activities  of   developing and evaluating the design artefacts and research processes; (2) a Rigour Cycle connects the   design  cycle  with  a  knowledge  base  of  scientific  theories   experience   expertise   and  metaartefacts;   and  (3)  a  Relevance  Cycle  that  captures  the  interaction  between  the  environment  or  context  of  the   problem  domain  and  the  core  design  activities  (cf.  Hevner  et  al.   2004).  These  cycles  were   incorporated into our design science research.     In  the  first  phase  of  the  DR  project  described  below   the  Rigour  Cycle  was  underpinned  by  our   adoption  of  the  SBVR  standard  from  the  Object  Management  Group  (OMG)  in  the  design  of  our   methodology. Design Science (DS) theory was at one level  informed by Formalism (West  2004) and   the  BungeWandWeber  (BWW)  Ontology  (Wand  &  Weber   1993   1995   2002)   but  chiefly  by  the   concepts   tenets   and  abstract  models  provided  by  the  SBVR  standard.  The  Design  Cycle  (Hevner    2007;  cf.  Hevner  et  al.   2004)  involved  an  iterative  approach  to  the  Build  Design  Artefact  and   Processes  Phase   and  Evaluation  phase.  The  first  Phase  of  the  DR  study  was  governed  by  a   hermeneutic  approach  to  developing  both  constituent  Constructs  and  Models  based  on  a  pragmatic   phenomenological  hermeneutic theory  of  interpretation  developed  by  team  members  (AbiLahoud  et   al. 2014  cf. Winograd & Flores  1986; Fonseca & Martin  2007). Thus  DS thinking informed the DR   process and underpinned its rigour.     This  Design  Research  study  commenced  in  February  2013.  The  first  phase  of  our  study  saw   immersion in the philosophy  tenets and processes involved in the application of  the SBVR standard   and direct engagement with the designers of the SBVR standard. Following this  detailed requirements   were  gathered   scoping  research  conducted   and  proofs  of  concept  (PoCs)  developed.  These  were   component activities in Hevner’s (2007) Rigour  Relevance and Design Cycles. While the focus was   on  the  Design  Cycle   the  nature  of  the  study  saw  natural  movement  into  and  between  Rigour  and   Relevance Cycles due to its strong foundation on the OMG SBVR standard and engagement with  and   feedback from  toptier banks in the US and Europe  an international legal firm  the legal informatics   research community in the US and Europe  and members of the EDM Council. In the second phase    the DR solution to the aforementioned problems was iteratively developed. The initial move through   the Rigour Cycle saw the SBVR standard being adopted as the DSR Knowledge Base. In a movement   through  the  Relevance  and  Design  Cycles   the  Evaluation  phase  was  conducted  internally  with   industry  coresearchers   and  externally  with  members  of  the  Object  Management  Group   where  the   DR artefacts were presented to members of the Enterprise Data Management Council (EDM Council)    Finance  Domain  Task  Force  (FDTF)   Ontology  PSIG  and  SBVR  community   at  OMG  Technical   Meetings  in  2013  and  2014.  In  May  2015   the  EDM  Council  CEO  Mike  Atkin  publically   acknowledged the contribution of the SBVRbased methodology to over 100 members from London   Citybased  GSIBs   UK  DSIBs   GRC  vendors   including  Chief  Data  Officers   Chief  Information   Officers and other practitioners.                5          3     Design  Rigour and Relevance Cycle Phase 12     Despite  being  one  of  the  most  ISintensive  industry  sectors   the  financial  industry  lags  behind  other   business  domains  in  the  application  of  semantic  technologies.  However   all  that  is  changing  as  the   financial  industry  is   through  the  Enterprise  Data  Management  Council  developing  a  common   vocabulary  called  the  Financial  Industry  Business  Ontology  (FIBO)  (Bennett   2011   2013;  Atkins    2015). We have previously adduced evidence to the effect that this DR initiative is unique in terms of   process and product. However  we argue that it transcends—in terms of purpose  detail and rigour—  extant approaches to capturing  the  semantics  of  the  regulatory  domain  in financial  services.  Support   for  this  contention  comes  from  our  previously  published  research  (AbiLahoud  et  al.  2013   2014)    presentations to  and interactions with  academics and practitioners at the OMG and  the International   Conference on Legal Knowledge and Information Systems (AbiLahoud et al. 2013  2014  O’Brien et   al.  2014)   and  contemporaneous  published  work  on  SBVR  (Ramakrishna  &  Paschke   2014).  The   following section 3.1 presents the Knowledge Base that informed this study’s Rigour Cycle  Sections   3.2 then delineates the DSR study in terms of the design artefacts       3.1     SBVR as a Knowledge Base for the Rigour Cycle     The Semantic Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR—Object Management Group  2015) is an ISO   TC 37compliant Formal Terminological Dictionary (the SBVR Vocabulary) used to define a coherent   set of interconnected business concepts. It is not merely a list of terms and definitions  however.  It is   much  more  as  it  enables  the  creation  of  a  Rulebook  that  contains  business  policies   rules  etc.  that   govern organisational activities and processes. Based on the principles of formal and firstorder logic    it was developed to enable business practitioners to capture the unambiguous meaning of the concepts   and  entities  that  constitute  a  business  domain  and  the  rules  that  govern  the  relationships  and   behaviours  of  such  entities.  Thus   SBVR  could   as  its  authors  intended   be  used  to  cross  the  chasm   between business and software engineering domains by providing a common vocabulary and a formal    but  businessoriented  mechanism   for  expressing  business  rules.  SBVR  is  part  of  the  Computation   Independent  Model  of  the  OMG’s  Model  Driven  Architecture  and  supports  the  use  of  Structured   English (SE) as a machineindependent natural language. Thus  it has a structured syntax for capturing   business  vocabularies  and business  rules  by  representing  both  structural  and  behavioural  dimensions   of  business  processes  and  activities  in  addition  to  policies  and  rules  that  govern  actors’  in   organisational  contexts.  SBVR  is  being  applied  in  research  and  practice  as   for  example   To  extract   business  vocabularies  from  business  process  models  (Njonko  et  al.  2014);  As  a  controlled  natural   language for business rule specifications (Njonko et al. 2014; De Jesus & De Melo  2014); and as a   standardbased  approach  for  knowledge  transformation  and  knowledge  representation  of  patent  law   (Ramakrishna  &  Paschke   2014).  Its  use in  the  financial industry  as  a  business natural language  has   been  indicated  by  Chapin  (2012)   while  our  previous  published  work  and  presentations  to  OMG   Technical  Meetings  indicate  its  potential  as  a  regulatory  natural  language  (AbiLahoud  et  al.  2013    2014). Its use has been popularised among practitioners by Rob van Haarst (2013) in his instructional   SBVR Made Easy  Business Vocabulary and Rules as a Critical Asset.      An  SBVR  ISO  TC  37compliant  formal  terminological  dictionary  and  rulebook—i.e.  business   vocabulary and rules—is comprised of the following        Noun Concepts—these correspond to things or entities that populate a business (or regulatory)     domain       Verb Concepts—these capture the relationships between entities expressed as Noun Concepts       Definitional  Rules—these  constrain  the  relationships  between  noun  concepts  and  are     expressed as Verb Concepts        Behavioural rules—these govern business activities in which Noun Concepts play roles               6          Thus  SBVR contains the noun concepts  verb concepts  definitional rules and behavioural rules for a   specific  business   business  domain   and  regulatorybusiness  domain  such  as   for  example   Anti  MoneyLaundering (AML) or MiFID 2  the Revised Markets in Financial Instruments Directive.      It is interesting to note that SBVR is itself defined according to the SBVR specification; significantly    any  domainspecific  terminological  dictionary  and  related  rulebook  is  an  extension  of  SBVR.   However   SBVR  does  not  include  behavioural  rules   as  such.  SBVR  is  simply  a  terminological   dictionary that defines what SBVR is  including  constituent concepts such as  what  behavioural rules   are and how to specify them.      According to the SBVR specification  a terminological dictionary and associated rulebook should be   complete and consistent        Each  noun  concept  should  be  defined  explicitly  or  adopted  from  an  authoritative  source—  alternatively it may be acknowledged as implicitly understood in that it is the everyday natural   language meaning of the term;       Only defined noun concepts may play constituent roles in verb concepts;       Rules should be built from defined  verb concepts only and articulated using  a defined set of     structure elements such as an obligation  necessity  if … then  that  at least and so on.     SBVR does not have a normative syntax; any syntax that has adequate expressive power is acceptable.   SBVR is specified in SBVR Structured English (SE)  a simplified version of natural English. SBVR  SE is probably the most widely used syntax for domainspecific SBVR models. Thus  the conceptual   model  is  separated  from  the  external  representation   and  any  (suitable  simplified)  natural  language   may  be  used.  Other  dimensions  to  the  application  of  our  DSR  Knowledge  Base  and  the  movement   through the Rigour Cycle are integrated into the following sections which describe Phase 1 and Phase   2 of our DSR study.     3.2     Iterating Though the Design Cycle  Phase 1 Methodology and Guidelines     In  January  2013   when  the  first  phase  of  the  present  DR  study  commenced   the  team’s  4  legal   researchers  began  their  training  in  the  Semantics  of  Business  Vocabulary  and  Rules  (SBVR)   specification  from  the  Object  Management  Group  (OMG).  This  culminated  in  a  2day  workshop   provided by two of the chief authors of the OMG specification in February 2013. They subsequently   collaborated with the team in the design of the first PoC for U.S. AntiMoney Laundering regulations   drawn from the Bank Secrecy Act and associated Federal Register Final Rules. The then objective of   expressing U.S. regulations thus was to transform them into a business natural language  such that  (1)   Nonlawyers from the financial industry could read and understand the rules; (2) Provide an audit trail   for the formation of organizational governance policies; (3) Enable software or knowledge engineers   to  transform  from  SBVR  to  OWL  vocabularies  and  other  formalisms   without  encountering   translation problems; and (4) Contribute to the development of the EDM Council’s Financial Industry   Business Ontology (FIBO). It was from this experience which emerged the Regulatory Interpretation   Methodology now described.               7                     Figure 1  Iterative Design Cycle phase 1  Regulatory Interpretation Methodology and Guidelines     The  focus  of  the  initial  transition   which  in  this  case   is  the  U.S.  AntiMoney  Laundering  (AML)   regulations – Title 31of the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR) Chapter X. The latter is over 100 000   words  of  source  text  before  following  external  references  to  related  texts  in  the  United  States  Code   (USC).  The  U.S.  CFR  is  an  annual  codification  of  U.S.  Federal  Register  Final  Rules.  Generally    Federal  Register  Final  Rules  are  selfcontained. Thus   a  final  rule  adds to  or  amends  sections of the   CFR  related  to  one  or  more  regulated  domains   for  example  AML  subdomains  such  as  Money   Services  Businesses   Reports  of  Foreign  Financial  Accounts   etc.  Beginning  with  such  foundational   texts  presents  legal  SMEs  with  the  opportunity  to  limit  the  scope  of  the  knowledge  representation   using  SBVR—that  is   in  the  creation  of  a  regulatory  natural  language.  This  commences  with  the   identification of key sections in the legal or regulatory text. Figure 1 presents a high level view of the   iterative design process which led to the development of the Methodology  Guidelines and Technical   Specification  which  we  use  to  create  our  Regulatory  Natural  Language.  Significantly   it  also   underpinned the design of our DSR IT artefact – Ganesha.        We now describe the iterative design process that underpinned the development of our SBVRbased   Methodology  and  Guidelines  for  legal  and  financial  SMEs  to  help  them  identify   interpret   stylise    disambiguate  clarify the meaning of a regulation and how it is then represented as a regulatory natural   language  expressed  in  the  form  of  SBVRcompliant  vocabulary  and  rules.  The  SBVR  specification   enables such SMEs to structure natural text around concepts specified in the SBVR Metamodel  which   may then be expressed as an XML grammar (XMLSchema). However  the SBVR metamodel is just   that—it  may  be   as  we  have  illustrated   modified  to  represent  domainspecific  knowledge.  As   previously indicated  the two main categories of concepts in the SBVR Metamodel are Noun Concepts   and Verb Concepts.        Noun Concepts are a groups of entities in the regulatory or business domain of discourse. For   example  regulator  financial institution  etc. Individual Noun Concepts are a particular type of   Noun  Concept  representing  actual  entities  or  individuals.  For  example   Securities  and   Exchange Commission (Regulator)  RegulationW (Regulation)  Wells Fargo Bank (Regulated   Entity)  and so on.       Verb  Concepts  (or  Fact  Types)  capture  the  relationships  between  Noun  Concepts.  For   example  the Verb Concept ‘money services business submits suspicious activity’ captures the               8          submission relationship between the noun concepts money services business and a suspicious   activity report.     Typically   an  SBVR  knowledge  base  or  semantics  repository  has  two  parts   a  Vocabulary  and  a   Rulebook.  An  SBVR  Vocabulary  is  a  Terminological  Dictionary  where  entries  are  termed  Noun   Concepts   while  relationships  are  captured  using  Verb  Concepts.  It  also  contains  Definitional  Rules   which act to constrain these relationships using alethic modalities (modifiers such that ‘it is necessary   that’   etc.)  and  related  advices  of  possibility.  An  SBVR  Rulebook  is  a  set  of  guidance  statements   containing  Behavioural  Rules  in  the form  of  deontic modalities  (e.g. it  is  obligatory  that   must  etc )   and advices of permission.      To be compliant   an  SBVR  instance  should  be  complete  and  consistent. This is  determined  by  three   basic principles  (1) Noun Concepts should be explicitly defined from the text  from other authoritative   sources  or recognized as implicitlyunderstood by the SMEs; (2) Previously defined Noun Concepts   are used to construct Verb Concepts; while (3) Verb Concepts are the basic ingredients in Definitional   Rules and Behavioural Rules. It must be noted that SBVR does not have a normative syntax; however    the OMG specification includes SBVR Structured English (SBVRSE)  which is a relaxed convention   based  on  natural  language.  SBVRSE  uses  text  styles  to  visually  identify  elements  from  the  SBVR   Metamodel.  In  the  following  example  we  adopt  a  typical  style  to  express  examples  in  SBVR  for   monochrome  publication.  As  with  software  programming  tools  and  integrated  development   environments   metamodel  elements  are  stylised  using  different  colours  and  italics.  In  the  basic   approach   Noun  Concepts  are  underlined  with  a  single  line.  Individual  Noun  Concepts  are  doubled   underlined. The verb part of speech of a Verb Concept is in italicbold font face. Keywords are in a   bold  font  face  and  they  are  usually  the  natural  language  representation  of  logical  operators   logical   quantifiers  modal operators and selected articles and determiners.     Applying the SBVR Metamodel provides legal and/or financial  SMEs with the ability  to apply their   experiential and technical knowledge to transform a complex legal rule into a human  and ultimately   machine readable vocabulary. Hence  in reading the text  legal SMEs focus on identifying modalities;   that  is   the  obligations   prohibitions   etc.   specified  or  referenced  by  the  text.  Following  this   we   propose the following activities  (1) The stylizing activity consists of indicating which element in the   SBVR metamodel a term (or set of terms) corresponds to while undertaking a linguistic analysis of the   text. This is achieved by applying the appropriate SBVRSE font styles to entities as Noun Concepts   and  Verb  concepts;  (2)  The  disambiguation  activity  consists  of  consolidating  and  identifying  the   explicit meaning of the text; and (3) The clarification activity which identifies the implicit meaning of   the  text  in  order  to  formulate  guidance  when  the  regulatory  intent  is  not  clear  (subsequent  to  each   disambiguation activity). Each of these activities demand legal experiential and technical knowledge.   The Methodology and Guidelines aid these activities.      3.2.1     Use Case based on MiFID 2     In  order  to  validate  the  extended  SBVR  Metamodel   legal  researchers  conducted  a  short  experiment   transforming  a  legal  text  into  a  RNL  by  following  the  processes  set  out  in  the  methodology  and   guidelines.  To  ensure  its  applicability  across  different  financial  regulatory  domains   a  decision  was   taken to move away from the antimoney laundering domain which informed the original development   of the methodology and guidelines. The researchers were directed towards MiFID 2 by a tier1 bank   and a leading international legal firm due to its impending enactment that will have a direct effect on   all international financial entities trading into and within the EU.     The  test  involved  two  legal  researchers   working  independently  on  the  transformation  from  the   regulatory text to the metamodel  and one knowledge engineer using the metamodel to build the XML  enriched version of the law. At the end of the test  the two resulting transformations were compared to   measure the consistency of the outputs.                    9               Figure 2  Excerpt of a section from a relevant MiFIR Article     The  preliminary  phase  was  implemented  by  identifying  the  themes  contained  within  the  MiFID   domain (any legal or regulatory text concerned with MiFID); these themes were then assigned to the   articles of MiFID 2 and MiFIR. The identification of themes in the regulatory text allows for a more   dynamic  (machine  assisted)  knowledge  exploration and  retrieval. While  the  assignment  of themes  is   not  a  hard  task  by  itself   the  consistency  of  the  resulting  classifications  is  of  primary  importance   towards  an  effective  highlevel   generic  and  jurisdictionally  independent  categorization   applicable   across an entire domain. The resulting classifications were different  yet consistent with each other so   as to allow a common assignment of articles within the identified themes  with the only issue coming   to  the  fore  when  choosing  the  legal  perspective  to  adopt  for  the  classification  (e.g.  legal  subject   involved  regulated activity  the addressee of the law).     After choosing  the section to transform  the legal researchers proceeded to stylise  disambiguate and   clarify the regulatory text by performing the following activities         divide the section into segments;                     rewrite  segments  in  plain  English   producing  selfcontained  sentences  and  fleshing  out   references to external documents or to other parts of the same document;      identify the modality of the rule (obligation/prohibition/permission);      identify and define terms and relations between terms.     The resulting transformations carried out by each of the legal researchers differed in number of rules   and vocabulary  yet this is not a weakness of the methodology or of the guidelines  it proves in fact   that they allow for different approaches  not constraining the legal expert into a limited language.     Here is an example of a rule resulting from the transformation of a regulatory text (Article 3 of MiFIR    see Figure 2 for the original text fragment)      Each of the noun concepts and verb concepts of the rule are described in the vocabulary part of   the SBVRcompliant RNL transformation. For example  this is the entry for “market operator”                     10          This formalization is also represented in machinereadable format (XML)  in the following fashion           the  business  of  a      <name>market operator</name>   <definition>is  a  person  or  persons  who  manages  and/or  operates     <nounConcept nounConceptID="N1.1" status="underConstruction">                                                                      regulated market and may be the regulated market itself.</definition>                                                                       <usedInRule>R3.1.1</usedInRule>   <usedInRule>R3.1.2</usedInRule>   <usedInRule>R3.1.3</usedInRule>   <usedInRule>R3.1.4</usedInRule>   <usedInRule>R3.2.1</usedInRule>   <usedInRule>R3.3.1</usedInRule>   <conceptType>      </conceptType>   <generalConcept>      </generalConcept>   <source>Article 4(1)(18) of Directive 2014/65/EU </source>   <definitionContext> Directive 2014/65/EU; Regulation 600/2014 </definitionContext>   <synonym/>   <dictionaryBasis/>   <linkToNecessityStatement>RR4.18</linkToNecessityStatement>   <entryLevelMeta>         </entryLevelMeta>                                                                    </nounConcept>     <subjectMatterExpert>Leona O’Brien</subjectMatterExpert>   <dateInterpreted>20150305</dateInterpreted>     <type>GeneralNounConcept</type>     <name>person</name>     The  iterative  design  process  in this  phase  primarily  involved  the  creation  of  SBVRbased  MS Word   Templates to support the stylizing and disambiguation activities and to underpin our nascent SBVR  based  semantic  repository   and  the  XML  version  of  the  repository  was  written  by  the  knowledge   engineer.  Such  (mostly)  manual  process  confirmed  to  be  positively  timeconsuming  and  highly   complex  (being  difficult  for  the  legal  expert  to  keep  track  of  the  many  implicit  links  established   between the rules and the vocabulary entries)  further underlining the need for a specific tool assisting   the  legal  experts  in  the  transformation.  The  artefacts  we  produced  using  antimoney  laundering   legislation and MiFID 2 (and its associated regulation MiFIR) contribute towards this goal by helping   software engineering researchers design DSR IT  which is explained in the following section.     3.3     Ganesha  Phase 2 DSR IT Artefact      Given the scale of regulations and rules being produced globally  we realised that MS Word Templates   and hypertext links would not scale up to the task. Thus  once R&D funding had been approved and   allocated   2  software  engineers  were  recruited  with  an  aggressive  6  month  schedule  of  deliverables.   The initial stage of Phase 2 had a newly appointed Principal Investigator collaborate with the research   fellow   a  postdoctoral  researcher  and  a  legal  researcher  to  undertake  the  initial  iterations  using  an   Agile  software  development  approach.  One  of  the  software  engineers  was  from  India—in               11          brainstorming the design and purpose of the proposed IT artefact it was christened Ganesha—the ‘God   of wisdom  knowledge and new beginnings’. The first task in the design of the DSR IT Artefact was to   design and develop an XML schema to tag the SBVR Metamodel. This not insignificant task is now   outlined.     Figure  3  illustrates  the  form  and  function  of  the  Ganesha  application.  Legal  documents  in  PDF  or   XML texts are imported into Ganesha by legal Subject Matter Experts. These are then presented for   interpretation and the iterative process of stylising  disambiguating and clarifying begins. The system   will  highlight  candidate  terms—both  noun  concepts  and  verb  concepts—if  they  have  already  been   defined. Where multiple definitions from different jurisdictions are present in the knowledge base  the   SME  will  select  the  most  relevant.  Ganesha  will   however   maintain  and  present  links  to  alternative   definitions and the source texts. All actions of the SME will be recorded in the form of MetaData. This   will permit versioning and document management. Thus  the SME will be enabled to create regulatory   vocabularies in the form of noun and verb concepts. These will then form the building blocks of the   rules   which  will  be  drafted  interactively  by  SMEs.    Ganesha’s  SBVR  Logic  Layer  will  enforce   compliance with the SBVR standard  as extended by this DR study. As straightforward as this sounds    the devil of detail is hidden in the complexity of the underlying SBVRbased XML schema (presented   in the following subsection).      Figure 3   Ganesha – Form and Function               What  the  legal  SME  will  create  is  a  cumulative  vocabulary   based  on  regulations   but  also   incorporating terms from the financial industry. Initially  the meanings and constructions on financial   concepts  imposed  by  the  regulators  will  be  included;  however   these  will  be  linked  to  the  nascent               12     StyliseClarifyLegislation  RulesRegulationsPresent sourceregulationsEnable SME to Stylise Disambiguate  and Clarify  Import in XML/PDFDisambiguateSubject Matter ExpertsSBVR XML Data Store(Berkeley DB)Knowledge EngineerSystemsDesignMethodology andGuidelines SBVRStandardis applied in Legal or FinancialSMEsKnowledge Management&TrainingPresentation LayerSBVR Logic LayerPersistence Layer     vocabulary  being  produced  by  the  EDM  Council’s  Financial  Industry  Business  Ontology  (FIBO)    which is expressed in the web ontology language (OWL). Our interactions with the OMG indicate that   OWL  to  SBVR  transformations  are  possible  (and  viceversa)   thus  linking  and  integration  with   industry standard vocabularies and taxonomies are possible. To this end  it is intended to exploit such   links to enrich and widen the scope of the vocabularies. Likewise  we have investigated  at the behest   of an international consulting firm  the possibility of capturing the semantics and rules in International   Financial  Reporting  Standard  (IFRS)  on  Financial  Instruments  or  IFRS  9  and  linking  to  the  IFRS   Taxonomy.  Our  scoping  research  indicated  that  this  is  possible.  Indeed   having  both  regulatory  and   standardsbased  (which  have  a  regulatory  dimension)  compliance imperatives  in  a  single  knowledge   base. Feedback from industry indicates that this is immensely attractive and valuable proposition  for   reasons will be presently adduced.     Use cases for Ganesha have been provided by toptier banks  an international legal firm focusing on   the financial industry and FinTech companies. An illustrative small example from our MiFID 2 proof   of concept is presented in section 3.2.1. While we have articulated the Rolls Royce solution above  the   current needs of banks and financial institutions are much  more fundamental. There are currently no   solutions available on the market that enable legal and financial subject matter experts capture  store   and  transfer/share  knowledge  of  regulatory  compliance  imperatives  according  to  an  international   standard and map these onto business vocabularies and rules to enhance governance  risk management   and  regulatory  compliance.  Indeed   it  is  our  experience   and  that  of  regulators   that  financial   institutions  are  deficient in  the  basic  capabilities  of capturing  business  vocabularies  and  rules. Thus    Ganesha  provides  the  capabilities  to  present  to  legal  or  financial  SMEs  disambiguated  and  clarified   vocabularies and rules in a regulatory natural language that is complete  logical and free of legalese    complexity   and  ambiguity.  Our  methodology  and  guidelines  have  proven  that  this  is  possible—  Ganesha provides the functionality to automate and informate this.  In addition  while legal opinion or   guidance  on  regulatory  compliance  is  typically  presented  in  Word  or  PDF  format   such  documents   cannot be queried in a meaningful way. Likewise  GRC vendors typically use SQLbased repositories   which do not support querying of unstructured data such as text. Xquery is to an XML database such   as  Berkeley   what  SQL  is to  a  relational  database  such  as  Oracle.  An  XQuery  expression  can  query   many  XML  documents  simultaneously  and  return  more  valuable  information  with  greater  precision   and granularity than mere word searches or SQL queries (cf. McCreary & Kelly  2013).      The  sophisticated  tagging   in  a  regulatory  natural  language   of  SBVRcompliant  XML  documents in   Ganesha  provides  powerful  capabilities  to  extract   transform  and  load  regulatory  compliance   information  into  a  user  interface  for  the  purpose  of  knowledge  sharing  or  training  inexperienced   personnel. In both the desktop and webbased (see below) versions  all vocabulary and rule elements   with be presented in hypertext links rendering them highly navigable with the ability to explore  drill   down and follow links to related content  up to and including  the original source regulations and rules    and their chapters  articles  sections and paragraphs. Furthermore  our intention to add functionality to   transform from SBVRXML to OWL provides the ability for semantic queries and inferencing of the   knowledge base. Enroute to this will be the provision of graphing functionality for visualisation. Thus    vocabularies and rules will be mapped and multiple relationships highly visible.          Another use case harks back to the original reason for the institution of SBVR by the OMG to help   solve both the vocabulary and translation problems identified earlier. With one notable exception  tool   support for  SBVR is  absent  from  the  OMG’s  catalogue.  Hence   one  of the use cases  identified  by  a   toptier bank is to have domain specific SBVRcompliant tool to enable software engineers understand   better the business and regulatory vocabulary and rules such that they can be embedded in applications   and databases. Similarly  IT governance can be enabled by identifying  such as in the above paragraph   of MiFID 2  the mandated information provision functionality of investment banking systems. Thus    such systems can help address operational risk where IT is concerned.                  13          3.3.1     A Foundational SBVRbased XML Schema     This  section  therefore  begins  by  introducing  and  explaining  the  XML  schema  that  underpins  the   architecture  of  the  DSR  IT  Artefact  codenamed  Ganesha.  The  schema  provides  details  about   regulatory  document  structures   elements   and  attributes.  Design  guides  and  conceptual  assumptions   that were made in the development of the schemas are discussed  as well as an overview of the XML   document using this schema. The objective of this phase of the DSR project is         To design solutions that capture regulatory compliance vocabularies and rules.       To  design  an  application  to  help  create  a  semantics  repository  in  the  domain  of  regulatory     compliance based on the Semantics of Business Vocabulary and Rules (SBVR) specification.       The schema is used as a foundational model for Ganesha. This model is based on SBVR and is   utilised to  generate  an  SBVRcompliant  XML  document  store.  SBVR structures  natural text   around concepts from the SBVR Metamodel which is expressed as an XML grammar (XML  Schema).     As  indicated   SBVRcompliant  Microsoft Word  Templates  were  used  by  legal SMEs  to create  RNL   representations  of regulatory  rules.  However  among  other  things   Word  documents  are  not  machine   readable and it is not possible to directly validate the correctness of knowledge representations.     The design of Ganesha’s XML schema makes it easier to enforce content structure and to validate the   correctness of data. The XML schema describes the data facets (restrictions on data) and data patterns   (data  formats)   and  ensures  a  mutual  understanding  of  the  content  between  legal  SME  and  software   engineers. Based on this schema  SBVRbased XML documents can be generated  stored in an XML  based document store  and subsequently queried to identify specific information about regulations and   rules.  To  the  best  of  our  knowledge   this  is  the  first  XML  schema  in  the  domain  of  regulatory   compliance  based  on  the  SBVRXML  Schema.    The  schema  follows  the  SBVR  model  in  that  it   structures text around a vocabulary and a rulebook. We extended this with a metamodel to capture the   rules  noun concepts  verb concepts and metadata in the regulatory compliance domain.               Figure 4  JAXB Architecture          The XSD (XML Schema Definition) for regulatory compliance has three main elements  RuleBook  a   Vocabulary  (Noun  Concepts  and  Verb  Concepts)   MetaData  and  Other  Data  elements.  This  schema   plays a key role in the architecture of the design science research IT artefact  which is next described.               14          3.3.2     IT Artefact Detailed Design     In the design of the IT artefact  the following challenges had to be met. The XML schema contains a   rich set of connected concepts  and extends the  standard SBVR schema. This gives a comprehensive   base for modelling regulatory concepts  but is challenging from a software engineering point of view   in terms of complexity. In addition  the XML schema is a much richer model than that possible with a   UML  Class  Diagram  or  an  EntityRelationship  model   and  this  has  to  be  reflected  in  the  code  to   support the model     Given  the  novelty  of  the  approach  and  the  demand  for  a  usable  IT  artefact  within  an  aggressive   timeframe  the architecture of the system would need to be flexible and designed for possible changes   in  requirements.  To  this  end   it  was  decided  that  the  best  way  to  leverage  the  richness  of  the  XML   schema   was  to  use  Java  Architecture  for  XML  Binding  (JAXB)  to  reflect  the  XML  schema  in  a   comprehensive java model – this is using the Domain Model software design pattern. (See Figure 4.)   Any  changes  to  the  XML  schema   can  then  be  reflected  with  ease  in  the  java  model.  The  JAXB   technology generates a set of tagged java classes which can be persisted to XML and marshalled back   from an XML file or database with minimum effort.                                        Figure 5  Iterative IT Artefact Detailed Architectural Design     15          To cater for the constraints outlined above  the software is being constructed in three phases – desktop    database  enabled  and  web  enabled  Ganesha  versions.  Figure  5  illustrates  an  approach  to  IT  artefact   design that it both iterative and incremental. The following figure illustrates the incremental evolution   of  Ganesha  from  the  desktop  version   to  databaseenabled  version  to  a  multitier  web  version  to  be   deployed  as  SaaS  during  2015.  The  technical  design  of  the  IT  artefact  is  based  on  established   architecture  and  design  patterns  (cf.  Knoernschild  2012;  McCreary  &  Kelly   2013).  The  desktop   version  was  designed  to  be  full  featured  in  order  to  transition  through  the  Relevance  Cycle  and   maximise  the  fit  with  enduser  needs  in  capturing  enduser  requirements.  The  database  version   ensured  the  application  would  scale  to  enterpriselevel  requirements.  Finally   the  webbased  version   was  originally  designed  as  SoftwareasaService  multiinstance  application   while  a  multitenancy   version is in the planning stage.     4     Conclusions     This  design  research  (DR)  study  makes  several  valuable  contributions  to  research  and  practice.  Its   pragmatic   practitioneroriented  approach  presents  an  approach  to  DR  that  applies  the  philosophy   (formal   firstorder   deontic  and  alethic  logic)  and  metamodel  of  the  SBVR  standard  in  order  to   underpin its rigour. This is further enhanced by the researchers’ direct engagement with the standard’s   creators in the Object Management Group. The teams’ network of research relationships with leading   academic researchers in the area of legal informatics also places a check on the rigour cycle activities.    In an industry that is seeking to increasingly standardise both process and product  including creating a   common language (Bennett 2011  2012)  looking to a theoreticallyinformed standard to inform rigour   also  makes  the  outputs  of  such  DR  more  relevant.  Engaging  with  the  broader  community  of   practitioners through membership and engagement with an industry association such as the financial   industry’s Enterprise Data Management Council  also enhanced the relevance of the DR study  in that   the researcher team were regularly engaging with tier1 and tier2 retail and investment banks. Also    specific  research  engagements  had  the  research  team  work  with  FinTech  companies.  This  approach   ensured that the  Design  Cycle  was  tightly  coupled  with  both  Rigour  and  Relevance  Cycles   as  there   was  a  natural  movement  into  and  between  Rigour  and  Design   and  Design  and  Relevance  Cycles.   While the broader engagements with practitioners were important  it was the specific engagement with   and  feedback  from  one  toptier  bank   an  international  legal  firm   and  the  legal  informatics  research   community  in  the  US  and  Europe  that  shaped  the  outputs  of  the  first  phase  which  produced  design   artefacts  such  as the  regulatory  interpretation  methodology  and  guidelines.  It  must  be  noted  that the   methodology and guidelines were designed in an iterative fashion and applied across jurisdictions (US   and Europe) and problem domains (AML  MiFID  and IFRS 9).      In  the  second  phase   the  DR  solution  –  Ganesha –  was  also iteratively  developed.  Again   standards  based  design  patterns  and  architectures  were  adopted.  However   innovation  and  contribution  in  the   design of IT artefact  was in the translation of the methodology and  guidelines into the SBVR Logic   Layer and the design of the complex SBVRXML Data Schema. Here  the design of the application   was informed by the use cases outlined in the previous section  thus ensuring its relevance. The design   also  factored  in  the  need  to  scale  the  application  and  deliver  it  as  SoftwareasaService.  Thus   in  a   global  regulatory  environment   where   for  example   domestic  regulations  are  now  international  in   scope  (Brummer   2010)   an  IS  such  as  Ganesha  can  be  used  to  create  a  common  understanding  of   regulatory rules from London to New York across the same financial institution. It is cautionary and   incredible to believe that this is not currently possible.                  16          References     ABILAHOUD  E.
