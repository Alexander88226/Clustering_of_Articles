The crowdsource panel includesbankers credit union executives industry analysts advisors authors andfintech followers from Asia Africa North America South and CentralAmerica Europe the Middle East and Australia.We used the findings from our panel as the foundation to develop aglobal survey of executives involved in the financial services industry which provided aprioritization of our trends. Our global survey also provided an opportunity to do an endofyearreview of last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s projections. Finally the survey collected insight into strategic priorities for2018 and the fintech players that the industry believes will have the greatest impact in theupcoming year.By collecting insights from leading influencers ranking the trends using an industry survey andincluding extensive analysis around each trend we have developed the most comprehensiveannual trend report in the banking industry. For the third consecutive year the research analysisand Digital Banking Report entitled 2018 Retail Banking Trends and Predictions aresponsored by Kony Inc.. The report will be available right after Christmas.Top 10 Retail Banking Trends for 2018The ranking of the top 10 trends and predictions was done by providing a list of trends identifiedby our crowdsourced panel and asking banks credit unions and the supplier community globallyto provide their top 3 predictions for 2018. Of the organizations that provided their top 3 trendsthe highest ranking prediction was that the industry was going to remove friction from the\\x0ccustomer journey (61%). The next two most mentioned trends were the improved use of data andadvanced analytics and refinements in multichannel delivery (mentioned by 57% and 42%respectively).Interestingly with the exception of one trend (testing and use of blockchain technology) thetrends and order of these trends were the same as last year. Last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trend of investment ininnovation did not make the top 10 this year. The importance and underlying components of eachtrend differed in this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research compared to the predictions for 2017.The fact that the list of trends identified by the financial services industry has remained relativelyconsistent could be a symptom of a greater problem. The banking industry is moving much tooslow and legacy firms are failing to differentiate themselves. According to Forrester \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn a marketwhere onethird of all customers say \\xe2\\x80\\x98all banks are basically the same\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it would make sense forexecutives and their teams to obsess over how to differentiate. Unfortunately 2018 will look morelike a digital arms race between warring incumbents than a year in which firms find new ways tospecialize and create value for customers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dRegarding changes in emphasis for this year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trends removing friction from the customerjourney increased in importance from last year with 61% of organizations placing this trend in thetop three compared to 54% last year. The trend around the use and application of data alsoincreased in importance from last year with 57% of those surveyed placing this in the top 3 for2018 compared to 53% in predictions for 2017. Other notable shifts of importance included agreater belief that open banking APIs would be important less emphasis on regulatory changesand a greater belief that advanced technology would have an impact in 2018.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report\\x0cTop 10 Strategic Priorities for 2018When we asked financial services organizations worldwide about their top three strategic prioritiesfor 2018 there was a significant change in priorities compared to last year\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research. While theorder of the top three priorities remained the same as last year the priority of reducing operatingcosts dropped from 41% last year to only 32% for 2018. At the same time the priority ofinvestment in innovation dropped from the 4th position to 7th with the number of firmsmentioning innovation falling from 26% to 22%.The biggest jumps in strategic priority in 2018 were seen with the emphasis on automating corebusiness processes (up 13%) and recruiting talent (up 8%). These shifts illustrate the growingimportance of becoming a digital bank and the impact of this transformation on the types ofemployees required to address new challenges.\\x0cHere is what some of our crowdsource panel had to say about 2018.\\xe2\\x80\\x9c2018 will see developments across the banking industry including a more matureapplication of fintech solutions greater use of digital payments the opening up ofbanking thanks to API built architectures the first significant progress withblockchain technology and the harnessing of AI and RPA solutions.

Removing Friction from the Customer JourneyWhile the banking industry has talked about \\xe2\\x80\\x98customercentricity\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and\\xe2\\x80\\x98improving the customer experience\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for decades most organizations havehad difficulty breaking down product silos or leveraging internal data todeliver a contextual digital experience. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLongterm sustainable growth in thebanking industry seems only possible with a radical departure from a salesand productobsessed mindset to one of genuine customer centricity andfurther rationalization of strategies to target the right markets customer segments and solutions\\xe2\\x80\\x9dstates Deloitte.According to the 85page report Improving the Customer Experience in Banking the objectiveof delivering a positive customer experience has become secondary to other bank prioritiesresulting in a transactional banking relationship for the customer. For financial organizations tochange this dynamic and meet the evolving needs of today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customers there are five areas thathave emerged as crucial priorities\\x0c1.  Move focus of digital engagement from cost reduction to experience enhancement.2.  Leverage advanced analytics machine learning and contextual engagement to provide ahighly personalized experience.3.  Allow the consumer to engage with their bank on the channels they prefer at the times theywant to engage.4.  Transition advisory and sales activities from being reactive to being proactive.5.  Engage endtoend throughout the customer journey from shopping to account opening toonboarding and through relationship expansion.A positive customer experience is channel sensitive with customers placing a higher weight ondigital customer experiences more than physical or call center channels. In fact in a recent J.D.Power survey the largest banking organizations improved in overall customer satisfaction whilemidsize banks declined and regional banks plateaued. This was attributed primarily to improvedmobile and online satisfaction.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends ReportAs the banking industry responds to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAge of the Individual\\xe2\\x80\\x9d big data and advanced analyticswill define the winners from the losers.

Expanding Use of Data and Advanced AnalyticsOver the past 18 months the Digital Banking Report has seen a growinggap between the organizations that are embracing the power ofcontextual insights and the potential of digital transformation vs. thosethat continue doing things the same way they have in the past. There isno reason to see this gap narrowing in 2018.Bestinclass financial institutions will apply advanced analytics andartificial intelligence to increase automation improve personalizationreduce costs enhance the customer experience and even assist with compliance. The potentialof advanced analytics grows exponentially over time. Each iteration additional data source andperformance measurement results in learning that enhances the accuracy of the predictivemodels.

Improving Multichannel Delivery\\x0cBanks and credit unions will see less than half their customers face toface in 2018. Instead an increasingly digital customer base will use selfservice touchpoints as a first point of contact only reaching out tocontactcenter agents or branches for the most complex engagements.This movement of transactional interactions to digital channels will meanthat branch and contactcenter interactions are more important than everin building human relationships with customers.Winning financial services organizations will provide all customer contact personnel with thedigital tools required to access answers quicker and will invest higher trained personnel who arebetter equipped to use these tools and present high value responses to inquiries.The traditional definition of convenience in banking has revolved around the proximity of thebranch. With the growth in digital technology and the increased acceptance of online and mobilebanking access to banking products and transactions is no longer tethered to a physical locationresulting in a redefinition of convenience. Today while convenience is still the primary driver ofinitial consideration the importance of branches in that definition has gone down.Novantas found the correlation between \\xe2\\x80\\x98perceived convenience\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98consideration\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to be slightlystronger than the correlations between \\xe2\\x80\\x98perceived convenience\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and \\xe2\\x80\\x98purchase\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with both beingvery strong. The biggest news is that the drivers of \\xe2\\x80\\x98perceived convenience\\xe2\\x80\\x99 start with anorganization\\xe2\\x80\\x99s digital capabilities. In fact the importance of branchcentric factors have dropped ineach of the past three years of the study. This is especially true for consumers aged 1854.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report\\x0cAligned with the preference to shop digitally there has been a corresponding increase in thepreference to open accounts digitally according to Novantas. Over a third of consumers prefer toopen their account digitally with the number being significantly higher (46%) if the consumershopped using digital channels exclusively. In fact the mobile channel has replaced otherchannels as the centerpiece of the banking relationship.\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIn 2018 mobile will surpass desktop as the top digital channel for retail bankaccount opening.

Embracing PSD2 and Open API BankingWhile APIs are not new to banking and are nothing more than a structurefor how software applications should interact they provide the gateway forinnovative contextual solutions that would be difficult to offer without OpenBanking. As outlined by the World Retail Banking Report 2017 published byCapgemini in conjunction with  Efma there are three types of APIs1.  Private APIs These are APIs that are used within the traditionalbanking organization reducing friction and enhancing operational efficiency. A vast majority(88%) of banks viewed private APIs as essential in 2015.2.  Partner APIs These are usually between a bank and specific thirdparty partners enablingthe expansion of product lines channels etc.3.  Open APIs In this scenario business data is made available to third parties that many nothave a formal relationship with the bank. Because of the structure of open APIs manybanks have a greater concern around security.Most banks ease into the use of APIs moving from private to partner and sometimes to openAPIs. It is believed that over time APIs will evolve to the more extensive options in response tothe consumer desire for greater digital solutions not currently provided by legacy organizations.This will also occur as both fintechs and traditional banking organizations understand that theyneed each others strengths. This collaboration will enable both banking organizations and fintechfirms to offer more to customers than previously possible.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report\\x0cDeloitte believes there are four distinct strategic options for banks and credit unions in the future.In two scenarios an institution remains in control of the customer/member relationship. In theother two products and distribution become unbundled.Incumbent as a fullservice providerIncumbent as a utilityIncumbent as a supplierIncumbent as an interfaceIt must be mentioned that the options are not mutually exclusive. Organizations may want to playin multiple quadrants. For instance they may want to be a supplier of services as well offeringproducts in a thirdparty interface.\\x0cPerhaps the greatest risk of open banking is that it will allow consumers and merchants toexecute direct transactions without going through banks making it more difficult for banks to havea full view of the customer transactions and maintain customer relationships. It is hoped that theopen banking concept can avoid this demise as traditional banks and fintech firms work togetherto build the customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trust and offer products and services that will improve a consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99slifestyle.The foundation of these partnerships will be the data that can be collected and cultivated for thebenefit of the customer the bank and the fintech firms. If applied diligently the improvement incustomer experience could be the differentiator that retains the overall banking (and nonbanking)relationship.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAs PSDII enters in force at the beginning of the year some truths will be revealedabout the effects of such imprecise regulation about the misplaced expectations ofsome startups and about the real open banking strategy of the European banks.Over the year I expect the bumps in the road to open banking to get smoother as\\x0cnew players learn to work together and deliver banking services in new ways. Therest of the world will be watching and learning from this.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x93 Andra Sonea Solutions Architect at Anthemis Group\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe era of Open Banking is upon us.

Building Fintech Partnerships\\x0cIn the past many traditional banking organizations looked at fintech startups as more of a nuisance than a threat. Today many are viewing thesenontraditional providers as a threat as well as either a partner or potentialacquisition.In its latest Global Fintech Report PwC found that 88% of legacy banking organizations fearlosing revenue to financial technology companies in areas such as payments money transfersand personal loans. The amount of business at risk has grown to an estimated 24% of revenues.In related DeNovo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research from PwC it was found that 30% of consumers plan to increasetheir usage of nontraditional financial services providers with only 39% planning to continueusing solely traditional service organizations. This is an additional wakeup call to legacyorganizations to determine how they will retain the key components of an existing bankingrelationship.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report\\x0cIn response to this threat 82% of traditional financial organizations stated a plan to increasecollaboration with fintech companies in the next three to five years. Similarly almost 50% offinancial services firms are planning to acquire fintech startups over the same period.Fintech startups realize that it takes more than a great solution to attract a scalable customerbase. To reach beyond early adopters and the techsavvy takes massive amounts of capital forpromotion and product support. Partnering with an established banking organization who willsupport the expansion of users among their client base seems like a logical means to an end.Alternatively legacy banking organizations struggle to keep up with consumer expectations. Sizeorganizational structure (silos) and even traditional leadership styles hamper the ability to deliverthe new digital solutions consumers receive from other industries.

Expansion of Digital PaymentsDespite increased adoption of digital payments cash remains a primary formof payment for many especially for lowvalue transactions and by certaindemographic groups. Attributes of cash contributing to continued use includespeed universal acceptance anonymity lack of fees etc. Some emergingmarkets also still lack a modern payments infrastructure while certaincultures don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have trust in the banking system. In other words the reportsof the death of cash are still exaggerated.While epayments are expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.6% from 2015 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2019 the yearlygrowth rate is expected to decrease as more transactions move to mobile payments (mpayments). Mobile payments are expected to have a CAGR of 21.8% from 2015 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2019 helpedby an increased proliferation of mobile devices. As with many of the payment trends the impactof China on growth numbers is significant.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report\\x0cThe integration of customer analytics improved fraud management dynamic wallet solutions andother valueadded services will have a positive impact on both the consumer and the merchant. Itis expected that ongoing improvement in biometrics and secure payments will become mandatoryin the future while integration realtime financial management solutions will becomecommonplace.Finally as fintech firms continue to bypass traditional value chain components traditional financialservices organizations will need to determine if they should partner with buy or ignore these newcompetitors. Given that most of the fintech activity in the payments space has targeted the mostlucrative components of the payment value chain significant decisions are necessary.\\x0cThere is no clear path to success in the new payments ecosystem with many variablesopportunities and challenges still in an embryonic state. It does seem to be clear that success willrequire collaboration between players and markets. Especially as new technologies and newstructures of solutions emerge in connection with open banking APIs AI and big dataorganizations will need to determine their best role in the new ecosystem.In the end the consumer and commercial marketplace will determine the winners but there aretremendous opportunities for firms that embrace collaboration of insight and solutions to developan improved valueadded proposition that can address the need for speed insight and security.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith the fastpaced development of applications technology and recent upgradesto Apply Pay we can expect mobile payments to continue to grow at a rapid pace.With the surge of Cyber Security data breaches on the rise it will be essential thatthese mobile payment applications and systems be put through vigorous securitytests performed by thirdparty auditors.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x93 Michael Fisher Fulltime Analyst at TechCPU\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAdoption of alternative payment technologies will expand exponentially as consumers ditch cashfor the convenience and security of emerging payment methods including contactless paymentsdigital wallets and biometric verification.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d\\xe2\\x80\\x93 Todd Linden CEO of Paysafe Group\\xe2\\x80\\x9cWith most larger U.S. banks utilizing the Zelle platform we will start to see a tremendousacceleration to digital payments especially P2P.

Navigating Compliance and Regulatory ChangesSimilar to what we saw in 2017 most banks and credit unions worldwideare continuing to do business under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty that isexpected to a challenge for the foreseeable future. Even though lawmakersand regulators aren\\xe2\\x80\\x99t expected to make many definitive changes mostfinancial institutions continue to do their best to meet risk and complianceparameters and supervisory expectations.Since most institutions realize that they don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t have the ability to wait to see how things willeventually end up many banking organizations are making progress trying to keep in alignmentwith what is anticipated from a risk and business perspective. As one banker stated this pastyear we are in a position to \\xe2\\x80\\x98beg for forgiveness\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rather than \\xe2\\x80\\x98asking for permission.\\xe2\\x80\\x99According to Deloitte \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBanking organizations need to keep moving forward as planned withdeliberate linkage between regulatory strategy; business strategy; and building infrastructure forgovernance regulatory reporting and risk management that scales and is flexible.The good newsis that many of the changes banking organizations are currently implementing make good sensefrom a business perspective\\xe2\\x80\\x94not just a regulatory perspective\\xe2\\x80\\x94and are worth doing no matterhow the future unfolds.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dGet the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegulatory and consumer attitudes to data protection controls and data sharingare undergoing important changes in many markets around the world and especiallyin Europe (e.g. PSD2 and GDPR).

Exploring Advanced TechnologiesAt a time when most organizations are still playing catchup a new waveof digital technology has the potential to change the way organizationsdeliver banking services even further. These new technologies includeartificial intelligence (AI) the internet of things (IoT) blockchain openbanking platforms with application program interfaces (APIs) and roboticprocess automation (RPA).With the potential to increase efficiency decrease costs and enhance the customer experiencethese digitalenabled technologies will result in disruption of the way people do their banking andpotentially what organizations deliver these services. We are already seeing organizations testingmany of these digital technologies hoping to win the battle to become the \\xe2\\x80\\x98bank of the future.\\xe2\\x80\\x99As quickly as past technologies have become the norm a new wave of emerging technologieswill combine digital technologies and the power of data to set new standards. According to PwCthese \\xe2\\x80\\x98essential eight\\xe2\\x80\\x99 technologies includeThe Internet of Things (IoT)Artificial Intelligence (AI)Robotics3D PrintingAugmented RealityVirtual RealityDronesBlockchainObviously the prioritization and investment in each of these technologies will vary based on theindustry business model and strategic goals of each organization. For instance while themarketplace as a whole does not foresee investing much in blockchain technology the financialservices industry ranks this as a high priority.\\x0cThat said investment in emerging technologies as a percentage of overall technology investmenthas not increased since 2007 (across industries). In fact the share of the overall technologybudget that is allocated to emerging technology is only 17.8% according to the PwC research.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends ReportEspecially for the financial services industry it is imperative to think beyond individual emergingtechnologies. With the advent of open banking APIs as a way to bring external technologies andinnovations directly to banking customers and the emergence of nontraditional bankingecosystems that may include nonbanking services combinations of technologies will become thenorm.For instance the use of customer data insights and advanced analytics may be combined withIoT technologies to allow payments directly from smart home devices.

Competing with New Challengers\\x0cModestsized fintech firms and large tech giants continue to make retailbanking inroads worldwide providing services that leverage the best indigital technology to deliver a customer experience that removescumbersome steps from both routine and more involved bankingengagements. Relative financial newcomers like AliPay (China) WeChat(China) Rakuten (Japan) Atom (UK) Monzo (UK) Starling (UK) N26(Germany) and Revolut (UK) have joined household names like PayPalAmazon and Google to disrupt the banking ecosystem leveraging modern infrastructures andinnovative cultures.According to Bain \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMany of the tech giants possess the ingredients of success digital prowesslarge customer bases organizations well versed in improving the customer experience andample leeway to extend their corporate brands into banking.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d More concerning may be that someof these firms are generating a level of trust previously reserved only for traditional banks andcredit unions. As a result an increasing percentage of consumers are willing to use financialproducts offered from these nontraditional firms \\xe2\\x80\\x93 especially where the experience is superior tothat offered by legacy organizations.It is expected that demand for products and services from fintech firms and large tech companieswill only increase as more consumers become familiar with new digital offerings. This isespecially true for younger consumers who have grown up with digital devices. More and morepeople will get annoyed when they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re forced by bank policies and processes to use nondigitalchannels for everyday banking business states the Bain research. This includes rudimentarytransactions as well as being able to open new accounts or apply for loans.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report\\x0cThe best way to prepare for the inevitable increase in competition that the continued expansion ofbanking services offered by Amazon Google PayPal Facebook and an increasing number ofstartup banks will bring is to be proactive in the development of personalized digital solutions.This will most likely involve new partnerships inside and outside of traditional bankingorganizations and a redefinition of what a banking ecosystem includes.In other words if banks don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t reorient their approach and radically accelerate their rate ofprogress loyalty will suffer and they will watch technology firms poach more business.Meanwhile their economics will erode as too many routine transactions continue to flow throughexpensive branch and callcenter networks.There is a great advantage in the customer and member insights that traditional financialinstitutions possess. The key is to apply these insights in ways that directly and positively impactthe digital experience similar to how large tech firms currently improve shopping social searchand payments.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe most significant change in the financial services industry next year will be theentry of 4th gen competitors.
