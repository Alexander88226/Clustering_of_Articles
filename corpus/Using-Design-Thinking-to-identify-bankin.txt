Our	main	  findings	can	be	grouped	to	three	main	areas 	(1)		the	changing	role	of	branches	(2)	online 	  mobile	 and	 phonebased	 services	 and	 (3)	 products	 and	 services.	 The	 compound	 of	  customers	is	quite	heterogeneous	in	age 	education	or	income	status	for	all	banks	in	our	  research 	therefore 	the	possibility	of	generalization	of	problems	and	possible	solutions	  is	limited.	A	major	challenge	for	banks	is	that	they	need	to	think	up	to	2030	customer	  segments 	and	offer	services	with	which	can	serve	the	needs	of	other	segments	–	so	  generic	enough	to	meet	more	segments'	needs.	Of	course 	the	strategies	of	banks	may	  differ	in	the	targeted	segments;	however 	banks	with	general	strategy	can	be	dominated	  by	competitors	concentrating	on	a	niche	strategy 	or	a	FinTech 	for	example 	with	the	  widespread	application	of	digital	solutions.	  Keywords 	Digital	Transformation 	Design	Thinking 	One	Week	Sprint 	Banking	  1   Although	the	banking	industry	is	a	traditional	and	conservative	industry 	it	has	to	follow	  the	required	changes	of	digital	transformation.	Although	the	banking	industry	is	heavily	  dependent	on	technological	solutions 	this	change	is	not	encoded	in	the	genes	of	the	  banks.	Moreover 	identifying	possible	digital	developments	is	harder 	than	the	banks	  think.	  The	goal	of	our	research	was	to	analyse	to	identify	customer	challenges	of	Hungarian	  retail	banks 	to	develop	and	to	test	digital	ideas	to	address	these	challenges.	For	this	  research 	we	were	collaborating	with	seven	Hungarian	banks 	and	analysed	both	online	    Introduction	    1	    <1st	Author	Name> 	<2nd	Author	Name>			    	  and	 offline	 customer	 challenges.	 The	 goal	 of	 this	 paper	 is	 to	 overview	 the	 related	  concept	in	the	literature 	and	present	the	results	of	this	research.	  2  Related	concepts	  The	goal	of	this	chapter	is	to	analyse	the	current	challenges	of	digital	transformation 	  presenting	the	challenges	of	the	banking	industry 	and	analysing	how	customer	centric	  digital	innovations	can	be	delivered.	  2.1  The	challenge	of	Digital	Transformation	  Digital	 developments	 were	 traditionally	 dedicated	 to	 the	 responsibility	 of	  IT	  Departments.	 Although	 the	 alignment	 between	 business	 and	 IT	 goals	 was	 a	 never  ending	discussion	of	both	practitioners	and	researchers	(Henderson	and	Venkatraman 	  1993;	Renaud	et	al	(2016);	Kahre	et	al 	2017) 	the	leading	role	of	organizational	IT	was	  not	really	questioned 	and	outsourcing	of	IT	services	usually	arose	mostly	in	operational	  issues.		  By	now 	the	exclusivity	of	developing	new	IT	services 	and	delivering	digital	innovations	  has	loosened 	mainly	because	of	the	following	reasons 	    •  As	digitization	reached	business	departments 	the	requirement	of	IT	knowledge 	  and	IT	savvy	employees	became	vital	of	organizational	success	(Weill	and	Aral 	  2006).	Therefore	business	leaders	and	employees	had	to	acquire	digital	skills 	so	  IT	departments’	knowledge	monopoly	is	under	demystification.	    •  As	 SoftwareasaService	 (SaaS)	 solutions 	 especially	 cloudbased	 solutions	  became	more	and	more	accepted 	business	units	have	the	opportunity	access	IT	  services	 without	 involving	 their	 IT	 departments	 (Katzan 	 2009;	 Foster 	 2011;	  Sultan 	2013).	Moreover 	introducing	a	new	IT	service	into	business	operations	  via	the	SaaS	model	takes	less	time	than	the	traditional	implementation	projects	  (Waters 	2005;	Gerhardter	and	Ortner 	2013).	    •  Not	only	the	speed	of	implementing	new	services	is	an	issue 	but	also	the	quality	  of	new	services.	As	IT	solutions 	like	infrastructure 	or	access	to	internet	became	  a	 commodity	 for	 most	 organizations	 (Carr 	 2003) 	 the	 transaction	 cost	 of	  choosing	or	changing	SaaS	services	decreased 	therefore	organizations	can	select	  innovative	SaaS	solutions	with	lower	costs	and	lower	risks.	As	Carr	(2003)	urged 	  “it’s	time	to	rethink	IT	management”.	    Therefore 	Bharadwaj	et	al	(2013)	claim	that	business	units	lead	the	way	of	digitization 	  and	 digital	 business	 strategies	 are	 separated	 from	 traditional	 IT	 strategies 	 as	 digital	  strategies	 address	 crossfunctional	 business	 objectives 	 and	 changing	 business	  processes	by	utilizing	IT	resources.	Digital	strategy	is	treated	as	business	strategy	itself.	  2.2  Digitization	challenges	of	the	banking	sector	  Digital	technologies	have	been	entering	the	banking	industry	for	years 	and	the	banking	  industry	and	banking	operations	and	highly	dependent	on	the	IT	services	(Fung 	2008).		  Shaikh	and	Karjaluoto	(2016)	originates	automated	retail	banking	services	into	the	mid  1960s 	because	of	the	requirement	of	processing	the	huge	number	of	creditcard	related	  electronic	transactions.	Since	then 	digital	solutions	are	not	uncommon	in	the	financial	    2	    <Paper	Title>Submission	Format	for	Bled	eConference 	…	    	  sector 	ATMs	in	the	late	1960s	and	1970s 	telephone	banking	and	POS	solutions	since	  1980s 	online	banking	and	even	mobile	banking	since	late	1990s.		 Motivations	  of	  digitization	was	faster	and	cheaper	customer	service.	Despite	of	these	efforts	and	digital	  achievements 	banking	services	still	seem	to	be	lagged	behind	general	digital	technology	  trends 	 and	 behind	 the	 digitization	 of	 other	 sectors 	 especially	 commerce	 (Harvey 	  2016).		  The	situation	is	more	challenging	for	the	banks 	as	their	customers	take	their	financial	  services	from	different	service	providers	(e.g.	account 	mortgage 	commercial	credit 	  credit	card 	etc.).	Easy	to	access	internetbased	services	make	this	situation	even	worse 	  using	SaaS	services	on	the	internet	provides	low	transaction	costs	for	trialling 	selecting	  or	changing	alternate	service	providers.	Moreover 	YGeneration	and	technologysavvy	  customers	demand	and	appreciate	digital	services 	and	these	segments	are	ready	to	  change	for	a	better	digital	customer	experience	(Lipton	el	al 	2016).	  Beside	the	changing	customer	behaviour 	banks	have	to	face	new	challenges	(Harvey 	  2016) 	    •  As	 new	 entrants 	 FinTech	 companies	 offer	 digital	 financial	 services	 in	 several	  niches.	 FinTech	 companies	 act	 as	 startups 	 frame	 a	 very	 specific	 customer	  challenge 	 and	 offer	 very	 specific	 solutions	 (e.g.	 money	 transfer 	 microloan 	  crowdfunding 	payment 	etc.).	One	FinTech	service	probably	will	not	endanger	  banks 	or	the	banking	sector 	but	together	they	target	small	but	very	profitable	  slices	of	the	banks'	value	chains.	Surprisingly	banks	didn’t	start	to	address	this	  challenge 	yet	(Bunea	et	al 	2016) 	although	this	hybrid	financial	model	seems	to	  stick	 in	 the	 market 	 and	 questions	 the	 role	 of	 banks	 in	 the	 following	 years	  (Akkizidis	and	Stagars 	2016).	    •  Technology	companies	also	enter	to	the	market	of	financial	services 	as	financial	  services	became	an	integrated	segment	of	their	value	offerings 	Alibaba 	Google 	  Apple 	 Samsung 	 etc.	 provide	 more	 and	 more	 financial	 services 	 which	 are	  technologically	advanced 	and	moreover 	they	can	target	their	existing	user	base.	  •  Since	the	financial	crisis	started	in	2008 	government	and	industrial	regulations	  became	 stricter 	 and	 require	 banks	 to	 apply	 and	 report	 these	 requirements	  (Goodhart 	 2008).	 These	 compliance	 issues	 require	 additional	 investments	 in	  technological	solutions	(reporting 	data	analysis 	fraud	protection 	antiterrorism	  analysis) 	and	makes	their	service	offerings	less	flexible 	and	sometimes	less	user	  friendly.	    2.3  Customer	centric	digital	innovations	  As	customer	behaviour	is	changing 	it	is	not	enough	simply	to	offer	new	digital	services 	  or	 just	 to	 copy	 the	 existing	 services	 of	 the	 competition.	 Even	 before	 the	 age	 of	  digitization 	 customer	 experience	 questions	 were	 highly	 important 	 and	 loyalty	 of	  banking	customers	was	related	to	perceived	value 	service	quality 	service	attributes 	  satisfaction 	image	and	trust	(Beerli 	2004;	Lewis	and	Soureli 	2006).	Digital	services	are	  expected	easy	to	use 	comfortable 	natural 	but	moreover 	the	solutions	should	service	  the	need	of	the	customers.	    3	    <1st	Author	Name> 	<2nd	Author	Name>			    	  FinTech	 companies 	 and	 digital	 innovators	 not	 simply	 digitalize	 or	 automate	 existing	  processes 	 but	 adequately	 understand	 customer	 challenges	 or	 new	 requirements 	 in	  which	customer	experience	has	a	vital	role	(Harvey 	2016;	Kenesei	and	Seprődi 	2017).	  The	need	of	a	bettergrounded	design	of	products	and	services	started	by	Herbert	Simon	  (1969 	1996) 	as	defining	the	role	of	design	as	“the	transformation	of	existing	conditions	  into	preferred	ones”	(Simon 	1996 4).	Further	researches	added	additional	layers	to	the	  discourse 	applying	different	epistemology	and	core	concepts	(JohanssonSköldberg	et	  al 	2013) 	    •  Rationalism 	The	science	of	artificial	  •  Pragmatism 	Reflection	in	action	  •  Postmodernism 	Wicked	problems	  •  Practice	perspective 	Designerly	ways	of	knowing	  •  Hermenutics 	Creating	meaning	    Nonetheless	of	the	evolvement	of	the	design	process 	further	thinking	still	refers	back	  to	Simon’s	framework	and	practical	approaches	try	to	integrate	all	discussed	concepts	  (Huppatz 	 2015).	 The	 art	 of	 design 	 the	 systematic	 way	 of	 designing	 products	 and	  serviced	is	labelled	as	“Design	Thinking”	(West	and	Di	Nardo 	2016) 	and	applies	the	  following	characteristics 	    •  Targets	solving	nonstructured	problems	  •  Applies	 a	 customer	 centric	 approach 	 analysing	 customer	 challenges	 through	    •  Emphasizes	the	importance	of	customer	value	creation	and	customer	experience	  •  Emphasizes	 the	 importance	 of	 collecting	 and	 processing	 information	 from	    observation	    various	sources	    •  Enhances	creativity	of	participants	  •  Helps	to	bring	together	various	actors 	users 	designers 	developers 	etc.	    Because	of	the	nature	of	a	general	design	thinking	approach 	it	is	able	to	be	a	basis	of	  digital	innovations	(Izukura	et	al 	2015;	Hosono	et	al 	2016).	  Inspired	by	the	overview	of	different	design	thinking	approaches	by	Gioia	(2011 39)	and	  based	on	the	collection	of	Dam	and	Siang	(2017)	of	the	Interaction	Design	Foundation 		  and	 processing	 additional	 widespread	 models 	 a	 general	 design	 thinking	 process	  includes	the	following	steps	(Figure	1) 	    •  Define 	defining	the	scope 	problem	and	challenges 	understanding	constrains	  •  Explore 	explore	the	target	area 	context	and	stakeholders	  •   •   •  Prototype 	develop	initial	prototypes	to	illustrate	the	solution	  •     Interpret 	process	the	explored	insights	and	define	the	problem	to	be	solved	  Ideate 	collect 	then	evaluate	multiple	solutions	    Iterate 	test	the	prototypes 	even	is	multiple	cycles	to	enhance	the	idea	and	to	  select	the	most	suitable	solution	  Implement 	develop	the	product	or	service	    •   •  Enhance 	 keep	 up	 with	 the	 product 	 provide	 supper 	 analyse	 data	 and	 plan	    further	developments	(restart	the	cycle)		  	    4	    	    <Paper	Title>Submission	Format	for	Bled	eConference 	…	    Define    Explore    Interpret    Ideate    Prototype    Iterate    Implement    Enhance    Ambrose	– Harris	(2010)    Deloitte	DeepDive    IDEO    IDEO	HCD    Design	Council	of	the	UK 	4	D’s    Define    Research    Understand  Observe    Inspire    Hear    Discover    Frog	Collective	Action	Toolkit    Clarify (Build)    Seek    What	x	4    The	LUMA	System    Kumar	101    d.school’s 5	Stages	Process    Design	Thinking	for	Educators    What is?

To	achieve	this	goal 	7	Hungarian	banks	joined	to	the	project 	of	which	total	  balance	sheet	altogether	represents	68%	of	the	Hungarian	banking	industry.	  s	 nature	 of	 the	 research 	 exploring	 digital	 banking	 possibilities 	 the	 research	 was	  considered	explorative.	We	wanted	deeper	insight	than	the	traditional	surveys	and	case	  studies 	therefore	we	decided	to	select	design	thinking	approach	among	the	qualitative	  research	methods.	The	Design	Thinking	approach	can	provide	a	deeper	understanding	  of	customercentric	challenges	than	traditional	surveys	or	case	studies	through	deeper	  involvement	 of	 observation.	 The	 Design	 Thinking	 approach	 also	 help	 to	 identify	 and	  evaluate	as	many	challenges 	as	possible 	and	ideate	as	many	solutions 	as	possible.		  For	the	basis	of	the	applied	methodology	the	5	steps	approach	of	IDEO	and	Riverdale	  was	selected	(Design	Thinking	for	Educators 	2012).	Because	we	have	limited	time	(5	  working	days)	and	limited	resources	(7	project	teams 	one	for	each	participating	bank 	  34	project	members	and	2	coaches)	we	had	to	adapt	the	methodology	to	fit	into	these	  frames.	To	achieve	our	goal 	we	used	the	following	additional	sources	to	construct	our	  research	methodology 	    •  The	book	of	Knapp	et	al	(2016)	presents	the	methodology	that	Google	uses	for	  rapid	prototyping	of	their	ideas.

Coordination	of	the	  teams	and	methodological	assistance	were	provided	by	two	leading	researchers 	in	the	  role	of	design	thinking	coaches.	The	research	team	invested	more	the	1000	working	  hours	during	the	5	days	to	explore	and	analyse	customer	challenges 	and	provide	viable	  ideas	 for	 the	 banks.	 In	 the	 discovery	 phase	 the	 main	 goal	 was	 to	 identify	 as	 many	  challenges	 as	 possible 	 while	 in	 the	 interpretation	 phase	 the	 teams	 prioritised	 these	  challenged	and	reduced	them	into	a	few	for	further	work.	In	the	ideation	phase	the	  teams	brainstormed	a	huge	number	of	ideas 	but	during	experimentation	only	a	few	  viable	were	selected	and	tested 	and	the	successfully	tested	and	iterated	ideas	got	only	  the	final	phase.	In	the	last	phase	the	surviving	few	ideas	were	developed	further 	costs 	  benefits 	risks	were	analysed 	and	a	project	timeline	was	added	(Figure	2).	  Following	this	methodology	Project	teams	delivered	their	research	findings	at	the	end	  of	the	5th	day 	concentrating	on	the	main	problems	and	main	solutions.	After	the	One	  Week	Sprint 	all	the	identified	challenges 	and	possible	solutions	were	collected	and	  analysed	further	by	the	coaches.	This	paper	presents	these	aggregated	results.

Although	each	project	team	was	dedicated	to	a	specific	bank 	customer	challenges	and	  problems	overlapped	of	the	different	banks.	  4.1  The	changing	role	of	branches	  Customers	 articulated	 their	 most	 problems	 related	 to	 branches	 in	 Discovery	 phase	  (Figure	3.).	As	we	investigated	the	area	of	branches	in	Interpretation	phase 	it	appeared	  that	no	one	loves	to	go	to	bank	branches 	especially	not	the	younger	generation.	The	  access	of	a	branch	may	be	a	challenge 	since	it	may	be	too	far 	or	the	opening	hours	may	  not	fit	the	customer	needs;	since	they	typically	are	open	during	working	hours		when	  customers	 are	 working	 too.	 But	 once	 a	 customer	 reaches	 the	 bank	 branch 	 there	 is	  typically	long	waiting	and	administration	time 	and	in	the	one	hand	customers	do	not	  always	get	what	they	wanted	(clerks'	quality);	in	the	other	hand	they	are	confronted	  with	pushed	offers	of	new	products 	services	clerks	try	to	sell	them 	which	also	increases	  the	waiting	and	administration	time.	  The	 traditional	 functionality	 of	 bank	 branches	 was	 to	 serve	 as	 the	 central	 point	 of	  customer	relations.	However 	for	customers	visiting	the	branch	may	be	"only"	a	drag 	or	  worse 	it	can	mean	frustration	for	them.	From	the	banks	side 	the	reducing	number	of	  customer	visits	should	motivate	branches	to	take	advantage	of	these	rare	opportunities 	  improve	customer	relationships	and	trying	to	sell	new	products	and	services	using	their	  personal	presence.	  From	the	customers'	side 	the	branch	visits	are	considered	as	a	task	with	no	significant	  added	value 	so	they	would	like	to	do	it	as	fast	as	possible.	And	they	consider	all	the	  things	that	prevent	this	(waiting 	administration	time 	listening	to	offers)	as	annoyance.	  	    Figure	3 	Challenges	related	to	branches	  	  To	 manage	 these	 problems 	 nowadays	 it	 is	 considered	 natural	 to	 direct	 all	 possible	  administrative	tasks	to	appropriate	online	channels	(phone 	mobile 	web).	The	question	    8	    <Paper	Title>Submission	Format	for	Bled	eConference 	…	    	  remains 	what	to	do	with	the	bank	branch	where	customers	do	not	want	to	appear	in	  person;	and	how	to	convince	customers	to	choose	the	closest	relationship 	personal	  appearance?	  The	question	is	complicated	because	of	the	heterogeneous	composition	of	the	banks'	  customers 	and	there	is	no	solution	that	would	be	appropriate	for	everyone.	There	are	  customers 	who	prefers	personal	presence	in	their	sensitive	banking	affairs		and	the	  customer	experience	should	be	ensured	for	them	as	well.	  Suggestions	made	up	during	Ideation	phase	and	tested	in	Experimentation	phase 	    •  Enrich	waiting	time 	Waiting	is	typically	a	lost	time 	both	for	customers	and	for	  banks.	It	is	worth	to	make	this	time	more	meaningful 	and	provide	an	opportunity	  for	interaction	with	the	bank	through	personal	assistants	or	electronic	solutions.	  •  Know	the	customers’	intentions	in	advance 	It	can	speed	up	administration	if	  customers	can	arrive	to	scheduled	time 	if	they	can	indicate	what	do	they	want	  to	achieve 	or	what	challenges	await	assistance	from	the	bank	in	their	actual	  phase	of	life.	    •  Speed	up	administration	with	online	started	processes 	Although	not	all	cases	  can	 be	 fully	 solved	 online 	 it	 can	 reduce	 administrative	 time	 in	 branches	 if	  processes	can	be	initialized	online 	checked	in	the	background;	this	way	only	the	  identification	and	signings	have	to	be	done	in	the	branches.	    •  Change 	or	extend	the	function	of	branches 	as	the	traditionally	nonfinancial	  service	providers	enter	the	market	of	banking	services 	so	should	not	the	banks	  be	afraid	to	build	up	a	new	kind	of	profile	towards	managing	relationships	with	  customers.	Is	not	that	a	more	direct	connection	if	the	branch	is	more	like	a	café 	  where	the	clerks	sit	next	to	the	customers	with	a	tablet?	Or 	if	the	branch	will	  become	a		increasingly	fashionable		community	office	at	the	same	time?	Or	  inverted 	 what	 is	 required	 for	 an	 agent	 to	 visit	 community	 offices 	 appearing	  elsewhere	daybyday	as	a	mobile	branch	clerk	to	arrange	matters?	After	all 	the	  branch	is	not	necessarily	the	physical	space 	but	the	place	where	the	issues	can	  be	arranged.	    One	full	project	proposal	from	the	Evolution	phase	was	dealing	with	how	to	reduce	  waiting	time	and	to	understand	the	intentions	of	customers.	If	the	waiting	time	may	be	  longer	than	a	few	minutes 	the	customers	should	not	draw	a	line	number 	instead 	a	  tablet	serves	as	a	personalized	caller.	Through	this	device 	the	authentication	of	the	  customer	 and	 identification	 of	 the	 customer's	 preferences	 can	 be	 easily	 done.	 The	  customer	 can	 get	 familiar	 with	 the	 bank	 offers 	 and	 even	 express	 their	 interest	 in	  banking	products.	The	customer	needs	can	be	assessed	in	the	form	of	tablet	games.	It	is	  important 	that	in	these	cases	the	bank	can	identify	the	real	customer	needs	and	offer	  those	products	only 	that	meet	the	real	needs		even	in	a	personal	administration		rather	  than	products	typically	offered	to	all	customers.	If	the	customer	needs	can	be	identified	  in	advance 	or	detect	lack	of	interest 	the	personal	administration	will	be	targeted 	so	it	  can	be	faster.	  4.2  Online 	mobile	and	phonebased	services	  Empowering	customers	to	manage	their	issues	in	an	online	channel	seems	to	be	an	  obvious	solution	to	most	of	the	problems	outlined	in	the	previous	section.	Arranging	    9	    <1st	Author	Name> 	<2nd	Author	Name>			    	  issues	online	reduces	the	need	of	personal	contact 	which	may	ease	the	customers'	life	  and	lower	operating	costs	for	the	banks	themselves.	  At	the	same	time 	managing	issues	outside	the	branch	(via	telephone 	mobile 	online)	  leads	to	challenges	(Figure	4) 	that	would	have	been	easy	to	handle	in	the	branch	itself 		  such	 as	 inadequate	 supply	 of	 information 	 lack	 of	 consultation	 and	 the	 functional	  limitations	of	the	different	platforms.		  Regarding	the	nonbranch	channels 	the	most	frequently	expressed	counterargument	  is	the	issue	of	security 	whether	the	data	of	the	customer	will	be	stolen 	what	can	ensure	  the	customer	that	they	are	communicating	with	the	bank	itself 	what	can	guarantee	the	  customers	that	their	order	will	be	really	executed.	These	are	the	challenges	we’ve	found	  in	Discovery	phase	with	some	of	the	possible	reasons	from	Interpretation	phase.	  	    	    Figure	4 	Challenges	related	to	electronic	channels	  	  Suggestions	made	up	during	Ideation	phase	and	tested	in	Experimentation	phase 	    •  Let	multichannel	administration	be	possible 	It	is	almost	inevitable	for	a	bank	to	  be	 present	 in	 a	 professional	 manner	 on	 all	 platforms	 (telephone 	 online	 and	  mobile	applications).	In	our	research	we	have	seen	examples	where	the	mobile	  platform	was	only	like	a	minor	advertising	space 	without	meaningful	services.	  •  Let	the	cases	be	traceable	online 	It	supports	customers'	need	for	transparency 	  if	the	ongoing	issues	(transactions 	orders 	transfers)		regardless	to	the	channel	  they	 were	 initiated	 	 can	 be	 monitored	 online 	 grouped	 by	 issue	 areas	 or	  chronologically.	    •  Provide	adequate 	professional	support	to	online	channels 	In	the	back	office	of	  online	and	mobile	applications	there	are	no	clerks		because	of	these	channels	  nature.	But	if	the	customer	gets	stuck 	or	has	questions 	it	would	help	them	a	lot	  if	there	is	an	opportunity	to	redirect	to	a	more	personal	channel 	online	chat 	  video	call 	call	centre.	In	addition 	because	the	customer	has	been	authenticated	  online 	no	other	authentication	should	be	performed	again	during	the	transition	  to	the	new	channel.	This	solution	can	reduce	the	number	of	lost	cases.	    •  The	customer	should	be	a	partner	in	security	issues 	Even	though	the	issue	of	  bank	security	belongs	to	the	banks 	a	significant	proportion	of	fraud	attempts	  are	 targeting	 customers’	 credulity.	 To	 prevent	 this 	 banks	 should	 improve	  customers'	security	awareness	and	manage	their	business	transparently.	    In	Evolution	phase 	teams	were	making	project	plans	to	solutions	which	were	targeting	  existing	mobile	applications	without	meaningful	functionality 	or	to	a	augmented	reality	    10	    <Paper	Title>Submission	Format	for	Bled	eConference 	…	    	  branch 	where	customers	can	manage	their	issues	in	the	wellknown	environment	of	  their	own	branch 	with	professional	clerks	as	avatars 	using	internetbased	telephony.	  4.3  Products	and	services	  Regarding	 to	 administration	 in	 branches 	 the	 interviewed	 and	 examined	 customers	  highlighted	in	Discovery	phase	the	lack	of	transparency	in	the	bureaucracy	of	banking 	  and	that	there	is	a	lot	of	paperwork	with	all	issues	(Figure	5).	The	loan	and	investment	  administration	turned	out	to	be	the	most	effected	with	the	problem 	that	the	rules		and	  the	processes	laid	down	by	banks	are	too	complex 	complicated	and		incomprehensive	  for	customers.	Customers	typically	get	information	from	these	rules	and	processes	from	  clerks	 during	 the	 administration	 	 and	 sometimes	 different	 clerks	 give	 different	  information	to	them	for	the	same	issue.	That	is	a	common	customer	complaint	that	the	  rules	seem	to	be	articulated	in	a	way	that	the	customer	may	not	understand	or	do	not	  want	to	understand	them.	  Banks	must	meet	several	legal	requirements	and	a	significant	part	of	these	apply	on	the	  cooperation	with	customers 	so	the	banks	have	no	other	option	than	to	enforce	the	rules	  applicable	to	customers.	This	make	the	rules	and	the	banking	operations	for	customers	  	but	often	also	for	the	clerks		difficult	to	understand 	and	what	is	even	worse 	following	  the	legislative	changes	the	rules	and	processes	are	frequently	changing	as	well.	  Because	of	the	above	mentioned 	the	customers		regardless	of	the	intention	of	the	  banks	–	can	feel	that	they	are	at	the	mercy	of	these	institutions.	From	the	bank's	side 	  ensuring	customer	experience	is	becoming	more	challenging	and	this	can	lead	to	churn	  of	customers.	This	is	one	of	the	most	important	findings	from	Interpretation	phase.	  	    	    Figure	5 	Challenges	related	to	products	and	services	  	  The	extent	banking	services	can	be	customized	or	personalized 	which	is	also	part	of	the	  customer	experience.	Many	customers	have	indicated	that	there	are	only	a	few	options	  of	banking	services	available 	and	they	cannot	find	those	services	that	meet	their	own 	  sometimes	 not	 so	 unique	 needs.	 Therefore 	 if	 they	 can	 find	 appropriate	 services	 in	  another	bank 	they	consider	the	possibility	of	switching	banks.	  Suggestions	made	up	during	Ideation	phase	and	tested	in	Experimentation	phase 	    •  Simplify	 banking	 procedures 	 increase	 transparency 	 the	 intricately	 worded	  rules	 do	 not	 favour	 the	 creation	 of	 a	 trust.	 It	 should	 be	 clear 	 what	 are	 the	  responsibilities	and	tasks	of	the	customers 	and	what	are	the	responsibilities	and	    11	    <1st	Author	Name> 	<2nd	Author	Name>			    	    tasks	of	the	banks.	Use	visualization	elements 	process	models	and	flow	charts	  for	 better	 understanding.	 Use	 the	 processes 	 process	 models	 as	 the	 base	 of	  policies	 and	 rules 	 with	 clearly	 defined	 responsibilities.	 Simpler	 and	 more	  transparent	processes	increase	the	efficiency	of	processes	(faster	throughput 	  less	errors) 	and	customer	satisfaction.	    •  Personalized	 and	 proactive	 services	 based	 on	 the	 analysis	 of	 banking	 data 	  Based	 on	 the	 customer	 transaction	 data 	 banks	 have	 extreme	 amount	 of	  information	about	customers'	life 	income 	spending 	spending	habits.	Based	on	  these 	banks	can	offer	opportunities	to	customers	proactively.	    •  Banking	portfolio	expansion	with	nonbanking	products	and	services 	As	the	  traditionally	 nonfinancial	 service	 providers	 enter	 the	 market	 of	 banking	  services 	 so	 should	 the	 banks	 open	 up	 to	 nonfinancial	 products 	 travel 	  commodities	and	insurance	products.	The	challenge 	however 	is	that	the	sales	  effort	of	these	new	products	should	not	bother	customers	in	any	of	the	sales	  channels.	    From	 Evolution	 phase 	 a	 project	 plan	 visioning	 an	 online	 bank 	 where	 personalized	  advertisements	can	be	seen	(not	only	in	the	field	of	banking)	based	on	the	data	gathered	  from	the	chronologic	and	personal	data	from	the	customer	is	important	to	mention.	    	    5  Conclusion	  Although	 most	 bank	 realized	 the	  importance	 of	 digitization 	 customer	 centric	  approaches	are	quite	new	in	the	Hungarian	banking	sector.	Development	is	not	only	a	  technological	question	(just	copying	existing	solutions	from	more	developed	regions 	  e.g.	USA 	Western	Europe 	of	SE	Asia) 	but	also	a	methodological	one.	In	our	research	  we	 demonstrated	 a	 useful 	 rapid 	 very	 focused	 approach	 of	 explore	 customer	  challenges 	 but	 for	 a	 successful	 project	 we	 required	 a	 good 	 and	 prepared	 team	  members.	The	two	coaches	were	able	to	provide	adequate	methodological	support.	  The	 findings	 of	 the	 project	 were	 discussed	 with	 the	 participated	 banks 	 given	 them	  better	 insights	 of	 customercentric	 approaches 	 through	 defining	 the	 demand.	 But	  additional	challenges	also	pressurise	banks	to	develop	their	systems 	eIDAS	compliance 	  PSD2	challenge 	GDPR	regulation.	It	is	a	limitation	of	this	research 	that	its	focusing	only	  on	customer	(individual	customer)	related	challenges 	that	mainly	visible	in	front	office	  services.	But	for	Hungarian	banks 	they	have	the	opportunity	to	apply	matured	solutions	  and	technologies 	what	is	still	innovative	on	the	Hungarian	market 	that	is	already	tried	  out	on	other	market 	and	we	can	know	the	success	and	failure	stories.	Therefore 	it	is	  important	 to	 benchmark	 the	  international	 market 	 even	 before	 deciding	 on	  implementation.	 	 Moreover 	 findings	 in	 this	 research	 are	 only	 a	 start	 for	 further	  researches 	but	it	was	considered	a	good	way	to	set	the	basis	for	further	investigations.	  It	is	a	strategic	choice	of	the	incumbent	banks 	how	to	manage	their	relationship	to	  FinTech	companies.	They	can	be	considered	as	competitors 	as	possible	partners	to	work	  with 	but	we	have	also	seen	a	Hungarian	bank 	that	itself	developed	a	Fintech	Incubator	  program.	Fintech	companies	are	considered	either	partners	or	competitors 	but	they	  definitely	increase	the	competition	in	the	sector 	and	support	the	digitization	efforts.	    12	    <Paper	Title>Submission	Format	for	Bled	eConference 	…	    	  Generally 	the	applied	research	identified	several	customer	challenges	and	offered	also	  several	possible	digital	solutions.	Although	the	project	teams	couldn’t	finish	complete 	  detailed 	readytoship	products 	they	made	rapid	progress 	generated	and	designed	a	  huge	number	of	ideas 	and	they	tested	if	they	are	headed	in	the	right	direction.	  In	future	researches	we	would	like	to	expand	the	size	of	the	research 	the	used	one  weekspring	 approach	 should	 be	 expanded	 with	 additional	 surveys	 to	 validate	 the	  findings 	and	to	generalize	the	results.		  6  Acknowledgement	  This	research	was	supported	by	TÉT_16120160052	Slovenian		Hungarian	scientific	  and	 technological	 cooperation	 project	 (Comparative	 Analysis	 of	 Trends 	 Tools	 and	  Success	Factors	of	Digital	Transformation	in	Slovenia	and	Hungary).
