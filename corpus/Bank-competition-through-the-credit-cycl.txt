The ﬁndings are discussed in  the context of a large international literature on the eﬀects of lending concentration and competition  on ﬁrms’ access to ﬁnance. We conclude that the increase in market concentration that is currently  taking place in Ireland is most likely to lead to more diﬃcult credit conditions for Small and Medium  Enterprises (SMEs).    Our research has ﬁve key ﬁndings. Firstly  concentration of lending to the private sector fell during  the boom period of 20042008  and rose steadily since the onset of the crisis. This ﬁnding provides  evidence of increased market entry and expansion of previously smaller lenders during periods of  prosperity  and retrenchment of all but the largest lenders during downturns. Secondly  lending to  SMEs is signiﬁcantly more concentrated than lending to the private sector in total. This suggests that  the lending market for smaller ﬁrms  about whom information is less easily attained (“informationally  opaque”)  presents larger barriers to entry which protect incumbent lenders. Thirdly  we ﬁnd a degree  of heterogeneity in the concentration of lending to diﬀerent sectors of economic activity. Fourthly   concentration of new lending ﬂows to SMEs in 2010 and 2011 is shown to be signiﬁcantly higher than  concentration of the stock of SME credit across all sectors. This suggests that the trajectory is towards  even higher concentration in the market. Finally  foreign banks’ share of private sector credit stock  peaked just as the crisis began  and has been falling since  indicating that in times of crisis foreign  market participants react by more aggressively reducing exposure than domestic banks.    There are two competing hypotheses on the likely eﬀect of a more concentrated lending market  on access to ﬁnance for ﬁrms. The Market Power Hypothesis (MPH) predicts that the traditional  Industrial Organization result should hold  a more concentrated market means more market power  for the largest banks  which leads to higher prices  tougher conditions and less lending. The Information  Hypothesis (IH)  however  suggests that relationship lending  under which investments in information  are required on the part of the lender  reverses the direction of the predicted eﬀect. Under this  hypothesis  a more competitive market will lead to less lending  as banks will not have the incentive  to make investments in information and their relationships  particularly with small borrowers.    The paper proceeds as follows  Section 2 provides analysis of trends in concentration of the Irish  private sector and SME lending markets; Section 3 highlights lessons from the literature that can  provide policy conclusions for Ireland; Section 4 concludes.    2 Credit Concentration  Data and Analysis    We use the Central Bank of Ireland’s Money and Banking Statistics. These data are available at the  lendersectorquarter level  with the sectors to which each institution lends mapping into the NACE  classiﬁcation of sectors of activity. A number of statistics are available at this disaggregation  the  outstanding stock of credit to all private sector ﬁrms from 2000 to Q3 2011; the outstanding stock  of credit to SMEs from Q4 2010 to Q3 2011; the volume of new lending ﬂows to SMEs from Q4  2010 to Q3 2011. Due to the nature of the data available  we focus our attention on the Herﬁndahl  Hirschman Index (HHI) of competition  which is a measure based solely on the concentration of  lending markets. While the literature has found that a more concentrated market need not necessarily  be less competitive  the evidence suggests that in Ireland the trend has generally been that as markets  become less concentrated  they have also been more competitive  and vice versa. Goggin et al. (2012)  ﬁnd evidence that lenders in the Irish mortgage market have increased standard variable rates as  concentration levels in the market have increased since 2008. We calculate a HHI initially for each  quarter and then for each sectorquarter. These are calculated as the sum of the square of the market  share of each market participant. A higher share represents a more concentrated  or less competitive  lending market. We also calculate at the same frequency and disaggregation the share of domestic  banks in total lending.    2    2.1 Concentration in private sector lending    Figure 1 plots the HHI for all private sector (nonﬁnancial) lending  and for lending to all “core” (non  propertyrelated  nonﬁnancial) sectors. For core sectors  the Irish banking system became steadily  less concentrated from the years in which the credit boom began to accelerate (generally considered  to be 200405) up to 2008  witnessed by a noticeable decline in the HHI. From mid2008  however   there is a clearly visible turning point in the series  with concentration increasing ever since. This  presents a clear pattern of either increased entry or increased expansion by small market participants  during a boom period  followed by a contraction in competitive forces once economic conditions began  to deteriorate.    The minimum value that the HHI reached in 2008 was .15  with the value for Q3 2011 standing at  .19. To get a sense for whether or not a HHI of .19 represents a concentrated lending market  Table  1 reports HHIs calculated in previous studies. McCann et al. (2012) ﬁnd that across 26 European  countries between 2000 and 2009  85 per cent of the countryyear observations have a HHI below .2.  These numbers and those of Table 1 suggest that concentration in the Irish private sector lending  market is heading towards the upper end of international norms for developed countries.    Data on lending to Small and Medium Enterprises has been required by the Central Bank of  Ireland since 2010. Our prior  due to the opaque nature of smaller ﬁrms  is that this market should  be more concentrated than the private sector credit market. Figure 2 plots the HHI for the stock  of private sector and SME credit on identical scales for Q4 2010 to Q3 2011. The ﬁgure shows a  clear diﬀerence  with the SME lending market having a HHI ranging between .25 and .27 over the  sample period  signiﬁcantly larger than any ﬁgure observed for the whole private sector. Numerous  studies have previously shown that smaller ﬁrms have more diﬃculty in accessing ﬁnance. The higher  concentration level found in the lending market to smaller ﬁrms is a potential channel through which  this diﬃculty may arise.    While Figure 2 outlined the diﬀerence in the HHI of outstanding credit stocks between private sector  and SME lending  Figure 3 plots the HHI for new lending ﬂows to SMEs  which gives an indication  of the likely path for concentration in the market. These data are likely to be more volatile than  concentration measures for credit stocks  given the diﬃculties experienced in the Irish ﬁnancial sector  and the low volume of new lending in a given quarter in 201011 1 thus an average of the available  data is plotted here. The ﬁgure shows that the HHI in new lending  is consistently higher than the  HHI for outstanding stock. This indicates that the Irish SME lending market is currently becoming  more concentrated.    Figures 4 and 5 exploit the sectoral dimension of the lending data. Figure 4 reports the concen  tration of outstanding credit stock of each sector of economic activity in 2004 and 2008. The picture  shows a heterogeneity in concentration of lending across sectors  and a pattern of increasing competi  tion over the credit boom. The only exception to this pattern is the construction sector  which had a  HHI of .19 in 2004 and .26 in 2008. The general trend presented supports the proposition made earlier  in the paper that the period of economic and credit boom in Ireland was associated with an increase  in competition in the lending market. Figure 5 presents an average HHI for each sector in 201011   comparing the HHI for lending to all ﬁrms on the left with the HHI for lending to SMEs on the right.  We observe higher concentration in the lending market for smaller ﬁrms in the majority of sectors. As  mentioned previously  this higher concentration may be driven by the opaque nature of smaller ﬁrms  which increases barriers to new entrants  but may also in itself contribute to credit constraints for  smaller ﬁrms.    On new lending ﬂows to SMEs  Figure 6 goes beyond the national numbers presented in Figure  3 and sheds light on the likely path for concentration of sectoral SME lending markets. With three  sectors presenting HHIs above .4  and all sectors reporting a HHI greater than .25  it appears that  the market for newly issued credit to SMEs in Ireland is an highly concentrated one. The logical  conclusion is that lending will become more concentrated in the short run in the majority of sectors in    1Central Bank Money and Banking Statistics show that new lending to SMEs averaged roughly e500m per quarter    in 2011.    3    the economy  with the knockon eﬀects for credit conditions and constraints that have been mentioned  previously.    2.2 Bank Nationality    As outlined in the introduction  a large literature exists on the role that foreignowned banks can play  in decreasing credit constraints for local ﬁrms  particularly when high concentration poses the risk of  increased constraints. The share of lending accounted for by foreign and domestic banks is outlined  in this section. As in the previous section  we begin with the longest time series available to us   plotting the quarterly share of private sector lending stock accounted for by the domesticallyowned  and foreignowned banks. Table 2 reports the banks that are deﬁned as domestic or foreign. Ulster  Bank  although present in the Irish market for over a century  is considered a foreign bank for the  purposes of this analysis.    Figure 7 reports the share of domestic banks in private sector lending  with the red line representing  lending to core sectors. Consistent with analysis of the HHI  a clear pattern emerges whereby during  the boom period of 2004 to 2008  the market penetration of foreign banks increased signiﬁcantly.  This is consistent with a situation where attractive potential returns in a booming economy attract  new entrants to the lending market. The post2008 crisis has had an identical eﬀect on foreign bank  penetration to that on competition in the market  with a steady increase in the domestic share of  lending from a low of 54 per cent at the end of 2009 to 64 per cent in 2011 Q3. This pattern matches  the ﬁndings of Presbitero et al. (2012) who show that more distant banks in Italy are more likely to  ration credit since the onset of the crisis. As with the ﬁndings on concentration previously  the lessons  of the literature suggest that this trend will likely have a detrimental eﬀect on credit conditions in the  local economy.    Figure 8 shows a degree of heterogeneity in foreign bank penetration across sectors of activity. The  domestic share of lending fell in the majority of sectors between 2004 and 2008  although there are  notable anomalies such as the construction sector  where domestic banks’ share of lending increased  from 59 to 72 per cent over the boom period.    Figure 9 shows that  in the SME lending market  the domestic share in both new lending and  the stock of credit are very similar at 65 and 66 per cent  indicating the the outlook is that the  domestic share will remain steady. In the SME market  there are sectors such as Transport & Storage   Construction and Business & Administrative Services which are dominated by local banks  but in most  sectors where the share lies around 60 per cent  indicating that a signiﬁcant market share will continue  to be accounted for by foreign lenders.    3 Lessons for Ireland from the literature    Figures for new lending suggest that the likely path for the SME market is towards further concen  tration  from a position where the market is already highly concentrated in international terms. The  trajectory for foreign bank penetration also appears to be downward. The international academic  literature provides numerous lessons for the likely eﬀect of this on access to ﬁnance in the Irish real  economy.    The conﬂicting predictions of the Market Power Hypothesis (MPH) and Information Hypothesis  (IH) have been tested on numerous occasions  with a wide range of papers oﬀering ambiguous results.  The direction of the eﬀect can depend on the sample of countries used  the additional control variables  included  and the proxy used for competition in the banking sector.2 Papers that reconcile the two  views have done so in a number of ways. de Guevara and Maudos (2009) and Patti and Dell’Ariccia    2Papers supporting the MPH include Beck et al. (2004)  Chong et al. (2011)  Agostino and Trivieri (2010)   Black and Strahan (2002)  Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) and Cetorelli and Strahan (2006). Petersen and Rajan (1995)  presented ﬁrst evidence that less competitive banking systems could lead to more access to ﬁnance. Other papers  supporting this hypothesis include Giannetti et al. (2008) and Zarutskie (2006).    4    (2004) explain that the relationship has an inverted Ushape  i.e. at very high levels of concentration   the MPH holds  but below these levels the IH holds. CarboValverde et al. (2009) explain the ambi  guity by relating concentration and competition to measures of market contestability and information  attainment. If a market is concentrated and also is not vigorously contested  then the MPH is shown  to hold.    A separate but related literature on the eﬀect of foreign bank penetration on credit conditions  exists. A number of studies  generally using data for emerging market countries  have found beneﬁcial  eﬀects of foreign bank penetration on access to ﬁnance.3 A more recent literature  however has found  that during the crisis period  foreign bank penetration may pose additional risks to local ﬁrms  in that  these banks  with less information on the local market  generally retrench at a faster pace than local  banks.4    This literature has a number of implications for the trends presented here for Ireland. The key  message of de Guevara and Maudos (2009) is that the MPH holds at the highest levels of concentration   but not at lower levels. As outlined earlier  it appears that concentration in Ireland is approaching  the highest range of HHIs seen in Europe in recent decades. The key lesson of CarboValverde et al.  (2009) is that concentration will lead to tougher credit conditions where there is not a high degree of  contestability or investment in information on the part of lenders. Evidence from Goggin et al. (2012)  suggests that in the Irish mortgage market  increased concentration has not been accompanied by  vigorous competitive behaviour since 2008. Furthermore  new lending ﬁgures reported by the Central  Bank of Ireland have been low in 2010/11  and Lawless and McCann (2011) have shown that credit  conditions in Ireland are the most diﬃcult in the euro area currently. All of these facts suggest that  in  terms of the results of CarboValverde et al. (2009)  Ireland appears to be in a position where increased  concentration is likely to exacerbate  as opposed to ease  SME credit constraints.    Beck et al. (2004) suggest that an eﬃcient credit registry and foreign bank penetration can mitigate  the eﬀects of bank concentration on obstacles to ﬁnance. The fact that a credit register does not exist  (although it is planned to begin operating in 2013)  combined with a trend towards foreign banks’  lending shares falling in Ireland in recent years  suggests that these mitigating factors are not likely to  be in place to reverse the predicted eﬀects of the MPH in Ireland in the coming years. Similarly  while  high GDP per capita and good insititutional quality are currently qualities of which Ireland can boast   the likely growth rate in GDP in Ireland  given current economic concerns across Europe  suggests  that an increase in economic activity is also unlikely to reverse the MPH eﬀect.    4 Conclusion    This paper presents descriptive statistics on competition in lending to ﬁrms in the Irish private sector  using detailed banklevel lending data. The aim of the paper is to present a picture of competition levels  in the market and to draw implications for Irish ﬁrms’ credit access. From a policy perspective our  key ﬁndings are as follows  the lending market for all enterprises has become more concentrated since  the onset of the 2008 crisis; the lending market for SMEs is signiﬁcantly more concentrated  and the  trend is towards even higher concentration; foreign bank penetration has diminished in Ireland since  the crisis. Having distilled the lessons from the literature on the likely eﬀect of increased concentration  and lower foreign bank penetration in the Irish SME lending market  it appears most likely is that  the predictions of the Market Power Hypothesis will prevail  leading to tougher conditions for SMEs  seeking to access ﬁnance. Policy measures such as a loan guarantee scheme  microﬁnance fund and  credit register should help to mitigate these adverse eﬀects somewhat  but it is clear from the analysis  presented here that challenges will remain in the medium term.    3Examples include Giannetti and Ongena (forthcoming)  George R.G.
