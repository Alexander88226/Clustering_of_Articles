case former still applicable element step screen unchanged investor could help determine whether amount investment financier could useful find deficiency prescribe right remedy order improvement enhance competitiveness financing evaluation although smes investment financing boom smes still could get away financing difficulty reason selection mechanism mutualtrust mutualbenefit establish information screen built bridge investor financier great benefit solve problem asymmetric information smes index screen right first financing cost reduce screen mechanism smes index could try avoid adverse selection would raise interest financing low one return symmetry also reduce financing cost second credibility reflect objectively people stereotype smes scale company would poor credibility low index fact plenty smes lack good business reputation therefore information screen mechanism would safeguard right enterprise smes low index screen relief screen chance would place smes find deficiency improvement favor investor one hand enhance credibility reduce default hand improve corporate governance structure necessary disclosure avoid reverse choice investor screen dialectical first choose transparent reason investor take adverse selection face unknown group screen information different enterprise could quantify compare transparency information investor could positive choice accord characteristic financing second minimization transparency information choice investor would much objective fair generally smes index would win favor investor financier compete improve quality information probability moral hazard would decline rapidly addition performance capacity index enterprise satisfactory default would also maintain low level conclusion application screen would change original lemon financier accurate timely disclosure private information investor could well grasp objective choice due improvement symmetric information original adverse selection moral hazard
