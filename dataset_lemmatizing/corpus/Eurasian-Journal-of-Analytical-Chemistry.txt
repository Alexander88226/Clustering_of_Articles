small and medium enterprise smes play important role thai economic growth and sustainable development recentlythai government improved operational efficiency smes development source innovation and business evolutionsector that can solve high unemployment problem facing the country nowadays there are approximately entity thailand and there are approximately about smes the financial sector dominated all service the economy including banking the bank thailand related operational efficiency smes development the accounting system provide and support source information owner and manager smes operating any industry for use the measurement financial performance importance any business regardless entity big small that the accounting practice smes need improve the accounting and relevant financial information the concept and principle adopted digital financial technology ensure reliability business and financial performance measured all the relevant accounting information are related profitability appropriate for successful management any business entity whether large small entrepreneur fei and minqian cutting edge technology blockchain provided the stateoftheart solution democratic virtual economic system that can verify payment reach consensus and store encrypted data virtual eco chaisonrungkaputiliterature review nomic system which meet the requirement speculator profitdriven entrepreneur marketfundamentalist libertarian and technology fetishist yelowitz and wilson blockchain defined distributed ledger technology that can implement financial model fei and minqian the cryptocurrency based collaborative open source principle and peertopeer network that suggest commitment social solidarity and mutual aid the blockchain composite technology for trusted data flow untrusted environment blockchain network tier verification node legalize transaction the longest hash chain each block contains multiple legal transaction taking transaction and clearing business the financial industry example the central database can not solve the multiparty trust problem every participant maintain database for carrying their own business data that potentially increase the cost labor the blockchain good solution for data transmission management distributed network however all transaction verification node need ensure the comprehensive backup transaction history therefore this matter concerned and inspected untrusted party fei and minqian this researchaimstodevelop the accounting verification process affecting digital currency transaction recorded being kept and maintained thai smes entrepreneur their reliable and the confident accounting information and privacy control protect and process accounting information that can measured using blockchain technology for small and medium business thailand this paper organized follows section introduction section literature review section the proposed model section the finding and give recommendation for future development the conclusion blockchain shared distributed ledger that log transaction that provide for persistence and verifiability transaction hari and lakshman transaction cryptographically signed instruction constructed user the blockchain muzammal for example the transfer cryptocurrency from one account another transaction are grouped into block linked and secured using cryptographic hash consensus protocol enables the node the blockchain network create trust the state the log and make blockchains inherently resistant tampering daniel and guida florian and luca therefore blockchain technology able toeliminate the need for middleman from the management transaction such bank the transfer money florian and luca blockchain distributed database that built network participating party who run the same subject the constraint and rule set the underlying block data gradually being chained together unlike centralized database held single entity creates indelible record resistant tampering any individual party furthermore any code the underlying chain are tweaked participant the nature the resultant blockchain change opening the possibility creating blockchain database storing all manner diverse data including property title contract share voting decision even reputation score hasanova blockchain system are most useful recording simpler data besides the type cryptocurrency adopted incentive mechanism these platform distinguish themselves few key property the access policy tell who can participate the blockchain network public blockchains allow anyone join and access the information stored the blockchain via the internet private blockchains are restricted private network and selected node only waltl florian and luca theory neither party can completely control the process the parent chain miner can only update status verify the legality the data chain strict accordance with rule unlike the concurrency control trusted distributed database blockchain consider the existence byzantine node the network may perform malicious behavior replicable state machine model between node and blockchain generated with full backup transaction verification node called miner always pursuit the unspent transaction output utxo via massive calculation the miner are willing spend electricity cost pay for the record right the next block competition for right ensures blockchain are naturally able resist double spend attack via the vulnerable fei and minqian eurasian journal analytical chemistry ethereum application platform developed the builtin ether coin which implement cryptocurrency fei and minqian this system also provides turing complete engine which used behalf blockchain lin and qiang later the linux foundation launched open source blockchain project hyperledger develop the crossindustry commercial blockchain platform despite this the question whether ethereum can harnessed empower marginalized community and build new mean solidaritybased finance remains unanswered particularly the regulation that must rigorously considered blockchain ledger application bank that the provisioning accounting standard currently referred ifrs financial instrument document published july the international accounting standard board iasb based ledger for banking that recording and processing loss the ledger are compliant with the ifrs standard classification these classification determine how financial asset and financial liability are accounted for financial statement and significantly how they are measured inprogress basis such buildingblock contract could woven together form the basis for more complex multistage multifunction entity referred some decentralized autonomous organization daos pangburn daos are primarily advanced multistage algorithm held the validation policy that informs who among the node can participate consensus creation and deploy smart contract the consensus protocol specifies how trust created among participant proof work pow requires node socalled miner invest significant hashing power create trust proof stake requires node prove ownership sufficient cryptocurrency establish trust florian and luca other notable consensus protocol are proof elapsed time poe proof importance poi proof state universa blockchain protocol raftbased consensus quorum and stream processing ordering service that all use replication establish trust the state the network even faced with failing network node daniel and guida florian and luca however some blockchain architecture which unchangeability would not enable the reversal misclassifications lin and qiang under the ifrs framework there logical classification structure for all financial asset which driven cash flow characteristic and therefore the business model which asset settlement under ifrs standardizes the management and reporting such item banking ledger simplified fashion compared those the previous rulebased requirement that are complex and difficult apply and more importantly complicated automate into smart contract transformation blockchain banking ledger rosati and this paper study some key issue that affect digital currency transaction smes developing verifies accounting process using blockchain technology tool build new process property right thailand based explicitly cooperative and social trust principle cryptocurrencies are subject the concept decentralized public ledger collectively maintained network participant the use blockchain ledger record log transaction allen rosati and fact can expand the vision trustenabling decentralized cooperative distributed collaborative organization among thai nation design and build our model using cryptocurrency with blockchain technology providing customized feature such deposit withdrawal financial contract and gas limit via net programming language that can created for any transaction type application the research population comprises smes involve with digital currency exchange and various service thailand our model consists following shown figure the integrity sequence and validity block are checked block header which includes the version number previous hash timestamp target difficulty random nonce all node run the blockchain application can generate pseudo random private key sha fei and minqian encrypt payment the proposed model data model network tier chaisonrungkaputi the consortium blockchain improves the speed the verification and authentication adjusting the decentralization vertical scalability the architecture pay more attention risk management for upgrading traditional enterprise application the public blockchain scenario fei and minqian the network environment fair although the type node are different unsecured for node that exposed network brings multitude security issue including attack statistic and analysis the blockchain operation into two part leader election and transaction serialization the algorithm pow fei and minqian reused but pow only used select the leader the leader can write block containing the public key and multiple microblocks that they can prevent forking these block are generated and broadcasted after intensely short interval the public key the miner merely included the key block all subsequent micro block are signed with the corresponding private key prevent faking micro block the incentive mechanism hardcoded split incentive which may have allocation vulnerability employ myetherwallet maranh that customized the underlying ethereum virtual machine implement customized contract engine that extend the function blockchain enrich user interface the contract engine fei and minqian the consensus algorithm the finding fig the proposed model using with blockchain technology the experiment our model based the concept consensus protocol and cryptocurrencies isthe keysthat affect digital currency transactionswe implement myetherwallet which distributed ledger platform leveraging private asymmetric key sha and various function allowing data flow between multiple party can tracked and managed real time one distributed ledger platform which provide the state financial transaction scenario the scenario transaction shown figure requested transfer money from and the state transition function reduces the value account and increase the value account account than the first place the state transition function return error hence one can formally define example apply somsri somchai send from somsri somchai somsri somchai but apply somsri somchai send from somsri somchai error eurasian journal analytical chemistry conclusion fig the verification procedure based the cryptographic blockchain finding found that the consensus protocol blockchain affect accounting transaction the method consensus algorithm using proof work can provide formal verification based asymmetric mathematical verification logic calculus cryptography security encryption the advantage pow can make the verification procedure based the cryptographic blockchain are not only stop abusive people who control central institution but also resolve the problem how establish trust relationship amongsmes financial transaction therefore the security and reliability the decentralize database can solve the multiparty trust problem accounting verification process this research objective develop the accounting verification process affecting digital currency transaction included smes cooperative financial structure and ecosystem thailand case the finding revealed that the consensus protocol using proof work the model can provide effective result not only record monitor and trace all the transaction correctly but also establish trust relationship support sustainable cooperation and best practice for thai smes however the decentralized ledger technology still new thailandit the fintech outlook disruptive technology especially among thai smes and startup entity that consider how blockchain technology could benefit therefore recommended that the national regulator must develop specific accounting guideline support sustainable cooperation and best practice for thai smes finally this research ongoing development based ecosystem such cryptoequity system the futurewe will create online financial application
