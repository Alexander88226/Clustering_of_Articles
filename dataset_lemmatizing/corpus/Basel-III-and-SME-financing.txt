conclusion blanket application the basel iii regulation those traditionally nancing smes could the medium term jeopardise the stability sme nancing and thus economic recovery those providing nance smes not have the same opportunity for capital accumulation systemically important large bank which are the real target group basel iii liquidity requirement well the leverage ratio further impair the operational business banking group which especially the nancial crisis proved systemstabilising adapting the regulation the various business model and the relevant speci city national banking sector therefore advisable for systemically important bank active across the contrast full implementation should sought order avoid distortion competition managerkreis der friedrichebertstiftung introductory remarksin september the insolvency investment bank lehman brother triggered one the worst global economic crisis since one year later the head state and government the state meeting pittsburgh decided improve the resilience the nancial market mean new regulation banking supervision the basel committee banking supervision tasked with implementing this decision december published the new set rule known basel iii the real economy need developed and well functioning nancial market the experience the nancial crisis therefore require the redesign the rule governing nancial market participant and thus also the rule banking supervision however because the signi cance the nancial sector for national economy sound analysis the effect any planned new regulation advisable order facilitate correct procedure and keep unwanted sideeffects minimum the reverse side any sweeping restriction the business activity which triggered the crisis would the constriction activity vital national economy such general lending company smes with annual turnover million euro make more than per cent all german company and employ more than per cent all worker see kfw bankengruppe smes are therefore the growth

provision well the current status the regulatory process then analysis the possible effect the basel iii provision lending focusing the intermediary the german banking market which are important for smes the implication for sme nancing are also considered the paper concludes with number proposed measure managerkreis der friedrichebertstiftung basel iii current statusa substantive content the revision basel iii essentially encompass three set issue whose effect will also analysed here changing the capital mix and raising the minimum capital ratio introduction liquidity ratio liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio introduction leverage ratioin accordance with basel capital date comprised core capital tier for example paidin capital reserve and net earnings supplementary capital tier for example designated reserve and longterm subordinated liability and third tier capital tier for example shortterm subordinated liability see seufert tier capital subdivided into hard and additional capital this will gradually increase with basel iii from per cent per cent consisting per cent hard equity capital per cent capital conservation buffer and per cent additional equity capital this change ect the goal basel iii more and better capital reinforce the cushion against loss and thus the capital institution need continue socalled goingconcern capital contrast capital which come into play primarily case insolvency also known goneconcern capital the latter other word tier capital consequently fall from per cent per cent the category tier capital been dropped completely determining the level the capital requirement still depends risk weighting market price risk and operational risk shall not present the change individual capital component detail basel iii and sme financingfurthermore future liquidity ratio will have maintained which are aimed both the shortterm and longerterm stability bank the liquidity coverage ratio for example supposed ensure that bank suf cient highvalue liquid asset onemonth basis able cover liquidity need stress situation for example partial run the bank the newly introduced leverage ratio nally limit the total business volume regardless risk weighting and thus the composition asset time the tier capital this key gure hitherto been viewed component the socalled pillar and thus reporting indicator within the framework disclosure requirement with the migration this key gure capital requirement within the framework basel iii the uence this indicator increased state the legislative processthe basel committee banking supervision legislative competence the state must therefore transpose the basel iii regulation into national law order make them binding the bank this supposed happen the end however this can not guaranteed the usa not even implemented basel yet for member state legal transposition take place the rst instance level present not clear whether basel iii will transposed directive least partly regulation regulation basel iii would equally binding all member state without parliamentary process and without the possibility adaptation national circumstance there are good reason for sticking the customary practice implementation the form directive particular germany managerkreis der friedrichebertstiftungdecentralised banking structure and the resulting possibility negative effect sme nancing make necessary provide some sort national room manoeuvre with regard legislative transposition see also weber since the regulation the basel committee are directed primarily large bank the usa for example applying the provision only these institution see zeitler basel iii and sme financingeffects basel iii the banksa general capital and liquidity requirement the newly introduced liquidity coverage ratio implies steering effect favour deposit nanced business model see benzler against the background demonstrable systemic risk with regard interbank nance these steering effect are desirable for the purpose reducing such risk focusing private deposit however could put pressure margin and thus lead deterioration the pro situation particular with regard bank with traditional business model already nanced deposit battle for private deposit therefore conceivable even though this doe not directly imply reduction lending the scope for forming revenue reserve and thus tier capital would curbed kind secondround effect this can reduce bank ability lendthe objective helping individual institution mean more and harder capital operate with greater caution and resilience and thus also increase systemic stability see zeitler welcomed against the background the principalagent problem however one might consider whether capital the right instrument far instilling caution concerned the problem basel iii undifferentiated approach also come light this point the real addressee the basel iii provision bank that are supposedly too big fail can make direct use the capital market for their additional capital need this way for example deutsche bank and commerzbank have already carried out capital increase issuing new share the intermediary bank concentrating sme nancing particular saving bank cooperative bank and also private banker and regional bank must contrast cover increased capital requirement the rst instance from retained pro should the mechanism just described develop this would make capital formation even more dif cult for those bank result the pressure their margin the illiquidity the capital these banking group also impairs the setting anticyclical managerkreis der friedrichebertstiftungcapital buffer since hard core capital can not acquired shortterm via the capital market even given attractive condition these circumstance capital can not breathe and over the long term the context basel iii must increased either through retained earnings through appeal shareholder capital formation also hindered the fact that for certain institution basel iii foresees among other thing the gradual introduction between and abatement for the difference between reserve and calculated expected loss from the lending business see benzler and basel committee banking supervision therefore expected loss calculated with reference rating system are above the reserve required under commercial law this give rise additional abatement from regulatory capital whether the effect this will shrink the volume credit allocated not yet clear because can assumed that the economic risk manifesting itself among other thing expected loss already uenced the economic management the bank certainly this applies only regulatory capital doe not represent bottleneck regulatory capital doe constitute bottleneck these abatement will tend have the effect restricting credit allocation all the more because the role regulatory capital the capital management the bank will increasing against economic capital see rabobank group capital requirement for sme loan hitherto accordance with basel riskweighted asset have had backed least per cent own capital through the socalled sme compromise however certain loan can regarded being the retail portfolio provided that the total volume credit one borrower doe not exceed million euro basically uniform risk weighting per cent applies the retail portfolio this regulation concern approximately per cent all company see bundesverband deutscher banken sme loan present have backed with per cent own capital mean the acrosstheboard increase the minimum capital basel iii and sme financingratio per cent without simultaneous adjustment risk weighting the capital requirement will rise almost per cent accordance with the basel iii provision this corresponds risk weighting per cent according the existing regulation objective reason for this discernible sme loan certainly did not trigger the nancial crisis this questionable above all the context other risk weighting for example those for european government bond this point addressed detail for example erste group bank erste group bank there also regulatory paradox why higher capital requirement when capital can not used cushion risk since falling short the minimum capital ratio already lead sanction see benzler future therefore the bank must hold capital conservation buffer which may reduced time crisis see zeitler result this mean that the average effective capital requirement increased over per cent impairment capital allocation sme loan due capital consumption for securitiesbasel iii accompanied increase risk weighting for trading book position and securitisations see rabobank group rst sight this seems step the right direction term sme nancing since the risk weighting for private and corporate loan remain untouched and supposedly risky position are covered higher capital requirement the assumption that trading book position securitisations would disposed response this increased capital requirement even regulatory risk capital would released for sme loan view the still unstable situation the money and capital market particular the market for securitisations questionable however whether will really possible dispose transaction with risk weighting that are higher under the basel iii regime one obstacle disposal could valuation loss income statement design independent risk weighted view the socalled leverage ratio also known the modi balance sheet equity ratio this represents managerkreis der friedrichebertstiftungthe relationship between hard core capital and balance sheet asset including offbalance sheet item since risk weighting underlies this indicator assumed that viewed isolation this gure provides incentive prefer presumably highyield asset pro table transaction see benzler taking all the new indicator capital including abatement and risk weighting liquidity and leverage ratio the question arises regulatorily optimal bank portfolio which meet all requirement simultaneously different market participant now assume that this form there such thing particular other regulatory innovation such the capital requirement directive are includedd possible implementation dif culties the case bank that finance smesone operational point the question whether sme credit institution have available the kind personnel and technical capacity they need able implement the new regulatory requirement time implementation will require signi cant effort both the institutional and the banking association level assuming that the institution concerned rule are not those that caused the crisis the question arises whether any likely increase stability would commensurate with the cost basel iii and sme financing implication for sme financing credit crunch and increase the cost borrowingthe effect bank lending condition described section can have negative impact sme nancing two way the one hand capital could represent bottleneck however this not understood mean that increased capital requirement tie resource that might otherwise used for lending capital should not confused with liquidity here see faz and admati certainly capital limiting factor with regard lender transaction without raising further equity securitisation growth potential lending limited particular because the current limitation their ability pas default risk mean securitisations other instrument the capital market bank not have further scope for lending see dentz top this come the newly introduced leverage ratio mentioned above which generally limit new business the latter can for example have the effect contracting lowmargin but highvolume business such stateguaranteed export nancing see bundesverband deutscher banken addition the the end stricter requirement with regard regulatory capital can lead increased nancing cost certainly the cost enterprise level private cost are not regarded isolated but rather should weighed against the cost the level the economy social cost see mile the point departure this consideration from recent english study mile that signi cant connection discernible between the leverage british bank and gdp growth worth looking more closely these line argument especially light the fact that clearly signi cant link discernible between customer condition for loan and the leverage bank the and the usa managerkreis der friedrichebertstiftungtheoretically based the modiglianimiller theorem could argued that capital cost are independent the relationship between equity and debt with growing capital adequacy the return requirement equity provider fall because the lower risk premium see also faz and admati even though the assumption frictionless market which underlies the theory not met the sensitivity customer condition with regard the bank capital ratio appears only comparatively low these argument seem point the right direction higher capital requirement have bene cial effect overall the one hand customer condition clearly can not too sensitive the level the capital ratio low private cost and the other hand with rising capital ratio the probability bank crisis and associated collapse gdp social cost fall the abovementioned study examines the situation for large british bank one key nding the following these estimate illustrate that even doubling the amount bank capital relatively modest impact upon the average cost bank fund ranging from just under bps under bps mile the author come the conclusion that level capital above that required basel iii would desirable the question arises whether this applicable sme nanciers that can not assumed hoc the one hand the argument that the anglosaxon nancing structure enterprise not directly applicable the german equivalent valid the other hand capital cost are calculated based the capital asset pricing model capital market theory the required capital risk premium can ascertained with this model precisely this regarded critically with regard saving bank and cooperative bank since both group institution have development mandate and the return equity for shareholder not primary performance indicator the german bundesbank simulation calculation the effect the basel iii capital requirement arrives margin around basis point for the german market see deutsche bundesbank basel iii and sme financingat any rate these banking group the connection between private cost and social cost not evident with regard the nancing structure german smes however can assume that the consequence higher forwarded capital cost would more pronounced germany this connection the bundesbank point out that the expected capital requirement individual bank vary and among others are fairly low for saving bank and cooperative bank see deutsche bundesbank nevertheless the bundesbank also point the danger higher interest spread and potential negative effect the real economy the effect the introduction the new liquidity ratio mentioned above were not examined finally conceivable that the bank will try reduce the risk they have take into account mean stricter requirement concerning credit quality the conclusion must therefore that even basel iii doe not lead fall the volume nancing for smes increase borrowed capital cost least possible access borrowed capital will impeded due higher requirement with regard credit quality current state sme financingat present there are concrete indication lending bottleneck according the credit hurdle calculated the ifo institute only around per cent the enterprise asked recently complained about restricted lending see ifo institute this one the lowest gures since this statistic began recorded true that bank are clearly issuing fewer loan than before the nancial crisis comparison the total volume loan showed fall over per cent against this general trend the crisis and thereafter result analysis the bundesbank mfizinsstatistik for the period managerkreis der friedrichebertstiftungdecentrally organised credit institution particular were able ensure the stability sme nancing for example germany the volume lending enterprise and the selfemployed saving bank billion euro increase around per cent the same applies the cooperative bank which lent total billion euro enterprise and selfemployed increase around per cent see deutsche bundesbank however the situation the capital market remains tense the western industrialised country will not able reduce their new debt zero for the foreseeable future and thus will continue resort frequently the bond market there are also the bond issue the euro rescue fund looking the schedule introduction the commencement higher capital requirement should also noted that this coincides with the socalled wall nancing other word and many corporate bond and loan will fall due see gisdakis this increased supply will lead rising yield and thus indirectly increase the cost bank loan the other hand smes are restricted their choice form nancing traditionally house bank loan have been smes main nancing instrument around per cent the volume nancing covered this way see ttchennespethal capital market related nancing instrument because the volume required and documentation requirement are not available most smes the dependence bank loan not led any problem date with regard nancing economic upturn indeed particular the period before the nancial crisis characterised surplus both domestic and foreign loan furthermore consolidation process expected among the regional bank the volume credit therefore not likely reach the precrisis level the foreseeable future the combination basel iii the tense situation the capital market and overall reduced credit volume can thus result deterioration the sme nancing situation whether the interim arrangement and the gradual implementation basel iii will cushion the possible negative effect sme nancing questionable for different view basel iii and sme financingsee zeitler apart from that the technical basis lacking for some the consequence basel iii for example the higher capital requirement with regard sme loan and the unrestricted application sme nanciers managerkreis der friedrichebertstiftung measure new capital requirement and the introduction liquidity ratio are logical consequence the nancial crisis and thus are necessary the breakdown the interbank market and the state rescue package support the bank capital the nancial crisis have clearly brought about that readjustment necessary with regard level capital and liquidity however there are wellfounded doubt whether the basel iii corset should applied without adjustment the banking structure germany guarantee the stability sme nancing the future the managerkreis therefore recommends the following measure basel iii been the practice far must implemented directive that way national legislator would have the opportunity adjust the basel iii provision the specific condition the national market particular the regulation must adapted the typical sme financier which term size and business model sometimes differ considerably from the large institution that are the real addressee basel iii the same time full implementation basel iii for systemically important euwide bank should sought order avoid possible distortion competition new sme compromise must found for basel iii analogous basel order that the capital requirement for sme loan are not raised this could happen mean change risk weighting despite the stability bankbased corporate financing germany consideration
