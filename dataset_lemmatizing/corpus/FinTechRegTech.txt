money laundering and surveillance conduct breach fistwo tentative conclusion emerge the added value applying machine learning the financial service sector first the ability machine learning method analyze very large amount data while offering high granularity and depth predictive analysis can improve analytical capability across risk management and compliance area fis example are the detection complex illicit transaction pattern payment system and more accurate credit risk modeling second the application machine learning approach within the financial service sector highly contextdependent ample highquality data for training analysis are not always available fis more importantly the predictive power and granularity analysis several approach can come the cost increased model complexity and lack explanatory insight this issue particularly where analytics are applied regulatory context and supervisor compliance team will want audit and understand the applied model machine learning revolution risk management and compliance introductionin recent year machine learning and artificial intelligence have seen increasing interest and popularity the financial service community hope are that they can dramatically improve analytical capability and streamline and automate all kind business line including credit underwriting compliance interaction with client and risk management the institute international finance iif previously written about the use machine learningai regtech banking and the new business model fintechin past year the amount data gathered financial institution fis have increased significantly the detail reporting requirement mushroomed and digitalization service creating large amount highfrequency unstructured consumer data result fis have clear need for more powerful analytical tool cope with large amount data all kind source and format while maintaining improving granularity analysis machine learning widely seen the financial service sector technique that may deliver that analytical power subfield statistic that quickly gained prominence the tech community recent year while element machine learning back the early century widespread use

the concept machine learning and within financial service machine learning link with other type statistical analysis possibility and limit will also briefly touch deep learning form artificial intelligence that root machine learning thereafter application within banking will discussed through three use case machine learning credit risk modeling detection fraud and money laundering and surveillance conduct breach and abusive behavior within financial institutionsbackground machine learningmachine learning comprises broad range analytical tool which can categorized into supervised and unsupervised learning tool supervised machine learning involves building statistical model for predicting estimating output based one more input predicting gdp growth based several variable unsupervised learning dataset analyzed without dependent variable estimate predict rather the data analyzed show pattern and structure datasetmachine learning particularly powerful tool for prediction purpose identifying relationship pattern data sample able create model incorporating those relationship that lead the most powerful outofsample prediction such model created running variable and the model subsamples the data identify the most powerful predictor and then testing the model many different data subsamples this can done thousand time that the model can learn from the data and improve predictive performance due reliance large datasets and heavy computing power machine learning closely associated with the big data revolution all extraordinary speedup computing recent year coupled with significant theoretical advance machinelearning algorithm have created renaissance computational modeling the accuracy some supervised machine learning approach further augmented through their ability conduct nonparametric analysis which can flexibly fit any model estimate the data this contrast some conventional statistical approach that start out making assumption about the relationship between the dependent and independent variable linear regression for example assumes that this relationship linear while this doe not necessarily need the case several machine learning approach contrast are also able infer nonlinear relationship which make them better able fit the data see iif regtech financial service technology solution for compliance and reporting march httpbitlymdq also

applicability varies with the type statistical problem one might want address broadly speaking machine learning can applied three class statistical problem regression classification and clustering regression and classification problem both can solved through supervised machine learning clustering unsupervised machine learning approachregression problem involve prediction quantitative continuous dependent variable such gdp growth inflation linear learning method try solve regression problem including partial least square and principal component analysis nonlinear learning method include

have idea what might cause that correlation break down deep learning and neural network from machine learning artificial intelligenceso far discussion focused classic machine learning method that are applied statistical problem with welldefined and structured datasets additionally machine learning approach have been advanced and combined solve all kind complex problem functioning artificial intelligence one the dominant approach deep learning learning approach that can based both supervised and nonsupervised method all are nonlinearthere are several way deal with overfitting and improve the forecast power machine learning model including bootstrapping boosting and bootstrap aggregation also called bagging boosting concern the overweighting scarcer observation training dataset ensure the model will train more intensively them for example one may want overweight the fraudulent observation due their relative scarcity when training model detect fraudulent transaction dataset bagging model run hundred thousand time each different subsample the dataset improve predictive performance the final model then average each the run model since this average model been tested lot different data sample should more resilient change the underlying data random forest example model consisting many different decision treebased model econometrician can take this concept even further combining the resulting model with model based another machine learning technique the result socalled ensemble model consisting group model whose outcome are combined weighted averaging voting been shown that averaging over many small model tends give better outofsample prediction than choosing single model theoryfree approach analysis due typical lack explanatory power and inherent complexity machine

some conventional machinelearning approach can equipped solve nonnumeric problem well for example xmeans clustering been applied text mining deep learning often proved more accurate however typical deeplearning system extremely complex and requires dataset with hundred million labeled observation only trained many field availability sufficient data for such extremely large datasets hardly givenapplication within financial servicesin past year the amount data gathered financial institution fis have increased significantly the detail reporting requirement have mushroomed and digitalization service creating large amount highfrequency unstructured consumer data result fis have clear need for more powerful analytical tool cope with large amount data all kind source and format while maintaining improving granularity analysisafter the financial crisis many new regulation and supervisory measure were introduced that required fis report more detailed and more frequent data more aspect their business model and balance sheet under the new capital regime bank report large exposure liquidity measure collateral and capital level stress test are based all kind firm data including loanlevel balance sheet data and qualitative aspect the business model the federal reserve ccar exercise requires fis consider the impact more than economic variable their business for insurer solvency dramatically increased reporting requirement these process create large amount reporting data that need welldefined and structured aggregated across the group and delivered intime with supervisor regulator have therefore introduced numerous initiative improve the quality supervisory data and the ability financial institution deliver these data the basel committee principle for risk data aggregation basel set standard for gsibs improve their system and reporting structure ifrs aim improve the quality supervisory dataapart from reporting data fis are increasingly able gather large amount lowquality unstructured highfrequency data these include output from consumer apps and other digital interaction with client metadata from payment system and external data source such social medium feed which can mined gauge insight market sentiment this type data typically called big data with practically all aspect business model regulated and supervised with detailed risk metric

build consumer credit risk model these combine traditional credit factor such debttoincome ratio with consumer banking transaction which greatly increase the predictive power the model fis have traditionally used linear logit and probit regression model credit risk for capital requirement stresstesting and internal risk management procedure recently many have started experiment with the application machine learning method improve financial risk prediction unsupervised method are typically used explore the data while regression and classification method tree support vector machine can predict key credit risk variable probability default lossgiven default bank normally have extensive record loanlevel data serve input bank have sometimes also experienced that machine learning can hard apply method can complex and model sensitive overfitting the data thereby the quality data within bank not always fit enough for advanced statistical analysis while bank are not always able consolidate the data from across the financial group among others due inconsistent data definition across jurisdiction and the use multiple system nonparametric and nonlinear approach support vector machine neural network and deep learning and ensemble are complex that they are practically black box that are hard not impossible for any human understand and audit from the outside that make these model hardly useful for regulatory purpose such the development internal model the basel internal ratingsbased approach financial supervisor typically require risk model clear and simple order understandable and verifiable and appropriate for validation themthat doe not however rule out the use machine learning optimize parameter and model with regulatory function linear and simple nonlinear machine learning approach can applied and still perform better than similar nonmachine learning approach machine learning can also applied select variable and optimize parameter existing linear regulatory model khandani stress that cart tree model produce easily interpretable decision rule whose logic clearly laid out despite their nonlinear character indeed there have been example already bank applying machine learning regulatory context public example citigroup hired external vendor build revenue forecasting model for the ccar exercisefraudone area which machine learning been applied for more than decade and with significant success the detection credit card fraud bank have equipped their credit card payment infrastructure with monitoring system socalled workflow engine which monitor payment for potential fraudulent activity fraudulent transaction can then blocked realtime the fraud model used these engine have been trained historical payment datathe high frequency credit card transaction provides the large datasets required for algorithm training back testing and validation furthermore since bank are able verify unambiguously which transaction were fraudulent and which were not they can construct clear historical data with relevant fraud and nonfraud label train classification algorithm the historical transaction datasets showcase wide variety predetermined feature fraud which distinguish normal card usage from fraudulent card usage ranging from feature from transaction the card holder from transaction history the detection money laundering and terrorism financing through payment system stand contrast machine learning longstanding record credit card fraud many bank are still relying conventional rulesbased system which focus individual transaction simple transaction pattern these system are often unable detect complex pattern transaction obtain holistic view transaction behavior payment infrastructure due their coarse selection method the number false positive created these system substantial result significant human capacity required for the assessment alert and filtering false positive from actual suspicious observation addition impediment data sharing and data usage well longestablished regulatory requirement have complicated innovation the amlcft area probit model the dependent variable binary can only take two value logit model the dependent variable categorical ayasdi ccar stress test httpbitlymny undated and after yesterday ccar stressful for citigroup march httpbitlymmbfph see the iif forthcoming report the use regtech for aml and submission fatf and the bcbs for more information data sharing issue amlcft wwwiifcom the capco institute journal financial transformation machine learning revolution risk management and compliance machinelearning system have the potential improve detection money laundering activity significantly due their ability identify complex pattern the data and combine transaction information network speed with data from many other source obtain holistic picture client activity indeed these system have already been shown bring false positive down significantly however application far the aml space lagged for several reason first money laundering hard define there universally agreed definition money laundering and financial institution not receive feedback from law enforcement agency which their reported suspicious activity have turned out money laundering therefore more difficult train mldetection algorithm using historical data because incidence money laundering typically not firmly established secondbest fis are optimizing detection algorithm using lowerlevel suspicious activity report depending variable for classification using classification between alert that the bank could classify false alert and those that moved submitted sars law enforcement agency unsupervised learning method are also applied amlcft they learn relevant pattern from the data clustering transaction client activity this yield additional insight since laundering method take all kind form and develop continuous basis example such unsupervised learning clustering clustering requires large datasets where can automatically find pattern within the data without the need for label clustering work identifying outlier point without any strong membership any one cluster group thus finding anomaly within subset the data aml clustering one the method used group together data using other analytics such topological data analytics and dimensionality reduction machine learning can reduce the significant amount false positive often associated with alternative method surveillance conduct and market abuse tradinga third area which machine learning increasingly being applied within financial institution the surveillance conduct breach trader working for the institution example such breach include rogue trading benchmark rigging and insider trading trading violation that can lead significant financial and reputational cost for fis the last couple year automated system have been developed that monitor the behavior trader multiple way and with increasing accuracythe capability the first generation these surveillance system were limited monitoring trading behavior and only through assessing single trade however the improved ability machine learning approach identify large complex pattern data allowed new generation system analyze entire trading portfolio these system are also able link trading information other behavioral information trader such email traffic calendar item building check and check outtimes and even phone call technology such natural language processing typically based deep learning and text mining which can based several learning algorithm have made those source machinereadable and suitable for automated analysis the output the trading behavior and communication one multiple trader are then integrated and compared profile normal behavior when trader behavior trading performance deviate from what deemed normal the system will send alert the compliance teamthere are several challenge applying machine learning this space first there are typically labeled data train algorithm legally complex for financial institution share the sensitive information past breach with developer supervisory learning approach are therefore hard apply second surveillance system need auditable for supervisor and for compliance officer and need able explain compliance officer why certain behavior set off alert for system that are entirely based machine learning that can difficult due the black box character learning approach order for alert interpretable and actionable for compliance team should ideally linked detection specific kind behavior rather than based solely statistical correlation the data these issue can addressed least partly founding the learning system behavioral sciencebased model which incorporates human decision and behavioral trait way such model address the lack explanatory power machine learning approach any alert from the system will based deviation identified from the model however the inclusion machine learning approach top the model creates feedback loop the system through which can adapt evolving behavior and get know adamson machine learning the future compliance panel discussion sibos conference september bholat the capco institute journal financial transformation the detail with which data can analyzed and outcome predicted unsupervised approach allow for

product seems there algorithm for every problemmachine learning revolution risk management and compliance trader ingests more data that crucial difference with previous rulesbased system which are unable tailor their surveillance method changed probability distribution and correlation consequently these system are typically based more conventional type machine learning which can audited and explained more easily than complex type such neural net and deep learninga practical barrier the implementation automated surveillance system the fragmentation and complexity sometimes found system gain perspective trader behavior surveillance system require information from many source which are likely found different system that can mutually incompatible slow deliverconclusion machine learning and artificial intelligence are big topic many field business these day including the financial service sector fis are looking more powerful analytical approach they need manage and mine increasing amount regulatory reporting data and unstructured data either for compliance purpose order compete effectively with other fis and fintech there seems aspect the business model that not impacted some way machine learning and artificial intelligence could improve insight into client preference risk management the detection fraud and conduct breach and automate client support allow for automated identity verification when coupled with biometricsthis article given introduction the machine learning field and discussed several case application within financial institution based discussion with iif member and technology vendor credit risk modeling detection credit card fraud and money laundering and surveillance conduct breach fis two tentative conclusion emerge the use machine learning the financial sector tentative because the field developing fast and many fis are still experimenting with machine learning some spacesfirst machine learning comprises range statistical learning tool that
