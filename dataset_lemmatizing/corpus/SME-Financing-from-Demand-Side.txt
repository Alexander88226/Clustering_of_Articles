bank for that reason sme vital both socially and politically nonetheless according world bank enterprise survey financial access the biggest obstacle firm growth there were few research focused chinese sme financing this paper made some effort using the enterprise survey from the survey summary table appendix some observation were made lack demand shown surveyed firm claiming need for credit firm surveyed posted lower proportion banking financing majority their investment financed internal channel this could the result bank discrimination could result selfselection iii the loan requiring for collateral regardless the channel collateralloan value ratio indicator for borrowing cost the interest rate also important however not observed firm survey the ratio level comparable canada and belgium while finland only oecd these distinguishing fact china were ignored former research did not apply their country concern the vacancy with great importance thus this paper proposed with following question and hypothesis which firm the demand for loan hypothesis firm that located more developed area heavy industry having better financial performance get higher chance having loan demand finance their future growth who applied for loan hypothesis contrary hypothesis loan demand assumed that firm with better financial performance likely apply for the loan since they could finance themselves with retained profit iii who eventually get the loan hypothesis firm that more established larger financially better performed are positively related better chance get granted the finding suggest selfselection problem during the application process large number firm are abundant with cash thus likely apply for loan while the firm better sale they are inclining apply for and obtain financing sustain growth this paper organized follows following section provides brief review sme financing china section reflects theory and research then followed methodology section empirical result are section lastly section the paper concludes with more discussion implication limit and suggestion page sme financing nekn finalp luoii sme financing china world bank definition sme widely used researcher practice firm number employee than counted sme the dataset this paper based fall into such category the sampled firm averaged employee with median despite the size they are critical for economic growth not only contribute gdp but also set the dynamic providing employment spreading innovation and entrepreneurship china sme did not flourish until the transformation towards market economy started during the sme were the form collective enterprise tves township and village enterprise which sheltered under local government protection since then more and more private sme firm were benefited from gradual market liberalization and reform policy various sector they experienced rapid growth since and have been contributing lot towards the spectacular gdp growth only smes have grown into major share chinese economy wang only realized this irreversible trend nee opper argues did beijing recognized their legal status and put policy promoting them despite such effort due the limitation financial reform argued lin and the financing market are controlled state player and favor lending stateowned giant stateowned commercial bank are dominating the market the big four socbs have all capital the economy while they are not keen lend sme all bank loan were the big soes the diplomat during which time the credit were abundant due the trillion cny stimulus program reacting the global financial crisis even though than half business loan went sme afterwards down peterson institute ocbc see appendix figure this picture seriously disproportional considering smes are responsible for half china output appendix figure alternative for example the stock and bond market were also unsuccessful pistor analyst say result sme turned and rely heavily informal financing financing and shadow banking tsai estimate that counted for all financial transaction which casting doubt nonperforming loan and their riskiness ayyagari identified finance the most important factor for firm growth such underdeveloped financial sector would negatively affect sme growth page sme financing nekn finalp luoiii theory and literature review established theory financing difficulty for small firm the finance gap hypothesis that focused more the supplier side loan this gap emerges when sme were too small public and underdeveloped get formalinformalchannel lending oecd further pointed out the relation this hypothesis the principalagent problem asymmetric information etc finance gap hypothesis state that under credit rationing the lender sme lending considered costly and risky like any business economy scale would reduce cost sme lending however not the case the cost could reduced competition competitive financial market while china such competition were highly limited due the facto oligopoly financing source and supply the stateowned player further smaller company tend have transparency their financial report and they are facing high level uncertainty more than half small business bankrupt within four year into operation ifc larger firm china with large number employment were backed unemployment threat the governing communist party giant soe enjoys soft budget constraint and almost certainly ensured bailout case failure opper oecd further suggested such gap could also explained within the institutional economics the gap noticed early cressy olofsson pooled range important paper that later had become corner stone research the topic they found constraint demand and supply side their existence preserved even controlled for firm management factor giant enterprise and smaller one differ their financial structure growth prospect scope product etc shift the market power the supplier side making smes suffering more severely from financial scale disadvantage while berger udell were arguing for institutional causal chain from financial infrastructure the market and discussed information gathering during lending process moreover the author are for larger financial institution even for developing nation due better information gathering and lower overall cost empirically there are abundant literature based different data which confirmed such gap around the world for instance beck kunt peria using banking survey data from world bank confirmed country more specifically china lin based data from nation bureau statistic suggested the early planning era bias page sme financing nekn finalp luotowards large soes continued which resulted sme financing difficulty also qiu structured their research firm survey from the chinese academy social science found china the informal channel primarily trade credit play significant role however the author also pointed out that most trade credit were more costly than bank loan nee opper research using survey shanghai stock exchange found financial status are insignificant influencing loan access while firm size innovation activity and location politicized capitalism are also significant universal that smes are struggling getting credit from various formal and informal channel nevertheless constrains from supply side can not fully explain the financing obstacle since many smaller firm simply have not any demand cole firstly tackled the problem need noneed loan firm and set the model which used later researcher kuntchev not only considered the nondemand fact but also went further they detailed four ordinal category from credit constrained fully credit constrained the framework these two author provided the basis for later demandside financing research and made possible for comparison these literature however did not include china comprehensive survey only done until the enterprise survey further previous study credit rationing from bank can not fully explain the sme financing difficulty resulted from selfselection third limitation that they did not differentiate firm who not have credit demand firm who have but did not apply and those who applied thus this paper based such logic would use the latest china data from the examine which firm actually need for loanscredit which one succeed and which them failed the loan application page sme financing nekn finalp luoiv econometrics methodology using logistic regression three group the surveyed firm the hypothesis raised from the beginning this paper could test empirically ividata empirical research with large firmlevel dataset too difficult conduct before the world bank enterprise survey based accepted and universal methodology the survey also ensured data quality term questionnaire setting data gathering rejection rate etc and provided possibility crosscountry comparison the global methodology they used from standardized survey method provided possibility crosscountry multiyears comparison china among more recent target country being surveyed provided relatively more recent dataset interviewed firm from different sector located city which very detailed sample carrying good indicating information cover majority part eastern china this specific topic not only contains detailed information firm characteristic which could controlled but also cover various financial indicator detailed data source for different variable within the questionnaire dataset see appendix table iviimodel the discussion limit former study solve the problem the surveyed firm are classified their demand for loan demand firm with loan demand then within firm need loan applicant non applicant for various reason cole labeled them discouraged firm lastly whether the applicant get the loan not denied approved lender detailed breakdown see appendix figure this paper would not differentiate whether the loan come from bank other channel since majority the firm enterprise survey got their loan from informal channel this paper would test three logistic regression since the dependent variable investigation are binary demand not applicant not and are approved not using the logistic estimation with the reporting robust standard error and outputting the odds ratio verbeek the estimation are easily readable the model specification which binary for nonobservation otherwise depending the dependent variable page sme financing nekn finalp luologit the logit the probability taken where vector covariates and beta the vector regression coefficient based verbeek the effect probability increasing predictor one unit while others constant can calculated idxij using maximum likelihood estimation could done the odds ratio could obtain just exp beta estimation the odds ratio which enables direct reading the magnitude effect verbeek here the binary logistic regression mean the constant effect predictor the likelihood the dependent variable outcome when greater than indicates the firm with such explanatory variable characteristic are more likely need credit apply eventually get the loan for example odds ratio mean that one unit change this independent variable controlled for other variable would increase the odds dependent variable change from factor increase the other hand the odds ratio smaller than would decrease the possibility that dependent variable iviiivariables mentioned earlier this paper followed the cole framework differentiate the three group firm introducing three model with three dependent binary variable they are need variable for distinguish firm demand for loan applicant variable for application for loan need but did not apply result variable for the result loan applicant three category explanatory variable were taken into consideration here summary them their detailed data source from the enterprise survey see appendix table firm characteristic age established firm suggest they are more successful size term employment legal status location macro indicator the competitiveness the main market higher competitive the market company may facing lower margin may need financing and what sector the firm operates three category loan value needed from high low

external audit majority them located eastern costal region and are specialized light industry very few service more them are sole proprietorship limited partnership term performance have positive sale growth but negative gross margin secondly need nonneed firm overall the ratio firm with loan demand without such demand firm who need loan are more likely shareholding nonlisted firm loanneeding firm also more likely locate eastern region and heavy industry the contrast sale indicator are significant suggesting that higherperformance firm are more likely have financing demand actually all three group share the same finding sale indicator the applicant compared nonapplicants firm with more sale number are more likely apply for credit similar finding were found for the legal status region and market however this group senior firm with auditor are more likely actually apply for loan the finding are accordance with conventional wisdom sale indicator difference also significant the group firm got approval deny loan better financial performance get higher approval rate being audited also improved the approval loan application additionally nearly firm applied were granted though conflicting result firm age and size however firm who need loan are more likely associated with higher sale being audited firm who are more likely apply and more likely get the loan also share these similar characteristic this support the credit rationing theory another fact note that more than half the nonapplicants saying they not need loan simply because they have sufficient capital page sme financing

situation this paper also done test model without these variable result not differ largely from model presented addition for robustness the estimation also done another round with the sampling weight suggested the methodology for accuracy this result would show table the appendix firstly look the need column next page when firm indicating they have demand for loan need variable take the value otherwise the need variable take value conventional confidence level the east region firm heavy industry firm and high sale growth firm were significantly add the likelihood for demanding loan other variable significant this suggests that more developed part china the smes with higher sale growth rate would want loan sustain their growth then move the applicant column table when firm indicating they have applied for loan app nonapplicants even they have such demand app seems that for the legal status variable all their odds ratio are significantly than suggesting being different legal status doe not increase the chance for the firm apply however being the east region china the odds ratio high largely increase the firm odds application sale per employee also increase odds loan application however sale three year ago and the gross margin decrease the odds loan application firm with previous better performance and higher margin may suggest that they are abundant fund thus likely apply for loan last part the result column take value when get approval from lender being denied loan only the current financial year sale are significantly increasing the odds get their loan application

indicator for lender consider other indicator considering the fact that the loan applicant got loan successfully the criterion for firm get loan should similar the average image loan applicant being audit associated with collateral requirement from lender collateral requirement suggests that better performed firm have lower borrowing cost sme financing nekn finalp luovi discussion and conclusion from this particular set survey data evidence show that from the demand side the main credit access problem chinese smes facing occurs when they are the process making application decision them discouraged firm the main finding are more revenue attained they could finance themselves thus lower the chance apply for new loan latest sale number proxy potential growth the near future have positive effect loan application since the owner would have find way finance the immediate presented higher production activity for those who applied majority them successfully obtained the loan and they have good sale number they are with even better odds these result are largely line with original hypothesis financial performance variable are negatively related odds application however positively the possibility having loan demand being granted the intuition behind the finding that firm considered with more cash are likely need apply for loan however any firm applied for loan then the supplierside selection based the finding latest sale indicator growth potential the evaluation indicator lender are looking viiimplications this paper found limited evidence confirming the popular belief that sme financing gap happened because discrimination the lender first the financing difficulty happened mainly because large share firm did not apply for loan despite the existence need second main reason they did not apply that such firm abundant fund other reason mainly concerned the cost and denial rate thirdly even when firm applied for loan majority them would for informal mean very few bank whether because general perception discrimination unknown from this survey aiming the problem financial market improvement competition efficiency could drive down the cost for the lender resulting lower rate offered the smes china context more investment and funding channel and liberalization financial sector are needed mckinsey last year state council took measure such credit channeling guidance window promote sme financing china central bank pboc gradually page sme financing nekn finalp luorelaxing interest rate limit and adjusting official rate the event financing difficulty more recently during the national people congress zhou xiaochuan the chair pboc signal the removal upper limit interest rate also suggests liberalization the financial sector beck kunt concludes that country without welldeveloped financial sector special tool like leasing factoring are with effectiveness even though the author ask for information share and competitiveness the financial system viiilimitation and suggests this paper used the from world bank which conducted huge sampling however like many surveyed data suffered from problem subjective scale data question financial should and can quantified however were not rather based interviewee perception which inaccurate smaller private firm who not regularly post their financial status and may not honest when answering sensitive question frequency data the survey yearly based that shorter term loan which often the case for smes were not observed location selection with only one city the west very few the middle could generate biased result regional variable often omitted the econometric software insignificant there were too few observation firm who get loan seen the many insignificant variable the test these factor contributed low level robustness survey setup some the question were ask latest value and reflection for earlier year such sale employee while others not such cost this inconsistency prevents timespan change the firm behavior further study could done with different variable further test the firm region size other characteristic study could take other survey data source into consideration for example longer time series data vertically include more macro factor such economic condition more detailed firm level data for example the most important indicator lending the interest rate offered the lender the research then could control for more factor and give more accurate and detailed result one could also use more complicated model such kuntchev their model category firm not binary but into ordinal order degree credit constrains using that model the author suggest not only evaluate firm credit access behavior but also enables researcher ass the financing
