quickly within the financial system giving rise new form lending and opening version shadow banking this particular true china while fintech finance and shadow bank can improve banking system they can also become new source fragility this paper aim provide theoretical analysis risk fintech finance financial sector with particular example for china these risk are most likely important when fintech move beyond technologica focus and performs financial intermediation particularly banklike function provide implication for the evolution fintech finance new source payment and funding propose ringfencing approach mitigate risk from contagion keywords fintech shadow banking contagion financial fragility interconnectedness rose neng lai professor department finance and business economics

the university macau research grant number myrgfba introduction fintech the short form for financial technology beginning transform mode operating business the finance and banking sector sironi defines fintech global phenomenon born the intersection between financial firm and technology provider attempting leverage digital technology and advanced analyt unbundle financial service and harness economy scale targeting long tail consumer fintech firm have emerged provider service and funding includ ing retail lending payment analytics personal finance and roboadvisors investme strategy directed pool fitting particular client demand opposed say strategy designed outperform the market whole called goalbased investing have become the fintech investor core philosophy see sironi for more detailed description fintech roboadvisors and investing major trigger for this evolution been the loss confidence the traditional banking system after the global financial crisis the evolution also begun outside country hit the crisis such china where for instance small and medium enterprise smes that have growth potential not have easy access the regular banking system furthermore the current low yield environment investor are motivated seek more direct lending and investment platform that offer lower transaction cost than regular financial intermediation and can avoid regulated deposit rate technology particularly the ability process large data set made direct lending easier the idea use technology analyze value and risk the pool that would suit client need more rapidly and with lower transaction cost shall see this can also entail externalit and agency cost example fintech for lender use automated underwriting model for mortgage financing via more accurate and detailed checking house buyer due easy access enormous database and better pricing model borrower and lender can spend effort loan origination and are willing spend more order obtain convenient service from fintech lender philippon and buchak the case peertopeer finance cryptocurrencies bitcoin and ethereum blockchain crowdfund ing and other digital wallet fund are directly transferred from fund provider fund user without the need any financial intermediary this also implies that credit risk are borne directly the creditor fundproviders and not the platform also hence called credit disintermediation this stimulated increase shadow banking way intermediation shadow banking mean financial institution that perform banklike intermediation functio but outside the regular banking system key difference are absence bank regulatio such lending and deposit rate ceiling well portfolio restriction and deposit insurance and other form liability guarantee the last two feature are especially crucial since the absence insurance and guarantee make shadow bank more susceptible run particular importance are lower cost information cost for intermediation service relative regular bank ability offer higher rate than those allowed formal institution due government restriction and broader range regulatory arbitrage for instance avoiding regulated capital requirement fintech finance facilitates underwriting and information benefit with big data making loan and valuing other asset that are prime target for substitute for traditional financ intermediation where investor are essentially depositor banklike business china can create elastic source funding for smes and real estate however because the fintech firm are outside the scope banking regulation and deposit insurance default can trigger depositor flight quality causing contagious collapse the fintech firm develop model the spirit the network model eisenberg and noe and acemoglu analyze whether fintech finance complementary the financial system the sense expanding funding availability andor disruptive which might affect the stability the banking sector whole pay particular attention contagion different state interconnectedness our modeling largely taxonomic exploit existing model clarify how shadow banking and fintech are connected and their implication with focus china recent experience also develop analogy with structure used the before the great recession which can used qualitat ive reference point for understanding risk clear that much this not new the current fintechshadow bank structure are similar the special purpose vehicle spvs used fund mortgagebacked security decade ago the use data evaluate credit risk mortgage reminiscent the move the the toward automated underwriting see straka our networkbased analysis fragility and fintech and the ensuing susceptibility system instability from large shock also related earlier analysis leijonhufvud and revisited corridor effect which system adjust stable manner small shock within some range but react unstable manner shock outside the range our model show that shock fintech financing have pas some threshold term number failed smes and the amount they owed before failure contagious hence highly interconnected banking network necessary but not sufficient condition for system failure the magnitude and closeness the connection matter and the size the corridor depends the nature the network given the potential instability suggest ringfencing recently popular approach financial regulation solution mitigate the power contagion from failure fintech finance the banking sector the best our knowledge this the first study formalize the link between fintech finance and the financial system background shadow banking and fintech financing shadow banking been accused being the center the global financial crisis leading the great recession the and subsequently tanking sizable share the global economy the other side the world shadow banking china rapidly expanded filling void supplying credit smes that are not able borrow from the big four bank and other commercial bank that are mostly designed fund stateownedenterprises soes and big corporation credit for small business china surged since with government support combat against the ripple from the global financial crisis according the people bank china loan small enterprise reached the total loan the end yao another group actively participating shadow banking local governme financing platform lgfps which are trust fund borrowing behalf local government the central government initiated fiscal stimulus order combat the potential economic downturn after the great recession seventy percent this stimulus package come from the local government which have utilize the lgfps for funding source many nonbank financial firm such trust company and microfinance company that lend smes are funded from investor the form wealth management product wmps apparently because the caution taken after the crisis fintech finance grown slower the than europe where there are more lax regulation governing fintech finance china different form fintech finance have emerged and grown with the notable example mobile payment and crowdfunding while the fintech finance market currently small relative the general banking sector the rapid increase depositor and borrower suggests bigger market relatively soon this especially due easy entry and exit coupled with high yield deposit and relatively easy access fund the borrower side recent study show that fintech investment grew globally with increase the but china although the latter represents only around usd billion while the former billion accenture ant financial alone poured usd billion wintermeyer the fintech firm with which are most concerned began ecommerce firm such etailing platform that have evolved into financial intermediary through collecting customer depositor fund and redistributing them the form loan and therefore have emerged basis for shadow banking one can think the basic structure similar special purpose vehicle spv used securitization model ashcraft and scheierman and brunnermeier although the fintech case the asset structure setup provided with more detailed information than been provided historical spvs the liability side can thought similar tranching the structure the spv rather like cmos and cdos our case the structure divided into equity and depositlike piece like simple commercial bank these structure are also similar those used repurchase repo market and structured investment vehicle fund pool mortgage other asset china the structuring been stimulated growth smes which thirst for more direct funding from investor hopefully cutting down intermediation cost and avoiding regulation player and product more recent participant fintech are ecommerce company and internet company alibaba example set microlending business for sme loan that are funded deposit alibaba customer whose small account are used for purchase online relative traditional shadow banking alipay the payment platform for alibaba cover many investor but mostly small amount could small rmb with their fintech advantage through their huge customer database ecommerce retailing etailing they are able develop credit assessment model evaluate the credit performance their borrower the deposit alibaba are what generate the shadow bank and they are largely unregulated and uninsured another popular source the lending platform for investor looking for high return and small firm that need quick funding bypassing regulation microcredit firm these usually operate with high leverage with loan size exceeding registered capital wealth management product wmps are unsecured financial product like bond fund rather than short term deposit usually sold small investor seeking higher return than those offered bank deposit they have been offered many bank and financ institution china some are form shadow banking when these product are subsequently transferred trust fund not recorded the bank balance sheet and then funded with tranched liability online wmps became popular when ecommerce company started accept deposit the ewallets customer the etailing business example the bao chinese term meaning treasure from remaining balance alibaba which large share the etailing market china and offer online wmps wmps have low entry barrier there minimum for investment amount for customer who are the depositor because nonfinancial institution are not subject interest rate restriction investor can promised annual interest rate even higher very high rate when compared the oneyear deposit rate china borrower from alibaba through aliloan are normally seller the etailing platform alibaba called taobao chinese term for digging treasure this example how institution like alibaba can utilize technology and big data analyze the creditworthiness these borrower who can small business with high risk alibaba later merged all efunding business into ant financial another competitor the tenpay and webank tencent one the largest social network provider china market structure simple representation incentive behind market structure that the major bank ration credit and are heavily regulated they charge regulated price that too low clear the market pay low regulated deposit rate and are subject capital and other requireme result there excess demand for credit and private market can emerge fill the gap even competitive disadvantage term cost fund bank raising money via guaranteed deposit the shadow banking market free pay deposit rate that are above regulated bank deposit rate and charge higher rate their borrower the rise fintech firm that offer banklike function threat traditional regulated financial intermediary they can use service and speed take business away from the regular banking system while lending higher rate flexibility from the lack regulatory body the much wider customer and debtor base and the unlimited scope expansion term accessibility form and mode have blurred the boundary among lender borrower and intermediary traditional banking system even though bank and nonbank financial institution have joined the trend adopting more financ technology order maintain their competitive position they not posse the same technology and flexibility the fintech firm that posse both technological expertise and big data extracting information wide range smes and investor the advantage fintech finance are also source risk the general financial system for instance epayment platform such alipay charge very small transaction cost relative other bank card payment but that mean easy move money around risk that the seller commodity bought via the platform will have trouble obtaining their payment from consumer the platform fails are risk failing because the credit business fintech firm shadow bank often lack expertise financial service while simultaneously significantly broadening the number and type borrower the case equity crowdfunding the business involved are usually very risky and the potential return estimated with very low precision over usually least five seven year startup period blaseg and koetter for example conclude that equity crowdfunding main source financing for smaller venture and those with fewer tangible asset acharya mention that wmps have caused financial institution more closely connected than ever and thus the rollover risk wmps increase the risk contagion across financial institution way that similar shadow banking via for instance securitized banking the repo market the and gorton and metrick this can create illiquidity problem and sudden lack capital can result difficulty rolling over loan and default the guaranteed principal for investor which can lead fragile banking the capital their business come from traditional bank some fintech company therefore seek strategic partner mitigate the problem lack financial expertise and capital for example alibaba ant financial partner with several bank such china minsheng bank that the former can collect funding and pas the latter lend out return for high enough rate the online wmp even though account yue bao are small ranging from few few thousand dollar the ant financial money market fund generated return the first quarter this attracts more customer deposit their money yue bao creating big fund that directly connected the formal banking sector another important issue that investor particularly small investor tend rely heavily explicit and implic guarantee buchak manage their risk and moral hazard concern there market downturn and guarantee are called this fund could make big withdrawa from associated bank hence implicit guarantee pose threat the chinese banking sector company like alibaba can either too big too connected fail zhou provides thorough narration the change regulation coping with the change fintech china which still far from optimal while there been rapidly developing literature about how fintech work and how different platform have preempted the credit market there scant research about whether fintech finance can help expand threaten the banking industry philippon one the first study how fintech can change the banking system providing cheap transparent and easily accessible funding contrast expensive traditional banking service which still rely heavily implicit and explicit government guarantee buchak compare fintech and nonfintech shadow bank and focus how fintech firm have penetrated into the mortgage refinancing business tasca offer comprehensive collection fintech finance from different perspective systemic risk interconnectedness that increase systemic risk leading contagion been widely explored especially after the global financial crisis see for example allen and gale gai and kapadia acemoglu and roukny study how different form banking network can lead varying degree contagion and financial fragility are also plentiful for example elsinger find that highly correlated portfolio exposure more crucial reason for contagion this could small given low bankruptcy cost there are effective measure combat crisis and cost being lender last resort could much smaller than previously thought glasserman concludes that either the shock the network must large the affected bank must have small net worth trigger contagion and that deteriorated credit quality can speed kaister argues that the potential for bailouts creates incentive that lead more fragile financial system although prohibition bailouts can also lead welfare reduction and higher probability crisis bernard suggests condition under which nointervention threat the regulatory body can helpful and when bailins are actually better than bailouts stopping contagion across various banking network banking and network order provide theoretical analysis the potential risk fintech finance the financialbanking sector first need know how bank are connected figure depicts some example possible financialbanking network system see for example roukny for modeling with different network structure for simplicity assume that the system consists four bank denoted node the first example star network which all bank are linked only bank typical example for bank the central bank quasicentral bank city state country another example would for this figure snapshot toobigtofail bank large system where very big bank linked other possibly nearby very small bank the second one the ring network where each bank connected with pairwise liability only with two adjacent bank reality star network and ring network banking system are very unlikely because bank work closely together and banking system work globally the last one our discussion the complete network which all bank are connected each other with pairwise liability other possibility are somewhere between the star ring network and the complete network that bank are connected more than one two but not all bank the system the banking network model model the link among bank banking system the spirit eisenberg and noe acemoglu and bernard suppose there are bank such that bank interbank obligation lij which what bank owes any other bank obviously lij for note however that bank doe not necessarily have interbank obligation with all bank the system which case lij for some for instance the simplest case star network depicted the left panel figure bank can any node which interbank obligation only with node the other extreme all bank the network have obligation with the other bank which case the complete network the right the panel the figure applies let the relative liability share denote other financial commitment such wage and operating expense part but more senior liability the bank bank also cash hand and market value from outside investment not interbank loan which generates random return suppose all payment have made the same date pji the repayment the liability from bank bank the total cash flow bank where pii and pji lji can not meet all committed payment that will have liquidate some outside investment suppose only fraction the fundamental value outside investment can recovered because fire sale sale within short time bank doe not have default long the relatively junior interbank liability can covered liquidating just enough outside investme provided that the senior obligation are covered otherwise would have sell all investment repay all debt that liquidation would determined based njijill otherwiseliflliiijij njjiiipxciinjjiiiwlpxc where the first term the parenthesis the minimum function the required amount but than liquidating all investment while the second part time the amount that could obtained from liquidating all asset the latter still not enough cover all interbank liability the bank assumed have default when bank default whatever left over after the senior obligation are met will distributed among bank for fulfilling the interbank liability hence for any bank the interbank system payment from bank bank otherwise bank the network nothing left from bank for simplicity let which similar the partial recovery interbank claim bernard expression also mean that whether any bank default not depends not only the return from external investment the fraction asset that could liquidated but also and crucially whether other bank the system are solvent and pay back bank and hence close network fragility network fragility property bank banking network that are risky the sense being subject large loss quickly due for example taking too many risky investme andor having too much leverage being subject tail risk from the fat tail return distribution fragility important explaining the collapse banking system when default some bank the system cause other bank default recall that any bank outside investment that provides random return following acemoglu assume this investment return injjiiiiiiiapxclwminl iiiinkkjiiijijlwlpxcminp ijpij ijijijlp where representing some shock iid the upper bound such that the outside investment return nothing while the lower bound implies that the return together with liquidating the asset should least cover the senior obligation this different from acemoglu which assumes that all bank have the same shock and therefore the same outside investment value liquidation fraction and senior obligation allow all these parameter bank specific following some number shock for bank here for simplicity assume each shock bank the same magnitude for time the total value the banking system which the sum all cash inflow and asset value the whole banking system minus those for bank that experience shock from their outside investment and therefore are subject liquidating some asset the extreme when liquidation not possible the value the system becomes where the group bank that default contagion and fragility contagion happens when default some bank the system spread other bank instability arises when contagion effect are amplified rather than dampened when shock come from outside the corridor suggests that the more interconnected bank are term more pairwise liability among more bank the system the more likely the network will contagious this not necessarily true however more bank the system can share the loss from the failed bank provided that most the bank are resilient enough nevertheless the smaller the total value the banking system all else equal the more fragile the system because small value iiiax iiiiiiaawa niiiiiiiilsaacu diiniiiiiiasaacu njijp mean small cushion for fragility not the purpose this paper prove what kind network will more contagious and fragile than others and under what circumstance rather take for granted the finding from acemoglu which are also confirmed bernard analyze the situation our fintechbank partnership network acemoglu define two different system system and system with the same number bank different such and respectively then system more stable than system both experience similar time shock but conditional the realization furthermore system more resilient than system conditional taking the magnitude for all the hence fragility bank network depends the original health the bank term quality their asset stability magnitude the shock resilience and the structure the network interconnectedness given this acemoglu show that for small enough shock complete network panel the most resilient and stable type financial network because the small shock will shared many bank the system thereby exerting minimal effect individual bank the other hand ring network panel which any bank linked only two other bank the system least resilient and least stable they also claim that higher similarity the pairwise liability among bank generates fragility this provides explanation why too big fail bank might not good for financ system because other smaller bank the system will not able resist the shock spread from these big bank the other hand high magnitude shock and interbank liability lij lead both complete and ring network being least stable while network structure somewhere between relatively more stable and resilient this because the weaker interconnectedness ensures that the loss from the defaulting bank are taken distressed this doe not take into account some endogeneity issue risktaking for instance big bank might take risk because franchise value ueue uminumin bank that have liquidate some asset but not all bank because not all are connected with the distressed bank complete network allows shock some bank completely transmitted the entire system hence increasing systemic risk addition more evenly distributed pairwise liability add faster contagion finally acemoglu introduces harmonic distance the closeness bank with another bank term both distance and intensity the liability bank that close all other bank with smaller harmonic distance the most systemica important any possible default this bank will most contagious explanation too systemic fail bank fintech network and shadow banking this section expand the previous section illustrate various form intra and internetwork connection within the fintech financing and across bank respectively model how the banking network model linked fintech finance when the latter becomes form shadow banking then formulate general model fintechbank partnership shadow banking network panel figure illustrates the structure most fintech network with the rectangular box both diagram the fintech firm that facilitate the financ ing platform fintech network applies when their function are merely providing technology platform enhance financial service but not intermediary for example can represent the etailing platform alipay consumer pay the retailer through their ewallets managed alipay through the etailing platform called taobao and retailer make sure the product are delivered the consumer else their etailing record taobao will affected through the negative review from consumer another example fintech network the platform fund can also collected via fintech firm from one end the other take crowdfund ing example crowdfunding can classified into lendingbased equitybased rewardbased donationbased the first two investor expect have return the future whereas donationbased crowdfunding the name implies not associated with payoff although investor rewardbased crowdfunding hope have reward the future should the venture business blossom hence graphical representation crowdfunding similar the fintech network where investor know about the nature the business venture the borrower through the fintech crowdfunding platform the rectangular box the case donationbased crowdfunding the arrow the figure point one direction from investor borrower because the borrower not have pay back the investor both lendingbased and equitybased crowdfunding investor expect earn return and will take opportunity cost into account and the fintech firm will act the financ intermediary facilitating collection and distribution fund that case the network will look like fintech network whereby the fintech platform not only intermediary for facilitating financing but also responsible for the banking function ensuring investor are paid their return mentioned before some investor would have implicit guarantee from the fintech platform well shadow banking fintech finance becomes form shadow banking case where investor can join the money market fund for which the fintech firm act financial intermediary for instance lend smes and promise return investor the network look like the fintech network figure for example investor place their money through deposit yue bao alibaba through which ant financial lends directly smes borrower the figure via aliloan branch the rectangular box the middle ant financial now functioning like traditional bank funding longterm loan with shortterm deposit and hence performing shadow banking function maturity transformation liquid transformation leverage and credit risk transfer because yue bao promise annual interest return when fintech firm create money market fund wmps through bank the fintech platform more complicated than fintech network because will connected banking network such that depicted panel figure illustration fintech firm join two bank bank and bank the banking network the fintech firm collect fund from the investor such yue bao alibaba and pass the fund bank and lend smes that are required pay higher loan rate than other big corporation arrow flow fund smes are omitted the figure upon collecting the interest payment the bank withhold some fee and pas the rest the fintech firm which then withholds some fee before distributing the rest the investor investment return this return general the form promised interest rate that higher than bank deposit rate panel show how banking system can support fintech example two fintech finance firm the dark thick arrow show the connection fintech firm with bank and and fintech firm with bank and course one bank can also choose serve more fintech firm and not all bank are connected fintech firm furthermore the banking network doe not have complete network the extensive connection between fintech shadow banking and banking network and the potential for significant expansion fintech finance that create contagion risk from the fintech sector the traditional banking sector model for fintechbanking system here develop fintechshadow banking model and analyze implication the fintechbanking system after the occurrence shock the fintech liability borrowing from the notation used the banking network section the cash flow fintech financing firmplatform any point time when payment are settled given where the number smes which the firm lends and hence the return from sme and the amount return that the fintech firm guarantee the investorsdepositors the remaining balance the surplus the firm some smes are not able make their payment the fintech firm can request them liquidate some their asset suppose sale asset smes are triggered where the total number troubled smes from which full recovery value can not obtained section suppose the fraction recovery and the asset value for sme and note that once liquidation triggered the smes will longer able make the usual payment then the cash flow the fintech firm the proceeds from these failed smes are still not enough then the fintech firm will have use own cash hand cover payment investor suppose the cash hand the fintech firm will have default the worst case this what happened china credit trust which claimed that would have sell five coal mining property before could return the money the investor zhu adding the complication that the investment product involved sold through the industrial and commercial bank china icbc one the big four bank china however this case icbc doe not have obligation repay the investor because served only the sale platform the wmps notice that even though the china credit trust shadow bank case and not related the fintech firm the investment product and channel are similar what have discussed before recent example related fintech finance shadow banking the negotiation huishan dairy china with eight creditor including hongling capital lender delay paying loan bloomberg news mentioned earlier xxmifi fixfj fjafjxxaxmtmjfjfjtmifi xaxcmtmjfjfjtmifif fintech financing just platform that transfer fund from investor directly borrower however many case particularly china investor are told that their investment have very low risk not riskfree and investor assume implic guarantee from the wmpissuing firm bank through which the wmps are sold wee and guo fintechbank partnership now connect the fintech network and the banking network represent the case where fintech finance firm partner with bank lend smes shown panel figure the cash flow the fintech firm similar except that the return are not from the smes directly but rather from total partnering bank two bank panel that cash flow given where represents the return from the sme investment that bank pay back the fintech firm for partnering bank the cash flow now includes the return from sme which separated from other outside investment because higher risk and highlight the fact that the fund are from the fintech firm formally cash flow bank becomes committed cash flow now where represents what bank gain from this partnership the sme loan are not performing while other outside investment are fine depending the partnership agreement with the fintech firm the bank doe not necessarily have liquidate asset even xxbifi fixfkixmk mkfkinjjiiixpxcfimkiifkinjjiiixwlxpxc fimkfkixx the agreement for the fintech firm fully responsible then bank will liquidate the asset the nonperforming smes even and the situation back expression the fintech firm will have default enough smes from the partner bank default that this case the bank return through this funding will minimal that will close zero the other extreme bank bear all credit risk all external investment including the loan smes that situation will shown the next section more fragile bank suppose bank not able meet obligation because some smes the fintechbank partnership default that then bank will have liquidate some asset addition liquidating the nonperforming smes suppose only fraction the value sme investment can recovered and the market value from the sme investment then the liquida decision for bank modified note that unlike which can contain investment asset other than loan and therefore can added albeit becoming more lengthy the two summation term are the cash flow from smes that are performing and those that are nonperforming fimkiifkinjjiiixwlxpxc fimkfkixx xaxcbitmjmtmjfjifjifjif fimkfkixx fitmkiifkinjjiiixwlxpxc fkia injjimtmkfkifkitmkfkiiifiiiiiapaxxcxlwminl the implicit assumption here that once sme nonperforming considered default and liquidated this can easily relaxed but will lengthen the formula quite remarkably expression show how fintech financing can harmful bank when the highly risky smes default their liquidation value are usually low can realized small value for given that the wmps guarantee high interest return mostly the case that not only true but big absolute value this highlight the fact that the bank involved fintech finance will have liquidate more own outside investment asset inducing more risk asset profile paying back the interbank liability the interbank system not straightforward because bank the interbank system now bank plus the fintech firm referring figure the relative liability for bank now becomes and the first expression above give the relative liability for individual interbank loan while the second one that for the fintech firm the amount paid back bank all other bank and the fintech firm extended from expression the following where this mean that each bank that connected bank with interbank liability receives than bank not involved the fintech financing fki fimtmkfkifkitmkfkixax otherwiselifxllifiiijij fiifiifxlx fiiimtmkfkifkiiinkkjtmkfkiiiijijxlwalpxxcminp the case contagion the total value the banking system with one bank call bank connected one fintech firm now also depends shock the smes business suppose the random return investment from sme given constant and random term then have where such that the return investment bounded below zero and above the liquidation value mentioned before assume that sme default and hence liquidated once experience shock course bank default completely then the value the banking system the same that bank doe not default and and other bank the system also experience other shock then the total value the banking system following expression becomes with the last term this mean that the overall value the banking system increased because the involvement bank fintech finance long the total loss those smes that experienced shock not big the value all other surviving smes the other hand many smes experience shock the overall value will smaller than without fintech financing now suppose bank and bank are both the fintechbank partnership panel figure the total value the banking system the case both bank needing liquidate some asset becomes the same applies increased number fintech firm joining the partnership which can also reflected the form more smes involved larger expression more bank involved which case becomes fkafk fkfkfkax fkfkfkfkfkaaa mtmkfktmkfkniiiiiiiialsaacu jmtmkfkjtmkfkjniiiiiiiialsaacu where there are with bank and fintech firm joining the fintechbank partnership allowing the possibility that one bank can partner with more than one fintech firm and each fintech firm can partner with more than one bank obvious from expression that whether fintech financing add value the banking system the presence shock very much depends whether the last term positive which depends the quality asset and the shock experienced the smes involved the fintechbank system once there wave failure sme business this term becomes smaller even negative resulting reduction overall value the banking system the risk contagion follows the argument discussed section albeit not straightforward recall that contagion happens the banking system fragile while highly interconnected complete network where more bank are resilient absorbing shock from failed bank can safe from contagion the case fintechbank system long the fintech platform are strong enough absorb default from some smes long the bank involved can more resilient the failure from the fintech firm particularly there wellinterconnected network then the overall system safe general however with more fragile banking system once the shock some point the smes andor fintech platform big enough the impact from contagion will greater and faster kind corridor effect further seen from the second part expression more fintech financing and therefore more smes the pool induce extra fragility the bank involved contagion more likely bank the system are more interconnected interconnectedness can seen from the liquidation decision term expression given bank and fintech firm have njhhmtmkfkjtmkfkjniiiiiiiihhalsaacu njhhmtmkfkjtmkfkjhha and expression and show that the liquidation decision depends not only sme performance under the fintech finance but also interbank payment from other bank which are also affected the sme performance their individual portfolio hence more smes defaulting across more bank that join the fintechbank partnership not only cause more bank more fragile but because the interconnectedness the interbank liability imply higher possibility contagion and destabilizing adjustment through the more fragile banking system other word shown section banking system where more fintech business involved particularly the toobigtofail toosystemictofail bank are also involved will bear higher potential risk failure even the interconnectedness within the banking system not changed our model can easily extended global perspective considering the interconnectedness banking system globally the number bank involved fintech and the number fintech firm can represent global setting all our argument for contagion throughout banking system can then extended contagion across country while this sound remote the moment fear and skepticism contagion leading another global financial crisis because fintech financing not without ground given the very rapid development and expansion fintech and history similar turbulence during the financials crisis and the that based similar structure have ignored our model the possibility that business default among smes can contagious too which more likely economic downturn when few smes could perform well and smes forming supply chain among themselves will spread the failure from the origin throughout the chain injjihhmtmkfkifkitmkfkiiihhfiiiiiapaxxcxlwminlhhhh hhfiiihhmtmkfkifkiiinkkjhhtmkfkiiiijijhhhhxlwalpxxcminp potential threat and the need for regulatory policy from the previous section see that the one hand more rapid and bigger expansion fintech increase the funding smes and more investor can enjoy return higher than artificially low bank deposit rate the other hand because the smes are relative riskier investment default noticeable number these smes can bring about nontrivial loss investor this can have big social impact because many these investor are small investor who aim for higher return but are not sophisticated enough understand that their investment are risky asset when fintech firm also act financial intermediary such sme default might also trigger failure the fintech firm although the banking system will not affected bringing bank when bank are involved the fintechbank partnership expression show higher overall value the banking system with expansion fintech financing long smes fail shown the second grand summation term however also shown section this same term also the one that induces increased fragility into the banking system some bank and fintech firm might also collapse the worst case investor the wmps under the fintechbank partnership can not repaid therefore crucial have appropriate governance avoid regulatory arbitrage especially because fintech grown rapidly for example the first half fund from bao have surpassed morgan become the largest money market fund the world lucas implying that involved lot small investor putting their saving though perhaps small magnitude that might represent major part their wealth into the hand ant financial related issue that not covered detail this study investor confidence and bank run most bank run model this can come from range source modelled the classic diamond and dibvig paper their model two equilibrium one with confidence and deposit remaining the bank and one without confidence where depositor move out deposit there clear preference for one equilibrium over the other and the bank doe not need insolvent experience run long some depositor lose confidence the bank they will withdraw their fund possibly trigger ing other depositor withdraw well the same token some the investor wmps the fintechbank partnership panic then some investor flight quality will trigger others withdraw fund too hence there not need default from many smes the fintech firm case bank not involved trigger liquidation asset order meet investor withdrawal the more fragile the banking system andor the fintech firm the easier the collapse the system due bigger magnitude flight qualit from big group fintech investor depending accounting regulation investment not have the bank balance sheet they can form subsidiary become their shadow bank branch the hongling capital lender example section fintech firm themselves can pose high risk shadow bank china some wmps are financing zombie firm that not produce anything are dying company industry experiencing oversupply steel and real estate but the fund are not held the balance sheet the bank because this can done under some trust formed the bank such financial intermediation not governed under normal banking regulation and there deposit insurance protect investor fund worse investor are told that their investment are mostly very low risk and they assume implicit guarantee from the fintech platform the bank even though some bank claim that they only help sell the wmp product and have obligation for the failure the investment long these bank are large valuable reputation might mean that they can not simply walk away for example minsheng bank one the partnering bank ant financial been pointed out one the aggressive lender through wmps this big alarm not only for the ever growing shadow banking sector china but also fintech platform especially when investor assume implic reported deutsche welle business column the financial stability board very concerned about the growth shadow banking china which the fourth largest the world but the second fastest growth guarantee the situation analogous that some structured investment vehicle sivs the before the recent crash which were off balance sheet but which sponsor bank nonetheless felt obligated support perhaps for reputation reason this can thought case pinkyswear recourse where seller make legally unenforceable promise that are not subject capital regulation perhaps close scrutiny and can broken under stress policy overall interconnectedness within and among bank shadow bank and fintech coupled with the very speedy development technology and innovation are possible source amplifying banking risk there have been lot proposal how regulate fintech and shadow bank here suggest ring fencing proposed remedy the global financial crisis measure tackle the risk financial contagion from fintech financing ring fencing the vickers proposal independent commission banking the united kingdom refers separating some

that the system will healthier the face shock because and pij expression and will free from and will depend the performance the smes under the fintech financing there are several way ringfencing this case direct way separate the fintech finance sector completely away from the banking system that will not affected whether there are any bailins bailouts the fintech firm when bank are involved approach separate the sme business from their core business which risky this similar the volcker rule for shadow banking branch bank this however requires very clear regulation identifying and separating the risky investment with smes from other bank investment otherwise opaque difference will make actual implementation ringfencing difficult third approach allow only some bank typically smaller one involved that these bank are completely ringfenced from the rest the banking system time trouble would the regulatory body determine bailins bailouts for these small bank were appropriate bernard proposes model that determines when government bailins bailouts threat not intervene are the best solution our model can adjusted fit their bailinout decision any case the regulatory body will dealing with only subsector the banking system rather than having the problem contagious across the whole system ringfencing loses effectiveness however when many bank big and small join fintech

obtain high positive value for with higher probability this will however restrict the original characteristic the free entry and innovation fintech note here that not consider the role liquidity our model because our focus the impact default smes the fintechbanking system rather than the liquidity issue the bank further one may consider the situation the governme being the lender last resort this

exploding the tool used the then particularly the use technology for analysis and pricing credit risk pool loan automated underwriting and the use special purpose vehicle and the repo market for funding are quite similar tool being used now china issue then overly enthusiastic application technology clear the that loan originator and seller well borrower gamed the newly evolved automated underwriting system exploiting thing not covered the model andor outright njhhmtmkfkjtmkfkjhha lying and cheating also clear that risk often hidden the complicated structure that were used fund the pool question whether china headed for similar experience these are reasonable worry for china problem with how those structure handled shock and fragility are similar issue about corridor network raised above inside which adjustment shock stable but outside which adjustment unstable note though that china fintech and shadow banking are still quite small relative the size the chinese economy there not appear data that can shed light the likelihood china being similar the and have insight into how policymakers might react fragility from fintech the main purpose the paper look how fintech financing linked the traditio banking system and consider how model whether fintech creates more value risk society the paper suggests general network model that can flexibly applied fintech financing with and without involvement the banking sector given various form interconnectedness show how the expansion fintech financing and extension shadow banking can create contagion the banking sector when many borrower smes default contribute the literature providing the best our knowledge the first study that model fintech financing using network model and which applied the chinese economy show how the network reacts increase fintech firm andor bank involved the fintechbank partnership this will crucial for regulatory body determine policy mitigate increased risk and yet allow financing smes the network model can also applied for consideration bailins and bailouts the bankingfinancial system due fintech finally suggest ringfencing way isolate fintech financing from the rest the banking
