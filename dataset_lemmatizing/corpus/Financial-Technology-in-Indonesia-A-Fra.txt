such debit and credit card order increasethe nancial inclusion generally urban population havecredit card ownership higher than rural population theyneed more nancial access other than bank for example ntech service which could accessed more easily inurban area due higher internet usagein the conventional landscape the interaction betweenthe aboveclassi citizen and the nancial service market

the underbanked citizen living the more urban area own saving account bank but borrows moneyfrom their local pawnshop assume their insuranceownership relatively low and still make payment
