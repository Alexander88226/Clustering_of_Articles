herein file european journal applied business management issn research paper risk management from the perspective startup submitted november accepted december evaluated double blind review system bruna villa todeschini andres sosa boelter joana siqueira souza marcelo nogueira cortimiglia structured abstract purpose this study sought present how startup relate risk management concept and practice identify appropriate tool for the context startup methodology data were collected two stage first with face face interview and then with online survey analyze how startup think and act about risk after that data descriptively analyzed and pearson correlation generated verify pattern the risk analysis process the startup finally risk management method adapted the context startup suggested facilitate the use this type company finding result this study found that startup view the concept risk different way and that the lack familiarity with this topic and the empiricism while analyzing risk are independent the operating time and capital invested startup but those which have consolidated strategy have also better structured risk management process limitation the sample size used the research considered limitation and may expanded future work for better understanding the startup environment practical implication startup can use this study mainly the adaption suggested section five better structure their risk management process originalityvalue literature regarding risk management doe not often include the innovation context startup which are company that deal all the time with high risk decision this study seek help fill this gap the literature keywords risk startup risk management innovation introduction startup are innovative nature thus startup have the characteristic being company that deal with high level uncertainty and dynamicity exposed innumerous risk recent case the mass employee dismissal medium feldman and the bankruptcy the brazilian company fleety moreno

controversial aspect such new business model risk various nature are aplenty the context startup and often may fatal van gelderen however and despite the fact that the discipline risk management already offer number widely consolidated method startup not seem use the traditional tool provided this research field enterprisewide risk management remains largely topic interest and practical implementation large firm with limited application technology hler and som projectlevel risk management startup informal strategy such tapping personal network for financial risk kim and vonortas discussion enterprise risk management small and mediumsized enterprise smes somewhat fertile falkner and hiebl brustbauer but issue and recommendation are too generic andor not readily applicable the context startup naude and chiweshe for instance there evidence that innovationoriented smes may more active their risk management strategy brustbauer but the result not discriminate startup from traditional innovative smes and detail appropriate risk management approach for each type sme are lacking overall can argued that risk management literature scarce regarding specific model technique and tool tailored towards startup which are company that have constantly deal with high risk decision that may mean the upgrowth the continuity even the end activity been hinted that startup manage risk particularly those that operate knowledgeintensive sector but actual risk management strategy seem unsystematic and focused risk mitigation only kim and vonortas the lack resource for developing and implementing risk management solution that characterizes smes especially the form specialized staff andor funding for hiring consultancy firm particularly severe cashstrapped startup moreover the issue balancing innovation which frequently requires risk taking orientation and risk management capability building open complex decision the context startup which are often challenged concomitant business model experimentation and formal business structuring gurd and helliar finally the individual characteristic startup founder and initial team member such their personality and social capital

iii suggest appropriate risk management tool used startup the study exploratory approach and ambition delivering definitive answer the matter however seek create initial proposition the field risk management the context startup that should further expanded future research from first attempt diagnose the situation risk management tool and technique adequate the reality risk management those company are suggested from that hope provide startup with starting guideline about how develop effective risk management process literature review innovation product service and business model been increasingly present european journal applied business management issn dynamic and competitive environment teece and linden being considered essential the survival company that context trott however enterprise take risk while innovating bessant this sense risk defined hubbard state uncertainty which possibility loss and undesirable result exist purdy present the notion uncertainty affecting objective while damodaran state that risk related the probability having different return investment than expected approach that considers both negative downside risk and positive result upside risk staple what verbano and venturini call strategic risk management this scenario number approach were proposed manage risk large firm iso international organization for standardization derivative from

risk evaluation risk response control activity vii information and communication and viii monitoring that way the erm act view every sphere the company something that can applied the startup context they are company initial stage what allows better risk analysis and control than bigger and already consolidated company while dealing with complex innovation environment tidd point out uncertainty and complexity determinant that context that way startup which are organization created seek repeatable and scalable business model blank and dorf need deal with these variable order succeed crossan and apaydin state that important know how tolerate failure and open risk taking order innovate the organizational level besides they point out the need for establishing link between result innovation and firm performance appropriating value from innovation purdy affirms that better consistency definition and risk process lead better level trust the decisionmaking process which useful and necessary the startup context bessant and tidd argue that the development new product and service gradual process uncertainty reduction starting from idea passing through intermediary stage until getting the success commercialization startup which are company that constantly innovate ries are part the initial stage this gradual process which uncertainty highest level according beregheh innovation considered process that occurs inside company and european journal applied business management issn that transforms idea new product service process providing those company with better condition compete crossan and apaydin expand the concept considering both process and result they present the social sphere addition the economic one and include the development new method production and new management system type innovation boje affirm that the current competitive environment turbulent and unpredictable and falconer point that manager should enable change part firmlevel learning process this sense bessant affirms that innovative company constantly reinvent themselves regarding threat and opportunity imposed the environment which might mean the adoption creation new technology firm thus must improve their innovation capability order decrease least manage the uncertainty associated with innovation generation and adoption what precisely innovation capability and what role risk management play still open question however gurd and helliar discus the role the company leader innovation enthusiastic versus control manager while hyytinen show that innovativeness negatively associated with the subsequent survival the startup these discussion show that startup are different from smallmedium sized traditional company they need deal with the issue finding own business model context high risk consequence traditional management approach not work this environment and tend lead failure blank dorf strategic plan are not the best way planning under change environment because long term projection are not reliable addition for company which developing product and may change the customer segment difficult have consistent strategy ries blank dorf deal with this problem agile management approach were developed focusing development culture that embraced receptiveness acceptance change and flexibility misra verdujover which may all antecedent success factor implementing risk management strategy similarly there are many practice applied project management related change collaborative development value proposition and robustness misra moran that may contribute risk management startup but they are usually not integrated comprehensive solution kim and vonortas the brazilian context factor pointed contributor startup discontinuity are invested capital and location arruda the same author show that company that have money run for one year more the beginning their operation have twice the chance survival than those which have capital survive than year besides that company installed business incubator accelerator technologic park have three time mortality risk than those that not have access such protective environment arruda this further investigated etges and souza who found that startup installed scientific and technologic park can mitigate many the risk which they are exposed staff turnover and difficulty keeping with technology these risk are mitigated due the fact that the academic environment help startup get adequate human capital their activity etges and souza which may even include supporting staff with risk management capability regarding company perception about the factor that lead firm survival product market acceptance harmony between founder and manager capacity adapt the market shift and need are highlighted lack commitment the founder nonalignment between personal and professional interest the founder and lack capital invest the business are highlighted the primary failure factor arruda although the lack risk management capability not been explicitly pointed out key cause startup failure the indirect effect not effectively managing risk may potential source performance impairment that may fatal nascent enterprise european journal applied business management issn method despite being considered risk capital business little said about how startup may analyze and deal with risk that are inherent corporate environment therefore this study inserted fragmented field research initiative and there consensus about how startup should conduct risk management hence this research exploratory seeking present the perception startup leader about risk that type company and developing adaption risk management method the startup context from the result this research hypothesis may suggested and tested looking for general understanding startup behavior regarding risk management data collection executed two stage the first one qualitative nature and used interview with brazilian startup founder eight people from different company selected convenience and availability were interviewed with the support semistructured questionnaire with predefined question help the interviewer guide the course the conversation question were allocated three block the first block verification prerequisite for the startup able participate the study acceptance criterion participate the survey were considered the following condition have company register brazil called cnpj criterion that show legal level commitment the respondent with the company the company received investment either from founder third party this present financial commitment from the partner iii the company have not yet reached the breakeven point criterion that characterizes startup still doe not survive own the market besides that identification information such name job title and academic education the interviewee and firm age were asked the second block consists qualitative question order verify how the company understands analysis and deal with the risk which exposed question were based the main stage risk management proposed iso international organization for standardization and general stage such identification analysis evaluation and treatment the risk purdy based that model the following question were proposed what you understand risk what are the biggest risk your company today iii how are risk analyzed your company what the strategy deal with those risk thus possible semantically analyze how convergent are the knowledge and practice risk management among the interviewee the aim the third block validate the interview and also understand the company context the following question were made doe the company have defined goal and strategic objective doe the company have definition internal and external factor that may impact performance something like swot analysis iii what your risk profile prone moderate averse risk what your company profile risk prone moderate averse risk thereby possible understand the use nonuse planning and management practice well the company strategic appreciation risk the second research stage quantitative based result the first one the goal this stage get answer the same question from the previous stage with bigger number startup something that would not possible through facetoface interview therefore online survey with the same question form the first stage made the survey sent brazilian startup association group incubator accelerator and technological park similar criterion were used validate answer the startup should have cnpj the startup should have received investment iii the respondent should have management position the startup total response were collected and were considered valid european journal applied business management issn according these criterion after this data were analyzed descriptive statistic and analysis pearson correlation done between some the main variable collected the second stage table variable operating time table overview the variable used the correlation analysis measurement unit month how are risk analyzed the company they are not analyzed empirically without the aid tool method with the aid tool method doe the company have defined goal and objective yes doe the company have the definition external and that can influence internal factor investment yes reais the company already recovered the value invested breakeven yes source the author result the first stage the research which facetoface interview were made generated more detail richness than the following stage the second stage however generated greater number answer and allowed the suggestion some proposal the process risk management brazilian startup qualitative stage result from the first block question possible briefly analyze the profile the interviewed company the evaluated startup have different background there are company working the energy industry printing education knowledge management and digital marketing the operating time also varies from six month three year which could suggest different maturity level for risk management although that not identified the quantitative research stage some had low investment four thousand reais some were funded public investment from entity from thousand reais little more than half million reais lastly there one company funded venture capital with six million reais investment despite the disparity investment quantity none the startup got the breakeven point half the startup are installed incubator and the others shared own office besides one the company brazilian founder but based canada all them have cnpj with the exception the foreign company which equivalent register canada most the interviewee are ceo and all them are partner their company european journal applied business management issn therefore being able give clear vision the intention and strategy their business analyzing the first question the second block possible notice some negativity attributed the meaning the word risk some probability thing going wrong danger the path from starting point final point thing you can not control others face risk something neutral that can either bad good and only one interviewee used the word opportunity his answer regarding which risk the respondent identified the biggest one their company three item were highlighted nonacceptance the value proposition the market problem related the brazilian government such bureaucracy high tax and the lack enough cash flow maintain the company activity also observed that half the company analyze risk empirically and that operating time investment don correlate with this aspect meaning that even more experienced more financially compromised startup might analyse their risk just based opinion the youngest company six month affirmed that they don risk analysis due their low investment four thousand reais until this moment therefore they understand that not necessary have deeper understanding the risk involving the business better organized startup relation risk management practice pointed out example tool such control metric management spreadsheet market monitoring related competitor and new technology besides that possible notice that startup with founder graduated with professional experience management showed greater structuring relation risk management activity than company that had founder with training management but greater technical skill about the product noticeable that none the startup analysis those presented method diffused the literature regarding the last question the second block which refers strategy deal with the risk one aspect that appeared most the interview the search for information related market client technology and the product itself besides that aspect agility the product development contingency measure for unexpected result and validation the product with the client were pointed out some the startup examining the validation question the third block possible conclude that all startup have defined goal and objective although not all them wanted could specify their strategy but the difference operating time those who didn care share this information clear the more experienced the startup the better structured strategy addition that possible understand that all startup have some idea the environment surrounding them but few them active monitoring keep internal and external factor that might influence their business date finally observing risk profile both interviewee and company possible notice that half the surveyed people consider themselves prone risk while the other half consider their positioning moderate regarding risk propensity person company evaluated averse risk something that can expected the scenario enterprise working with innovation quantitative stage result from the startup that had their answer validated the online formulary stage most them more than two year operating time the investor commitment relation deposited value those startup noticeable the company received between and the band and between and besides that the company still didn recover the invested money from those that did received between and european journal applied business management issn large majority the enterprise declared that they have clearly defined strategic goal and them presented valid answer with objective quantitative definition and specific deadline when asked provide example strategic goal addition that the company have definition external and internal factor that may influence their performance about the respondent risk profile affirm risk prone and affirm have moderate risk profile relation the company risk profile however there seems bit more caution indicated that their startup have moderate risk profile whereas the other have risk prone profile when asked about what they understand risk most the respondent showed negative perception materializing itself word such problem threat adversity barrier loss among others the other hand only the respondent seemed have vision risk associated the possibility gain return greater than normal the remainder associated risk the definition damodaran which both scenario positive and negative outcome are considered the risk analysis occurs empirically and without aid any risk management tool most the startup them utilize proper tool this context and affirm that don analyze risk all moreover even startup with more than two year operating time most them analyze their data empirically this distribution raise the hypothesis that startup are interested analyzing risk since they empirically however they seem have little access risk management tool proper tool the startup scenario when asked about strategy deal with risk execute internal control that could financial product training action plan monitor their market make regular test and only one company explicitly affirmed look for client feedback seeking for client opinion one the pillar the lean startup methodology ries which point obtaining quick answer the business hypothesis order minimize error this kind company the behavior presented most the company contrary what ries suggests seems more like consolidated enterprise than startup that sense agility seems losing strength stable practice incumbent the market which might mean problem related the difficulty reaching the exponential performance expected the case startup addition the analysis generated from the description the data obtained the survey pearson correlation analysis also generated table and the result contribute the proposition the first phase the maturity level the risk analysis process slightly negative correlation index with startup operation time which mean that older company have much even structure for risk analysis than newly established company the invested value slightly positive correlation index with the maturity level the risk analysis process which may raise some hypothesis for some the company with the highest level investment there structure that allows the systematization risk analysis process company with higher investment have investor who demand protection practice relation risk what influence these company have better established process for this anyway the positive correlation found low suggesting that analysis based opinion and feeling are common startup with higher level investment and that the risk management process not much more priority these company than capitalized one the other hand there sign that company that define strategic objective and goal also better organize their risk analysis process pearson coefficient addition european journal applied business management issn company that analyze the market which they are inserted evaluating opportunity and threat also seem signal greater propensity better organize risk analysis pearson coefficient these two correlation are the strongest found the set analyzed case and may indicate that for the process risk analysis occur more organized way the startup necessary have first stage strategy analysis and planning since without these initial definition there seems insufficient alignment for the risk management process take place finally the correlation between the method risk analysis and the issue breakeven almost index which suggests that there random behavior between investment recovery and systematization the risk analysis process table pearson correlation between the variable how are risk analyzed the company operating time doe the company have defined goal and objective doe the company have the definition external and internal factor that can influence investment the company already recovered the value invested breakeven source the author appropriateness the risk management process the startup context based the analysis carried out with the startup possible notice that the company which are entering the market need adapted risk management method order able execute activity also important highlight that adaption these method can useful for startup create value and not only bureaucratic process this study propose adaption the standard iso international organization for standardization wellknown method for risk management the original method presented figure first important highlight the correlation identified between strategy analysis and planning and the method analyzing risk the surveyed company these finding can drive the management structure for the company reach better risk management before trying deal with risk management necessary structure the strategic analysis and planning defining objective and goal for the company and analyzing opportunity and threat the market the context the risk management process startup communication and consultation should part daily quick change and pivot ries however these stage the risk management process need highlighted considering seems occur the minority the analyzed startup thus facing this scenario propose approach that can european journal applied business management issn mixed with agile practice such scrum shwaber and beedle where revision practice communication and consultation stage suggested mainly for startup manager first the company stakeholder group need defined after that suggested that least once month ideally sprint retrospective meeting one the manager keep responsible for quickly presenting opinion from each stakeholder group the context establishment stage seems something already incorporated the reality startup given the fact that almost all startup some kind planning goal and objective definition and analyze internal and external factor that influence the company performance the main risk brought partner the company diverge some part from arruda showing the possibility not having consolidated understanding the subject seen that general those are new company and partner are still learning process this emphasizes the importance the risk identification stage thus that stage suggest startup evaluated factor related partner the amount them that devote full time the harmony between them their ability adapt the business the market need and change commitment and personal and professional interest alignment the partner environment the place where the startup installed that may facilitate complicate the functioning and human resource captionattraction and iii economic aspect product service acceptance the market and capital volume invested furthermore important review item such amount full time devoted partner that have other income source and the possibility incubation acceleration place with reduced functioning cost these aspect are point elucidated the identification stage order verify their relevance not addition them suggested verify political technological and legal aspect that altered may change the entire course the startup example that the change the credit card market proposal made the brazilian government threatening fintech operation such nubank miozzo besides those aspect other point considered risk team member should pointed out according the context which the company inserted and development stage according answer given the startup the stage risk analysis and evaluation are usually driven empiricism and almost never have argument based fact data just opinion and feeling with risk identification and regular stakeholder opinion gathering performed communication and consultation stage possible move analysis stage which each risk identified the previous stage must evaluated relation consequence may cause the evaluation stage complement the analysis stage being the one where the decision about each risk level and priority taken the treatment stage must executed two phase first one define what about each risk mitigate avoid accept transfer based that the need action plan defined followed those plan definition and execution thus propose the company have specific moment for the execution both analysis and evaluation stage along with the first phase treatment stage periodic meeting the startup manager european journal applied business management issn figure risk management process source international organization for standardization monitoring and review must periodic process and both active and passive dimension may highlighted startup are company with short management cycle action must developed measured and result and learning must verified quick way ries hence risk management monitoring and revision suggested executed two level daily and sprint following the scrum agile method shwaber and beedle widely used project management method startup daily meeting internal and micro level risk should approached they can easily solved while the sprint retrospective meeting necessary review howif risk are affecting the company objective and goal also verifying the need incorporating new risk and treatment and monitoring active monitoring may conducted staff specifically trained identify risk while passive monitoring may part everyone task the latter would imply minimum level knowledge about what risk and how identify and thus may out reach for the smallest resourceful startup conclusion this research present evidence the lack familiarity brazilian startup management team with risk management method issue that potentially detrimental the success new venture both qualitative and quantitative data suggest this lack familiarity unrelated founder experience the total amount invested capital which turn may signal external recognition the merit the new business which alert not only founder but also incubator accelerator and venture capital investor taken together these sign may point overall lack awareness regarding the importance enterprise risk management the notably riskheavy brazilian startup environment although lacking knowledge about possible notice that startup manager are largely interested building risk management capability for their company recognizing that dealing more efficient way with practical tool manage risk may beneficial european journal applied business management issn such firm given that their company deal with the result risk decision all the time however the methodology that the current literature present are too robust the startup reality which highlight the need simpler method appropriate this initial phase business organization first attempt adapt the widely known model presented the iso international organization for standardization proposed making use management practice reportedly already known and adopted startup the rationale behind the proposed adaptation first familiarize startup with the risk management process using what they already know and apply building more complex and sophisticated solution risk management capability matures within these company moreover even simple practice such those identified the empirical research may adequately integrated proper risk management model contribute immensely startup success relation popular approach structuring startup such lean startup ries and scrum shwaber and beedle which are fundamentally built upon the concept testing and experimentation remarkable that few company reported the use systematic testing decrease the level risk grassroots adaptation these wellknown startup principle risk management would not surprise researcher given that risk management approach technological project already employ similar reasoning keizera and instance trialanderror learning risk management startup have been already identified sommer furthermore the search for customer feedback not mentioned risk identification strategy even customer involvement innovative activity been largely accepted modern startup modus operandi coviello and joseph this lead the interpretation that brazilian startup may trying behave consolidated and stable enterprise too soon which may possibly affect their risk management capability and consequently hamper their growth finally number limitation must noted first limitation regard the nature itself risk certain foreseeability involved the notion risk management thus this research did not investigated aspect related related and fruitful stream research innovation study that management approach deal with unforeseeable uncertainty loch sommer instead strict erm approach chosen choice that defined our interpretation risk management and consequently influenced our research design result our result must interpreted with this limitation mind additionally there are limitation that arise from our methodological choice first the sample size used the empirical study small and should expanded future work for better characterization the brazilian startup environment because exploratory approach definitive answer regarding the adoption risk management solution brazilian startup were provided further research paramount order further test the first impression uncovered this paper similarly additional research may focus testing the proposed model adaptation for risk management regarding adequacy startup operational and strategic routine particular aspect special interest the assessment how hand such proposed model that what extent founder and initial team member would able apply themselves even lacking formal risk management training this assessment particularly important for startup with typical limitation term financial and human resource and also for business accelerator and incubator providing support nascent enterprise finally the need for study related risk management innovation environment emphasized way supporting the practice this subject startup european journal applied business management issn
