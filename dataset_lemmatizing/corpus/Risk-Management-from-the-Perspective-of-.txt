conduct risk management hence research exploratory seeking present perception startup leader risk type company developing adaption risk management method startup context result research hypothesis may suggested tested looking general understanding startup behavior regarding risk management data collection executed two stage first one qualitative nature used interview brazilian startup founder eight people different company selected convenience availability interviewed support semistructured questionnaire predefined question help interviewer guide course conversation question allocated three block first block verification prerequisite startup able participate study acceptance criterion participate survey considered following condition company register brazil called cnpj criterion show legal level commitment respondent company company received investment either founder third party present financial commitment partner iii company yet reached breakeven point criterion characterizes startup still survive market besides identification information name job title academic education interviewee firm age asked second block consists qualitative question order verify company understands analysis deal risk exposed question based main stage risk management proposed iso international organization standardization general stage identification analysis evaluation treatment risk purdy based model following question proposed understand risk biggest risk company today iii risk analyzed company strategy deal risk thus possible semantically analyze convergent knowledge practice risk management among interviewee aim third block validate interview also understand company context following question made company defined goal strategic objective company definition internal external factor may impact performance something like swot analysis iii risk profile prone moderate averse risk company profile risk prone moderate averse risk thereby possible understand use nonuse planning management practice well company strategic appreciation risk second research stage quantitative based result first one goal stage get answer question previous stage bigger number startup something would possible facetoface interview therefore online survey question form first stage made survey sent brazilian startup association group incubator accelerator technological park similar criterion used validate answer startup cnpj startup received investment iii respondent management position startup total response collected considered valid european journal applied business management issn according criterion data analyzed descriptive statistic analysis pearson correlation done main variable collected second stage table variable operating time table overview variable used correlation analysis measurement unit month risk analyzed company analyzed empirically without aid tool method aid tool method company defined goal objective yes company definition external influence internal factor investment yes reais company already recovered value invested breakeven yes source author result first stage research facetoface interview made generated detail richness following stage second stage however generated greater number answer allowed suggestion proposal process risk management brazilian startup qualitative stage result first block question possible briefly analyze profile interviewed company evaluated startup different background company working energy industry printing education knowledge management digital marketing operating time also varies six month three year could suggest different maturity level risk management although identified quantitative research stage low investment four thousand reais funded public investment entity thousand reais little half million reais lastly one company funded venture capital six million reais investment despite disparity investment quantity none startup got breakeven point half startup installed incubator others shared office besides one company brazilian founder based canada cnpj exception foreign company equivalent register canada interviewee ceo partner company european journal applied business management issn therefore able give clear vision intention strategy business analyzing first question second block possible notice negativity attributed meaning word risk probability thing going wrong danger path starting point final point thing control others face risk something neutral either bad good one interviewee used word opportunity answer regarding risk respondent identified biggest one company three item highlighted nonacceptance value proposition market problem related brazilian government bureaucracy high tax lack enough cash flow maintain company activity also observed half company analyze risk empirically operating time investment correlate aspect meaning even experienced financially compromised startup might analyse risk based opinion youngest company six month affirmed risk analysis due low investment four thousand reais moment therefore understand necessary deeper understanding risk involving business better organized startup relation risk management practice pointed example tool control metric management spreadsheet market monitoring related competitor new technology besides possible notice startup founder graduated professional experience management showed greater structuring relation risk management activity company founder training management greater technical skill product noticeable none startup analysis presented method diffused literature regarding last question second block refers strategy deal risk one aspect appeared interview search information related market client technology product besides aspect agility product development contingency measure unexpected result validation product client pointed startup examining validation question third block possible conclude startup defined goal objective although wanted could specify strategy difference operating time care share information clear experienced startup better structured strategy addition possible understand startup idea environment surrounding active monitoring keep internal external factor might influence business date finally observing risk profile interviewee company possible notice half surveyed people consider prone risk half consider positioning moderate regarding risk propensity person company evaluated averse risk something expected scenario enterprise working innovation quantitative stage result startup answer validated online formulary stage two year operating time investor commitment relation deposited value startup noticeable company received band besides company still recover invested money received european journal applied business management issn large majority enterprise declared clearly defined strategic goal presented valid answer objective quantitative definition specific deadline asked provide example strategic goal addition company definition external internal factor may influence performance respondent risk profile affirm risk prone affirm moderate risk profile relation company risk profile however seems bit caution indicated startup moderate risk profile whereas risk prone profile asked understand risk respondent showed negative perception materializing word problem threat adversity barrier loss among others hand respondent seemed vision risk associated possibility gain return greater normal remainder associated risk definition damodaran scenario positive negative outcome considered risk analysis occurs empirically without aid risk management tool startup utilize proper tool context affirm analyze risk moreover even startup two year operating time analyze data empirically distribution raise hypothesis startup interested analyzing risk since empirically however seem little access risk management tool proper tool startup scenario asked strategy deal risk execute internal control could financial product training action plan monitor market make regular test one company explicitly affirmed look client feedback seeking client opinion one pillar lean startup methodology ries point obtaining quick answer business hypothesis order minimize error kind company behavior presented company contrary ries suggests seems like consolidated enterprise startup sense agility seems losing strength stable practice incumbent market might mean problem related difficulty reaching exponential performance expected case startup addition analysis generated description data obtained survey pearson correlation analysis also generated table result contribute proposition first phase maturity level risk analysis process slightly negative correlation index startup operation time mean older company much even structure risk analysis newly established company invested value slightly positive correlation index maturity level risk analysis process may raise hypothesis company highest level investment structure allows systematization risk analysis process company higher investment investor demand protection practice relation risk influence company better established process anyway positive correlation found low suggesting analysis based opinion feeling common startup higher level investment risk management process much priority company capitalized one hand sign company define strategic objective goal also better organize risk analysis process pearson coefficient addition european journal applied business management issn company analyze market inserted evaluating opportunity threat also seem signal greater propensity better organize risk analysis pearson coefficient two correlation strongest found set analyzed case may indicate process risk analysis occur organized way startup necessary first stage strategy analysis planning since without initial definition seems insufficient alignment risk management process take place finally correlation method risk analysis issue breakeven almost index suggests random behavior investment recovery systematization risk analysis process table pearson correlation variable risk analyzed company operating time company defined goal objective company definition external internal factor influence investment company already recovered value invested breakeven source author appropriateness risk management process startup
