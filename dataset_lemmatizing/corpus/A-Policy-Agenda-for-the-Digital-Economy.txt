page the challenge for the past four decade the relentless wave innovation information and communication technology icts driven sweeping set change across the globalizing knowledgebased economy the embedding microprocessor and sensor growing range product become ubiquitous feature the global economy controlling the rhythm which operates each stage this ongoing revolution commentator have predicted that reached the limit what technologically feasible however the current wave innovation embodied mobile device cloud computing and the internet thing once again putting the lie this prediction the all pervasiveness this technology leading informed commentator like brian arthur label this the second economy which comprises revolution sweeping scope the first industrial revolution from which created muscular system that drew upon machine power the motive force driving the economy suggests that the current revolution developing neural system based digital technology that communicate and interact with each other this neural system based digital technology that underpins the second economy and driving the most fundamental technological change virtually sector the economy immune disruptive effect and the full impact contribution future growth still not readily apparent this emerging digital economy the focus our current research project creating digital opportunity the development digital technology now reached the stage where become foundational technology that all pervasive and essential our daily life electricity the information and communication technology sector lie the heart the emerging digital economy but significance extends far beyond this single sector because other industry technology sector more central the development globally competitive economy few country can afford ignore this trend and many are positioning their ict industry the driver future growth this second economy that silently forming vast interconnected and extraordinarily productive creating for new economic world how will fare this world how will adapt how will profit from and share benefit very much arthur while the current era information technology began the with the invention and rapid diffusion the microprocessor the development optical fiber and the simultaneous digitization telecommunication with the introduction the first digital switch the full effect the digital economy not felt until the mids when the introduction and rapid adoption the internet and the set widely used standard that comprise the world wide web began transform what had previously been discrete policy agenda for the digital economy page individual computer and corporate network into network globally interconnected digital network what colloquially refer cyberspace the integration microprocessor increasingly embedded mobile rather than fixed device digital telecommunication and the internet creating new architecture for the delivery product and service based cloud computing cloud computing refers the ability easily use remotely located shared computing resource flexible and scalable manner the progressive dispersion cloud computing creating new economic reality that lie the heart the digital economy increasing abundance computing resource that fundamentally altering the economic calculus production distribution and sale virtually every sector the economy from agriculture and mining automotive manufacturing and entertainment several critical consequence follow from this transition from scarcity abundance computing resource cloud computing delivering computationintensive resource wider range firm ever lower cost turning traditional highvalue added economic activity into commodified activity making possible disaggregate and disintermediate both production activity and service activity that have been embedded the structure large corporate organization this disintermediation extends from the production physical product such electronics and automobile the delivery service from hotel accommodation screenbased entertainment content cloud computing becomes more widely accessible ever lower cost value moving the architecture away from infrastructure provider towards those delivering software service kushida the result the emergence what kenney and zysman refer the platform economy they define platform framework that permit collaborator undertake range activity often creating facto standard forming entire ecosystem for value creation and capture diverse range platform provide the infrastructure and tool upon which other firm across wide range manufacturing and service sector can deliver their product and service the emergence platform represents new business model that making digital service more widely accessible and leading profound reconfiguration market form work organization and the very basis value creation the second economy they are profoundly unsettling existing pattern economic activity the manner depicted schumpeter many prevailing model business organization production and service delivery are affected their disruptive potential kenney and zysman sector the economy and indeed national economy can protected from the effect this transformation important corollary the force that are driving the cost hardware toward zero and making immense level computing power more widely accessible that the software policy agenda for the digital economy page component the information technology sector increasing dramatically significance this point been underlined mark andreessen widely cited wsj article entitled software eating the world but also been stressed number others including mit willy shih shih argues that the current technological revolution involves fundamental shift the functionality information technology from the hardware side software key consequence this shift that functionality that previously had built into the hardware product can now programmed through software and modified updated much more easily one consequence this shift that lowering the entry barrier many industry making easier for company introduce innovative new product that can disintermediate and disrupt existing industry from automobile and taxi hotel and financial service increasingly the competitive advantage product will embedded their software well the management the brand that employ the latest software tool the software revolution will powerful complement the cheapcomputing revolution and the opportunity for unique and innovative product are boundless just matter programming shih even intel recently announced that venture financing arm significantly increasing investment software company nyt previous generation federal innovation policy from the failed experiment with microsystems international the the more successful example the microelectronics and system development program the among other initiative that period contributed directly and indirectly stimulating the growth some canada most successful information technology firm that turn fueled the boom canada high technology sector the and early canadian success strongly concentrated the hardware side the telecom and mobile sector the last phase the boom with some notable exception like cognos cgi and open text and this part the sector that been impacted most severely the increasing commoditization hardware canada become competitive hardware than the and the demise nortel the absorption newbridge into alcatel the decline rimblackberry and the effective integration jds into the california base uniphase all symbolize this decline more positive note mitel one canada long standing telecom firm successfully made the transition from hardware company specializing pbx business system premise software company based virtualized software system operating cloud environment similar vein blackberry shifting business focus from the production hardware the enterprise security side product offering policy agenda for the digital economy policy direction for canada page the cdo research proposal set out the critical research and policy challenge determine what part the production process can competitively retained canada and what are the added value activity that can most profitably carried out domestically designing policy with this increasing global division activity mind critical framing successful digital strategy for canada policy need focus how take advantage this transition building and supporting canadian strength software and then how scale them more effectively this trend shifting functionality from hardware into system through the application software code may hold important key the future canada place the emerging digital economy leading economist have noted that there traditional bias small open economy such canada against technologybased industry the entry barrier associated with technological innovation especially hardware affect smaller firm greater extent than large one the degree that smaller economy are characterized larger number smaller indigenous firm this place the entire economy competitive disadvantage consequence there greater social incentive justification for providing business support technologicallyintensive industry small open economy than the case with larger more selfcontained economy harris the relative size firm the smaller economy lead suboptimal industrial structure with respect competing innovationbased industry subsidizing small firm engage greater level spending alone doe not automatically ensure that the firm will grow sufficient size overcome the barrier entry into world market this suggests that government policy support the digital sector the economy must include one that are targeted supporting firm they grow beyond the startup phase and face more intense competition continental and global market the market failure the industrial process within technologically intensive industry disadvantage firm small open economy resulting the need design technology and business support policy with this fact mind theory that link international trade with technological innovation argue that shift leadership are not randomly distributed across industrial sector between country technological competition tends cumulative and the nature that competition contains large degree irreversibility country and region gain substantial advantage from being first new and emerging technology the initial advantage that accrue the technological leader area allow retain that lead for period time and undermine the effort competitor the benefit technological leadership allow firm recover research and development cost well realize higher than average return investment effect policy agenda for the digital economy page success breed success being successful today raise the probability success the future harris dosi tyson and zysman this success turn provides capital for firm recycle into greater research and development investment support future innovation the critical question how government should respond these change while the cdo project still early stage our research thus far provides perspective the policy change needed respond this challenge the analysis below present some preliminary insight from our cdo research and some policy implication for consideration cdo researcher dan breznitz recently argued the the uncertainty associated with investment research and development and the inability appropriate the research result are among the biggest obstacle innovation most economy numerous study and policy report have documented the fact that despite canada excessive reliance the delivery innovation support through the taxbased program level business spending research and development have been falling while the program itself need reform more effectively meet the need the technology community evident that continuing rely primarily the tax system move canada off low innovation equilibrium council canadian academy insufficient what required the introduction and expansion range direct spending program support innovation the high technology and digital sector the economy the role technology development agency researcher the cdo network have documented the different type policy instrument that have proved effective those country that have moved from relatively low level technological intensity much higher level performance key feature many the success story been the use relatively low profile technology development agency such darpa the sitra finland the office the chief scientist israel the enterprise development program and international service program ireland key the success these agency the fact that they were effectively insulated from shortterm political pressure produce result and were staffed with technology expert from academia and industry who could target the agency investment build innovative capacity indigenous firm through their ability experiment with new and emerging technology and make longterm investment these agency were relatively inexpensive for the public purse with budget often the range million year what crucial for their success the institutionalization the agency and the ability pursue longterm strategy while not every investment proven successful and some agency have been more effective policy agenda for the digital economy page sustaining their strategy over the long term the evidence suggests that the model can highly effective shifting the technological trajectory indigenous hightech sector path that will enable exploit new and emerging technology with greater elasticity demand the international market place breznitz breznitz and ornston indeed recent article the harvard business review former director darpa currently implementing the agency innovation model google advanced technology and project group which charged with the task bringing fruition host next generation mobile technology argues that the key lesson learned darpa over many decade can effectively transferred the private sector and help accelerate the pace innovation private firm they argue that the key darpa success consists three element setting ambitious goal using temporary project team carry them out and maintaining the complete autonomy the agency selecting and running project also central darpa success been unwavering commitment building research agency dedicated solving technological problem located pasteur quadrant stokes which entail pushing the frontier basic science solve welldefined useinspired need dugan and gabriel bonvillian important differentiate between the role that this type technology development agency play many our leading competitor and the current model research funding that dominates the canadian innovation system the existing federal model for focused the funding basic research through the federal granting council nce and crc one end the continuum and support for private sector primarily delivered through the tax system with number minor program devoted commercializing university based research there significant body research which document the importance fundamental research generating many the scientific breakthrough that have been critical for the development today digital technology national research council mazzucato but what lacking the canadian system focused and autonomous agency charged with the mission stimulating radical innovation that are close the technological frontier one example successful model along these line within canada sustainable development technology canada sdtc not for profit foundation created the federal government with significant funding that operates with independent board outside the federal departmental structure believe that similarly well funded entity would highly successful for supporting ict company from applied research through commercialization this not say that can afford ignore the financing basic httpswwwsdtccaen policy agenda for the digital economy page research canada need expand the range direct spending program support innovation digital technology while maintaining our strength the basic research that can the source the next generation technology well train the highly qualified personnel work those innovation along with the establishment strategic technology agency require more focused and strategic approach innovation the ict sector building proven strategy that have worked both canada and other country key starting point develop sector strategy consultation with key industry association and representative there shortage policy document and recommendation currently available from these organization this process could launched and undertaken with some sense urgency some the province particularly ontario have undertaken such sector strategy exercise which should built upon and integrated into any federal initiative this area the process itself need iterative one there not beginning and end point given the pace which digital innovation continues sweep through the economy the strategy and the consultation need revisited periodic basis key component such exercise the launching ictdigital road map exercise explore existing strength and make strategic decision about the area where could achieve maximum leverage the shortest time frame with the minimum amount additional federal spending the result such exercise could also provide important resource for the work the strategic technology agency the federal government established track record convening industry and sectoral roundtable draw technology road map that can used inform industry sector about where the technological frontier moving given that experience this something that could initiated fairly quickly the availability risk capital also need expand the range policy instrument available support market driven innovation the digital sector fortunately there are number highly successful example program that have worked well other country and that could adapted canada one the most effective these the small business innovation research sbir program the number commentator have suggested that should applied this country introduced the small business incentive research program designed simulate technological innovation particularly small business and increase private sector commercialization innovation derived from federal research and development the sbir program required federal agency with budget over million set aside per cent their fund for the program the early the program criterion were revised policy agenda for the digital economy page congress increase the set aside per cent and increase the emphasis placed commercial potential for successful application more than billion had been awarded under the program with current expenditure billion year numerous evaluation that have been conducted the program have documented positive effective the growth and success innovative startup firm including the increased likelihood recipient firm attracting venture capital investment lerner branscomb and auerswald unlikely that the program could financed and delivered exactly the program care would need taken selecting program design and delivery mechanism ensure maximum effectiveness canada the canadian advanced technology alliance cata recently put forward proposal introduce sbirtype program canada replacing the refundable portion the tax credit targeted small business canadian sbir administered dedicated agency established for that purpose the proposal merit serious examination the federal government well examine how the existing build canada innovation program bcip could integrated into this new program another existing federal program with proven track stimulating innovation small and mediumsized enterprise the industrial research assistance program irap numerous study federal innovation policy lipsey and carlaw lipsey carlaw and bekar and number report leading industry association have called for significant expansion the funding available for irap measure are needed strengthen and expand the staff irap and significantly increase budget one problem that plagued irap recent year the constant expansion and contraction budget response changing macroeconomic condition and shift the policy mandate assigned the program irap requires stable and assured long term funding ensure that play the critical innovation support role for which intended while mandate stimulate innovation canadian sme extends well beyond the information technology sector and digital technology significant expansion budget the range proposed cata among others should significant component expanded federal strategy create digital opportunity for firm canada due attention need paid the design the csbir ensure that complement and doe not overlap compete with the current mandate irap the cata proposal for canadian sbir can viewed online httpsdocsgooglecomdocumentdfdktbjdtwnntmqujgixgvcnazwvkucjxrmhaeimqedit policy agenda for the digital economy growing startup firm global scale page key challenge for canada dealing with the competitive issue how both start and grow indigenous firm digital technology involves dealing with the dual problem scaling and the evaluation technology firm the capital market the recent demise nortel the buyout key telecom firm like jds uniphase and newbridge network and the substantial downsizing rimblackberry all point the challenge growing and sustaining indigenous canadian firm the digital economy government both the federal and provincial level have introduced number important initiative recent year expand support for incubator and accelerator part which are being studied the cdo project well expand funding for the venture capital market these policy have helped expand the support available for startup firm and the degree funding available finance them starting new firm just one part the problem the other part the fact that not grow enough our startup firm the global scale that when one disappears the dynamism the whole system jeopardized need additional policy support the scaling digital firm once they have been launched the challenge create new program federal andor provincial that can effectively designate number the most promising startup the digital sector for additional support help them scale doing important recognize that age firm should more important criterion for direct taxbased public support than the size firm such program can designate specific number promising highgrowth startup across the country and provide them with resource strategy revenue generation talent management and growth capital help them scale the program should focus the most critical challenge facing scaleups such growing their revenue base particularly accessing global not just continental market helping them recruit retain and develop the managerial and technology talent need grow competitive company global scale and ensuring that they have access source capital that are adequate not just launch the company but grow the program could designed and implemented supplement existing federal and provincial program that support startup such the existing canadian accelerator and incubator program caip the ontario network entrepreneur one alberta regional innovation network there exist number scaleup program the that merit close attention care should taken ensure that the program effectively targeted selective group startup the one with the most promising chance success the global stage and that delivered through existing agency with strong and proven track providing effective support for startup firm diluting the program the level where applied too broadly indiscriminately would ensure failure before even got off the ground policy agenda for the digital economy page far ranging presentation cdo partner wesley clover also documented number initiative that can help canadian company scale attain greater success global market one suggestion call for the establishment sale marketing consortium help give canadian technology firm the breadth critical mass needed penetrate the bric market where size matter they also suggest that the federal and provincial government should increase direct support for smes such risk insurance more aggressive and targeted foreign intelligence sale opportunity direct support for industry export consortium wesley clover this call reinforced the recent policy document from the information technology association canada itac the itac report call for range initiative help canadian firm penetrate global market including that industry organization should develop identify and bring together set smes from specific sector for example health informatics cyber security digital medium and enterprise solution that can exposed key foreign market very targeted way increasing the chance for success for subsequent trade mission information technology association canada related issue that requires serious policy attention help canadian digital firm grow sufficient scale dealing with the challenge stock evaluation provided the capital market penetrating presentation the earch money conference the late adam chowaniec argued that public company canada realize stock market valuation that are much lower than their peer south the border that this applies both tsx listed company and dual listed canadian company referred recent analysis which suggested that ict company are valued per cent discount the software sector and per cent discount the hardware sector chowaniec statistic from the bdc cited the wesley clover policy document referred above indicate that backed canadian tech firm exit canada will raise only per cent what would get the and canadian firm exit achieves just per cent what comparable firm realizes there similarly canadian tech firm exit canada achieves than per cent what the same firm would raise the wesley clover the consequence this systematic undervaluation canadian technology firm been well documented the annual report the branham group the leading information technology firm canada which list leading canadian firm that have been lost acquisition over the past decade and half the capital market challenge for canadian information technology firm one creating pool capital that are not only targeted funding angel and startup early stage but can also contribute growing midstage company that are already well established canada this problem also the focus report the president itac cdo partner the challenge building stronger tech policy agenda for the digital economy page company canada the report call for change the regulatory framework support the growth indigenous canadian ict firm well program for infrastructure support canadian company achieving greater success the global marketplace earlier stage their corporate development gupta the impact digital technology across the economy while the information technology sector underpins the emerging second industrial revolution and the platform economy revolutionary significance lie potential impact and disrupt virtually every sector the economy enabling and transformative technology large share the economic impact the digital opportunity will play out well beyond the ict and manufacturing sector the economy the primary and secondary industry that are using digital technology change the way they business raising productivity increasing product diversity reducing risk and restructure global production network this suggests that key concern for the federal government working jointly with their provincial counterpart might chart effective strategy ensure that canadian firm are provided the support needed take full advantage this potential matter what sector the economy they operate there opportunity work with industry association who have already done considerable amount work the technological change impacting their industry develop sectoral strategy that can identify and target specific initiative which can often funded through existing federal and provincial program promote the adoption and diffusion digital technology across their sector one area where canadian firm continue lag across the board term investment software recent report from the centre for the study living standard suggests that under investment software account for per cent the broader canadaus ict investment gap and consequently significant contributor canada lagging productivity performance evident that canada requires national strategy support the adoption and use the latest software available across broad range economic sector given the critical link between investment icts and productivity growth well the pervasive effect digital technology across the economy the cdo research partnership view this critical political issue urgently need attention the shortlived digital technology adoption program administered the national research council intended achieve this goal but suffered from number design limitation still require national digital technology adoption strategy assist smes identifying what technology are most appropriate for them and boost software investment and productivity the business development bank canada bdc offer support smes looking adopt and exploit digital policy agenda for the digital economy page technology through the smart tech service business may also apply for available million loan for investment hardware software and consulting service centre for the study living standard the federal government could examine the possibility expanding this program and ensuring coverage across broad range sector the canadian economy part the current cdo project research team member and partner are undertaking extensive set sectoral study that chart the current and potential impact digital technology across wide range industry sector although still their early stage many these study highlight the need for policy change across range area including regulatory issue disruptive innovation across many different sector challenging current regulatory regime the federal provincial and municipal level uber which being studied the cdo project provides excellent illustration the kind challenge this technology creates for the prevailing regulatory regime the municipal level but just forewarning even bigger change that lie ahead numerous other challenge are just beginning emerge related field research conducted association with the cdo project suggests that the coming introduction autonomous vehicle made possible the spreading use digital sensor and controller going herald even greater change urban planning urban design and the implementation urban transportation system working with the city toronto cdo partner helping the municipality understand how the transition from transportation single owner product transportation service will require major rethinking number municipal planning and regulatory area fintech other sector being studied the cdo project range from agriculture and mining advanced manufacturing digital medium and financial service these study afford important insight into the growing impact digital technology established sector the economy working conjunction with industry representative member the cdo research team have recently completed analysis the evolving fintech ecosystem the greater torontokitchenerwaterloo region benchmarking canada strength against other emerging fintech ecosystem and suggesting strategic direction help stimulate and support the growth the ecosystem the report highlight both the potential opportunity being created fintech firm but also the significant challenge they pose for established industry player the research team suggested number critical policy initiative help grow the emerging fintech ecosystem many these can implemented the provincial and municipal level which have targeted financial service key area for policy support but some will require federal action one policy agenda for the digital economy page the critical element the fintech ecosystem currently missing the presence large inexpensive incubator centre offering basic service with high connectivity highly discounted rate while number incubator exist the inexpensive one are far below the scale currently available london and new york and the more expensive one demand rent far above what startup can afford the result that effort build dynamic fintech ecosystem key canadian centre are lagging behind development leading global centre such new york and london there also evidence that despite recent effort the federal and provincial government increase the supply seed and very early venture capital available startup canada there may still shortage this suggests more direct approach for example grant conditionally repayable loan policy area for increased government participation research been conducted member the cdo research partnership best kind international case such israel and finland breznitz breznitz and wolfe which can provide instructive lesson for canada however some the most significant initiative support the growth the fintech sector may require regulatory change the federal level canada one the world most respected financial regulatory framework and this framework one the base for the continuous stability financial system nonetheless this regulatory system and specific regulatory body now act and are perceived act way that limit restricts innovation emerging from new company thus preserving the statusquo for established canadian financial institution this lead first many fintech firm either relocating their operation the not developing product these niche thereby allowing foreign company gain global prominence and control greater market share the same time the presence excellent regulatory system and the high degree respect for the regulator widely seen potential asset for the fintech ecosystem hence finding way which the canadian regulator perhaps taking page from their counterpart can develop procedure stay abreast new technology development and their predicted impact the market while allowing for rapid smallscale experimentation leading scaleup case success source great potential such action would not only make canada more attractive global hub for fintech development attracting high quality entrepreneur and investor but would also create institutionalized pathway for information diffusion collaboration and the development vibrant ecosystem breznitz advanced manufacturing within the context this sectoral approach support the adoption and diffusion digital technology across the economy draw particular attention the strategic importance policy agenda for the digital economy page the manufacturing sector the spread the digital economy and new global production system have fundamentally altered the landscape the industrial economy the emergence new material changed the manufacturing process introducing new software layer into traditional machining process instead classical metal bashing metal manufacturing now based the manipulation the microstructures the material industrial company including about per cent smes have developed specialized software tool for optimizing production tool and process however there are still important gap the modelling and visualization microstructures and their related production process further there the opportunity expand market integrating them into global supply chain platform developed leading multinational corporation research suggests that the major opportunity for growth will lie within existing industrial company who have more stable income stream established customer base and the production capability and staff because the critical importance smes for economic and job growth important focus increasing the innovative capacity sme firm particularly for new technology like printing and additive manufacturing the growing shift from the embedding control mechanism hardware system their design software creating broad opportunity for canadian firm both the ict and the advanced manufacturing sector given canada long standing expertise software there are smes that have developed their own software application sometimes standard code and sometimes vertical application running top mainstream platform provided leading international database vendor there opportunity deploy these module for running larger digital manufacturing platform from global multinationals this offer the potential for them added valueadded module for other manufacturing environment and export market also possible for individual dedicated application optimized through integration with other software module and data source across the supply chain the spread the digital economy and new global production system have qualitatively changed the nature the industrial economy this now applies manufacturing resource industry and agriculture also mean that most the valueadded created away from the original location production the farm mine factory concomitantly the revised version industrial policy networked industrial policy which focus enhancing the regional industrial common key location across the country order utilize the existing research education and training infrastructure support canadian smes the leading edge the digital revolution their respective sector recent policy report from the connect innovation institute the university california san diego drew attention the central role played the manufacturing sector policy agenda for the digital economy page process and incremental innovation and the longterm implication decline the sector ability innovate the production wide range manufactured good become increasingly globalized production become more fragmented and organized global production network consequence company involved these network have become more specialized from the they undertake the design manufacturing and assembly their component final product production increasingly networked activity company share responsibility with other partner their global production and innovation network consequence the key supporting domestic manufacturing capability the adoption policy designed solve what the report refers semipublic good supply problem breznitz and cowhey recent policy initiative both the establish national network for manufacturing innovation nnmi which being set privatepublic partnership program and the establish catapult centre are both aimed improving the manufacturing capability for technology developed their respective country emulating some the key feature the fraunhofer institute germany hepburn and wolfe the nnmi model particular and the new institute establishing have significant bearing for the competitive standing range technology and industry the manufacturing sector the canadian economy many the new institute are located physically proximate region canada and they are being established industrial sector which the competes directly with canadian firm for investment and product mandate the model being adopted the may not wholly transferable canada but the rationale behind adoption applies equally the domestic manufacturing sector focusing sectoral strategy for manufacturing based the recognition the significant role that manufacturing play private spending research and development well the need build regional and provincial capacity support new technology platform emerging area such the connected car the automotive sector the adoption and integration ict the delivery medical service and the management the health care system more broadly the trend government policy support manufacturing discussed above based recognition the strategic significance technology platform opposed the spending the level individual firm this recognition two critical implication for existing and proposed policy both the federal and provincial level requires broader and deeper integration the link between program designed support the research and development capability research institution especially the public sector and the integration those research capability with the absorptive capacity domestic provincial firm policy agenda for the digital economy page also requires that the effectiveness existing program assessed within the context the competitive status canadian firm the global economy their strategic position evolving global production and innovation network and policy intervention enhance the export performance indigenous producer and supplier recent report prepared researcher the innovation policy lab part the cdo partnership identifies some the common design funding governance and operational characteristic the german british and american technology transfer hepburn and wolfe evident that need canadian made technology transfer centre innovation hub focused the application digital technology manufacturing process part the policy development process for the development such centre need look closely the strategic area where both the catapult centre the and the nnmi the are focusing the course research being conducted one the four theme for the cdo project have come across three four initiative currently being developed private sector firm university consortium some combination the two the federal government might consider designing process that will allow build upon these initiative develop made canada solution the manufacturing challenge that many our domestic firm are facing cdo researcher working this area have proposed number related initiative which include support for accelerated introduction metallic advanced manufacturing machine community college and regional innovation centre funding for demonstration project the integration advanced manufacturing with next generation digital manufacturing process planning and quality control system support for increased community college training cadcam capacity for canadian smes and the introduction five year effort develop new canadian manufacturing software platform equivalent the european industry standard security issue the old economy government have long taken responsibility for policing justice and national defence the second economy nothing short the same required the state data hacking and other crime facilitated digital technology are now common occurrence facilitated the lack secure system and the lack enforcement across border cybersecurity for government business and household fundamental policy domain century government survey digital technology and internet use statistic canada found that approximately per cent all large firm canada saw security andor privacy concern barrier further integrating icts into their business some the cdo partner policy agenda for the digital economy page are involved with the leading consortium firm that are grappling with these security issue leading industry association such cata are also focusing some their effort the issue cybersecurity other government such germany are coordinating national effort respond this challenge through the creation the federal office for information security bsi which mandate that cross all three sector the agency the state security germany report provide valuable insight the current challenge for cybersecurity the federal government need coordinated response the issue information security that involves both leading firm and industry association the field local and regional strategy for digital innovation the final policy area that deserves mention the importance including local context perspective maximize the impact federal policy the local level the advantage adopting this approach use existing policy instrument more focused and coordinated way facilitate coordination dialogue and interaction among the constituent element especially firm the local and regional level cluster are one approach that have proven effective policy instrument fostering linkage between firm university and research institute and providing basis for firm take better advantage market opportunity they also afford the opportunity for small and mediumsized firm establish connection with larger partner and multinational firm this focus the local and regional dimension digital innovation based the recognition that canada large and diverse economy that requires policy response that are tailored this diversity and able take full advantage successful local initiative the effective implementation this approach the local and regional level requires greater degree coordination between all three level government and their respective economic development agency the adoption local and regional perspective doe not require the introduction new spending program the government but rather the implementation additional lens through which review and evaluate wide range existing program both within the department and beyond the competitiveness institute cluster policy whitebook note that cluster policy for example can cut across wide range existing policy area industry policy science and technology policy competition policy education and labour market policy and social policy andersson oecd policy initiative focused providing support for local and regional concentration firm interrelated sector not see httpswwwbsibunddeenhomehomenodehtml policy agenda for the digital economy page constitute new policy area but represent new approach synthesizing existing range policy instrument that cut across the three field the action plan for prosperity developed the coalition for action innovation canada presented very concise and focused set recommendation for series action the federal government could adopt support cluster the local and regional level the plan argued that the federal and provincial government should align their existing policy and spending support the development regional and local cluster this should include effort university college polytechnic and research institution align research and training effort meet the need existing and potential local cluster support for cluster organization can help ensure that experienced actor the private sector can assist cluster development offering advice and guidance new startup supporting the entry and growth related firm into area and consistently communicating their need local postsecondary institution and research centre the plan also recommended the creation national network share knowhow and best practice how improve cluster competitiveness and reinforce cluster development coalition for action innovation canada this network can build the considerable experience already located number key cluster organization across the country well existing national organization such the canadian digital medium network also cdo partner labour market issue one the most challenging issue address concern the question whether there sufficient supply graduate being trained work with digital technology across the economy human capital which common factor both the hardware and software sector increasingly critical input for the sector whole well key geographic concentration firm canadian postsecondary institution are well regarded for producing significant number well trained and highly qualified graduate with many the skill required for growing the digital economy but there also need introduce student career opportunity this sector much earlier stage their education number recent study have suggested that there may critical skill shortage some specific ict category and the overall number graduate may insufficient meet growing demand across the digital sector the economy cdo partner working the ict sector the economy are experiencing shortage people with ict skill specific area such software development another finding from the nordicity study ict skill the lack senior technology business and marketing manager with global skill precisely because few policy agenda for the digital economy page canadian company are reaching global scale before they are bought out nordicity association with david ticoll working with provincial counterpart imperative that federal department ensure that the future skill need the sector and key local and regional concentration industry are met the urbanrural dimension the digital economy digital technology are being adopted and used the ground city and community across the country most our economic activity based our city and their overall ecosystem including support for knowledge job creation startup and new smart solution healthcare paramount importance the overall growth the ict sector the cdo project studying how the diffusion these technology the municipal level and rural community can support their adoption and use across the economy whole one policy proposal this area design and implement initiative like the smarter city fund and companion funding the future city catapult centre one the technology transfer centre discussed above establishing smarter city fund can help position canadian firm take fuller advantage the world smart city market trillion dollar business that will continue grow rapidly for long time would also create ecosystem that support startup cluster and creates local market for wide range ict company fostering local smart city market support the development skill and solution for company then abroad and compete the trillion dollar global smart city market however canada work ensure that major city are globally competitive and can match the most innovation metropolitan centre the world must also recognize the growing innovation divide emerging with the smaller city and town taking innovation smaller community particularly northern aboriginal and rural settlement formidable challenge although there are successful centre that have capitalized improvement technological infrastructure the ubiquitous nature the internet and the opportunity for individual and small company compete internationally targeted market the search for model nonmetropolitan innovation development much developed than for major city but canada widely distributed population and unique regional culture underscore the importance identifying mean engaging all canadian the century technologydriven economy among the policy initiative that merit closer attention are the creation virtual incubator and innovation centre regional basis northern innovation thematic basis cold weather innovation with anchor institution leading the national effort policy agenda for the digital economy page government can support national lone eagle strategy based the idea that highly skilled individual are longer placebound and can work and live anywhere their economic impact smaller community can dramatic government should also work raise the profile small townruralnorthern and aboriginal innovation business development recognition the fact that digital innovation can also occur outside the major metropolitan centre finally also need undertake major quality life and work study that examines the short and longterm impact digital technology small town rural area and remote community recognizing the fact that the distribution cost and benefit digital technology differ significantly between larger urban centre and smaller community conclusion this clearly ambitious agenda lay out for any government let alone new one that face wide range pressing policy issue despite this fact would argue that the policy agenda for the digital economy must priority area for any government canada for the reason described the outset not since the first onset the industrial revolution have seen interconnected set technology with similar potential both disrupt our established industrial sector and economic pattern but also generate new economic opportunity for ourselves and future generation while some the initiative set out above require new program spending many can achieved through reallocation existing program spending refocusing the priority existing program the digital dimension the economy collaborating more closely with provincial and municipal government can also leverage existing program spending those level the effectiveness with which all three level government grasp the digital opportunity and
