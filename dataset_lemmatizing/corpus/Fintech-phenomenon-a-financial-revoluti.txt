neologism that come from the word financial and technology and indicates the connection new technology with traditional activity the financial industry gomber can find great variety definition and interpretation the academic literature varga but this paper will provide summary following the perspective the financial stability board fsb fintech technologically enabled financial innovation that could result new business model application process product service with associated material effect financial market and institution and the provision financial service fintech includes digital innovation and technologyenabled business model the financial industry and such innovation can transform the traditional industry structure improve strategic intermediation increase access financial service but also generate privacy regulatory and lawenforcement change philippon fintech includes wide range digital innovation such online marketplace lending also known online peertopeer lending equity crowdfunding roboadvice distributed ledger technology dlt cryptocurrencies and machine learning schindler ozaee and sohrabi described fintech system software and digital platform deliver financial service final consumer this sense fintech industry that refers company that try make financial solution more flexible and efficient through greater support new technology fintech company are generally technological startup which provide client with array service and strive consolidate their position the financial market competing with traditional bank and financial player darolles gomber fintech contains innovator and disruptors the financial sector that offer more flexibility efficiency and opportunity than the traditional financial intermediary fintech considered sustaining fintech when refers existing financial firm that use innovation strengthen their business disruptive fintech where startup and new company adopt compete with traditional financial firm supplying new product and service lee despite the different perspective author agree define fintech the marriage financial service and information technology arner whose aim promise more flexibility efficiency and security customer than incumbent financial institution the first part our work will follow the definition fintech provided the financial stability board since our principal aim study the dynamic and the effect the phenomenon and not fintech firm summing fintech activity can organized into five category financial service payment clearing and settlement deposit lending and capital raising iii insurance investment management and market support fsb for example the category payment involves new and innovative payment solution such mobile payment system transfer and cryptocurrencies deposit and lending activity include crowdfunding crowdlending and microcredit solution haddad and hornuf the development fintech the financial industry broader sense fintech the application technology finance but this not novelty for the financial industry arner technology and innovation have always had key role the evolution the financial sector indeed the last year represent important step forward term innovation the the credit card revolutionized the payment system the late the introduction the automatic teller machine atm replaced branch and teller the promoted the first electronic stock trading exchange trading floor during the financial institution implemented new while the brought internet and ecommerce business model ozaee and sohrabi even though financial player have always looked for and adopted new solution best satisfy their client the wave financial and technological innovation the last decade caused important change the financial landscape concerning not only product and service but also regulatory issue eba understand how and why fintech today influence financial player and market fundamental summarize the evolution this phenomenon the process fintech evolution arner tried understand how fintech established itself the financial market and what factor drove development the author distinguished three phase fintech evolution specifying that the term fintech doe not refer only specific sector business model but entail all service and product offered incumbent financial institution the first stage fintech and allowed the transition from analogue industry digital one new technology developed during the century facilitated the transmission financial information transaction and payment across border the technological innovation this period favoured the establishment modern infrastructure which increased the global interconnection financial institution varga marked the beginning new era characterized the globalization and digitalisation financial process based electronic transaction between financial player and their customer around the world financial institution began adopt computerized trading system bank developed infrastructure for internal operation and relationship with their retail client and new regulatory standard were drawn face new risk the financial industry with the emergence internet most bank fully digitized internal process and relation with outsider and retail customer even though the innovation occurred during this era initially regarded disruptive represented the birth modern banking varga based infrastructure branchfocused business model and advanced technological system with the internet evolution the technological advance transformed the nature the financial service industry and led the development electronic finance efinance which refers many financial service such banking and stock trading performed through electronic mean lee and shin the mobile finance asserted itself during the thanks important innovation the smartphone user base and this facilitated the emergence new service such mobile payment and mobile banking that are extension efinance the innovation introduced the two last decade favoured the success fintech especially after the worldwide crisis combining efinance internet technology artificial intelligence and big data analytics until fintech included traditional regulated financial player that provided financial service and product using new technology after the global financial crisis new startup and established technology company emerged the financial industry which began offer financial solution and service directly business and final customer since the global financial crisis represented the turning point for the growth fintech decide briefly discus the consequence the crisis that accelerated the development and the success fintech the financial industry the role the financial crisis the development fintech the financial crisis only one the factor that caused significant change the banking and financial sector nicoletti underlined darolles the financial crisis had strong influence both the regulation the traditional financial institution and the trust client their bank since the crisis revealed systemic risk the activity traditional player postcrisis reform reinforced the regulatory framework mainly for bank the consequence the crisis were amplified the failing the banking sector such excessive leverage lowquality and inadequate capital and insufficient liquidity buffer bcbs therefore the banking system not able absorb the resulting loss and the financial crisis transferred the rest the financial industry and the real economy causing significant reduction credit and liquidity availability the basel committee banking supervision bcbs decided intervene after the financial crisis increase the bank ability absorb shock and reduce risk spillover from the financial sector the real economy the postcrisis reform have been referred basel iii whose main aim concern stronger capital and liquidity regulation mixed with improvement bank supervision risk management greater transparency and disclosure for bcbs fundamental restore the health the banking system the centre the credit intermediation process between saver and investor and provides wide range financial service customer smes large company and government bcbs the effect the financial crisis were strong since the global banking system faced the crisis with insufficient level highquality capital for this reason the new regulation redefines the bank capital focusing common equity which considered the highest quality component bank capital the regulatory capital comprises tier capital made common equity tier cet and additional tier and tier capital the new rule introduced new restriction for these category minimum cet ratio riskweighted asset all time with conservation buffer all form capital tier capital must least riskweighted asset all time and the total capital tier tier must least riskweighted asset all time bcbs cosimano and hakura since the bcbs considered the inadequate liquidity the financial system one the main culprit the crisis decided implement the liquidity coverage ratio lcr shortterm measure verify whether bank have enough liquidity meet expected future outflow within day period mcnamara particular the aim the lcr guarantee that bank own sufficient highquality liquidity asset hqla survive day stress scenario and the timeline established the bcbs imposed bank achieve lcr january and lcr january during the financial crisis bank were forced reduce their excessive balance sheet leverage and this caused additional downward pressure asset price and contraction credit availability hence the basel committee decided introduce simple and nonrisk based leverage ratio constrain the increase leverage the banking sector avoiding deleveraging process that can damage the financial system and the economy and reinforce the risk based requirement bcbsb consequence basel iii the banking sector are the subject many debate the literature cosimano and hakura some author admati argued that higher capital requirement can generate significant benefit reducing leverage and the risk bankruptcy the banking sector increasing bank equity allows limit systemic risk event because bank are required fund themselves with more equity than they did before the financial crisis addition the author demonstrate that the social cost rising capital requirement are very small for large financial institution the other side arner asserted that the greater rigidity the new regulation increased the compliance obligation bank and modified their incentive and business structure basel iii also reduced the capacity bank provide lowvalue loan with damage especially smes private individual who usually choose new player innovation fund themselves spinassou showed that the capital requirement imposed basel iii reduce the credit supply without guaranteeing improvement the financial stability and that the higher leverage ratio introduced since induces bank prefer risky project safe one cosimano and hakura focused their analysis the impact new capital requirement basel iii the behaviour bank developed country from the result suggested that the new standard determine higher loan rate and slower loan growth even bank reaction vary from one economy another one considering the crosscountry variation bank net cost raising equity and the elasticity loan demand with respect change loan rate even though the main goal basel iii defeat the weakness the banking and the financial sector bank reduced their activity since they were obliged keep greater reserve and they are still considered the public opinion the real responsible for the financial crisis darolles financial crisis also changed the public perception the banking system arner the author underlined the effect the financial crisis the labour market focusing two set individual firstly many financial professional either lost their job were well remunerated after the financial crisis and consequently most this underutilized educated workforce been admitted the new industry fintech the other hand the financial crisis indirectly damaged the newer generation that are facing many difficulty the labour market even though their education and skill are line with fintech innovation especially younger generation have lost their faith bank since the financial player were not able manage their risk during the financial crisis and they avoided the bankruptcy only thanks significant injection public money darolles finally several study pointed out that the loss confidence financial institution mainly the part european and american consumer accompanied substantial increase confidence financial service provided technological institution fujitsu this attitude bolster the acceptance fintech innovation especially among the young the expense traditional provider financial service the driver fintech demand and supply factor after analysing the historical evolution fintech focus the main driver and determinant this phenomenon understand why exploding right now the financial sector schindler adopted demand and supply framework financial innovation that then applied the definition fintech the supply side factor starting the supply side supply driver represent what lead someone provide new product service the financial market this category can find continuous technological progress regulatory environment revolutionary innovation and the macroeconomic landscape kerenyi and molnar analysed above technology always played key role the evolution the financial sector atm internet efinance online banking and mobile payment have been important technology advance representing great breakthrough the financial innovation technological innovation could have material impact the structure the financial system term concentration contestability and composition fsb decrease concentration generally associated with greater competition lower market power player and lower price technology reduces concentration when allows new nontraditional service provider compete with incumbent and offer good service that overcome the existing regulation considering contestability technology may reduce cost for new entrant and facilitate their access technology however the consequence the reduction the incumbent pricing power finally technology may favour the unbundling financial service leading change the composition service provider and great amount activity that are not subject the regulatory framework financial innovation often driven also regulation which comprises change regulatory and supervisory requirement underlined above the cause and consequence the financial crisis induced regulator improve the previous set rule with great impact the business incentive incumbent and new player fbs increasing the rigidity the requirement for the banking sector bank reduced lowvalue loan and were forced move away from shortterm funding schindler now bank must comply with stricter standard whose aim protect the financial intermediary system and the consumer from another financial meltdown kerenyi and molnar since the new regulation damaged the ability bank meet the need all type customer this favoured the emergence new financial player that took the place incumbent providing financial product and service client and business many case innovation creates turn another innovation which trigger innovation spiral leading natural sequence innovation schindler this sense innovation can interpreted supply factor because allows the emergence another innovation innovation can revolutionary when transforms the market condition and feature radical way kerenyi and molnar considering the fintech sector the distributed ledger technology dlt example disruptive innovation that deeply modifies payment clearing and settlement process mill dtls allow their user collect and access information relating given set asset and their holder shared database which can used settle the transfer security and cash without the need central ledger authority pinna and ruttenberg this technology executes large number realtime transaction rapidly reducing the operating cost payment and especially crossborder money transfer kerenyi and molnar financial innovation usually driven change the financial and macroeconomic landscape schindler the author stated that the collapse the american housing market the eve the crisis caused significant rise the quantity real estate owned bank and financial institution this situation encouraged many financial player securitize the rental income from the real estate they owned this led important innovation the financial sector since would more difficult for financial institution create such product without the collapse the housing market which left them with lot real estate considering the macroeconomic landscape the increase the number fintech player been favoured also the low interest rate environment caused the international financial crisis kerenyi and molnar after the financial meltdown the result the implementation active monetary police with cut interest rate and the introduction quantitative easing measure although the stricter and riskaverse regulation introduced after the crisis reduced the instability the financial system several country especially europe become more difficult fund and support innovation and initiative therefore the innovation that characterize fintech often come from new market player startup technology company which are not subject that regulation zilgalvis the demand side factor considering the demand side financial player can create and offer lot product and service but there necessary condition for their success there should sufficient market demand for these product consumer habit and preference are the first demand driver for financial innovation consumer and company habit have changed with the evolution technology and the penetration internet not only their everyday life but also how bank conduct their activity kerenyi and molnar customer are now looking for more convenient tailored and faster financial solution than the past and they expect immediate access financial service that are line with the rest their online activity wilkins the customer base fintech service composed mainly younger generation that have developed different habit from their elder younger people require personalised solution that are strong contrast with the traditional approach bank and other financial institution which are prone offer product for the mass market darolles addition younger generation are more comfortable using latest technology and for this reason they represent the targeted customer fintech company despite the success fintech solution among youngers financial incumbent are aware that they should satisfy their demand with more innovative and interactive product and service schindler besides demographic schindler recognized that regulation act both supply factor and demand driver since can contribute demand for new product and service prove this hypothesis the author focused the liquidity coverage ratio lcr which requires bank hold adequate stock highquality liquidity asset hqla meet their liquidity need within day period bcbs bank issued bond another instrument that coming due within day the bank must hold hqlas cover the impending outflow from the author perspective this creates demand for product that not lead the implementation the lcr one these product the callable commercial paper commercial paper typically includes shortterm promissory note issued corporation other issuer fund future operation case commercial paper bank provide backup liquidity facility the issuer which can drown upon them repay maturing issue commercial paper the issuer are not able sell new issue commercial paper process called rolling over the issuer draw upon the backup facility during the day period lcr the new regulation introduced basel iii imposes the facility provider maintain corresponding hqla the consequence lcr increase the cost bank providing backup liquidity facility for commercial paper that mature day avoid such draw occurring within the day lcr window bank developed commercial paper that include call provision allowing issuer redeem the commercial paper before the start the day period therefore commercial paper redeemed before reach maturity day then the issuer the commercial paper can not draw upon the liquidity facility within day and consequently bank not need maintain any hqla support the facility mcnamara this case the regulation basel iii that introduced the lcr created demand for new product the part issuer commercial paper and induced someone bank supply the new product the emergence fintech company the first part this paragraph analysed the main driver the fintech phenomenon considering demand and supply side even many study also focus factor which favoured the emergence fintech company haddad and hornuf examined the main economic and technological determinant that explain the formation and the success fintech startup which are categorized into nine different type those that operate financing payment asset management insurance insurtechs loyalty program risk management exchange regulatory technology regtech and other business activity the study focus fintech startup formation country between and and based four main hypothesis first the author supposed that welldeveloped economy and capital market facilitate the formation fintech startup indeed these startup need enough financing start and carry their business model and the traditional capital market are welldeveloped entrepreneur have better access the necessary resource fund their business addition more advanced economy more likely that individual require innovative service and new financial tool especially within large financial market which offer greater possibility change through innovation and digitalization second driver the availability the latest technology the economy already analysed for the fintech phenomenon technological advance are fundamental prerequisite introduce new solution and disrupt the traditional financial sector fintech company need technological innovation satisfy new customer need implementing faster payment system and offering easier operation improve the sharing information and reduce the cost banking transaction encourage the supply fintech solution latest technology need accompanied supporting infrastructure that should already available the economy the country the third factor fintechs formation relates the nature the financial sector the financial crisis played key role the sudden upsurge fintech startup for several reason the lack trust bank after the crisis benefitted fintechs which interrupted the vicious circle distrust and reduced financial soundness the financial meltdown also increased the cost debt for many smes and many case bank stopped lending money business while many fintech startup the area crowdlending and crowdfunding were able fill this gap therefore the demand for fintech service should higher country which were more strongly hit the financial crisis and where the banking sector sound lastly the author considered the role credit labour market and regulation fintechs formation the author observed that economy should adopt supportive regulatory regime attract entrepreneur and promote the emergence startup furthermore individual are more prone establish new business there are significant restriction how the credit supplied the private sector and control interest rate that interfere with the credit market the author also tried understand how the feature the labour market can affect fintech startup first economy should allow market force determine wage and condition that startup can find talented individual and easily hire and fire employee indeed large bureaucratic cost and complicated administrative requirement might prevent any new business activity following the report ernst young the fintech ecosystem based many attribute among which there are talent and entrepreneurial availability country with large workforce skilled talent more positive influence the emergence fintech company analysing all these aspect the author concluded that fintech startup are more frequent country and region with more supportive regulation and larger labour market despite the great success fintech startup they are not the only one that operate the fintech sector kerenyi and molnar indeed the recent year many large nonbank company have started offering financial service that once were prerogative traditional financial institution technology company have become the most successful fintech company since they can overcome entry barrier the banking market thanks their feature they have large customer base the adequate infrastructure and solid reputation although most technology company provide their existing customer with online and mobile payment system for example google wallet apple pay and amazon payment some them take part also lending activity opportunity and challenge fintech fintech very complex movement that includes both technological innovation applied financial service and fintech company that provide innovative financial service considering the double nature fintech will examine benefit and challenge both the general phenomenon and company operating the fintech sector since both have the potential reshape and the same disrupt the existing financial sector benefit fintech the financial industry financial innovation arise solution market inefficiency imperfection and they provide benefit improving least one inefficiency henderson and pearson starting from the upside fintech seek globalize simple financial service improving financial inclusion especially developing and emerging country where the financial service are not yet widespread increase financial inclusion fintech offer simple financial product and service thanks new instrument and technology with respect traditional incumbent which generally adopt mass market approach fintech may entail benefit for customer through improved quality and user experience more tailored product easier access financial service and cheaper financial solution eba utilizing big data fintech analysis individual customer preference and offer personalised tool and solution nakaso indeed fintech company pay more attention customer specific need and attitude because the final decision client that are looking for interactive and flexible service according their want ozaee and sohrabi fintech can generate efficiency also for credit and other financial institution cost reduction faster provision service increase customer number thank greater financial inclusion and lower regulatory compliance cost eba fintech company decrease banking cost due brick and mortar branch complex procedure and severe industry regulation since fintech disrupters are not constrained rigid regulation legacy system branch network like traditional financial player are ozaee and sohrabi moreover fintech company can meet mainly smes loan application that many case bank are obliged refuse because stricter standard imposed after the financial crisis this possible most fintech lending company use alternative data and way assessing credit risk increasing credit availability for consumer smaller younger profitable and minorityowned business that previously were underserved jagtiani and lemieux some fintech lender have developed their own algorithm and online lending platform which include nonconventional information sale data shipping data cash flow analysis from business checking account evaluate the credit risk the borrower fintech lender have access nontraditional information which are not used not available traditional bank lender such fico score which estimate the credit worthiness considering payment history current level indebtedness type credit used length credit history and new credit account and dti debttoincome ratio all these innovation favour more stable credit landscape and allow fintech firm avoid two basic risk banking activity mismatched maturity and leverage ozaee and sohrabi indeed bank act financial intermediary they take deposit provide loan borrower and liquidity depositor fractionalreserve banking even these function may cause bank run which sometimes triggered crisis the past nakaso fintech company not accept deposit case online lending platform they simply match borrower and saver directly broader sense fintech can benefit the financial industry through the provision new service and business model the rise market transparency and improvement the efficiency information exchange eba conclusion fintech revolution significantly modified the financial industry and the activity traditional financial player transformed business model financial intermediation and customer access new solution provides new financial product and service with higher level personalization thanks the application big data analytics iii fintech company substituted some traditional bank activity and deliver their service through new and more attractive nonbanking channel gomber risk and challenge fintech the financial industry despite the benefit fintech innovation they also bring new issue regarding payment and settlement nakaso firstly fintech may introduce significant change the structure settlement and other financial service already mentioned dlt one the most revolutionary innovation introduced fintech and emergence can significantly affect the traditional settlement structure based centralized bookkeeper since dlt promotes decentralizationoriented technology increasing automation could guarantee greater efficiency and certainty but the same time could increase financial volatility which may only shortterm create procyclical dynamic wilkins the digital transformation finance increased the potential for cyberattacks most innovation are founded digitisation interconnected system and the sharing data across wider set party eba fintech technology and network are becoming accessible especially through open gateway such internet and smartphones and this increase the need strengthen appropriate measure against cyber threat nakaso therefore cybersecurity system are hacked there will rise operational legal and reputational issue and financial loss for institution and this may weaken longterm trust new solution leading lower adoption rate eba worst there might wave coordinated attack causing liquidity squeeze the financial market and threatening the solvency financial player darolles the fintech process made the financial industry more vulnerable attack and cybersecurity the clearest example how fintech need regulation arner fintech initiative have generated important challenge regarding regulation and traditional financial player behaviour relative technology adoption nicoletti although are going discus the relationship between fintech and regulation next page have already underlined that many fintech activity and company emerge and operate outside the traditional regulatory framework the one side this favour more flexibility greater speed and lower compliance cost for fintechs the other side make more difficult for regulator monitor these activity and there lower level coordination among financial service fintech company and regulatory official nicoletti the evolution fintech created some challenge for traditional financial player relative the digital transformation promoted fintech evolution incumbent have only few possible strategic solution compete with newcomer darolles fintech company have competitive advantage thanks the adoption innovation while financial player try fast adopter merler expanding the technical skill their team and encouraging their staff adopt new working method and procedure this might also imply the purchase financial product and service from fintech firm directly the acquisition fintech startup even this last solution rare traditional financial player seem hostile merge new entity with their existing infrastructure although the acquisition could bring important advantage traditional incumbent another solution the collaboration with fintech company develop new service and move traditional client relationship towards more interactive and tailored system darolles the collaboration may benefit both fintech company and traditional financial player indeed sell their service fintechs need partner who know how operate the financial industry and incumbent turn can provide their product third party unbranded form this solution adopted traditional financial player create tie with fintechs and exploit their distribution channel and customer base this new model incumbent operate product design platform selling unbranded solution fintechs and becoming more capable satisfying change user need the only risk with this model that fintech company which have direct relationship with client might bypass the platform supplying the financial product despite risk and challenge the lack fintech innovation would lead risk technology complacency and obsolescence relative other country nicoletti without technological advance financial institution might lose their competitive advantage and therefore their financial environment might become noncompetitive the global financial market some author try investigate the effect fintech also relation the real economy term economic growth gdp per caput and industry volatility beck assessed the relationship between financial innovation and economic growth and volatility analysing set country over the last decade the author found that higher financial innovation lead stronger growth opportunity for country and higher gdp per caput growth higher financial innovation associated with higher growth industry that rely more external financing iii higher level financial innovation cause higher growth volatility among industry which rely more external funding addition the author underlined that the relationship between financial innovation and real economy also depends the feature the market environment the financial structure and the regulatory framework for example the positive effect might stronger marketbased financial system than banksbased financial system indeed the first one are more prone stimulate financial innovation completing financial market and exacerbating negative effect the second one are more focus the innovation the retail sector improving customer experience through new product and service concerning the regulatory framework have already discussed the consequence that the tightening bank regulation after had the evolution financial innovation the one hand more restrictive requirement increased bank difficulty and limited the possibility innovate the other hand they facilitated the success fintech solution giving bank more incentive innovate their turn the result this study confirmed that there are both bright and dark side financial innovation since encourages stronger economic development but the same time turn out into higher volatility industry which benefit more from financial innovation since finance strong connection with economy the positive effect fintech the financial industry also spread the real economy sector nakaso fintech innovation stimulate and improve financial inclusion which turn positive impact economy people have access new financial service they have the opportunity expand innovative business such ecommerce and elearning which developing country are hindered the limited access payment service therefore fintech contributes economic development with new financial service and opportunity even developed country more difficult quantitatively ass the impact fintech the economy because the high level technological innovation fintech and financial stability fintech might have significant implication the financial industry term financial stability underlined the financial stability board fsb fintech can either support undermine financial stability indeed innovation could guarantee more efficient provision financial service and reduction financial friction but the same time they could intensify existing difficulty introduce new one the main benefit financial stability first include decentralisation and diversification which can curb the consequence financial meltdown some circumstance specially developing country financial market diversity necessary condition for financial stability indeed the failure single financial institution weaker influence the market since there would other provider the same financial service efficiency operation also provides support financial stability since favour stable business model financial institution and creates advantage term overall efficiency the financial system and the real economy third factor that contribute greater financial stability transparency reduces information asymmetry and allows ass and price risk more accurately securitisations are example modern financial innovation the opacity securitisations considered many scholar one the main issue which led the financial crisis generating severe agency problem loan underwriting screening and monitoring reduce the opacity both the and the adopted new regulation that impose more assetlevel transparency for many type assetbacked security ertan demonstrated that new standard especially europe have encouraged securitized loan better quality term lower default probability lower delinquent amount and lower loss upon default moreover transparency stimulates the creation financial instrument with exposure specific risk completing market and increasing market participant ability manage risk the last benefit fintech financial stability represented the access and the convenience financial service have already discussed that for example fintech credit increase the availability credit mainly for household and smes who are generally underserved traditional financial player besides the access financial service fintech innovation also improves financial inclusion providing new technology and instrument therefore access and convenience financial service are two fundamental condition for supporting sustainable economic growth and providing diversification exposure investment risk the fsb also analysis the factor that could undermine the financial stability separating microfinancial risk and macrofinancial risk microfinancial risk are those that make individual firm financial market institution sector particularly vulnerable shock and they include both financial source and operational source example financial source are maturity mismatch liquidity mismatch and leverage which expose the counterpart loss operational source refer governance process control issue which can lead disruption the provision financial service critical infrastructure cyber risk which can damage the protection data and the integrity system causing financial loss for institution iii legal and regulatory risk which can negatively affect the confidence the system leading reputational issue macrofinancial risk refer weakness which could amplify shock the financial system and consequently impair the financial stability potential risk include contagion which the possibility that distress suffered single financial institution sector could influence other institution sector the financial market causing decrease confidence those institution sector procyclicality which refers the natural tendency financial variable fluctuate around trend during the economic cycle landau and which can threaten financial stability when market participant action exacerbate the degree and impact fluctuation economic growth and market price over longer term iii excess volatility arising when the financial system overreacts news causing solvency liquidity problem which can impair the functioning asset and credit market especially case homogeneity business model systemic importance entity that are considered too important and too big fail may lead moral hazard because they generally operate outside the current regulatory perimeter and they never take banklike risk maturity transformation and leverage addition they may compromise the competition with other service provider since they are considered systemically important for the financial industry wilkins implication fintech credit financial stability this paper define fintech credit all credit activity facilitated electronic online platform which match borrower and saver directly and process large amount customer information since fintech credit activity play important role and generated significant interest financial market the fsb also analysis the effect fintech credit financial stability the fintech credit activity grown fast over the last year even follows different path across different jurisdiction claessens china the largest market considering data referred followed united state and united kingdom distance after the rapid growth the evolution fintech credit suffered slowdown many major jurisdiction even though fintech credit market have experienced rapid expansion recent year their size remains small relative credit provided traditional financial intermediary the actual small size fintech credit limit direct influence financial stability however this sector were supposed increase would bring both benefit and risk for the financial stability merler the most important advantage fintech credit the improvement financial inclusion which allows investor obtain alternative product and borrower with limited access bankintermediated credit receive the necessary funding fintech may also reduce transaction cost including search cost and cost incurred during loan origination and maintenance process thanks the digitalisation lending process and the introduction new lending technology the decrease transaction cost could lead lower lending cost and better riskadjusted return for investor however fundamental ass whether fintech lender are able transform lower lending cost advantage for their borrower term lower price jagtiani and lemieux indeed philippon found that the unit cost financial intermediation declined only marginally after the crisis despite the significant evolution fintech the creation innovative lending platform may also encourage the diversification credit source the economy they provide alternative solution that are more suitable for smaller firm and final consumer the greater diversity credit provision can benefit the traditional banking sector specific circumstance where fintech credit platform act spare tyre for lending the economy fact fintech offer new option and solution through which credit can flow other part the economy traditional lending not available this sense fintech credit increase the efficiency incumbent merler and some jurisdiction government use fintech credit platform stimulate credit market after banking crisis the same time many advantage fintech are linked potential risk fintech increase accessibility credit for many category customer but with the threat deterioration lending standard sahay identified bellshaped relationship between credit inclusion and bank stability country with weaker bank supervision the negative effect greater credit access bank buffer more pronounced while country with high level supervisory quality credit inclusion positively associated with higher bank buffer the author concluded that the impact broadening credit access bank stability depends the quality the supervision and they underlined the need for strong supervision improve financial inclusion through credit fintech credit may also lead more procyclical credit provision like reduction lending condition during economic upswing and pullback credit case financial distress significant pullback fintech credit generates systemic risk concerning the availability substitute form credit either through other online lending platform traditional financial intermediary considering the small size fintech credit most country difficult for borrower find alternative fintech credit platform quickly and for this reason barrier existing platform offering different type lending are not high traditional financial intermediary rarely supply credit certain borrower such very small selfemployed business therefore unlikely that fintech lending will promptly replaced from solution outside the fintech credit industry moreover fintech lending company are more prone help investor with herd behaviour and more volatile credit risk appetite even fintech lending platform may more exposed than bank some microfinancial risk due their greater use untested and digital process financial stability could also undermined the securitisation fintech credit obligation into large pool this process allows borrower obtain funding from different class institutional investor and fintech investment actively traded however increased use securitisation may cause some financial stability risk firstly this process rise the connection between fintech platform traditional bank and capital market therefore the continuous expansion fintech credit market can generate new channel through which risk the fintech credit sector are transmitted the wider financial system and vice versa secondly securitisations fintech credit obligation can bring greater opacity the overall market due the bundling and tranching loan obligation indeed many fintech credit activity have emerged outside the regulatory perimeter with consequent difficulty for authority monitoring and managing regulation fintech one the main issue concerning fintech evolution connected the regulation this recent phenomenon the global financial crisis induced regulator strengthen the existing rule and introduce new requirement especially the financial and banking sector favouring the evolution fintech activity and company fintech generally emerges and operates outside the regulatory perimeter and the nontraditional product and service offered fintech company may not observe the traditional financial regulation arner for this reason becomes more difficult for regulator monitor and evaluate fintech activity difficulty regulating fintech regulator objective about financial industry are financial stability prudential regulation conduct and fairness competition and market development arner before elaborating suitable regulation supervisor need analyse the benefit and the applicability technology the introduction new technology fintech doe not always imply that will widely adopted and that will subject new rule since fintech emerging player are growing fast and they are threatening traditional incumbent regulator need intervene adjusting their method and rule best support fintech considering the significant change financial and banking sector over the last decade there are two main risk that regulator need avoid darolles first regulator should prevent overprotecting incumbent creating high entry barrier for newcomer indeed excessive regulation can stifle financial innovation and competition regulator also need favour new fintech player with rigid regulation than incumbent with respect traditional financial player newcomer are generally not constrained severe requirement and rule introduced after the global financial crisis even this may cause the lack information protection and issue security regulator decision have both direct and indirect influence the competition between incumbent and new player the financial market the main goal the regulatory framework guarantee parity for all financial agent and the same time promote innovative competitive and secure financial market regulation should guarantee equal treatment and competition among all player for the soundness the financial industry moreover rulesetters also need focus the incentive offered market agent and how these can influence the behaviour and the decision player darolles suggested creating harmonised set rule and avoiding different regulation for different category player since this would break the financial market and interfere with the emergence new player and with the evolution financial innovation fintech innovation brings both benefit and challenge for the financial market but interest are not always line with the longterm goal regulator philippon fintech company generally enter the market where their activity can profitable although there are many sector where the incumbent presence deepseated and entry difficult these case the aim the regulation actively encourage entry and guarantee level playing field among traditional and new financial player nevertheless real market the argument level playing field elaborated darolles fundamental goal for regulator doe not apply due main bias the financial sector the principle level playing field not coherent when incumbent are toobigto fail and applies only when newcomer carry out the same activity traditional player but with more efficiency lower cost philippon for regulator challenge find right regulation framework for new fintech activity the financial industry includes both incumbent and newcomer and should dynamic fitting continuous change the size and activity business arner for fintech startup regulation may too expensive compliance cost licence application and incompatible with their lean business model for emerging new player would better apply principlebased regulatory regime which includes more flexible compliance obligation with respect rulebased regime both regime have advantage and disadvantage for fintech company principlebased regime guarantee more flexibility especially for earlystage firm but the same time creates uncertainty term compliance and limitation term scalability for more mature business rulebased regime clearly defines rule and process giving right incentive the supervised entity but lead higher compliance cost and greater complexity suitable option for fintech startup might combination both regime since the principlebased system allows company more flexible and dynamic while the rulebased one make fintechs more attractive investor and creates barrier entry for subsequent new competitor regulator face difficult task finding balance between incumbent interest and the need control the emergence new financial player darolles the one hand authority tend impose stricter and tighter rule existing player since they know their business and goal the other hand they tend more lenient with market entrant which conduct new activity and provide new service whose risk are still not fully understood right regulation should permit incumbent survive favour financial innovation and promote healthy competition and reach these goal some author suggests principle and guideline for rulessetters darolles argued that regulation should encourage healthy competition among player whether they implement new technology offer traditional solution and remove all obstacle growth for new entrant moreover the regulation framework should not make any difference among player but cover all them simultaneously regardless their characteristic activity principle level playing field lastly the main aim regulator should the protection user the financial system which can continuously cause new and unexpected risk fintech involves risk and challenge regulator need focus the downside this phenomenon defending user financial service and the stability the financial system discussed above one the main risk fintech the increase cyberattacks due the greater use online service online platform and technology for regulator the main obstacle the lack historical case and data about cyberrisks and they not know how evaluate and regulate these risk the only solution for authority identify plausible attack scenario and test their consequence fintech business regulator need become expertise this field fulfil their role another risk that regulator need face the outsourcing some task within financial transaction traditional player decide collaborate with fintech player they generally offload some traditional activity task onto external service provider especially the case job with high technological content this way traditional financial player reduce cost pressure and fintech company are more efficient since they are better able use new technology the issue that the transaction split between traditional regulated financial player and fintech company that are not necessarily subject specific requirement and this cause breach the supervision system lastly authority need focus and supervise the use big data analytics that might bring negative consequence for user financial service nicoletti regulator should guarantee that data collection not damage the privacy user and that personal information about customer not used discriminatory tool the rise regtech since the fintech process introduced significant change the financial industry authority were induced combine the traditional objective financial stability and consumer protection with the goal growth and financial innovation arner the outcome process regulatory innovation which includes technology regtech and change existing regulatory framework such the introduction regulatory sandbox regtech the contraction regulation technology and indicates system new technological application artificial intelligence machine learning and distributed ledger used comply with stricter and more complex regulation the financial industry allen and berg regtech offer continuous monitoring capacity providing close realtime insight and seek identify problem advance rather than take measure after the fact arner the emergence regtech attributable the complex fragmented and everevolving postcrisis financial regulatory regime which cause higher compliance and supervision cost for the regulator and the supervised entity technological advance which can improve data management and analysis such new cryptographic technology blockchain robotics and application programming interface apis iif iii the need financial institution reduce compliance cost and the goal supervisor strengthen competition and guarantee financial stability and market integrity regtech cover three complementary group participant firstly financial player who apply new technology meet new requirement and standard arising from postcrisis regulation secondly regulator who face the rapid emergence fintech company and technology and need use regtech conform with new challenge and task mentioned above regulator have double goal they need protect user financial service and the financial stability without hindering financial development and innovation lastly policymakers and regulator who need create the necessary infrastructure meet change the financial system and support their new regulation this implies increasing use and reliance regtech which allows financial institution comply with rule and authority understand innovative product and complex transaction like fintech regtech offer both opportunity and risk the application new technology regulatory framework allows reduce compliance cost shorten bureaucratic procedure and provide more flexibility and dynamism fintech company however regtech often requires significant investment due the use new instrument and procedure moreover although regtech contributes increasing the efficiency regulatory compliance this doe not necessarily imply reduction the overall burden regulation since compliance only small part the red tape burden allen and berg lastly there still uncertainty the market about the usefulness and success these new technology that can used reduce the complexity rule but whose future evolution and development might impeded regulation another novelty the regulation fintech represented regulatory sandbox that enable innovative financial player check the feasibility their new financial product service and business model within test environment with the exemption from regulatory obligation ykiss sandbox allow startup and incumbent conduct the test under real market circumstance for specific time and involving limited number real customer company that are admitted regulatory sandbox need follow specific procedure satisfy certain condition for getting into the test firstly the innovative product service presented the entity should have element novelty for the consumer and client secondly the entity should meet the requirement market entry the test positive result then the innovation can enter the market regulatory sandbox are set authority promote competition and efficiency through innovation and improve the relationship between supervisor and financial service provider jenik and lauer arner underlined that the main market objective for sandbox are reduce timetomarket potentially lower cost fintech startup can operate without complete licensing obligation provide better access finance and foster more innovative product until now the end the framework regulatory sandbox not widely applied yet the first country introducing this innovation united kingdom followed about ten country asia and middle east europe only the netherlands and switzerland are adopting specific and dedicated regulatory sandbox even the european union level more initiative are evolving and focusing fintech challenge implication fintech for bank and banking system the first chapter this work described the main activity benefit and risk fintech phenomenon and fintech company our analysis show that traditional bank are particularly threatened fintech which may cause the disaggregation bank value chain boot fintech startup mainly focus retail banking lending and payment system mckinsey and they have developed new technology and instrument such peertopeer lending platform online crowdfunding market roboadvisors and machine learning tool which allow understand and satisfy customer need for tailored cheaper and easier use financial solution lending platform provide credit without bank intermediation matching borrower and lender directly when customer and firm invest small business smes younger business these platform reduce intermediation cost and evaluate the credit risk borrower applying algorithm and big data analytics and using nonconventional information about customer vives payment are important area fintech characterized significant development even bank still maintain their leader position boot traditional payment system may disrupted digital currency such bitcoin vives digital currency are generated using blockchain technology where transaction can verified with block record without any intermediary bank intermediary function these system facilitate the introduction many potential costsaving innovation and they allow generate new currency without the backing government trustworthy gobetween blockchain technology considered one the biggest disruption the financial industry since increase transparency transaction and provides mechanism which protect customer privacy bussmann lastly traditional function bank may also hampered roboadvisors and machine learning tool which provide investment advice and avoid some the usual conflict interest between customer and human advisor roboadvice fintech innovation which challenging the traditional financial advisory service kaya roboadvice offer online investment guidance and portfolio management service based algorithm and model find optimal investment strategy for client roboadvisors are fully automated online platform that provide customer with digital finance advice and portfolio allocation furthermore fintech company represent the major competitor traditional bank because they not have comply with severe regulation opposed traditional incumbent who must deal with stricter requirement bussmann fintechs operate with more agility and they face lower compliance cost and this enables them offer cheaper and faster financial product with respect newcomer traditional bank are still trapped lot red tape even they strive invest heavily technology and use more than the past compete with new entrant and survive the new financial industry technological innovation have double effect traditional bank the one hand incumbent adopt new technology cut cost improve the quality their product and more attentive customer need the other hand innovation reduces traditional barrier entry the credit and financial service market increasing the competition with fintech company which offer technologyintensive and lowcost solution panetta although fintech startup are growing fast and they undermine traditional financial institution they also represent opportunity for incumbent and mainly for bank revolutionize their business model and offer more specific value proposition indeed fintechs and bank can benefit from collaboration partnership because both have valuable asset and capability share juengerkes fintechs are techdriven apply innovative technology are not bound legacy system and provide personalised financial solution bank have larger customer base offer regulated product and service and add their industry expertise and know how there are several motif that induce bank and fintechs create alliance klus collaborating with incumbent financial player allows fintech company enlarge their customer base increase their financial knowledge improve trust and credibility and obtain access banking license which some case would too expensive for startup alone the other hand bank might outsource some activity their partner gain rapid innovation thanks fintechs technological advance and secure competitive advantage since fintech firm develop innovative way provide financial service although the financial crisis undermined consumer confidence the banking industry and fintech company threat the function and activity the banking system bank are still considered safe place for people investment and money boot conclusion traditional bank adopt new technology and innovation compete with fintech newcomer and preserve financial stability despite the limit imposed the severe regulation fintech startup may threat the banking system since they offer tailored financial service that meet customer preference and need they provide more flexible and dynamic financial solution thanks the lighter regulation iii they operate the same market traditional bank also reaching customer and business underserved incumbent and they have taken over function and activity previously assigned only bank new fintech instrument for the banking sector although fintech exacerbates competition the financial market can also provide instrument and method bank manage high cost and regulatory and market pressure which came after the financial crisis bussmann first seek understand which fintech innovation are more adopted and known user which are not only final customer but also bank and other financial institution for this purpose refer study which analysis the fintech adoption australia canada hong kong singapore the and the gulamhuseinwala the fintech adoption measured through the fintech adoption index considering four main category saving and investment money transfer and payment borrowing and insurance money transfer and payment online foreign exchange nonbanks transfer money have the highest adoption rate followed saving and investment peertopeer platform equity reward crowdfunding online investment advice insurance and borrowing fintech lending online marketplace focusing the relationship between fintech and the traditional bank the most disruptive innovation for the banking sector have emerged payment lending and crowdbased financing reported mckinsey since the aim this work analyse the implication fintech for the banking system decide examine the main innovation these sector and analyse whether they bring concrete benefit bank weaken their longhand position payment system traditional payment system involve many agent instrument institution and process which generally imply high cost and great complexity change technological advance and innovation have always characterized payment system aiming improving the nature process the customer interest gomber the current payment landscape threatened the entry nonbank digital player the modernization payment infrastructure the reduction crossborder payment inefficiency and the digitization retail banking transaction mckinsey nonbank digital player are entering the payment system increasing competition for bank taking away important customer relationship and reducing margin domestic transaction while favouring electronic payment instead cash and check bank also need conform new product digital channel and technology introduced nonbank player compete effectively with them and meet evolving customer need the entry nonbank player affect not only the domestic payment system but also crossborder payment until now bank have done little solve the inefficiency crossborder payment which remain expensive for customer fintech instrument and player try solve the limit crossborder payment such lack transparency and tracking and slow processing time moving from crossborder payment system another solution reduce cost and speed crossborder payment the use blockchainbased cryptocurrencies such bitcoin even the price volatility dltbased instrument and the lack trust them could weaken their positive influence the payment system gomber finally the digital revolution consumer payment and retail banking expanding with important change transaction banking customer and individual are getting used faster and cheaper payment the retail side they will look for similar service transaction banking for their company fintech innovation the payment sector especially concern cashless solution mobile payment integrated billing and streamlined payment and nontraditional payment scheme cryptocurrencies peertopeer transfer and mobile money wef cashless solution guarantee simplicity interoperability and valueadded service firstly they facilitate customer transaction allowing them make payment single tap secondly most innovative solution are not limited single payment method but they allow customer manage and use variety credit card debit card and bank account for payment lastly many innovative solution also offer valueadded service and functionality addition payment enabling financial institution create closer customer relationship and deliver additional value the traditional payment system are built automated clearing house and intermediary bank they can not enable rapid and inexpensive money transfer especially between country for this reason decentralised and nontraditional payment system provide alternative streamline the intermediating process decentralised system allow user move money between them and they typically rely cryptography rather than central authority traditional system ali the payment take place through distributed ledger technology dlt blockchain the form cryptocurrencies decentralised solution are capable near realtime settlement reduce transaction cost and ensure superior transparency and traceability transaction nontraditional payment system such mobile money and transfer are based trusted nonfinancial third party transfer value across user and geography even underbanked region wef mobile money network that enables payment across user via mobile device without requiring bank account well establish financial infrastructure thanks feature mobile money leverage mobile communication reach unbanked and underbanked individual developing and emerging country bussmann the transfer directly link the local account both sender and recipient satisfying user need for speed payer control security and universality bradford and keeton nonbank payment method both the payer and the payee need have account with the intermediary make and receive the payment furthermore both party need indicate source from which the intermediary account and payment can funded generally bank account payment card most the time the payment cleared and settled through book transfer from the intermediary account the payer the one the payee amazon and paypal platform nontraditional payment scheme enable very rapid and highly transparency transaction both sender and recipient and they favour financial inclusion since they not impose specific financial requirement user wef concluded that most payment innovation not completely disrupt the existing payment process but they can act real competitor bank since they focus frontend process improve customer experience and better satisfy their need furthermore one the main target fintech always been exceed two the greatest limitation the traditional payment payment speed and service availability innovative payment method seek guarantee the transmission the payment and the availability fund the payee real time nearreal time reducing the delay the clearing and settlement payment lastly fintech innovation the payment system ensure transparent and automatic process for customer and thanks the use mobile device and like they have more opportunity gather data and information about customer preference and attitude innovation with these advantage can threaten traditional payment scheme especially credit card bussmann deposit and lending function the fintech world deposit and lending are other fundamental service provided traditional retail bank that are facing strong competition from fintech innovation and company bussmann the primary function commercial bank are accepting deposit and granting loan and advance individual and business higher rate interest than allowed bank deposit account retail bank receive saving from their account holder and provide interest the saving return then they use the saved fund originate loan borrower and they receive different interest rate return wef bank determine the availability loan and the interest rate analysing the borrower risk profile using credit score and consequently they identify riskaverse riskseeking saver and lowrisk highrisk borrower borrower are served depending each bank risk appetite which generally related the size and the scale the bank even bank are potentially more prone serve lowrisk borrower and accept deposit from riskaverse saver although deposit and lending are two traditional function incumbent bank fintech innovation have reached this sector and they are gaining popularity over the last decade loan issued fintech player represent one third unsecured consumer loan volume the and they are expected grow yearly rate over the next five year the rapid development and success alternative lending solution have important consequence the consumer lending market and especially retail banking vallee and zeng therefore first try understand what fintech lending how new player operate and what implication they will have for the banking industry the fintech lending sector differs from traditional banking environment since doe not imply building teller and branch but the same time enables money flow from saver borrower traditional commercial bank odinet the traditional banking lending bank act intermediary between depositor and borrower indeed they lend money deposited saver the bank borrower and then they pay interest customer their deposit return fintech lender instead match directly borrower and saver and they not lend money themselves rather fund are provided investor partnerbanks after the prescreening loan application lending platform investor screen listed borrower directly decide whether not finance the loan vallee and zeng the role investor fintech lending represents radical change the lending market since they conduct activity and function that are traditionally performed bank addition the author argued that informationally sophisticated investor improve lending outcome screening listed loan using information provided the platform while sophisticated investor not screen investing average loan passively they can break even not investing all result sophisticated investor outperform sophisticated one increasing the volume loan financed the lending platform however the active role investor lending platform generally lead endogenous adverse selection problem which can impair the loan volume through both price effect and quantity effect the price side sophisticated investor are better able identify and finance good loan sophisticated investor may face average loan with lower quality hence sophisticated investor may need lower loan price break even causing lower prevailing loan price the platform and lower amount loan application the first place the quantity side case too severe adverse selection sophisticated investor may not break even and exit the market leading lower loan volume solve the adverse selection problem and maximize loan volume fintech lending platform focus the prescreening intensity and the information provision investor the platform prescreening cost initially high the platform will choose low prescreening intensity but provides more information lender this strategy encourages the participation sophisticated investor increasing the volume loan financed them even sophisticated investor not take part instead the prescreening cost low platform choose high prescreening intensity that sophisticated investor are willing invest platform simultaneously provide information mitigate the adverse selection problem caused more sophisticated investor summing this theoretical model platform prescreens pool loan application list some loan the platform and provides some information investor facilitate their screening and investing decision since unsophisticated investor not screen they are always uninformed about individual loan quality while sophisticated investor paying cost for information become informed and identify good loan therefore sophisticated investor finance only good loan and outperform uninformed and unsophisticated investor which suffer the adverse selection imposed them given the role investor fintech lending platform fintech lender not bear any credit risk and therefore they not need hold any capital reserve like traditional bank odinet result fintech lender can establish lower interest rate their product and this feature attracts borrower choose fintech lending platform instead traditional financial institution new lender also differ from bank term income and method underwriting unlike retail bank the income fintech player come from commission and fee that receive from the origination loan from their distribution lastly besides traditional method underwriting for example fico score fintech lender apply mathematical and machine learning process define the creditworthiness potential borrower fintech lender generally act direct funding lender intermediary lender odinet the first case fintech lender also called balancesheet lender are online company that originate loan internally and provide them directly borrower these lender keep the loan their book until the debt retired and they generally obtain financial fund make the loan from outside investor from their own borrowed capital fintech lender are intermediary lender when they create collaboration with thirdparty financial institution this business model the financial institution make the loan the borrower but all underwriting and processing the application done the fintech lender which generally acquires the loan after origination with this strategy the fintech lender not bear any credit risk because they purchase the loan directly from the partneroriginating bank and they with investor capital therefore the investor who bear the risk that the online borrower could default given their participation the fintech platform another important aspect the analysis fintech lending understanding why this phenomenon come over the last decade and what factor drove successful development when after the financial crisis traditional lender pulled back providing credit access especially consumer fintech lender began successfully operate the financial industry filling the lending gap odinet already discussed for the fintech phenomenon the global financial crisis caused reduction customer trust towards bank and increase safety measure around loan higher capital requirement decided regulator and supervisory authority the result tightening loan requirement bank while the loss confidence led lending gap with considerable portion individual and business with higher risk profile unserved financial institution wef the increase regulatory measure caused two major shift the financial market odinet first new rule made the cost doing business for many financial institution more expensive second incumbent were forced reprice their financial product and service against higher underwriting and compliance cost the cost credit increased many consumer and small business decided turn new player access capital fintech lender were able fill the credit gap using technological advance and machine learning reduce cost speed and automate loan process and reach underserved consumer and smes additionally they can satisfy borrower that traditional bank generally find too risky indeed commercial bank take risk themselves and they focus only lowrisk consumer while alternative lender provide online marketplace where lender can choose the desired portfolio most provider such online and lending platform match directly fund borrower and saver further fintech lender rely solely investor while commercial bank need use their customer deposit and fund from assetbacked security make loan odinet for these reason fintech player can ensure flexible fast lowcost and customeroriented alternative wef the world economic forum also analysed the potential role fintech lender with respect traditional bank the first potential scenario the disintermediation financial agent where alternative lending platform successfully replace traditional bank matching riskaverse saver and lowrisk borrower the consequence loss incumbent market share alternative lending platform since offering lower interest rate and more streamlined process new entrant also attract and retain lowrisk borrower traditional bank are still trapped legacy process obsolete technology and strict capital requirement they can not adapt quickly enough and the intensified competition alternative lender will generate pressure the spread earned between interest paid saver and received from borrower leading erosion bank margin and deposit the second potential scenario alternative lending platform act complementing traditional intermediary fintech lender are unable build sufficient customer awareness and trust especially lowrisk lending segment they create partnership with existing bank where alternative lender and bank cater different class investor and borrower traditional financial institution continue operate with lowrisk market guiding highrisk individual who not meet minimum lending requirement fintech lender thanks the collaboration between bank and fintech player customer fulfil their financing need and gain access saving and lending product that best suit their preference furthermore traditional incumbent also reach and serve highrisk customer without losing other business line and taking high risk however the profile customer served bank could become increasingly homogenised given the possibility saver and borrower switch alternative lending platform the third potential scenario traditional bank react quickly the competition alternative lending player revolutionizing their technology and process directly acquiring fintech lender with these strategy traditional bank develop alternative adjudication method and capability more streamlined lending process and greater efficiency offering lower interest rate and catering more borrower who traditionally are underserved the result are significant improvement customer experience greater availability loan and investment opportunity improved profitability and reduced leakage during lending application process nevertheless bank will need diversify their saving and lending product from the traditional onesizefitsall approach serve various customer need and face the competition against diverse fintech lender summing the author wef identified two likely implication that are common all potential scenario firstly the choice saver turn fintech lending platform short and mediumterm investment vehicle could cause erosion traditional deposit and investment product offered bank and financial institution leading some balance sheet shrinkage and negative impact capital ratio secondly could become more difficult for bank measure customer creditworthiness consistent basis since client saving and credit portfolio could distributed over many alternative platform that use different reporting standard and method doe peertopeer lending really threaten commercial bank peertopeer henceforth lending the most successful fintech lending model the consumer credit market balyuk the term describes the relationship between two party without the need for central intermediary milne and parboteeah and indeed the peculiarity this innovation the direct matching borrower and lender through online lending platform lending borrower access the online platform request loan online and they provide information about their current financial situation like income open credit line bachmann individual and institutional investor can choose invest independently within investment group algorithmically morse lender generally not fund entire loan but rather they may diversify across borrower who get financed only investor bid reach threshold the bid reach the threshold the loan close interest rate assigned the borrower the lending platform according his riskscoring lending platform are affected information asymmetry which cause principalagent problem between investor and borrower all fintech lending model borrower loan are financed platform investor who need ass borrower creditworthiness lender want therefore get much valid information about the borrower possible but the other hand borrower may hide some their characteristic order get the loan and low interest rate overcome the information asymmetry platform force borrower provide information about their current financial situation investor receive overview borrower financial characteristic such credit rating detailed information income and monthly expense house ownership the debt income ratio after defining borrower creditworthiness lender with the screening and pricing process balyuk investor screen borrower using their proprietary algorithm and additional local and macroeconomic information that not available bank although lending started with unsophisticated investor lender the considerable growth this innovation attracted institutional investor who have insight into credit market condition and characteristic thanks their strategic position lastly lending platform use fully automated algorithm price and underwrite loan significantly reducing screening cost for investor the automation the entire application verification and funding process enables lender screen small loan that are generally rejected bank because their low profitability milne and parboteeah focused the competitive advantage lending platform over traditional commercial bank platform offer better rate return deposit and lower fee for borrower than traditional bank the automation the entire process the lack any intermediary and the focused nature their activity guarantee low administrative and overhead cost for setting platform addition since investor bear all the risk the process first the borrower default they are compensated with much higher rate return secondly lending platform provide greater access credit especially some category borrower that are generally refused traditional bank borrower who not meet the more stringent criterion that bank place loan can find alternative lender who are willing take greater risk providing additional lending service another reason for the growth lending linked the direct matching borrower and saver thanks this feature lending offer form finance that generates more social benefit and externality customer this case borrower are the hearth lending activity while bank and other financial intermediary focus more their market power and profit without adequate regard the interest their client lastly important advantage lending technological innovation which allows improve the quality and speed service both borrower and lender the author argued that the majority bank budget towards maintaining existing system rather than creating innovative new one furthermore retail bank tend have large legacy system that can not easily replaced because the obsolete infrastructure built around them analysing how lending impact the credit provided bank balyuk argued that fintech lender influence the fundamental the consumer credit market improving information between borrower and investor furthermore the author found out that bank tend increase access credit for consumer who receive loan from lending platform since alternative lender guarantee greater accuracy processing customer information and screening loan application therefore fintech innovation the lending sector can bring benefit reducing imperfection and friction the consumer credit market and consequently they generate information spillover bank which are more prone enlarge their customer base also including underserved borrower although fintech lender take away part bank customer offering low interest rate and providing more tailored financial solution milne and parboteeah asserted that the development platform will not lead the end the banking system platform and fintech lender general conduct activity traditionally assigned exclusively commercial bank attract both lender and borrower with better rate and ensure faster automatic and transparent process but they lack one core banking activity liquidity provision according the author the principal activity commercial bank liquidity provision rather than intermediation bank ensure their deposit customer the possibility draw deposit demand either withdrawing cash using bank payment instrument and their borrower the flexibility their use loan facility customer are willing receive lower interest rate return deposit higher cost borrowing return for the liquidity service provided retail bank milne and parboteeah underlined that lender are disadvantage compared bank providing such liquidity service they not have access money market funding central bank liquidity for this reason and fintech lender should considered complementary agent not direct competition with retail bank which are expected set their own platform collaborate with existing one thanks fintech innovation bank can improve the availability credit customer who generally not meet the requirement for conventional bank lending increasing the stability and the efficiency bank and the banking system whole crowdfunding new source funding crowdfunding considered mckinsey another fintech innovation which may cause disruption the traditional banking system albeit lesser extent with respect innovative payment system and fintech lending crowdfunding emerged alternative way for entrepreneurial venture secure fund without the need for venture capital other traditional form investment mollick crowdfunding derives from the combination microfinance and crowdsourcing even represents unique category fundraising facilitated the growth internet crowdfunding defined open call essentially through the internet which allows entrepreneur obtain necessary funding either the form donation exchange for some form reward voting right belleflamme other word crowdfunding the collection fund through web platform from large group backer fund project startup wilson and testoni thanks the use web platform and the consequent reduction transaction cost possible collect small amount from large pool funders and this can result considerable amount capital second the use the internet make possible directly link funders with individual organization looking for funding without the need for active intermediary crowdfunding differs from other funding method because the relationship between funders and founder which varies context and the nature the funding effort mollick case art human project funders act philanthropist who not receive any direct return for their donation the second model the lending model which entrepreneur obtain fund the form loan return for their contribution funders receive fixed periodic income and repayment the original principal investment wilson and testoni entrepreneur using lending model seek passive investor because they are simply interested raising money and not using the crowd customer onn and renault the third approach called rewardbased crowdfunding which funders receive nonfinancial reward for backing project funders get some privilege for example allowing them access product realized funded project earlier date better price with some other special benefit finally the equity crowdfunding treat funders investor giving them stake other consideration return for their funding equity crowdfunding contributor receive security which allow them get portion the profit and vote general meeting onn and renault using this model the crowdfunding platform give investor the possibility finance project already listed expert and become shareholder the funded company crowdfunding can alternative complement traditional financial circuit onn and renault indeed through crowdfunding individual organization can avoid having turn traditional bank which tend reluctant grant loan some category customer addition startup and small business may run into difficulty attracting external finance during their initial stage through both bank loan and equity capital belleflamme therefore many project and venture remain unfunded due lack sufficient value promised financial investor due difficulty convincing them crowdfunding emerged new source finance which help firm raise fund from large audience rather than from small group specialized lender the concept crowdfunding using the crowd obtain idea feedback and solution develop corporate activity many entrepreneur just need small amount capital start onetime project which generally financed friend and family however crowdfunding also useful source for entrepreneurial seed capital enabling entrepreneur obtain the initial money necessary for the establishment their business mollick besides fundraising crowdfunding permit test the good service proposed the project sort preselling potential client onn and renault the project are presented the crowdfunding platform and this way for the entrepreneur promote his project and benefit from the platform viral potential addition creator are invited share their project via social network directly involving the community which becomes driving force the project lastly project developer can improve their credibility traditional financier traditional bank and venture capitalist trough successful crowdfunding campaign the four model crowdfunding donation model lending model rewardbased model and equity crowdfunding differ term complexity and level uncertainty wilson and testoni the donation model the simplest one because the only risk that the project doe not achieve goal even the funder the project doe not expect any material financial return from his investment although equity crowdfunding the smallest category the entire crowdfunding term volume the most complex focus equity crowdfunding characteristic and risk because seems the most disruptive innovation for the financial and banking sector equity crowdfunding the investor buy share the company but also need estimate value further the level uncertainty very high since this model based the entrepreneur ability create equity value the company which very difficult ass equity crowdfunding receiving greater attention from policymakers and academic since precious source fund especially for startup which generally have limited access finance and often not command asset used guarantee for bank loan young and small firm can obtain equity funding from three traditional source founder family and friend angel investor and venture capitalist the role angel investor and venture capitalist increased substantially over the last decade because after the financial crisis bank have become more reluctant finance startup due their greater riskiness and lack collateral equity crowdfunding the same objective business angel and venture capitalist but departs from these model because transaction are intermediated online platform wilson and testoni described the key characteristic equity crowdfunding with respect angel investor and venture capitalist firstly equity crowdfunding mostly operates the financing segment covered angel investor although authority introduced upper limit the capital that can raised from nonqualified investor the crowd secondly angel investor the financial return not the only reason for investment equity crowdfunding crowdfunding investor also finance startup for social and emotional benefit besides the will help startup initiate successful business exploit tax relief and achieve meaningful financial return addition the investment spectrum equity crowdfunding typically broader than angel investor and venture capitalist since investment motif the large public tend quite heterogenous although equity crowdfunding become valuable alternative source fund for startup and increasing term volume not riskfree indeed the characteristic crowdfunding can make investment young firm even riskier and they can exacerbate the information asymmetry problem common seed and earlystage financing while business angel and venture capitalist perform due diligence evaluate the firm crowdinvestors have incentive perform since this process costly and crowdfunding investment are generally small moreover crowdfunders likely lack the expertise and skill adequately perform due diligence this happens because the large audience often includes nonprofessional investor who not have the knowledge capability evaluate company finally the company valuation conducted crowdinvestors may affected bias and herding behaviour agrawal the author argued that the propensity individual funders invest project increase with accumulated capital potentially leading herding because the investment decision funder may affected those the other investor furthermore the author asserted that funders and entrepreneur are typically initially overoptimistic about potential outcome regarding investment equity crowdfunding often based standardised contract provided the platform however investment into startup generally require customised contract order align the interest the entrepreneur those the funder business angel and venture capitalist tend invest portfolio company diversify their risk this strategy might replicated equity crowdfunders considering that they are exposed variety project however nonprofessional investor the crowd could not understand the strategic importance the diversification and therefore they could potentially concentrate all their investment single project company finally equity crowdfunding tends exacerbate the information asymmetry problem that typically characterize earlystage firm indeed entrepreneur always have more information than investor about their project venture agrawal equity crowdfunding the informational asymmetry increase due the geographical distance between funders and entrepreneur particularly difficult for funders perform due diligence person ass the true ability the entrepreneur the underlying quality the project the consequence market failure the form adverse selection indeed funders discount the value the project the platform result highquality venture will not raise fund the platform because they can not get fair price for their equity that platform the risk that adverse selection increase the cost capital the point where only lowquality venture will choose crowdfunding while highquality venture will continue turn business angel and venture capitalist crowdfunding business model also some limit postinvestment support and monitoring business angel and venture capitalist provide not only funding startup but they are also directly involved increasing the value the company while the support provided crowdinvestors generally valuable the crowd make small investment and incentive provide active support the company due the lower return for their investment agrawal moreover the information asymmetry typical earlystage financing also characterises the postinvestment phase limiting the monitoring activity the crowd the monitoring activity particularly important investment that take year more produce return wilson and testoni equity investment may succeed fail and therefore necessary elaborate positive exit strategy for the investor the exit investor can through ipo but equity crowdfunding the path positive exit can longer and even likely conclusion the lack preinvestment screening and due diligence weaker investment contract and poorer postinvestment support and monitoring can make equity crowdfunding transaction significantly riskier than business angel and venture capitalist one after describing the characteristic and the risk equity crowdfunding try understand whether these innovation really affect the banking system crowdfunding other fintech innovation the potential replace significant part the banking system blaseg and koetter analysed the relationship between crowdfunding and bank verify when venture and entrepreneur are more willing turn crowdfunding rather than traditional bank loan the author underlined that the financial crisis increased the difficulty that young and small firm face raising external finance result the volume equity financing from venture capitalist decreased significantly and credit supply tightened early stage financing typically characterised greater riskiness information asymmetry and high relative transaction cost crowdfunding established itself valid alternative for younger venture since ensures lower transaction cost thanks the use web platform the author analysed whether and how the credit shock transmitted bank made young venture and entrepreneur more inclined seek crowdfunding alternative source external finance focusing large group young venture germany blaseg and koetter found out that the relationship young venture with bailedout bank increase the probability that the venture crowdfunding moreover after the financial crisis bank were forced handle their lending more restrictively due more sever rule therefore venture that can not demonstrate their creditworthiness remain unfinanced and they decide turn equity crowdfunding instead bank financing young and small firm are more likely use crowdfunding also when they have few tangible asset tangible asset allow reduce the financial loss for investor case bankruptcy and the information asymmetry cost venture pledge their asset collateral summing crowdfunding valuable alternative source funding mainly for young venture and small entrepreneur especially when their bank are affected credit crunch crowdfunding fintech lending potential threat commercial bank because can reach some category customer who are generally underserved traditional financial institution bank are adapting crowdfunding platform business model meet small loan application with transparent and customised product however crowdfunding innovation not riskfree and the real issue whether crowdfunding will able overcome main limit lack expertise and knowledge perform due diligence information asymmetry problem lack adequate monitoring and successful exit for investor despite some successful equity crowdfunding case the crowdfunding industry still lack sufficient track record ass ability create value for both investor and entrepreneur wilson and testoni for these reason most young venture are still more prone apply traditional bank business angel venture capitalist who provide knowledge the market expertise and financial capability lastly there huge disparity size between the crowdfunding and traditional banking industry and this mean that crowdfunding not currently considered realistic alternative bank bank performance and profitability the previous paragraph focused three fintech innovation which mckinsey described the most concrete threat the banking system analysed innovative payment system fintech lending agent and platform and equity crowdfunding relation traditional commercial bank activity and function from the analysis emerged that fintech innovation threaten the banking system since they have the potential overcome some limit and disadvantage traditional incumbent innovative payment system guarantee faster cheaper and more transparent process their customer improving their experience and better satisfying their evolving need fintech lending company and platform reach category borrower highrisk borrower such smes and individual who are generally underserved traditional bank addition alternative lending ensures lower transaction and compliance cost thanks the direct matching between investor and borrower and the lighter regulation lastly equity crowdfunding particular emerges valid and valuable alternative source external finance for young venture and startup with respect innovative payment system and fintech lending crowdfunding characterized small volume the financial industry but allows small project and venture get funding fintech lending crowdfunding satisfies customer and firm funding application which are typically rejected commercial bank due their greater riskiness these fintech innovation threaten the banking system because they better meet customer evolving need and preference they take away client traditional commercial bank and they guarantee lower cost higher rate return and severe requirement but fintech innovation have tangible effect commercial bank term performance and profitability doe the collaboration between traditional bank and fintech company improve bank efficiency before developing model analyse these issue first need define bank profitability and how measure bank performance this work refer bank performance the ability bank generate sustainable profitability ecb profitability essential for bank maintain ongoing activity and for investor obtain fair return any profitseeking organization bank need generate profit against unexpected loss and depletion capital base the ultimate purpose bank preserve and create value for owner even various stakeholder bank can focus different aspect profitability depending their perspective depositor for example worry about bank longterm ability look after their saving debt holder instead look the ability the bank meet obligation while equity holder focus profit generation secure future return their current holding despite bank greater complexity their performance still driven earnings efficiency risktaking and leverage mentioned above the ultimate objective bank the creation profit and earnings but also important account their composition and volatility efficiency defined the ecb the ability the bank generate revenue from given amount asset and make profit from given source income will discus bank efficiency later relation potential collaboration with fintech player risktaking refers the adjustment earnings for the undertaken risk generate them lastly leverage might improve bank result the upswing acting multiplier but the same time might also increase the probability bank failure due rare and unexpected loss there great variety measure ass bank performance with difference among group stakeholder the ecb split performance measurement three category traditional economic and marketbased measure roe return equity along with roa return asset one the most widely used measure corporate financial performance adopted analyst consultant financial manager and shareholder wet and toit roe measured dividing the net income the average total equity and can broken into three separate ratio following the dupont analysis hess and francis the three component measure respectively actual profitability utilization asset and the gearing the company for bank make sense combine the last two component into one equity capital utilization measure fact unlike industrial firm bank gearing not particularly distinguishing factor and generally strongly affected regulatory capital requirement the two remaining subcomponents roe could then interpreted operational and capital efficiency respectively therefore roe can improved increasing profitability using asset more efficiently increasing financial leverage wet and toit roe the most popular measure performance directly ass the financial return shareholder investment easily available for many category stakeholder and iii facilitates the comparison between different company sector the economy ecb however this ratio some flaw and limit performance indicator wet and toit the author argued that the earnings company can manipulated legally within the generally accepted accounting principle gaap changing some accounting policy addition roe calculated after the cost debt but before considering the cost own capital mentioned above roe increase with higher financial gearing but this last beyond certain level may cause fall the company value and the share price this case increase roe may lead wealth destruction which contrast with the principle shareholder value creation higher gearing and higher asset turnover which are not necessarily beneficial can cause dangerous increase roe the ecb underlined that during the financial crisis roe failed discriminate the best performing bank from bad one term longterm sustainability their result some case the bank with the highest roe were those worst hit the crisis indeed roe shortterm indicator which provides overview the bank current health and for this reason can not take into account longterm strategy longterm damage caused negative event and measure with longterm impact roe not good indicator bank sustainable performance when change derive from oneshot event which can not replicated the future extraordinary event during crisis roe doe not also consider longterm issue such restructuring improvement capital ratio for example during crisis many bank undertake action such restructuring return generating value the longterm however these strategy generally imply negative effect term cost involving further pressure roe and the current performance moreover roe can misleading ratio since generally influenced seasonal factor and expose bank higher unexpected risk level the last criticism roe analysed the ecb that this ratio not risksensitive and completely ignores important risk element such the quality asset the cost risk the risk concentration and the solvency situation the ecb concluded that roe not standalone performance measure and therefore necessary develop alternative and additional performance indicator other traditional indicator measure performance are roa calculated roa cost income ratio cir calculated which estimate the ability the financial institution generate profit from given revenue stream iii net interest margin computed net interest margin which indicates the capacity bank intermediation function generate income bank performance can also assessed through economic measure such eva economic value added and raroc riskadjusted return capital ecb these indicator ass the economic result generated company from economic asset mainly focusing efficiency central element performance eva defined the excess adjusted earning over the opportunity cost the capital involved eva adjusted earnings where earnings are adjusted better represent economic earnings accordance with gaap the opportunity cost equity and the amount equity used the unit being measured kimball from the ecb perspective eva considers the opportunity cost for stockholder hold equity bank measuring whether generates economic rate return higher than the cost invested capital increase the market value the company the value the eva can improved three way increasing adjust earnings either trough improved margin additional sale reducing the equity capital used reducing the cost equity kimball however any change improve eva requires manager face tradeoff among the key variable manager decide expand the activity increase earnings such expansion will lead greater investment and higher equity capital this case eva will increase only the additional earnings generated expansion exceed the marginal cost the additional equity capital involved otherwise company may increase use debt and decrease the amount equity used but decrease the riskiness the equity investment will increase and the cost equity will increase this situation eva will improve only the percentage decline greater than the percentage increase considering the flaw roe discussed above and the tradeoff that manager need face using eva the eva system considered superior more conventional performance measure manager bank and company should use performance indicator identify the best investment decision term earnings and use equity capital manager only focus maximizing earnings and adopt roe value project they will not consider the opportunity cost capital and therefore they will choose project with positive and increasing earnings but with inefficient use equity firm that adopt only roe performance indicator will tend underinvest grow more slowly than should and generate lower return for shareholder more popular performance measure roe and roa may suggest that the bank performing well when fact may reducing value shareholder using eva firm may avoid these outcome because manager would induced manage the internal tradeoff between growth and the return additional equity maximizing eva firm would invest until the last project generated roe just equal the opportunity cost the equity capital employed despite the advantage eva term incentive system and shareholder value creation not the best measure performance because project with negative eva will not chosen considering the current eva figure even though the future annual eva enough justify the investment wet and toit discussed above one the main limit roe performance indicator that roe not risksensitive and ignores any risk element the bank activity the second economic performance measure analysed the ecb the riskadjusted return capital raroc which measure the expected result over economic capital raroc one the riskadjusted performance measure rapm used the banking industry guide for efficient asset allocation performance evaluation and capital structure decision complex financial institution geyfman after the strengthening regulatory constraint bank total capital one the bank main objective maximize riskadjusted profitability one way reach this goal minimize the risk each activity undertaken the bank rapm have been developed during the last decade compare the riskadjusted return against appropriate hurdle rate the bank cost capital the opportunity cost stockholder holding equity the bank raroc measure the performance bank the ratio between the riskadjusted return business activity and the capital employed finance identify successful operation and project performance measure need consider the underlying level risk associated with bank activity and they need face the tradeoff between growth return and risk kimball evaluate bank performance raroc approach assigns capital business unit part process assessing the riskadjusted rate return and the economic value added each business unit zaik this system allows allocate capital individual business unit and activity bank accordance with their anticipated economic value added eva ecb with respect roe raroc more reliable measure evaluate the performance business unit given the focus the underlying risk level zaik the raroc business unit greater than the cost equity which the shareholder minimum required rate return mean that the business unit creating value for shareholder but raroc below the cost equity the business unit reducing shareholder value however the use rate return raroc roe roa doe not allow quantify how much value being created destroyed operation for this reason manager who use only raroc any rateofreturn measure performance are induced underinvest maximizing the shareholder value bank should undertake all project that exceed the cost capital but manager are rewarded exclusively the basis roe raroc they are more likely refuse value increasing project that will reduce their average return therefore zaik suggested using the economic profit also called residual income the activity measure the performance and create right investment incentive for manager about raroc the ecb underlined similarity with eva because both approach link bank profit with cost capital even raroc further because adjusts the valueadded relation the capital needed raroc theoretically the most relevant measure performance since compare economic return against risk however difficult calculate raroc without having access internal data and making strong assumption addition raroc seems more appropriate tool for activity with robust technique for measuring risk such credit risk for these reason academic are reluctant consider raroc valid alternative tool analyse and measure performance business activity the ecb concluded the analysis performance measure focusing marketbased indicator which characterise how capital market value the activity any company compared with estimated accounting economic value the most commonly marketbased metric include the priceearnings ratio which the ratio the company financial result over share price the pricetobook value which relates the market value equity book value iii the total shareholder return tsr which the ratio dividend and increase the stock value over the market stock price and the credit default swap which express the cost insuring unsecured bond the institution for given time period summing roe and roa are the most widely used among traditional performance measure the banking sector and many other industry roe internal performance measure shareholder value and far the most popular indicator since can easily assessed and provides direct valuation the financial return shareholder investment however roe some limit and flaw ignores any risk assessment shortterm indicator which doe not consider any longterm strategy longterm issue the company and iii can subject manipulation case lack data considering these limit academic analysed alternative tool and indicator measure performance bank particular the socalled riskadjusted performance measure rapm risk become fundamental component assessing bank performance after the financial crisis and the consequent strengthening bank capital requirement raroc allows bank assign capital individual business unit according their underlying level risk raroc theoretically considered more reliable performance measure than roe term risk assessment but this ratio not out limit and disadvantage ass bank performance using this ratio necessary have access internal data and make strong assumption about bank activity some author wet and toit eba kimball also consider eva performance measure which based the concept opportunity cost applying eva bank expect obtain better decisionmaking their manager since they are forced include the opportunity cost equity when making investment and operating decision kimball addition the author argues that eva superior the more conventional roe since requires manager face tradeoff among key variable earnings cost capital and amount equity employed however any other incentive compensation system eva system can manipulated manager maximize their compensation without necessarily increasing the profit the company this case manager juggle the eva based system maximize the current incentive compensation the expense future reported performance one the main driver bank performance efficiency together with earnings risktaking and leverage ecb efficiency and effective utilization have always been key objective bank and financial institution spong the last few year the emphasis banking efficiency increased due several recent event increasing competition for financial service technological and financial innovation banking consolidation and the increasing competition from nonbank player all these event induced bank focus more attention controlling cost and providing service and product efficiently innovation technology especially term improvement communication and data processing also adding emphasis efficiency fintech innovation give bank and other financial institution opportunity and solution raise productivity and efficiency using new technological instrument bank can increase their efficiency automating process and operation introducing new financial product and service and competing more directly with each other much the banking consolidation movement motivated the hope increasing efficiency company generally perform acquisition reduce cost internal operation exploit potential synergy and eliminate overlapping office personnel and other duplicative resource and service bank can get similar advantage case collaboration acquisition nonbank player such fintech company darolles fintech player have strong competitive advantage thanks technological innovation but incumbent are trying expand their skill and capability merler bank may decide purchase financial product service directly from fintech player when too costly for them internalize their production thanks the collaboration with fintech company bank can ensure cheaper and easier use financial solution faster and automated process and they can outsource some activity partner more efficient all these trend show that efficiency need central objective bank operate successfully the literature can find several definition efficiency technical efficiency allocative efficiency economic efficiency cost efficiency and scale efficiency for the purpose our work follow the definition provided the ecb the ecb described efficiency the ability bank generate revenue from given amount asset and make profit from given source income efficiency can measured using the costtoincome ratio henceforth cir which express the capability the institution generate gross profit from given revenue stream arnaboldi and rossignoli cir traditionally computed noninterest expense excluding bad debt and tax expense divided the sum net interest income and noninterest income hess and francis measure the output bank relation utilized input and show the amount expense that are needed given time period generate specific amount revenue burger and moormann cir recognized the most popular ratio measure cost efficiency since can easily computed allows fast and easily feasible comparison bank can easily computed and the result seem intuitive the literature about cir commonly recognized that high cir equivalent low productivity and low efficiency and viceversa hussain hess and francis showed that there inverse relationship between the cir and the bank profitability ghosh found out that negative relation between efficiency and the cir exists and this mean that more efficient bank with lower cirs generate higher profit therefore seems exist negative correlation between cir and efficiency and positive relationship between efficiency and profitability although bank focus the reduction cir proxy for cost efficiency cir some limitation assessing efficiency beccalli osborne found clear correlation between the cir and the roe sample bank bekier and nickless found important difference regarding cost efficiency among country which adopt different payment system country where cheque are widely used for noncash payment usa canada australia and the tend have more costly banking system than european country which rely more electronic transaction method moreover using financial ratio measure efficiency some disadvantage with respect parametric and nonparametric approach stochastic frontier approach and data envelopment analysis because financial ratio tend ignore the input price and the output mix berger and humphrey closer analysis cir calculation show that price component interest rate commission fee and factor cost influence the determination earnings and expense and they alter the ability cir measure efficiency burger and moormann earnings are based sale quantity and assessed price while administrative cost are determined looking the cost production factor the consideration price the earning side can problematic for the measurement efficiency which detects the level bank production and settlement capability therefore price element should not included the measurement productivity lastly bank that operate different country may characterised different interest rate and commission fee since these element are part the cir bank situated country with higher interest margin ceteris paribus appear more efficient and productive than others considering the limitation the cir academic have developed parametric and nonparametric method which estimate the operating efficiency beccalli operating efficiency occurs when company cost minimising using input for the same level output profit maximising producing more output for the same amount input this concept efficiency proxied frontier index know xefficiency defined the ratio the minimum cost that have been expended produce given output bundle the actual expense which used measure bank performance and considered better indicator compared traditional accounting ratio berger and humphrey summing efficiency become one the main objective bank and banker especially after the financial crisis and the consequent strengthening bank capital requirement bank any other organization should able generate profit with efficient use input and resource the focus efficiency also increased due the greater competition from nonbank player such fintech company that operate the banking sector the competition from fintech player induces bank adopt new technology develop new automated process and new financial service presented simple but comprehensive definition efficiency provided ecb efficiency the bank ability generate revenue from given amount asset and make profit from given source income regarding efficiency measurement described different approach from the traditional cost income ratio the more precise dea and sfa method since our work will analyse the correlation between fintech innovation and bank efficiency focusing the cost dimension fintech instrument adopted bank believe opportune apply the costtoincome approach impact fintechs acquisition bank performance the previous chapter analysed the fintech phenomenon and the emergence fintech startup henceforth fintechs which provide innovative financial solution and service fintech complex phenomenon threatening the banking industry and the traditional financial institution includes both technological innovation distributed ledger technology artificial intelligence roboadvisory and application programming interface apis and fintechs which provide new financial service based fintech innovation over the past year customer significantly changed their view financial service company and their need kmpg customer expect more innovative faster and efficient financial service however traditional bank have failed provide these service because stringent regulatory requirement and inflexible slowtoadapt legacy core banking system schwab and guibaud the current era digitalization and automation financial institution should able quickly respond their customer need with customized and easier use financial product therefore financial institution and bank feel the pressure both modernize their infrastructure and respond changing customer demand and expectation the banking industry facing fierce competition from fintechs from variety front fintechs are able better satisfy customer need adopting variety technology increase the accessibility and speed their service capgemini the elaboration advanced data analytics and the greater attention customer data allow fintechs offer tailored service and product adopting more customerfocused approach contrast with traditional bank fintech innovation guarantee their client more transparency and dependability through digital automated and more efficient process moreover the emergence fintechs led the introduction new business model such lending which may have significant impact lending and retailing sector with respect traditional bank fintech have legacy infrastructure and they can keep cost down and offer lowerpriced solution such roboadvisors finally through innovation and lowcost financial solution fintechs can reach and satisfy customer who are generally unserved underserved the traditional financial industry all these element represent fintechs strength and source competitive advantage with respect bank and other financial institution which should invest more time and attention evolving customer need and technological advance collaboration between bank and fintechs collaboration and relationship between fintechs and incumbent can winwin situation for both entity considering the complementarity their feature and competitive advantage capgemini fintechs offer agility focus customer experience and lack legacy system while bank bring infrastructure brand name and customer trust and their ability deal with regulation although fintech are closer customer need introducing innovative product they face challenge scalingup and establishing financially viable business model despite the growth and the great number fintechs only few fintech company and product have reached significant scale fintechs weakness come from the lack customer trust and brand name since take time for fintechs attract customer which reposed trust traditional financial institution unlike bank and other financial institution fintechs not have wellestablished distribution infrastructure and this may prevent them from reaching broad customer base even though fintechs have leaner and lowcost structure thanks the absence legacy system regulatory and supervisory body across the world are introducing protocol and regulation for fintechs this decision come from the continuous expansion fintechs the financial industry even many them not have the expertise handling complex regulation and mandate fintechs need also face issue about financing and capital indeed they heavily rely venture capital funding based the uniqueness their business fintechs new idea not generate interest this can compromise the financing firm operation and activity finally for fintechs difficult reach economy scale without collaborating with incumbent although fintechs offer lowcost financial solution they can profit only with economy scale which may allow them attract and gain new customer mentioned above collaboration can profitable solution for both fintechs and traditional financial institution since fintechs challenge are often natural strength incumbent and vice versa although fintechs are real competitor for different player the financial industry bank insurance financial institution they especially threat traditional bank indeed fintechs have partly taken over function and activity previously reserved for incumbent payment lending and investing eickhoff they began provide financial service which are similar those provided traditional bank but are not subject the same degree regulatory pressure term licence capital and rule for this reason will focus our analysis the relationship between bank and fintechs the emergence new competitor fintechs altered the composition the banking industry and induced bank elaborate fintech strategy maintain their role the financial sector addition the development new technology and the shift customer need increased the interest bank fintech innovation and company bank can adopt different strategy curb the potential threat from fintechs ernst young bank may decide invest their own capital fintechs inhouse venture capital independent venture capital fund investment their own balance sheet investment fintechs allow bank gain early access innovative solution resolve the lack inhouse talent and innovative culture and reduce the timetomarket bank can also enter different type arrangement with fintechs utilizing product platform developed fintechs for example the case roboadvice creating partnership collaboration whole network establishing joint venture cocreating new service bank partner with fintech launch new digital marketplace creating partnership collaboration with fintechs one the most common strategy the banking industry given innumerable advantage term speed cost and acquisition new customer kpmg through the creation alliance fintechs product and service can reach the large customer base bank and the same time bank can help fintechs address regulatory requirement and gain access new customer segment klus instead investing fintechs bank could accelerate their inhouse development fintech product and service when bank decides build fintech innovation they can define the scope their initiative and design tailormade product service kpmg however few financial institution adopt this strategy because they not have time resource capability and agility develop fintech innovation efficiently and effectively indeed create inhouse innovation internal capability technical competency and cultural disposition embrace change are required for bank the building strategy represents challenge also because the strict regulation and the complexity their business have historically slow down their innovation process ernst young another model engagement with fintechs represented merger and acquisition bank may directly acquire fintechs increasing their digital footprint and reducing cost for the development new technology acquiring fintechs may effective way avoid the development process directly gaining access fintech capability even though transaction between bank and fintechs are very recent phenomenon the banking industry they can lead important benefit for both player bank would have direct access talent and innovative culture reach new market and speed process and product delivery final customer since fintechs adopt new technology offer alternative innovative financial solution and reach underserved customer bank would also have the possibility enlarge their product and market differentiation with respect collaboration operation are more complex because they imply complete integration between two entity with different culture capability and knowledge bank could also create relationship whitelabelling with fintechs other technology company this situation fintechs develop and realize the financial product service which are then brand and sell bank applying this strategy bank have access innovative product without bearing the cost for their realization and they can test value and fill potential productservice gap however bank have control than developing the product internally they need integrate this innovative structure within their business and share revenue kpmg some case fintechs sell their product only under their partner bank brand mer and maxin analysing sample fintech the german industry the author found out that all fintech that apply whitelabel approach cooperate with many different bank therefore fintechs are only technology service provider and they distribute their technology bank increase profit and number user whitelabelling convenient for bank because they can offer innovative financial solution their customer without the need build develop the necessary legacy system with this type collaboration emerges new hybrid model for bank called banktech schwab and guibaud this model bank would put fintech company disposal their core banking infrastructure and sometimes their banking licence while indirectly reaching new customer which were unserved the past for example young people the unbanked smes digital native although fintechs provide innovative financial solution through more customercentric experience some them need bank support knowledge and expertise operate the relationship bankfintechs bank will not only lend fintechs with their backbone infrastructure operate but also rely them serve their existing client better finally bank are leading participating number accelerator incubator and training programme get access technology and talent without taking any significant stake the fintechs the other side fintechs gain easy access resource data funding space and networking opportunity test their prototype this the case joint fintech program lead fintech program conclude the analysis the report kpmg show that collaboration the preferred engagement strategy when bank need interact with fintechs drive financial innovation however although bank still hesitate acquisition fintechs are emerging phenomenon the banking industry insight identifies and analysis fintechs acquisition bank the period most these acquisition occurred after september and this confirms that such type deal very recent and that bank are changing their behaviour towards fintechs bank involved these acquisition are especially

the group remain the cutting edge payment system bringing numerous benefit also for customer along with the acquisition performed the previous year the purchase openpay showed bbva commitment digital transformation order revolutionize the banking industry accordance with fintech innovation analysing all the acquisition performed bbva until now emerges the attention the spanish group towards technological innovation brought fintech the financial industry bbva always declared that digital transformation one the priority strategy and seek achieve this goal investing incubating and acquiring fintech venture and company the context fintechs acquisition bbva can considered early adopter these innovation following the diffusion innovation theory elaborated rogers indeed considering the sample fintechs transaction mentioned table bbva performed the first acquisition fintech company the history the banking industry and also the most active european bank the purchase new player all the acquisition fintechs performed the group are united commitment digital transformation improve customer experience and offer better financial solution technological innovation become essential source value and competitive advantage for company indeed many author uhlenbruck king makri argued that company turn acquisition alternative strategy for obtaining the knowledge necessary create innovation this the strategy adopted bbva the acquisition fintechs given technological advance and shift customer need bbva understood the key role digital innovation the banking industry indeed the acquisition fintechs allowed bbva obtain and integrate knowledge and capability from acquiring firm better meet customer requirement and face the fierce competition from new technological player through these transaction bbva also gained access growing sector fintech such digital banking online payment solution big data and cloud computing bbva can now offer client cheaper fintechs generally apply lower charge fee and interest rate and faster traditional banking service guaranteeing them more transparency process and more security personal information except for madiva soluciones the other three acquisition performed bbva are crossborder transaction toward the finland and mexico accordance with academic literature there are several reason that can induce company perform crossborder acquisition rather than domestic transaction datta analysing the crossborder acquisition performed bbva refer only some motif such growth synergy increase market power and market entry and access input and technology expansion and growth through are time consuming and more cost effective than internally developing the necessary production capability and capacity indeed the realization new facility and infrastructure requires investment and may more profitable acquire existing facility another company this reason line with the strategy declared bbva even the spanish group also committed incubating and financing fintech venture another motive linked the realization potential synergy between the bidder and the target company combining their effort and resource firm can produce better result with lower operating cost the case bbva the acquisition fintechs may allow the spanish bank realize operating synergy term higher growth new the mexico finland existing market spain crossborder transaction can also allow acquired company gain access new market this case foreign company prefers acquire local firm which know the market and established customer base the case bbva crossborder acquisition allow geographically expand and strengthen presence market such the and mexico where had relatively small impact the time simple acquisition the fintech financing activity the far exceeded that every other country reported accenture the market characterized the highest rate fintech investment about and deal more than the trend the market and attention fintech innovation attracted bbva which strengthened and differentiated original strategy directly acquiring fintech company focusing the acquisition openpay bbva performed the deal moment tremendous growth for the mexican fintech sector bbva and still now one the largest bank that dominate mexico the strong position the group mexico gave the opportunity acquire mexican startup consolidate presence not only within the traditional banking system but also the innovative fintech ecosystem moreover crossborder transaction also enabled bbva enlarge customer base gaining access acquired firm customer finally company generally perform crossborder operation gain access technology and latest innovation this perfectly reflects the commitment bbva digital transformation and innovation business model indeed bbva acquired input and technology fintechs both domestic and crossborder transaction mentioned above bbva gained access innovation digital banking online payment solution big data and data analytics which are the most disruptive fintech innovation for the retail banking sector summing the acquisition fintechs performed far are based three objective bbva strategy accelerate the digital transformation process the group integrate knowledge and capability about latest technological innovation and gain access new customer effect acquisition company performance literature review the previous paragraph analysed investment partnership and acquisition fintechs performed bbva reach new objective accelerate digital transformation described the different initiative the spanish banking group the fintech ecosystem mainly concentrated fintech acquisition understand the strategic motif bbva behind such operation now will try investigate the effect such acquisition bbva performance however before focusing bbva acquisition briefly describe the main finding academic literature about the performance company after operation many study the academic literature compared the accounting statement company before and after acquisition investigate whether and how they affect the firm financial performance there are two distinct methodology that can applied study the financial effect takeover rahman and limmack guest one side profitability study compare the postacquisition performance the acquirer with the preacquisition performance the acquiring and acquired firm the other side share return event study examine the share price impact the transaction the acquired and acquiring firm since our work will follow the approach profitability study will describe the main finding profitability study the academic literature considering academic study about operation the they show inconsistent result indeed some author found negative impact company postacquisition performance while others identified positive effect operation firm performance and profitability the inconsistency profitability study may due different methodology employed and different sample selection mueller reviewed sample study across seven nation belgium germany france the netherlands sweden the and the about the effect operation corporate performance the author noticed consistent pattern either improved deteriorated profitability after acquisition ravenscraft and scherer compared premerger and postmerger profitability line business manufacturing company during the period acquired company were found extraordinary profitable before the acquisition especially the smallest firm after the merger the profitability acquired company declined and the author concluded that merger have substantial negative impact the postacquisition profitability clark and ofek philippatos and baird and denis also found that acquisition not lead improvement firm performance ghosh argued that operating performance doe not improve after acquisition the author investigated the performance merger occurred between and using control firm benchmark considering firm matched performance and size benchmark the author found evidence that operating performance improves following acquisition addition the result this study indicated that cash flow used many author measure financial performance increase significantly only case cash acquisition while they decline for stock acquisition healy examined the postacquisition operating performance merged firm using sample the largest merger the between and unlike ravenscarft and scherer measuring company performance through operating cash flow return the author found that combined firm have significant improvement cash flow these increase cash flow result from improvement asset productivity relative firm industry however this study been criticized for using industry median firm benchmark switzer continued the healy study analyse performance change larger sample takeover the during the period the result indicated that the performance the merged company typically improved after the transaction considering substantially larger sample and time period with respect healy ramaswamy and waegelein examined the financial performance target and acquiring firm using sample company during the period the study followed the methodology healy adopting industryadjusted cash flow return market value asset performance criterion comparing the premerger and fiveyear postmerger period the author observed significant improvement postacquisition performance addition the result indicated that postmerger performance negatively associated with relative target size and positively correlated with longterm incentive compensation plan looking the dickerson investigated the impact acquisition company performance using sample merger between the result indicated that acquisition have detrimental impact company performance comparing the roa acquiring and nonacquiring firm moreover the author underlined that company growth through acquisition yield lower rate return that growth through internal investment manson further investigated sample acquisition the between and following the methodology adopted healy the author found out evidence both operating and nonoperating gain from takeover however these result are sensitive how operating performance and associated gain are measured powell and stark analysed sample takeover completed the over the period using several benchmark and operating performance measure the author found that acquisition result modest improvement operating performance even these result strongly depend the methodology adopted for the analysis indeed using procedure which benchmark firm are selected the basis several pretakeover characteristic the author found slight increase postacquisition performance for acquiring firm using the methodology developed healy which posttakeover performance regressed combined target and acquirer preacquisition performance the result indicated larger improvement postacquisition operating performance cosh analysed the performance takeover the completed the period measuring the takeover performance change company operating performance the result indicated that takeover have positive but not always significant impact profitability and negative impact short and long run return from the study the analysed before emerged that most them showed positive correlation between operation and company postmerger performance can also find inconsistent result study that consider other country europe and the rest the world review paper bruner analysed sample study from analysing the postacquisition financial performance firm the author reported that four study evidenced negative performance after the acquisition three study indicated positive impact the acquisition the performance and eight study showed nonsignificant change between the premerger and the postmerger firm performance the methodology cash flow developed healy also adopted sharma and hao the study investigated the improvement postacquisition operating efficiency sample manufacturing firm during australia unlike healy the author used matched sample based asset size and industry control for industry and economic factor however the result showed that corporate acquisition not lead significant improvement postacquisition operating performance gugler analysed the effect merger around the world the the continental europe australia canada and new zeland using large panel data over the past year the author examined the effect the merger comparing profitability and sale the merging firm with control group nonmerging firm they observed that takeover produced significant decline company performance rahman and limmack examined the financial performance sample malaysian company involved acquisition the period the aim the study investigate whether takeover malaysia lead improvement corporate operating performance analysing company operating cash flow performance the result suggested that acquisition performed malaysian company led improvement the long run operating cash flow performance such improvement came from both increase return sale and asset turnover ooghe analysed the impact acquisition sample privately held company belgium between and specifically this study examined the financial performance the acquiring firm after the acquisition using statistical analysis industryadjusted variable the result indicated that after the transaction the profitability the solvency and the liquidity most the combined company decline mantravadi and reddi examined the postmerger performance acquiring firm from different industry india the author adopted sample merger india between and and they compared some premerger and postmerger financial ratio investigate the impact operation the performance acquiring firm the author found that merger have slightly positive impact firm profitability the banking and financial industry while other sector showed marginal negative impact operating performance kumar examined the postmerger operating performance acquiring company involved operation between and india the author compared the premerger and postmerger performance company using accounting data investigate merger related gain the acquiring firm found that postmerger profitability asset turnover and solvency the acquiring firm average show improvement when compared with premerger value therefore concluded that merger usually not improve the acquirer financial performance finally rani investigated the impact transaction corporate performance comparing the performance company before and after the transaction the result pertaining operating cash flow ratio showed that there improvement performance the acquiring firm the postacquisition period the author conducted the same analysis applying the pont model and they showed that operation lead improvement the longterm operating profit margin the acquiring firm they concluded that increase cash flow after the transaction are generated primarily due the better operating margin for the and the study mentioned above finding related indian operation show opposite conclusion different author from our analysis emerged that the academic literature divided about the relationship between operation and their impact company postmerger performance the finding different author have not converged conclusion whether operation are creating destroying value for the company involved found inconsistent result study conducted the the and other country different finding may due different methodology different sample operation and economic characteristic different country the prevailing theory the literature that operation have negative impact the postmerger performance both acquired and acquiring firm methodology objective our work analyse profitability and efficiency the acquiring firm bbva before and after the four acquisition simple madiva soluciones holvi and openpay investigate whether the transaction have impact the postacquisition performance the acquirer investigate the effect acquisition performance analyse roe roa and cir the acquiring company before and after the transaction research methodology most the author the academic literature conducted empirical analysis investigate the impact operation company performance they developed statistical model which compared the premerger and postmerger performance both acquiring and acquired firm ass whether the transaction creates benefit for both entity our dissertation conduct quantitative analysis focusing only the financial performance the acquiring company bbva not examine acquired firm performance since difficult find financial statement and data small fintech startup realize our analysis use secondary data from the financial statement bbva relation the year the transaction and research hypothesis test the objective mentioned above formulate the following general hypothesis bbva acquisition have impact the posttransaction performance the acquiring company bbva acquisition have impact the posttransaction performance the acquiring company adopt the methodology comparing premerger and postmerger performance term profitability and efficiency the acquiring firm using the following financial ratio return equity roe return asset roa costtoincome ratio cir chapter also mentioned net interest margin nim traditional indicator measure the financial performance bank however the financial statement bbva found only annual data nim and not quarterly data for the other financial ratio using annual data the two acquisition performed would present the same value preacquisition and postacquisition nim the same issue would also occur for the two acquisition reducing the number observation from may cause further decrease the significance the result for this reason exclude nim from our analysis the acquisition our sample occurred february december march and december therefore decide examine quarterly financial ratio bbva investigate the potential effect the operation the postacquisition performance the spanish group many author healy manson ghosh rahman and limmack suggest investigating the effect corporate performance considering two more year before and after the transaction sufficient long period needed investigate and understand the impact acquisition since efficiency and operating performance improve over longtime horizon and not within short period however can not adopt this time interval especially for the latest two acquisition occurred due the lack financial data after examine financial ratio change the shortterm one year before and one year after the acquisition since the acquisition simple and madiva soluciones occurred the same year but different month february and december consider the financial ratio bbva the date the acquisition the same valid for the two acquisition occurred march and december the quarter each acquisition denoted while oneyear before and after are indicated and respectively table from represent the financial ratio bbva for each transaction table bbva financial ratio for the acquisition simple financial ratio roe roa cir table bbva financial for the acquisition madiva soluciones financial ratio roe roa cir table bbva financial ratio for the acquisition holvi financial ratio roe roa cir table bbva financial ratio for the acquisition openpay financial ratio roe roa cir paired ttest preacquisition and postacquisition data are tested for normality assumption establish whether the paired ttest can applied using shapirowilk normality test found that data roe roa and cir both before and after the acquisition follow normality distribution indeed the pvalue greater than the significance level for roe roa and cir pre acquisition and postacquisition value since the normality assumption satisfied all the three sample can apply paired ttest verify our hypothesis following the approach adopted ramakrishnan and singh compare preacquisition and postacquisition financial ratio bbva using paired ttest examine there any statistically significant change operating performance apply the paired ttest for our analysis since each financial ratio each transaction tested twice before and after the transaction this mean that the observation are paired data paired ttest parametric test which used compare the mean two variable from the same group ramakrishnan determines whether the difference between the mean the two variable significantly different from zero our case the two variable are the financial ratio the acquiring firm before and after the transaction the paired ttest thus determines whether there significant difference between the mean the two period before and after the acquisition for the financial ratio the mean difference the two variable significantly different from zero mean that the acquisition effect positive negative the performance the acquiring company the mean difference equal zero can conclude that the acquisition impact the corporate performance for each financial ratio conduct paired ttest based the following hypothesis roe acquisition have significant impact acquiring firm roe acquisition have significant impact acquiring firm roe roa acquisition have significant impact acquiring firm roa acquisition have significant impact acquiring firm roa cir acquisition have significant impact acquiring firm cir acquisition have significant impact acquiring firm cir now illustrate the main step conduct paired ttest firstly elaborate the hypothesis that want test where the mean difference secondly calculate the difference henceforth between preacquisition and postacquisition data for each transaction now represent our sample data conduct paired ttest need calculate the mean difference the standard deviation sdi the difference and the standard error the mean difference the mean difference defined the mean the paired difference the standard error the mean difference computed our test statistic where the number difference where equal zero indeed our null hypothesis assume that there difference between preacquisition and postacquisition financial ratio the acquiring firm the tvalue then compared the pvalue decide whether accept reject the null hypothesis the value these step are reported table from result the paired ttest using software conduct the paired ttest report the outcome for the three financial ratio table table result paired ttest for the financial ratio the acquiring firm financial oneyear oneyear after tpvalue ratio before mean mean value twotailed roe roa cir not significant significance level roe the mean difference preacquisition and postacquisition roe equal the tvalue with pvalue twotailed choosing significance level equal the pvalue greater than therefore can not reject which state that there the four acquisition performed bbva have significant impact the acquiring company roe failing reject can conclude that there difference preacquisition and postacquisition roe the acquirer looking the mean roe before and after the transaction the result show decrease roe from this decrease might cause negative effect the performance the acquiring firm however not statistically significant reduction since the pvalue greater than the significance level roa the table above illustrates that the mean difference roa equal with tvalue and pvalue twotailed fixing the significance level result pvalue greater than therefore can not reject which state that the four acquisition performed the spanish group have significant impact postacquisition roa since our test fails reject can conclude that significant difference between roa before and after the transaction doe not exist from the table above emerges decline roa average from although this reduction might negatively affect the performance bbva not statistically significant given pvalue cir the mean difference related cir equal the tvalue with twotailed pvalue since the pvalue greater than the significance level can not reject can conclude that there significant difference between the preacquisition and postacquisition cir the acquiring company therefore emerged that the four acquisition performed bbva have significant impact postacquisition cir for roe and roa also posttransaction cir reduces with respect the value before the acquisition from with pvalue greater than can state that the reduction not statistically significant for the acquiring company conclusion considering the great development fintechs and the increasing interest bank the fintech ecosystem our work focus the relationship between fintechs and traditional bank particularly the aim the dissertation ass whether acquisition fintechs have significant impact the financial performance acquiring bank referred performance term profitability and efficiency bank which are measured through return asset roa return equity roe and costtoincome ratio cir investigate this issue considered the four acquisition fintech company performed the international banking group bbva and choose bbva acquisition since the spanish group the most active european player the fintech ecosystem and acquirer fintechs the initial objective our work test whether the four acquisition have significant impact bbva postacquisition roa roe and cir comparing preacquisition and postacquisition value from the result obtained for the financial ratio will infer acquisition global effect the postacquisition performance the acquiring firm the financial ratio related each acquisition are measured one year before and after the acquisition examine their change after the transaction since the value each financial ratio are measured twice before and after the acquisition they can considered paired data verified the normality assumption financial ratio value conducted paired ttest investigate whether the acquisition influence postacquisition financial ratio the acquiring firm three hypothesis were formulated ass whether bbva acquisition significantly affect roa roe and cir the acquiring company assumed null hypothesis that acquisition have significant effect the postacquisition roe roa and cir while the twotailed alternative hypothesis stated that significant difference between preacquisition and postacquisition financial ratio exists considering the return equity the result reported table indicate pvalue greater than the significance level therefore can not reject and can conclude that there significant difference between the preacquisition and postacquisition roe moreover the result show reduction the mean roe which declined from after the acquisition although this decline might indicate negative impact the acquisition the posttransaction roe not statistically significant given that pvalue greater than the significance level analysing this profitability ratio can conclude that the four acquisition performed bbva not have significant impact return equity after the transaction the second paired ttest conducted examine the impact acquisition acquiring firm return asset the result the paired ttest show pvalue greater than the significance level can not reject the null hypothesis which state significant impact acquisition acquiring company roa after the transaction failing reject can state that acquisition not cause significant change the return asset the acquiring company addition the mean roa reduces from before the acquisition after the transaction even though this decline not statistically significant finally test the effect acquisition the cir the acquiring company for the profitability ratio the result the paired ttest highlight pvalue greater than the significant level since can not reject conclude that acquisition not have significant impact the cost efficiency the acquiring firm after the transaction indeed the paired ttest not show any significant difference between cir before and after the acquisition the cost efficiency mean also diminishes after the transaction from although this reduction can not considered statistically significant pvalue greater than considering these result can state that the acquisition performed bbva not have any significant impact postacquisition roe roa and cir therefore can conclude that bbva acquisition not significantly affect the performance the acquiring firm the result our work are line with some finding profitability study the academic literature mentioned above the literature review author are divided about the impact operation the performance the acquiring company some author healy manson ramaswamy and waegelein rahman and limmack powell and stark argued positive impact acquisition the performance acquiring and acquired company however most the academic study cited our work mueller ravenscraft and scherer clark and ofek philippatos and baird denis dickerson ghosh kumar found negative effect operation the performance the company involved the transaction difference may due different methodology different sample company and different accounting measure although our finding are line with some previous academic study they are not out limitation first limitation our analysis linked the small sample size indeed measure roe roa and cir bbva only relation four acquisition small sample size can lead some issue interpreting the statistical result especially term pvalue the sample size strictly related the confidence the estimate uncertainty and precision small sample size generally lead lower confidence the result greater uncertainty and lower precision and statistical power indeed the result our analysis are not statistically significant for all the three financial ratio the small sample size due the small number fintech acquisition performed traditional bank acquisition fintechs very recent phenomenon the traditional banking sector since initially bank considered fintechs only competitor and not source competitive advantage our work focused bbva fintechs acquisition since the european bank with the highest number acquisition the fintech ecosystem second limitation our analysis the time interval adopted measure the financial ratio bbva for the acquisition most the study the academic literature measure the financial ratio from two five year before and after the acquisition indeed many author argued that potential effect positive negative profitability and efficiency emerge only the longterm however adopted shortterm horizon due the unavailability financial data after the choice longer time interval would have excluded from our analysis the two acquisition performed march and december further reducing the sample size appendix the following table report the intermediary result necessary conduct the paired ttest table
