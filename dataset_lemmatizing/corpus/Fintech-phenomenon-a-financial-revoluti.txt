fintech included traditional regulated financial player provided financial service product using new technology global financial crisis new startup established technology company emerged financial industry began offer financial solution service directly business final customer since global financial crisis represented turning point growth fintech decide briefly discus consequence crisis accelerated development success fintech financial industry role financial crisis development fintech financial crisis one factor caused significant change banking financial sector nicoletti underlined darolles financial crisis strong influence regulation traditional financial institution trust client bank since crisis revealed systemic risk activity traditional player postcrisis reform reinforced regulatory framework mainly bank consequence crisis amplified failing banking sector excessive leverage lowquality inadequate capital insufficient liquidity buffer bcbs therefore banking system able absorb resulting loss financial crisis transferred rest financial industry real economy causing significant reduction credit liquidity availability basel committee banking supervision bcbs decided

stress scenario timeline established bcbs imposed bank achieve lcr january lcr january financial crisis bank forced reduce excessive balance sheet leverage caused additional downward pressure asset price contraction credit availability hence basel committee decided introduce simple nonrisk based leverage ratio constrain increase leverage banking sector avoiding deleveraging process damage financial system economy reinforce risk based requirement bcbsb consequence basel iii banking sector subject many debate literature cosimano hakura author admati argued higher capital requirement generate significant benefit reducing leverage risk bankruptcy banking sector increasing bank equity allows limit systemic risk event bank required fund equity financial crisis addition author demonstrate social cost rising capital requirement small large financial institution side arner asserted greater rigidity new regulation increased compliance obligation bank modified incentive business structure basel iii also reduced capacity bank provide lowvalue loan damage especially smes private individual usually choose new player innovation fund spinassou showed capital requirement

bank reduced activity since obliged keep greater reserve still considered public opinion real responsible financial crisis darolles financial crisis also changed public perception banking system arner author underlined effect financial crisis labour market focusing two set individual firstly many financial professional either lost job well remunerated financial crisis consequently underutilized educated workforce admitted new industry fintech hand financial crisis indirectly damaged newer generation facing many difficulty labour market even though education skill line fintech innovation especially younger generation lost faith bank since financial player able manage risk financial crisis avoided bankruptcy thanks significant injection public money darolles finally several study pointed loss confidence financial institution mainly part european american consumer accompanied substantial increase confidence financial service provided technological institution fujitsu attitude

financial service leading change composition service provider great amount activity subject regulatory framework financial innovation often driven also regulation comprises change regulatory supervisory requirement underlined cause consequence financial crisis induced regulator improve previous set rule great impact business incentive incumbent new player fbs increasing rigidity requirement banking sector bank reduced lowvalue loan forced move away shortterm funding schindler bank must comply stricter standard whose aim protect financial intermediary system consumer another financial meltdown kerenyi molnar since new regulation damaged ability bank meet need type customer favoured emergence new financial player took place incumbent providing financial product service

kerenyi molnar customer looking convenient tailored faster financial solution past expect immediate access financial service line rest online activity wilkins customer base fintech service composed mainly younger generation developed different habit elder younger people require personalised solution strong contrast traditional approach bank financial institution prone offer product mass market darolles addition younger generation comfortable using latest technology reason represent targeted customer fintech company despite success fintech solution among youngers financial incumbent aware

fintech company first part paragraph analysed main driver fintech phenomenon considering demand supply side even many study also focus factor favoured emergence fintech company haddad hornuf examined main economic technological determinant explain formation success fintech startup categorized nine different type operate financing payment asset management insurance insurtechs loyalty program risk management exchange regulatory technology regtech business activity study focus fintech startup formation country based four main hypothesis first author supposed welldeveloped economy capital market facilitate formation fintech startup indeed startup need enough financing start carry business model traditional capital market welldeveloped entrepreneur better access necessary resource fund business addition advanced economy likely individual require innovative service new financial tool especially within large financial market offer greater possibility change innovation digitalization second driver availability latest technology economy already analysed fintech phenomenon technological advance fundamental prerequisite introduce new solution disrupt traditional financial sector fintech company need technological innovation satisfy new customer need implementing faster payment system offering easier operation improve sharing information reduce cost banking transaction encourage supply fintech solution latest technology need accompanied supporting infrastructure already available economy country third factor fintechs formation relates nature financial sector financial crisis played key role sudden upsurge fintech startup several reason lack trust bank crisis benefitted fintechs interrupted vicious circle distrust reduced financial soundness financial meltdown also increased cost debt many smes many case bank stopped lending money business many fintech startup area crowdlending crowdfunding able fill gap therefore demand fintech service higher country strongly hit financial crisis banking sector sound lastly author considered role credit labour market regulation fintechs formation author observed economy adopt supportive regulatory regime attract entrepreneur promote emergence startup furthermore individual prone establish new business significant restriction credit supplied private sector control interest rate interfere credit market author also tried understand feature labour market affect fintech startup first economy allow market force determine wage condition startup find talented individual easily hire fire employee indeed large bureaucratic cost complicated administrative requirement might prevent new business activity following report ernst young fintech ecosystem based many attribute among talent entrepreneurial availability country large workforce skilled talent positive influence emergence fintech company analysing aspect author concluded fintech startup frequent country region supportive regulation larger labour market despite great success fintech startup one operate fintech sector kerenyi molnar indeed recent year many large nonbank company started offering financial service prerogative traditional financial institution technology company become successful fintech company since overcome entry barrier banking market thanks feature large customer base adequate infrastructure solid reputation although technology company provide existing customer online mobile payment system example google wallet apple pay amazon payment take part also lending activity opportunity challenge fintech fintech complex movement includes technological innovation applied financial service fintech company provide innovative financial service considering double nature fintech examine benefit challenge general phenomenon company operating fintech sector since potential reshape disrupt existing financial sector benefit fintech financial industry financial innovation arise solution market inefficiency imperfection provide benefit improving least one inefficiency henderson pearson starting upside fintech seek globalize simple financial service improving financial inclusion especially developing emerging country financial service yet widespread increase financial inclusion fintech offer simple financial product service thanks new instrument technology respect traditional incumbent generally adopt mass market approach fintech may entail benefit customer improved quality user experience tailored product easier access financial service cheaper financial solution eba utilizing big data fintech analysis individual customer preference offer personalised tool solution nakaso indeed fintech company pay attention customer specific need attitude final decision client looking interactive flexible service according want ozaee sohrabi fintech generate efficiency also credit financial institution cost reduction faster provision service increase customer number thank greater financial inclusion lower regulatory compliance cost eba fintech company decrease banking cost due brick mortar branch complex procedure severe industry regulation since fintech disrupters constrained rigid regulation legacy system branch network like traditional financial player ozaee sohrabi moreover fintech company meet mainly smes loan application many case bank obliged refuse stricter standard imposed financial crisis possible fintech lending company use alternative data way assessing credit risk increasing credit availability consumer smaller younger profitable minorityowned business previously underserved jagtiani lemieux fintech lender developed algorithm online lending platform include nonconventional information sale data shipping data cash flow analysis business checking account evaluate credit risk borrower fintech lender access nontraditional information used available traditional bank lender fico score estimate credit worthiness considering payment history current level indebtedness type credit used length credit history new credit account dti debttoincome ratio innovation favour stable credit landscape allow fintech firm avoid two basic risk banking activity mismatched maturity leverage ozaee sohrabi indeed bank act financial intermediary take deposit provide loan borrower liquidity depositor fractionalreserve banking even function may cause bank run sometimes triggered crisis past nakaso fintech company accept deposit case online lending platform simply match borrower saver directly broader sense fintech benefit financial industry provision new service business model rise market transparency improvement efficiency information exchange eba conclusion fintech revolution significantly modified financial industry activity traditional financial player transformed business model financial intermediation customer access new solution provides new financial product service higher level personalization thanks application big data analytics iii fintech company substituted traditional bank activity deliver service new attractive nonbanking channel gomber risk challenge fintech financial industry despite benefit fintech innovation also bring new issue regarding payment settlement nakaso firstly fintech may introduce significant change structure settlement financial service already mentioned dlt one revolutionary innovation introduced fintech emergence significantly affect traditional settlement structure based centralized bookkeeper since dlt promotes decentralizationoriented technology increasing automation could guarantee greater efficiency certainty time could increase financial volatility may shortterm create procyclical dynamic wilkins digital transformation finance increased potential cyberattacks innovation founded digitisation interconnected system sharing data across wider set party eba fintech technology network becoming accessible especially open gateway internet smartphones increase need strengthen appropriate measure cyber threat nakaso therefore cybersecurity system hacked rise operational legal reputational issue financial loss institution may weaken longterm trust new solution leading lower adoption rate eba worst might wave coordinated attack causing liquidity squeeze financial market threatening solvency financial player darolles fintech process made financial industry vulnerable attack cybersecurity clearest example fintech need regulation arner fintech initiative generated important challenge regarding regulation traditional financial player behaviour relative technology adoption nicoletti although going discus relationship fintech regulation next page already underlined many fintech activity company emerge operate outside traditional regulatory framework one side favour flexibility greater speed lower compliance cost fintechs side make difficult regulator monitor activity lower level coordination among financial service fintech company regulatory official nicoletti evolution fintech created challenge traditional financial player relative digital transformation promoted fintech evolution incumbent possible strategic solution compete newcomer darolles fintech company competitive advantage thanks adoption innovation financial player try fast adopter merler expanding technical skill team encouraging staff adopt new working method procedure might also imply purchase financial product service fintech firm directly acquisition fintech startup even last solution rare traditional financial player seem hostile merge new entity existing infrastructure although acquisition could bring important advantage traditional incumbent another solution collaboration fintech company develop new service move traditional client relationship towards interactive tailored system darolles collaboration may benefit fintech company traditional financial player indeed sell service fintechs need partner know operate financial industry incumbent turn provide product third party unbranded form solution adopted traditional financial player create tie fintechs exploit distribution channel customer base new model incumbent operate product design platform selling unbranded solution fintechs becoming capable satisfying change user need risk model fintech company direct relationship client might bypass platform supplying financial product despite risk challenge lack fintech innovation would lead risk technology complacency obsolescence relative country nicoletti without technological advance financial institution might lose competitive advantage therefore financial environment might become noncompetitive global financial market author try investigate effect fintech also relation real economy term economic growth gdp per caput industry volatility beck assessed relationship financial innovation economic growth volatility analysing set country last decade author found higher financial innovation lead stronger growth opportunity country higher gdp per caput growth higher financial innovation associated higher growth industry rely external financing iii higher level financial innovation cause higher growth volatility among industry rely external funding addition author underlined relationship financial innovation real economy also depends feature market environment financial structure regulatory framework example positive effect might stronger marketbased financial system banksbased financial system indeed first one prone stimulate financial innovation completing financial market exacerbating negative effect second one focus innovation retail sector improving customer experience new product service concerning regulatory framework already discussed consequence tightening bank regulation evolution financial innovation one hand restrictive requirement increased bank difficulty limited possibility innovate hand facilitated success fintech solution giving bank incentive innovate turn result study confirmed bright dark side financial innovation since encourages stronger economic development time turn higher volatility industry benefit financial innovation since finance strong connection economy positive effect fintech financial industry also spread real economy sector nakaso fintech innovation stimulate improve financial inclusion turn positive impact economy people access new financial service opportunity expand innovative business ecommerce elearning developing country hindered limited access payment service therefore fintech contributes economic development new financial service opportunity even developed country difficult quantitatively ass impact fintech economy high level technological innovation fintech financial stability fintech might significant implication financial industry term financial stability underlined financial stability board fsb fintech either support undermine financial stability indeed innovation could guarantee efficient provision financial service reduction financial friction time could intensify existing difficulty introduce new one main benefit financial stability first include decentralisation diversification curb consequence financial meltdown circumstance specially developing country financial market diversity necessary condition financial stability indeed failure single financial institution weaker influence market since would provider financial service efficiency operation also provides support financial stability since favour stable business model financial institution creates advantage term overall efficiency financial system real economy third factor contribute greater financial stability transparency reduces information asymmetry allows ass price risk accurately securitisations example modern financial innovation opacity securitisations considered many scholar one main issue led financial crisis generating severe agency problem loan underwriting screening monitoring reduce opacity adopted new regulation impose assetlevel transparency many type assetbacked security ertan demonstrated new standard especially europe encouraged securitized loan better quality term lower default probability lower delinquent amount lower loss upon default moreover transparency stimulates creation financial instrument exposure specific risk completing market increasing market participant ability manage risk last benefit fintech financial stability represented access convenience financial service already discussed example fintech credit increase availability credit mainly household smes generally underserved traditional financial player besides access financial service fintech innovation also improves financial inclusion providing new technology instrument therefore access convenience financial service two fundamental condition supporting sustainable economic growth providing diversification exposure investment risk fsb also analysis factor could undermine financial stability separating microfinancial risk macrofinancial risk microfinancial risk make individual firm financial market institution sector particularly vulnerable shock include financial source operational source example financial source maturity mismatch liquidity mismatch leverage expose counterpart loss operational source refer governance process control issue lead disruption provision financial service critical infrastructure cyber risk damage protection data integrity system causing financial loss institution iii legal regulatory risk negatively affect confidence system leading reputational issue macrofinancial risk refer weakness could amplify shock financial system consequently impair financial stability potential risk include contagion possibility distress suffered single financial institution sector could influence institution sector financial market causing decrease confidence institution sector procyclicality refers natural tendency financial variable fluctuate around trend economic cycle landau threaten financial stability market participant action exacerbate degree impact fluctuation economic growth market price longer term iii excess volatility arising financial system overreacts news causing solvency liquidity problem impair functioning asset credit market especially case homogeneity business model systemic importance entity considered important big fail may lead moral hazard generally operate outside current regulatory perimeter never take banklike risk maturity transformation leverage addition may compromise competition service provider since considered systemically important financial industry wilkins implication fintech credit financial stability paper define fintech credit credit activity facilitated electronic online platform match borrower saver directly process large amount customer information since fintech credit activity play important role generated significant interest financial market fsb also analysis effect fintech credit financial stability fintech credit activity grown fast last year even follows different path across different jurisdiction claessens china largest market considering data referred followed united state united kingdom distance rapid growth evolution fintech credit suffered slowdown many major jurisdiction even though fintech credit market experienced rapid expansion recent year size remains small relative credit provided traditional financial intermediary actual small size fintech credit limit direct influence financial stability however sector supposed increase would bring benefit risk financial stability merler important advantage fintech credit improvement financial inclusion allows investor obtain alternative product borrower limited access bankintermediated credit receive necessary funding fintech may also reduce transaction cost including search cost cost incurred loan origination maintenance process thanks digitalisation lending process introduction new lending technology decrease transaction cost could lead lower lending cost better riskadjusted return investor however fundamental ass whether fintech lender able transform lower lending cost advantage borrower term lower price jagtiani lemieux indeed philippon found unit cost financial intermediation declined marginally crisis despite significant evolution fintech creation innovative lending platform may also encourage diversification credit source economy provide alternative solution suitable smaller firm final consumer greater diversity credit provision benefit traditional banking sector specific circumstance fintech credit platform act spare tyre lending economy fact fintech offer new option solution credit flow part economy traditional lending available sense fintech credit increase efficiency incumbent merler jurisdiction government use fintech credit platform stimulate credit market banking crisis time many advantage fintech linked potential risk fintech increase accessibility credit many category customer threat deterioration lending standard sahay identified bellshaped relationship credit inclusion bank stability country weaker bank supervision negative effect greater credit access bank buffer pronounced country high level supervisory quality credit inclusion positively associated higher bank buffer author concluded impact broadening credit access bank stability depends quality supervision underlined need strong supervision improve financial inclusion credit fintech credit may also lead procyclical credit provision like reduction lending condition economic upswing pullback credit case financial distress significant pullback fintech credit generates systemic risk concerning availability substitute form credit either online lending platform traditional financial intermediary considering small size fintech credit country difficult borrower find alternative fintech credit platform quickly reason barrier existing platform offering different type lending high traditional financial intermediary rarely supply credit certain borrower small selfemployed business therefore unlikely fintech lending promptly replaced solution outside fintech credit industry moreover fintech lending company prone help investor herd behaviour volatile credit risk appetite even fintech lending platform may exposed bank microfinancial risk due greater use untested digital process financial stability could also undermined securitisation fintech credit obligation large pool process allows borrower obtain funding different class institutional investor fintech investment actively traded however increased use securitisation may cause financial stability risk firstly process rise connection fintech platform traditional bank capital market therefore continuous expansion fintech credit market generate new channel risk fintech credit sector transmitted wider financial system vice versa secondly securitisations fintech credit obligation bring greater opacity overall market due bundling tranching loan obligation indeed many fintech credit activity emerged outside regulatory perimeter consequent difficulty authority monitoring managing regulation fintech one main issue concerning fintech evolution connected regulation recent phenomenon global financial crisis induced regulator strengthen existing rule introduce new requirement especially financial banking sector favouring evolution fintech activity company fintech generally emerges operates outside regulatory perimeter nontraditional product service offered fintech company may observe traditional financial regulation arner reason becomes difficult regulator monitor evaluate fintech activity difficulty regulating fintech regulator objective financial industry financial stability prudential regulation conduct fairness competition market development arner elaborating suitable regulation supervisor need analyse benefit applicability technology introduction new technology fintech always imply widely adopted subject new rule since fintech emerging player growing fast threatening traditional incumbent regulator need intervene adjusting method rule best support fintech considering significant change financial banking sector last decade two main risk regulator need avoid darolles first regulator prevent overprotecting incumbent creating high entry barrier newcomer indeed excessive regulation stifle financial innovation competition regulator also need favour new fintech player rigid regulation incumbent respect traditional financial player newcomer generally constrained severe requirement rule introduced global financial crisis even may cause lack information protection issue security regulator decision direct indirect influence competition incumbent new player financial market main goal regulatory framework guarantee parity financial agent time promote innovative competitive secure financial market regulation guarantee equal treatment competition among player soundness financial industry moreover rulesetters also need focus incentive offered market agent influence behaviour decision player darolles suggested creating harmonised set rule avoiding different regulation different category player since would break financial market interfere emergence new player evolution financial innovation fintech innovation brings benefit challenge financial market interest always line longterm goal regulator philippon fintech company generally enter market activity profitable although many sector incumbent presence deepseated entry difficult case aim regulation actively encourage entry guarantee level playing field among traditional new financial player nevertheless real market argument level playing field elaborated darolles fundamental goal regulator apply due main bias financial sector principle level playing field coherent incumbent toobigto fail applies newcomer carry activity traditional player efficiency lower cost philippon regulator challenge find right regulation framework new fintech activity financial industry includes incumbent newcomer dynamic fitting continuous change size activity business arner fintech startup regulation may expensive compliance cost licence application incompatible lean business model emerging new player would better apply principlebased regulatory regime includes flexible compliance obligation respect rulebased regime regime advantage disadvantage fintech company principlebased regime guarantee flexibility especially earlystage firm time creates uncertainty term compliance limitation term scalability mature business rulebased regime clearly defines rule process giving right incentive supervised entity lead higher compliance cost greater complexity suitable option fintech startup might combination regime since principlebased system allows company flexible dynamic rulebased one make fintechs attractive investor creates barrier entry subsequent new competitor regulator face difficult task finding balance incumbent interest need control emergence new financial player darolles one hand authority tend impose stricter tighter rule existing player since know business goal hand tend lenient market entrant conduct new activity provide new service whose risk still fully understood right regulation permit incumbent survive favour financial innovation promote healthy competition reach goal author suggests principle guideline rulessetters darolles argued regulation encourage healthy competition among player whether implement new technology offer traditional solution remove obstacle growth new entrant moreover regulation framework make difference among player cover simultaneously regardless characteristic activity principle level playing field lastly main aim regulator protection user financial system continuously cause new unexpected risk fintech involves risk challenge regulator need focus downside phenomenon defending user financial service stability financial system discussed one main risk fintech increase cyberattacks due greater use online service online platform technology regulator main obstacle lack historical case data cyberrisks know evaluate regulate risk solution authority identify plausible attack scenario test consequence fintech business regulator need become expertise field fulfil role another risk regulator need face outsourcing task within financial transaction traditional player decide collaborate fintech player generally offload traditional activity task onto external service provider especially case job high technological content way traditional financial player reduce cost pressure fintech company efficient since better able use new technology issue transaction split traditional regulated financial player fintech company necessarily subject specific requirement cause breach supervision system lastly authority need focus supervise use big data analytics might bring negative consequence user

regtech offer opportunity risk application new technology regulatory framework allows reduce compliance cost shorten bureaucratic procedure provide flexibility dynamism fintech company however regtech often requires significant investment due use new instrument procedure moreover although regtech contributes increasing efficiency regulatory compliance necessarily imply reduction overall burden regulation since compliance small part red tape burden allen berg lastly still uncertainty market usefulness success new technology used reduce complexity rule whose future evolution development might impeded regulation another novelty regulation fintech represented regulatory sandbox enable innovative financial player check feasibility new financial product service business model within test

popularity last decade loan issued fintech player represent one third unsecured consumer loan volume expected grow yearly rate next five year rapid development success alternative lending solution important consequence consumer lending market especially retail banking vallee zeng therefore first try understand fintech lending new player operate implication banking industry fintech lending sector differs traditional banking environment since imply building teller branch time enables money flow saver borrower traditional commercial bank odinet traditional banking lending bank act intermediary depositor borrower indeed lend money deposited saver bank borrower pay interest customer deposit return fintech lender instead match directly borrower saver lend money rather fund provided investor partnerbanks prescreening loan application lending platform investor screen listed borrower directly decide whether finance loan vallee zeng role investor fintech lending represents radical change lending market since conduct activity function traditionally performed bank addition author argued informationally sophisticated investor improve lending outcome screening listed loan using information provided platform sophisticated investor screen investing average loan passively break even investing result sophisticated investor outperform sophisticated one increasing volume loan financed lending platform however active role investor lending platform generally lead endogenous adverse selection problem impair loan volume price effect quantity effect price side sophisticated investor better able identify finance good loan sophisticated investor may face average loan lower quality hence sophisticated investor may need lower loan price break even causing lower prevailing loan price platform lower amount loan application first place quantity side case severe adverse selection sophisticated investor may break even exit market leading lower loan volume solve adverse selection problem maximize loan volume fintech lending platform focus prescreening intensity information provision investor platform prescreening cost initially high platform choose low prescreening intensity provides information lender strategy encourages participation sophisticated investor increasing volume loan financed even sophisticated investor take part instead prescreening cost low platform choose high prescreening intensity sophisticated investor willing invest platform simultaneously provide information mitigate adverse selection problem caused sophisticated investor summing theoretical model platform prescreens pool loan application list loan platform provides information investor facilitate screening investing decision since unsophisticated investor screen always uninformed individual loan quality sophisticated investor paying cost information become informed identify good loan therefore sophisticated investor finance good loan outperform uninformed unsophisticated investor suffer adverse selection imposed given role investor fintech lending platform fintech lender bear credit risk therefore need hold capital reserve like traditional bank odinet result fintech lender establish lower interest rate product feature attracts borrower choose fintech lending platform instead traditional financial institution new lender also differ bank term income method underwriting unlike retail bank income fintech player come commission fee receive origination loan distribution lastly besides traditional method underwriting example fico score fintech lender apply mathematical machine learning process define creditworthiness potential borrower fintech lender generally act direct funding lender intermediary lender odinet first case fintech lender also called balancesheet lender online company originate loan internally provide directly borrower lender keep loan book debt retired generally obtain financial fund make loan outside investor borrowed capital fintech lender intermediary lender create collaboration thirdparty financial institution business model financial institution make loan borrower underwriting processing application done fintech lender generally acquires loan origination strategy fintech lender bear credit risk purchase loan directly partneroriginating bank investor capital therefore investor bear risk online borrower could default given participation fintech platform another important aspect analysis fintech lending understanding phenomenon come last decade factor drove successful development financial crisis traditional lender pulled back providing credit access especially consumer fintech lender began successfully operate financial industry filling lending gap odinet already discussed fintech phenomenon global financial crisis caused reduction customer trust towards bank increase safety measure around loan higher capital requirement decided regulator supervisory authority result tightening loan

financial market odinet first new rule made cost business many financial institution expensive second incumbent forced reprice financial product service higher underwriting compliance cost cost credit increased many consumer small business decided turn new player access capital fintech lender able fill credit gap using technological advance machine learning reduce cost speed automate loan process reach underserved consumer smes additionally satisfy borrower traditional bank generally find risky indeed commercial bank take risk focus lowrisk consumer alternative lender provide online marketplace lender choose desired portfolio provider online lending platform match directly fund borrower saver fintech lender rely solely investor commercial bank need use customer deposit fund assetbacked security make loan odinet reason fintech player ensure flexible fast lowcost customeroriented alternative wef world economic forum also analysed potential role fintech lender respect traditional bank first potential scenario disintermediation financial agent alternative lending platform successfully replace traditional bank matching riskaverse saver lowrisk borrower consequence loss incumbent market share alternative lending platform since offering lower interest rate streamlined process new entrant also attract retain lowrisk borrower traditional bank still trapped legacy process obsolete technology strict capital requirement adapt quickly enough intensified competition alternative lender generate pressure spread earned interest paid saver received borrower leading erosion bank margin deposit second potential scenario alternative lending platform act complementing traditional intermediary fintech lender unable build sufficient customer awareness trust especially lowrisk lending segment create partnership existing bank alternative lender bank cater different class investor borrower traditional financial institution continue operate lowrisk market guiding highrisk individual meet minimum lending requirement fintech lender thanks collaboration bank fintech player customer fulfil financing need gain access saving lending product best suit preference furthermore traditional incumbent also reach serve highrisk customer without losing business line taking high risk however profile customer served bank could become increasingly homogenised given possibility saver borrower switch alternative lending platform third potential scenario traditional bank react quickly competition alternative lending player revolutionizing technology process directly acquiring fintech lender strategy traditional bank develop alternative adjudication method capability streamlined lending process greater efficiency offering lower interest rate catering borrower traditionally underserved result significant improvement customer experience greater availability loan investment opportunity improved profitability reduced leakage lending application process nevertheless bank need diversify saving lending product traditional onesizefitsall approach serve various customer need face competition diverse fintech lender summing author wef identified
