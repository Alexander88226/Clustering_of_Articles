haddad hornuf examine main economic technological determinant explain formation success fintech startup categorize nine different type operate financing payment asset management insurance insurtechs loyalty program risk management exchange regulatory technology regtech business activity study focus fintech startup formation country base four main hypothesis first author suppose welldeveloped economy capital market facilitate formation fintech startup indeed startup need enough financing start carry business model traditional capital market welldeveloped entrepreneur well access necessary resource fund business addition advanced economy likely individual require innovative service new financial tool especially within large financial market offer great possibility change innovation digitalization second driver availability late technology economy already analyse fintech phenomenon technological advance fundamental prerequisite introduce new solution disrupt traditional financial sector fintech company need technological innovation satisfy new customer need implement faster payment system offering easy operation improve share information reduce cost banking transaction encourage supply fintech solution late technology need accompany support infrastructure already available economy country third factor fintechs formation relates nature financial sector financial crisis played key role sudden upsurge fintech startup several reason lack trust bank crisis benefit fintechs interrupt vicious circle distrust reduce financial soundness financial meltdown also increase cost debt many smes many case bank stop lending money business many fintech startup area crowdlending crowdfunding able fill gap therefore demand fintech service high country strongly hit financial crisis banking sector less sound lastly author consider role credit labour market regulation fintechs formation author observe economy adopt supportive regulatory regime attract entrepreneur

success fintech startup one operate fintech sector kerenyi molnar indeed recent year many large nonbank company start offering financial service prerogative traditional financial institution technology company become successful fintech company since overcome entry barrier banking market thanks feature large customer base adequate infrastructure solid reputation although technology company provide exist customer online mobile payment system example google wallet apple pay amazon payment take part also lending activity opportunity challenge fintech fintech complex movement include

activity company emerge operate outside traditional regulatory framework one side favour flexibility great speed low compliance cost fintechs side make difficult regulator monitor activity low level coordination among financial service fintech company regulatory official nicoletti evolution fintech create challenge traditional financial player relative digital transformation promote fintech evolution incumbent possible strategic solution compete newcomer darolles fintech company competitive advantage thanks adoption innovation financial player try fast adopter merler expand technical

opportunity even developed country difficult quantitatively ass impact fintech economy high level technological innovation fintech financial stability fintech might significant implication financial industry term financial stability underlined financial stability board fsb fintech either support undermine financial stability indeed innovation could guarantee efficient provision financial service reduction financial friction time could intensify exist difficulty introduce new one main benefit financial stability first include decentralisation diversification curb consequence financial meltdown

fintech credit financial stability paper define fintech credit credit activity facilitate electronic online platform match borrower saver directly process large amount customer information since fintech credit activity play important role generate significant interest financial market fsb also analysis effect fintech credit financial stability fintech credit activity grown fast last year even follow different path across different jurisdiction claessens china large market consider data refer follow united state united kingdom distance rapid growth evolution fintech credit suffer slowdown many major jurisdiction even though fintech credit market experienced rapid expansion recent year size remains small relative credit provide traditional financial intermediary actual small size fintech credit limit direct influence financial stability however sector suppose increase would bring benefit risk financial stability merler important advantage fintech credit improvement financial inclusion allows investor obtain alternative product borrower limited access bankintermediated credit receive necessary funding fintech may also reduce transaction cost include search cost cost incur loan origination maintenance process thanks digitalisation lending process introduction new lending technology decrease transaction cost could lead low lending cost well riskadjusted return investor however fundamental ass whether fintech lender able transform low lending cost advantage borrower term low price jagtiani lemieux indeed philippon found unit cost financial intermediation decline marginally crisis despite significant evolution fintech creation innovative lending platform may also encourage diversification credit source economy provide alternative solution suitable small firm final consumer great diversity credit provision benefit traditional banking sector specific circumstance fintech credit platform act spare tyre lending economy fact fintech offer new option solution credit flow part economy traditional lending available sense fintech credit increase efficiency incumbent merler jurisdiction government use fintech credit platform stimulate credit market banking crisis time many advantage fintech link potential risk fintech increase accessibility credit many category customer threat deterioration lending standard sahay identify bellshaped relationship credit inclusion bank stability country weaker bank supervision negative effect great credit access bank buffer pronounce country high level supervisory quality credit inclusion positively associate high bank buffer author conclude impact broadening credit access bank stability depends quality supervision underlined need strong supervision improve financial inclusion credit fintech credit may also lead procyclical credit provision like reduction lending condition economic upswing pullback credit case financial distress significant pullback fintech credit generates systemic risk concern availability substitute form credit either online lending platform traditional financial intermediary consider small size fintech credit country difficult borrower find alternative fintech credit platform quickly reason barrier exist platform offering different type lending high traditional financial intermediary rarely supply credit certain borrower small selfemployed business therefore unlikely fintech lending promptly replace solution outside fintech credit industry moreover fintech lending company prone help investor herd behaviour volatile credit risk appetite even fintech lending platform may expose bank microfinancial risk due great use untested digital process financial stability could also undermined securitisation fintech credit obligation large pool process allows borrower obtain funding different class institutional investor fintech investment actively trade however increase use securitisation may cause financial stability risk firstly process rise connection fintech platform traditional bank capital market therefore continuous expansion fintech credit market generate new channel risk fintech credit sector transmit wider financial system vice versa secondly securitisations fintech credit obligation bring great opacity overall market due bundling tranching loan obligation indeed many fintech credit activity emerge outside regulatory perimeter
