small and mediumsized enterprise smes have generally played the most significant role the development the national and provincial economy china smes have made great stride that have accounted for over all enterprise contributed more than growth gdp and foreign trade for economic development nationwide provided over job opportunity and more than business revenue although smes have experienced overall performance that would characterized excellent and have irreplaceable role promoting the national economy their financial environment been and remains susceptible and sensitive changing financial condition all level overall smes face greater financial constraint than larger firm there are measure that are intended alleviate the financial constraint smes such leasing and factoring that are helpful facilitating access finance the absence welldeveloped financial institution numerous study have argued that smes are financially more constrained than are large firm smes are major player the economy such that the current financial market failure obstacle their expansion and growth for this reason smes need administrative and financial support from government all level however despite the growing interest subsidizing smes there are concern about whether these measure are helpful and sufficient according statistic from the people bank china smes have obtained bank loan that account for the loan financial institution and bank supporting loan smes lie the range moreover virtually smes are experiencing capital circulation problem smes have not received financial support relative the contribution they have made the economy their financial problem have become barrier that affect the sustainable development smes given this background the financial supply chain enters important participant the financial system with associated financial credit risk the remainder the paper follows section give literature review including the definition supply chain finance credit risk evaluation supply chain finance and risk control for supply chain finance the theory supply chain financial core enterprise risk discussed section including credit guarantee and operational risk section present the fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp framework including the fuzzy judgment matrix and check for consistency the weight vector and composite weight vector the empirical analysis evaluated section including discussion core enterprise evaluation system the core enterprise credit risk and model construction and solution some concluding remark are presented section literature review international research supply chain finance started before similar development china the mode operation more mature and the achievement are relatively advanced regarding relationship between supply chain and financing berger etal advanced the conceptual framework for the development and financing global small and mediumsized enterprise smes and established the idea supply chain finance klapper analyzed the principle underlying the inventory financing model and the function that small and mediumsized enterprise had adopted the supply chain the development china supply chain finance began around the financing mode plus implemented the shenzhen development bank since renamed the ping bank offered billion credit line making profit with the nonperforming loan accounting for all supply chain finance recent year supply chain finance been developing rapidly statistic show that the end smes had chosen supply chain finance alleviate the shortage business liquidity however innovative financing method supply chain finance also certain risk such the financing small and mediumsized enterprise core bank whereby one party credit problem can lead the failure supply chain financing and the loss other participant while smes are undoubtedly the engine economic growth their speed growth will dampened market imperfection and institutional weakness for further detail see beck and demirguckunt definition supply chain finance according the definition supply chain finance scf hofmann relies two more organization the supply chain cooperate financial resource create extra value jointly although these organization remain independent pfohl and gomm argued that scf could raise the value participating firm the supply chain addition the value leading firm the supply chain according gupta and dutta with increasingly fierce competition becomes more important improve the efficiency working capital using cash that trapped the financial supply chain fsc mathis and cavinato argued that bank should play more active role the fsc integrate the resource the chain silvestro and lustrato showed that bank are key player that can offer alternative supply chain solution the fsc blackman proposed formal definition that financial supply chain the network organisation and bank that coordinate the flow financial transaction through shared information system facilitate product supply chain between trading partner scf can defined many way the analysis the different definition and conceptual contribution highlight two major perspective scf which can identified financialoriented from which further buyerdriven perspective can identified and supply chainoriented the financial perspective interprets scf set innovative financial solution for further detail see caniato scf increasingly become hot topic supply chain management and growing product category financial institution fis china scf experiencing rapid development stage and numerous fis have begun focus developing and designing new scf service and product solve the financing issue facing smes scf channel for financing which manages plan and control all cash flow across supply chain member improve the turnover efficiency working capital scf smes obtain loan with looser constraint from bank through expanded credit line core enterprise alleviate the pressure funding and financial intermediary dramatically increase their income more specifically scf significantly decrease the credit risk smes for fis nevertheless scf can not completely eliminate credit risk which continue one the major threat fis moreover scf been promoted for almost ten year and experienced slow development china because there not yet appropriate sme credit risk evaluation index system outstanding prediction model which hinders scf for further detail see zhu scf concerned with the capital flow within supply chain area that often been neglected the past nevertheless scf doe have impact firm capability for adopting sustainable supply chain management scm practice for further detail see liu credit risk evaluation supply chain finance china smes are the main applicant scf that bank suffer from credit risk scf when the smes can not honour agreement and contract generally agreed that structuring the sme credit risk evaluation index system the greatest and most critical challenge bank management scf and fundamental credit loan decision making good credit risk evaluation index system can guarantee profitability and stability whereas poor system can potentially lead significant loss for further detail see zhu previous study the expert and scholar pay more attention the credit risk smes while neglecting the credit risk core enterprise which one the main financial entity the supply chain fact the core enterprise credit risk the key influence the effective implementation supply chain finance feldmann and ller emphasized the role asymmetric information held supply chain partner who are opportunistically behaved silvestro and lustrato argued that the factor that could affect the risk scf include supply chain coordination cooperation and information sharing berger and udell found that small firm have limited access external financing and were more tighly constrained their operation both developing and developed country galindo and schiantarelli drew the same conclusion for country latin america schiffer and weder found that small firm consistently face greater growth obstacle than large firm which implies that size one the most reliable factor for financing obstacle confronting firm except for age and ownership firm for further detail see beck song and zipkin analyzed the method for determining the quality good the pawn financing process moreover investigation wuttke indicated that better for the supply chain enterprise smes adopt pre shipment financing model preference postshipment funding model furthermore both corporation and bank have shown great interest using scf technique ease their tension the supply chain and also making large corporation shorten the payment period for their key supplier for further detail see randall zhu proposed sme credit risk evaluation index system specifically designed for scf this system used evaluate the credit risk from different point view which not only consist financial and nonfinancial condition smes but also contain the financial and nonfinancial condition the operational status the entire supply chain and the transactional relationship between smes and for further detail see zhu therefore measuring and evaluating the credit level core enterprise and controlling the credit risk core enterprise are the key using supply chain finance efficient manner risk control for supply chain finance mentioned above there been substantial and informative research supply chain finance for smes nevertheless there remain some limitation there been little research collaborative supply chain finance for smes and the research not necessarily been systematic some study have concentrated one aspect solve the macmillan gap but have ignored systematic analysis and the overall optimization supply chain finance for smes lee and rhee demonstrated that through the coordination and establishment commercial credit among smes the result risk control for supply chain finance smes are better than those financial risk control financial institution for the individual company the apparent ability some supply chain recover from inevitable risk event more effectively than others recently triggered debate about supply chain resilience scres while scrm focus the identification and management risk for the supply chain order reduce vulnerability scres aim developing the adaptive capability prepare for unexpected and contingent event respond disruption and subsequently recover from them for further detail see ttner and maklan theory supply chain financial core enterprise risk supply chain finance core enterprise are the exchange centre capital flow information flow and logistics and play important role the supply chain financing the risk can vary including three major risk namely credit guarantee and operational risk which are discussed below credit risk core enterprise play important role supply chain finance and play key role connecting the supply chain capital flow information flow and logistics bank are based the core enterprise strength and credit guarantee and select the upstream and downstream enterprise perform credit activity therefore the core enterprise condition and development prospect determine the smooth operation the supply chain the credit status core business problem will inevitably spread the supply chain with the upstream and downstream enterprise thereby affecting the overall supply chain finance security and operational efficiency and leading supply chain financing failure core enterprise credit risk manifest itself two respect the core enterprise can undertake the entire supply chain finance guarantee function when they are experiencing poor management themselves moreover the core enterprise may confronted with credit crisis due bonding credit which exceeds credit capacity resulting financing failure the core enterprise development prospect are not encouraging their power diminished core enterprise may conceal their real transaction record with different party the supply chain which lead false financing this can affect their actual performance that they will not able satisfy the condition the agreement with the bank which case the smes financing will eventually fail guarantee risk for the core enterprise the socalled guarantee risk arises financing when smes break contract when smes can not continue payment bank loan the core enterprise guarantor smes bear the associated bank loss supply chain finance guarantee the core enterprise the credit situation smes lead greater strength smes and the possibility reducing the risk bank lending money smes through promoting enterprise production and business development the core enterprise intends give credit smes the core enterprise should careful selecting smes the supply chain that are financially strong reduce guarantee risk operational risk the process supply chain financing many the required step need confirmed manually operational risk need accommodated the operation the three main financing risk are also different for example the operational risk account receivable financing mode focus primarily the management account receivable the existence sale discount will lead error when the account receivable are checked moreover given the fact that receivables financing repeatedly regular procedure the payment and actual deviation occur when the core enterprise are confirming such payment addition the account receivable settlement involve enterprise and many settlement account the procedure for repayment can complicated especially when the method for the account receivable transfer payment change operational error are more prone occur thereby leading greater operational risk overall the greatest influence the supply chain the three different type risk mentioned above financial credit risk the main participant the supply chain the core enterprise credit level significant influence the success financing order reduce the financial risk the supply chain the effective control core enterprise credit risk fundamental fuzzy analytical hierarchy process fahp framework saaty introduced multifactors decision making approach which factor are arranged hierarchical structure order apply the fahp method necessary construct hierarchy that express the relative value set attribute decision maker evaluate the relative importance the attribute each level based the fahp scale which turn used direct them express their preference between each pairwise comparison then the decision maker are required determine whether the element equal importance somewhat more important much more important very much more important absolutely important relative another element these important intensity are respectively converted numeral value the fahp scale and the intermediate value see table using this scale the qualitative judgment evaluator are converted into quantitative value which enable construction pairwise comparison matrix the pairwise comparison matrix made for all element considered the construct hierarchy the result from these comparison are used calculate list relative weight and importance the factor eigenvectors based the rapid application development rad method table fahp scale intensity linguistic variable positive positively ahp scale value reciprocal value the same important weakly more important fairly more important strongly more important absolutely more important intermediate value fuzzy judgment matrix fuzzy judgment matrix can used compare the importance different indicator the level importance two element are assumed incorporated into index labelled and the hierarchical element represent the existing fuzzy relation all which constitute fuzzy matrix given below the fuzzy index matrix rij denotes judgment value which represents the extent which much more important than when the two element and are compared pairwise comparison among the main factor subfactors and alternative are produced based the typical ninepoint scale combined with fuzzy number the next step calculate the priority weight factor subfactors and alternative adopting the fahp approach the idea calculating the priority weight attribute based the pairwise comparison given the questionnaire doing set comparison question are proposed order ask the expert their opinion the higher the evaluation the greater will the importance factor corresponding three level the hierarchical model the expert first evaluate the four main factor the second level with respect the overall goal the third level pairwise comparison alternative are made with respect the overall goal order obtain the quantitative value the compared importance between each two indicator fuzzy numerical value from are employed shown table with such comparison between each two factor the fuzzy judgment matrix can constructed fuzzy judgment matrix consistency check consistency check the first condition for calculating the weight only the consistency meet the requirement can the model solved relatively simple judgment method based the following formula nnnijaij ijthe acceptable condition for the consistency judgment where the implication the attitude the decision maker the higher the consistency the fuzzy judgment matrix required the decision maker the smaller will the value the value most suitable when set weight vector criterion layer the determination the weight vector the key the fuzzy judgment matrix which can obtained after sorting out the result the questionnaire given the expert the formula given equation used solve the weight vector for each criterion layer the weight given each expert multiplied the weight vector and the weight vector the element the layer such that can obtained follows aij for any weight vector index layer criterion layer each decision making expert take the layer element the criterion and give the fuzzy judgment matrix which obtained the level element compare two fuzzy judgment matrix using the same method and thereby obtains the weight vector each element the layer composite weight vector after calculating the priority weight vector the and layer the following iformula equation ijwiw used compute the composite weight vector and the priority weight vector the different index obtain the credit risk the key risk factor can then identified the formula the index value element the weight vector the criterion layer index value wij the weight vector the criterion layer the empirical analysis introduction core enterprise the wuhan iron and steel group affiliated the stateowned sasac important backbone enterprise good credit rating and substantial financial strength among the core enterprise the supply chain finance the wuhan iron and steel group the production stage the three stage product supply production and sale the upstream enterprise act primarily steel material supplier which are responsible for the mining steel the wuhan iron and steel group applied various bank for financial loan mean the receivables document the financing process downstream enterprise are mainly steel dealer which are responsible for the sale steel during the financing process they select the financing mode prepayment purchase and apply for loan based sale contract the china industrial bank cib been cooperating with the wuhan iron and steel group the supply chain finance since until december the china industrial bank had credit line among the upstream and downstream dealer the wuhan iron and steel group with credit amount that exceeded rmb billion the nonperforming loan ratio the upstream and downstream enterprise very low almost close zero which successful case the implementation supply chain finance evaluation system the core enterprise credit risk the core enterprise risk control the most important factor the supply chain risk for this reason the construction the core enterprise credit risk system very important this paper construct layer analysis using four approach toward risk namely the core enterprise industry position management perspective asset status and credit record core enterprise industry status the achievement interenterprise transaction not only relies the quality good but also the industry status the focus attention general the core enterprise industry status significant effect their business condition this paper selects the macroscopic environment and the development situation the enterprise the secondary index industry status evaluation core enterprise operation bank are more concerned about the operation the core enterprise with guarantee the reason that the core enterprise need assume the guarantee obligation case default the smes the core enterprise not have high solvency the bank will not position offer loan the smes they need consider their own financial interest the operating performance the core enterprise mainly reflected the three indicator profitability operating capacity and solvency this paper selects these three index the secondary indicator the evaluation system asset status the core enterprise the main premise bank loan that the core enterprise provides security for smes such that when smes breach their contract the core enterprise will accept their responsibility for the guarantee thereby compensating the bank and reducing bank loss therefore the asset status the core enterprise also important focus bank inspection this way the ability the core enterprise cash financial asset stronger than that the monetary fund receivable account and inventory this paper will take the three item the secondary index the current asset status evaluation core enterprise credit history the key the successful financing smes the core enterprise credit guarantee bundled together with smes form the overall credit however the credit situation the core enterprise poor even the smes and the core enterprise credit guarantee are bundled together the bank will not make the loan accessible this paper selects the credit rating and the previous performance namely the credit history the secondary index the hierarchy the evaluation system core enterprise credit risk can constructed shown figure divided into three level and arranged descending order the first level present the overall goal which the risk evaluation supply chain financial core enterprise and situated the top the hierarchy the second level four major factor are inserted into the model namely industry status operation condition asset state and credit record each factor includes several subfactors the third level the hierarchy the industry status factor explained two subfactors namely macroenvironment and enterprise development the operation condition includes operation ability profitability and solvency the asset state consists monetary fund account receivable and inventory the credit history includes enterprise credit rating and past performance core enterprise credit risk evaluation system hierarchical graph figure model construction and solution using the risk evaluation system that described above including risk category and risk factor the risk identification model constructed using fuzzy analytic hierarchy process fahp and the model thereby solved this paper the core enterprise employee are divided into four category namely managerial staff senior engineer middlelevel employee and general employee the questionnaire scored according four type employee with the fuzzy matrix given and these category employee are given different weight specifically managerial staff senior engineer middlelevel staff and general employee various type employee the blayer element are compared pairwise and the fuzzy judgment matrix thereby obtained the fuzzy judgment matrix used determine the fuzzy consistency the four matrix namely and the weight order vector that can solved taking example the solution given therefore similarly given the above the weight the four category employee can added and the blevel weight vector can obtained follows result the weight vector the criterion layer the target layer given the construction the total weight vector the criterion layer the target layer can determined follows the core enterprise asset weight and ranked first the operating weight which ranked second the credit record weight thereby being ranked third the industry position weight and ranked fourth the ranking constructed above show that commercial bank are primarily concerned with the asset status the core enterprise followed the core enterprise operation then the credit record the core enterprise and finally the core enterprise industry status under the premise calculating the weight the criterion layer the weight value each risk factor the index layer can also obtained according the questionnaire survey result the four kind employee the risk factor the index layer are compared with each other the fuzzy judgment matrix constructed and the single ranking weight vector obtained according the judgment matrix this paper the weight vector the criterion layer each element the layer taken example the fuzzy judgment matrix constructed follows the same method used obtain the weight vector namely therefore similarly based the weight vector the four kind employee fuzzy judgment matrix the weight coefficient four kind employee are added obtain the group weight vector follows therefore the weight vector the criterion layer the index layer given similarly the weight vector the criterion layer the index layer can summarized given below the weight vector the criterion layer the index layer given the weight vector criterion layer the index layer given the weight vector criterion layer the index layer given the weight vector the target layer can obtained calculating the criterion layer weight vector for the target layer and the index layer taking the index the weight vector the operating capacity calculated similarly can derive the weight vector risk factor the index layer according the degree importance risk factor were ranked follows profitability operating capacity monetary fund solvency account receivable inventory past performance macroenterprise environment enterprise development and enterprise credit rating based the importance ranking the index layer the ranking the indicator and the importance evaluating the standard level basically the same the indicator business performance and asset status are the forefront the core corporate credit risk and are the two factor affecting core enterprise credit risk the most therefore mean fuzzy analytic hierarchy process quantitative risk assessment can performed this approach can very helpful conducting key analysis observation for financial institution provide supply chain financing for purpose determining the key financial indicator concluding remark supply chain finance good medicine solve the financing problem small and mediumsized enterprise smes which can effectively alleviate the capital constraint smes and achieve benefit for many participant the supply chain therefore core enterprise should improve their economic strength adjusting their business strategy and innovation enhance enterprise competitiveness and improving their asset quality and credit record enhance their industry status and core competitiveness core enterprise should also carefully select smes the supply chain choosing those with good credit status higher industry position and strong profitability ensure the overall security and stability the supply chain reduce credit risk and enhance the overall competitiveness there are several suggestion regarding balancing the development supply chain finance building and dynamic improvement the supply chain financial risk evaluation and control system and establishing electronic database commercial bank present supply chain finance mainly used automobile steel and other industry which have large industry limitation important participant the supply chain core enterprise strengthen the strategic cooperative relationship the supply chain member that supply chain financing can extended other industry solve the financing constraint smes the core enterprise can also use their own advantage expand supply chain financing other industry maximize the profit among different industry group this way core enterprise can play important role supply chain finance supply chain finance involved the exchange capital flow information flow and logistics the major participant include bank core enterprise and smes order maintain the interest all party necessary construct and perfect the risk evaluation and control system this requires establishing scientific concept risk management and risk assessment based real transaction the main business object involved supply chain financing should strictly controlled control variety risk dynamic adjustment the weight and improving the supply chain financial risk assessment system unified information file should collected based the core enterprise including the operating condition asset status industry status credit record effective information the database collecting related data upstream and downstream the archive around the core enterprise developing data information system electronic data information and updating the database accurately using the latest information that might available finally through the establishment database the supply chain finance supply chain finance and modern information technology are integrated establish the sharing information resource and realize the exchange information flow capital flow and logistics between bank the core enterprise and small and mediumsized enterprise will thereby function more smoothly which not only improves the efficiency the supply chain operation but should also reduce variety risk and improve the efficiency and effectiveness supply chain finance author contribution data curation weiming mou formal analysis weiming
