technology guangzhou china abstract financing the bottleneck that restricting the development china small and medium enterprise the root cause financing difficulty for smes the serious information asymmetry that exists between financial institution which lead adverse selection and moral hazard this paper financing theory smes information dissymmetry and credit rationing theory are used analyze the financing difficulty for smes and financing strategy crack financing difficulty are proposed keywords small and medium enterprise information asymmetry adverse selection moral hazard financing strategy jel classification code introduction china smes have gradually become great force for promoting economic development related data show that sme financing come mainly from the external financing financial intermediary egbanks however due the information about sme business status and credit status not totally known bank they tend consciously cut down loan lending smes this exactly what call credit rationing behavior result many small and medium enterprise will forced close down for lack fund therefore how break financing barrier facing sme under asymmetric information and promote the growth and development smes make full use role played economic development can said are currently the most pressing problem solved analysis impact information asymmetry financing behavior information asymmetry that exists between smes and financial the root cause the small and mediumsized enterprise financing difficulty lie the serious institution asymmetric information mean that one party access relevant information while the other lack the relevant information the information more than the former unfortunately lack relevant information would have adverse impact decisionmaking the latter party further lead inefficiency resource allocation fact asymmetric information can divided into ante informational asymmetry and information asymmetry ante asymmetric information can lead adverse selection information asymmetry lead moral hazard applying the theory asymmetric information analyze credit market scan provide theoretical basis resolve financing problem bothering the small and mediumsized enterprise copyright ccbyncnd asian business consortium gdeb page global disclosure economics and business volume issn information asymmetry lead adverse selection adverse selection happens when information related the borrower credit project risk and benefit are known more borrower than financial institution other word the borrower have relative information advantage therefore financial institution the relative disadvantaged position are only able raise lending rate reduce potential risk credit loss however rising interest rate loan may lead those normal bluechip company withdraw from the lending market because they not want pay the premium term market interest rate the other hand those company who having poor business performance pure cheater tend acquire loan from bank they willing pay higher interest rate strange seems loan interest rate may turn out reduce rather than increase bank earnings this case most bank would probably choose relatively low interest rate and refuse part the demand for loan rather than select higher interest rate and try meet all the borrower demand for loan this socalled the first kind credit rationing behavior more precise among all the application for loan some got being admitted while some others are denied even when the smes willing paid more interest because the relative weakness small and medium enterprise themselves compared with larger enterprise understandable that smes become the main target been administered credit rationing many smes have been eliminated from market because lacking the access loan thus asymmetric information lead adverse selection which would aggravate the financing difficulty for smes information asymmetry lead moral hazard moral hazard financial market occurs when the borrower already acquired the loan due the financial institution are unable supervise the borrowing company all the time and obtain effective information about the borrower willingness pay back loan business performance and where the loan there are chance that borrowing company may violate the original commitment they made when signing the loan contract and engage highrisk investment intentionally flight from debt other word bank can not completely know and control what indeed the borrower use loan for and whether they would pay the money back not the borrower are likely take risk default the engagement this opportunistic practice what know moral hazard could lead bad debt which could take toll bank guarantee loan safety and profitability bank and other financial institution for one thing will implement credit rationing policy that reducing lending smes avoid moral hazard which what called the second act credit rationing precisely speaking the applicant borrowing requirement will only partially met such applying for million but only receiving million which can lead atrophy the sme loan market for the other financial institution may raise loan threshold strengthen smes credit appraisal and management order reduce the lending loss arise from the moral hazard however this reaction will boost the transaction cost between bank and enterprise dramatically addition smes also have difficulty come with satisfying mortgage the financial institution therefore financial institution may not dare lend any loan smes conclude asymmetric information lead moral hazard which would further exacerbate the financing difficulty smes the transaction cost increase caused asymmetric information transaction cost can divided into two kind one happens before signing the contract with any borrower which can call searching cost due the asymmetric copyright ccbyncnd asian business consortium gdeb page global disclosure economics and business volume issn information the bank take effort term money and time search for information which can reflect the real situation the enterprise ensure the safety and efficiency loan and prevent the borrower fraud these information varying from financial statement the credit rating level quality management cash flow business prospect and forth however information related this not easy obtain the credit market because most which are highly internalized and not accessible which will drive the cost information searching fact the more incomplete and the transparent the information the higher searching cost will the other transaction cost loanafter supervision cost prevent borrowing enterprise from gambling behavior and speculation the bank also need certain cost supervising but most small and mediumsized enterprise are familyowned and implement extensive management their financial accounting practice and most often are not standard the financial information obtained bank often inaccurate and can reflect the real situation smes making the process information searching and supervising even more difficult addition loan small and mediumsized enterprise are small scale but much higher frequency which could enhance the supervision cost per unit contrast large enterprise have very huge advantage aspect such the credit rating valuable mortgage meanwhile information them relatively transparent and accessible all these advantage can effectively reduce the cost searching for information transaction object and cost supervision comparing the cost benefit and risk among different type enterprise financial institution will inevitably resort large enterprise reducing the loan small and mediumsized enterprise which further aggravate the financing difficulty facing the small and mediumsized enterprise counter measure financing difficulty under asymmetric information the smes themselves need strengthen their internal governance mechanism present common that chinese smes have several universal problem such having unsound corporate financial system and inaccuracy financial report smes should strengthen their internal governance mechanism and improve the standardization the enterprise financial system and enterprise information transparency moreover smes should offer effective financial report with high authenticity help commercial bank make judgment besides smes should pay more attention the credit consciousness and set good credit image financial institution when the credit level enterprise risen financial institution will change their impression toward smes and bank will change their credit orientation hence the financing difficulty will handled completely developing and standardizing local small and medium financial institution regional and local small and medium financial institution have relative advantage term low transaction cost and information when providing financing support for smes that because local mall and medium financial institution are more accessible local information and can make full use them thus they can easily gather information about operational performance development prospect and credit rating level smes relative lower cost what more important they also have comparative advantage credit screening and loanafter supervision smes which they easily overcome information asymmetry that can lead the problem moral hazard and high transaction cost
