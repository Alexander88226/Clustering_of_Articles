and scholar with the unpredictable cryptocurrency value the controversy surrounding the cryptocurrency hype remains vigorous however academic research investigated the individual cryptocurrency acceptance behavior especially developing country context drawing the literature blockchain cryptocurrency ebanking and unified theory acceptance and use technology utaut this paper aim propose model that integrates cryptocurrency dimension antecedent and utaut construct examine the factor that influence individual cryptocurrency acceptance behavior malaysia this study employ quantitative approach collecting online survey questionnaire data evaluate the proposed model using partial least square structural equation modeling plssem approach this paper appears valuable contribution that provides regulator and cryptocurrency practitioner highlevel overview potential individual cryptocurrency acceptance factor keywords blockchain cryptocurrency acceptance conceptual model malaysia utaut introduction the rapid advancement technology driven the internet revolution profoundly affected the global financial market the lee and shin since then financial technology fintech emerged new term describe the embracement novel technology that transform financial activity more effective and efficient gai keke according milian existing fintech literature show the most discussed subject included network externality electronic banking cryptocurrency big data and biometrics authentication the most recent technology been introduced fintech blockchain one undeniable fact that the blockchain

this doe not repel the fact that this technology and cryptocurrency serf enabling force for economics transformation which the ability transform the conventional financial service morkunas beyond the financial sector blockchainbased solution have been deployed wide array context for instance there electronic medical record system chen wanitcharakkhakul and rotchanakitumnuai supply chain casadovaraa chang manufacturing liu zhang intelligent transportation system kang kato twentythird pacific asia conference information system china what determines the acceptance cryptocurrency malaysia analysis based utaut fintech context the extant blockchain literature pointed various advantage this technology which evident the advent cryptocurrency cryptocurrency peertopeer version electronic cash that allows online payment sent directly from one party another without going through financial institution crosby the most mentioned benefit include decentralization ermakova walton and johnston low transaction fee baur seetharaman and speedy transaction gao and khairuddin however the negative sentiment associated with cryptocurrency alarming when involved money laundering illegal marketplace and cyber hacking zulhuda and sayuti global regulator are yet assimilated into standardized regulatory framework because the regulator stance the legitimacy cryptocurrency remains ambiguity pieters and vivanco considering the uncertainty future cryptocurrency and the radical skepticism about price fluctuation becomes interesting investigate individual behavior when come accepting and adopting cryptocurrency the emerging literature reported cryptocurrency acceptance and adoption study the context developed country especially european country ermakova roos wahl however the cryptocurrency acceptance behavior and the factor that drive such acceptance far limitedly explored especially the developing country context henry kick and connolly while the malaysian government officially launched regulatory framework monitor cryptocurrency exchange business january envisaged that cryptocurrency will still around for the foreseeable future hence paramount importance grasp the understanding cryptocurrency acceptance behavior before wellestablished cryptocurrency system can come into place achieve this this study strives answer the following research question what are the driver cryptocurrency acceptance malaysia top that this study aim provide the blockchain and cryptocurrency enthusiast with better understanding the acceptance pattern and behavior resides the malaysian individual level the study seek encourage merchant ponder upon the business opportunity granted the implementation cryptocurrencyfriendly payment system this also add competitive advantage and value their business integrating the business model with innovative financial solution while cryptocurrency present new paradigm transaction this study pave the way for individual stay abreast this digital era where blockchainbased solution are receiving massive attention with respect regulator this study provides valuable insight into developing sophisticated and holistic governance model from technical point view this study potentially help blockchainbased financial solution developer contemplate the current issue payment system towards the development ideal and secure payment system additionally this study also flourish the literature blockchain fintech and adoption theoretical background technology acceptance and adoption theory with the rapid progression information and communication technology technology acceptance theory became essential help understanding acceptance and adoption behavior since the past decade scholar have dedicated significant effort build robust technology acceptance model these include theory reasoned action tra technology acceptance model tam davis model utilization mpcu thompson theory planned behavior tpb azjen social cognitive theory sct compeau and higgins innovation diffusion theory idt moore and benbasat unified theory acceptance and use technology utaut venkatesh venkatesh order build solid theoretical foundation for this study the theory were reviewed decide the most suitable theory adapted into the cryptocurrency acceptance context tra sct and tpb focus how social factor influence person behavior another word the technological factor which important this novel financial innovation disregarded moreover the construct embedded tam are not comprehensive enough address cryptocurrency acceptance mpcu specifically deal with the factor that impact worker use computer the workplace while the evolution cryptocurrency frequently growing idt requires relatively static input predict individual behavior meanwhile the original utaut model emphasizes the organizational twentythird pacific asia conference information system china what determines the acceptance cryptocurrency malaysia analysis based utaut context which doe not take individual behavioral factor into consideration overall this study doe not opt for these mentioned theory understand cryptocurrency acceptance this vein the utaut model which extended from utaut appeared the most suitable approach because robust and comprehensive model that focus individual context also deal with technological and social factor from good number existing study the utaut model been proven work understanding the acceptance numerous technology for instance the patient use laboratory electronic portal ravangard mobile internet for mobile user kralji and tek internet banking application for elderly people jorge moura and learning management system ain well google classroom for university student jakkaew and hemrungrote these literature show that the model partially fully supported the hypothesized relationship different context additionally existing empirical study have demonstrated that online survey questionnaire feasible data collection tool for cryptocurrency acceptance and adoption study abramova and hme gunawan and novendra shahzad proposed research model while the original utaut model that examined the use mobile internet which appeared generally widespread technology the current era this study spark the literature examining the more recent and novel blockchainbased cryptocurrency given that venkatesh conducted the original utaut study developed country context hong kong china this present work aim bridge this gap targeting developing country context malaysia since both type country different term the progression technological infrastructure and the economic status worth examining how the finding will altered from the original study the other hand dwivedi have reported that the moderator utaut model gender age and experience were typically dropped and one possible reason that the effect moderator doe not bring significant variation for technology acceptance and adoption context while the nature this study longitudinal prior literature show that inappropriate include experience the moderator due the incompetency acquiring the respondent increasing level experience different point time period jorge this study considers the novelty and recency cryptocurrency can result lack individual interaction and familiarity with the use cryptocurrency which inadequate form the different habit level hence the construct habit excluded adhering the research objective examining the cryptocurrency acceptance behavior the behavioral intention sufficient measure the degree acceptance and thus usage behavior eliminated the exclusion usage behavior supported prior study nikolopoulos and likothanassis queiroz and wamba also inappropriate include usage behavior construct while this study doe not delineate the passage time from how the individual transform their initial intention the actual use cryptocurrency addition the construct originally embedded utaut the proposed model includes three cryptocurrency dimension antecedent considering the legitimacy cryptocurrency not reached international consensus this study sought include government regulation take the role regulator into consideration another aspect that this study considers cryptocurrency feature that make unique from the conventional currency including transaction feature predictor individual acceptance behavior besides the inclusion price volatility paramount importance because the fluctuation cryptocurrency value resulted deep skepticism nutshell these make original contribution the field technology acceptance study malaysia conceptual model conceptual model derived based the literature blockchain cryptocurrency electronic banking and technology acceptance study figure display the illustration the conceptual model which used towards the development hypothesis statement twentythird pacific asia conference information system china what determines the acceptance cryptocurrency malaysia analysis based utaut hypothesis development figure proposed conceptual model the flaw and drawback the current digital payment solution credit card paypal have led novel approach digital payment blockchainbased cryptocurrency baur apart from the first cryptocurrency bitcoin there are over thousand viable alternative which have different strength the unique and novel cryptocurrency feature included but not limited improved transaction speed gao gunawan and novendra mendozatello lower transaction cost for remittance ermakova folkinshteyn and lennon anonymity and privacy seetharaman shehhi well intermediary removal gao walton and johnston while these feature are expected beneficial for consumer this study postulate the following hypothesis cryptocurrency transaction feature influence performance expectancy positively while the legitimacy cryptocurrency remains debatable among global regulator bollen pieters and vivanco the establishment regulation regulator play decisive role for mass acceptance and adoption shahzad the study argues that the exchange rate bitcoin versus dollar will increase significantly the regulator support come into place seetharaman malaysian regulator have shown their support allocating investment fund for peertopeer financing platform the same time safeguarding the public interest establishing the regulation govern cryptocurrency exchange and initial coin offering which came into force january zmudzinski since this standpoint might encourage the development technological infrastructure digital exchange platform digital wallet application support the cryptocurrencybased payment system this study hypothesizes that cryptocurrency government regulation influence facilitating condition positively unlike the governmentcontrolled malaysian ringgit myr bank rakyat malaysia doe not control the supply cryptocurrency hence inevitable that the cryptocurrency market highly volatile compared the conventional fiat currency berentsen and sch undeniable that the cryptocurrency price fluctuation incur fear within individual baur the other hand surprising finding show that drastic increase price volatility attracts individual adoption behavior for monetary gain farell henry besides urquhart found that the volatility and trading volume cryptocurrency significantly drive public attention this study argues that the price volatility will affect user perception the cryptocurrency value because monetary cost fluctuates line with price hence the following hypothesis formed cryptocurrency price volatility pvl influence price value positively discussed cryptocurrency leverage blockchain technology appear alternative digital payment system with unique transaction feature address the drawback traditional financial service therefore expected that user can gain prominent benefit from cryptocurrency adoption kumpajaya and dhewanto and shahzad suggested that the acknowledgment the perceived usefulness cryptocurrency daily life play role cryptocurrency acceptance and adoption behavior with that the hypothesis formed below twentythird pacific asia conference information system china what determines the acceptance cryptocurrency malaysia analysis based utaut performance expectancy positive impact behavioral intention use cryptocurrency new paradigm the field fintech newly launched late nakamoto cryptocurrency still immature landscape despite unnecessary understand the backend cryptocurrency system use cryptocurrency some basic technical and financial knowledge necessary deal with the digital wallet and exchange platform existing cryptocurrency study show that the knowledge about cryptocurrency system may decrease the chance being scammed abramova and hme shehhi line with the study henry and kumpajaya and dhewanto cryptocurrency acceptance behavior depends the individual belief about perceived ease cryptocurrency use this study hypothesizes that effort expectancy positive impact behavioral intention use cryptocurrency one the success factor for the cryptocurrency attributed the large network effect the consumption social medium increasing steadily walton and johnston prior study have shown that social influence great impact individual acceptance behavior because people tend gather information and listen advice from other people related product service before the actual adoption megadewandanu line with that zhang recommended that widespread electronic banking acceptance could achieved through the power wordofmouth considering money much societal and psychological context anticipated that social attention one the important driver cryptocurrency acceptance this lead the following hypothesis social influence positive impact behavioral intention use cryptocurrency based the finding queiroz and wamba the facilitating condition construct affect blockchain adoption the developed country the usa but play role developing country context india this because developed country tends have adequate facilitating condition support new technology whereas the lack infrastructure developing country might become one the impediment contrast gunawan and novendra showed that facilitating condition affect cryptocurrency use indonesia and individual are satisfied with the existing facility and infrastructure behind the use cryptocurrency view the increasing number blockchain solution provider malaysia worth examining how the availability facilitating condition impact cryptocurrency behavior hence this study hypothesizes that facilitating condition positive impact behavioral intention use cryptocurrency apart from the functionality technology one the extrinsic motivation factor the original utaut model found that intrinsic motivation also led technology acceptance and adoption venkatesh megadewandanu are line with the original study and the author suggested that the concept gamification can fuse into the mobile wallet application increase hedonic motivation while cryptocurrency can used transactional currency and investment asset for monetary gain predicted that this motivates individual engagement towards cryptocurrency another example intrinsic motivation provided cryptocurrency the sense freedom while using the decentralized and anonymous cryptocurrency bashir the individual curiosity and attractiveness the novel blockchain technology and cryptocurrency also contributed the increase hedonic motivation this hypothesized follows hedonic motivation positive impact behavioral intention use cryptocurrency the individual level the price value factor should taken into consideration the individual who the technology will need bear all the associated cost venkatesh previous empirical study have shown that individual behavioral intention adopt mobile internet banking impacted the price value factor jorge mahfuz since the price cryptocurrency determined the global market demand and supply value relatively volatile and unstable compared the fiat currency berentsen and sch therefore this study proposes the following hypothesis twentythird pacific asia conference information system china what determines the acceptance cryptocurrency malaysia analysis based utaut price value positive impact behavioral intention use cryptocurrency methodology this study intends investigate the factor that directly and indirectly impact cryptocurrency acceptance behavior the individual level specifically the target unit analysis focus malaysian individual who are equipped with cryptocurrency knowledge following quantitative methodology this study will use survey questionnaire data collection tool since cryptocurrency anonymous nature unable retrieve complete list individual who are accepting cryptocurrency therefore nonprobabilistic sampling method purposive sampling will employed with the aim achieving theory generalization instead sample generalization memon the minimum sample size required for actual data collection which calculated with gpower software faul with the gathered survey data the proposed model will evaluated using plssem with smartpls software hair ringle conclusion with the disruptive effect that brought blockchain technology and the anticipated impact cryptocurrency fintech field this study timely such aim understand blockchainbased cryptocurrency acceptance whose advantage are not entirely cleared whose skepticism are still rising and whose diffusion path remains uncertain term theoretical contribution this study attempt expand the usage utaut cryptocurrency context proposing model enable better understanding how individual behave towards cryptocurrency that leverage the nascent technology blockchain addition the original utaut construct the proposed model considers cryptocurrency characteristic include three new predictor technology acceptance behavior top that this study focus the context developing country and thereafter scholar can work crosscountry
