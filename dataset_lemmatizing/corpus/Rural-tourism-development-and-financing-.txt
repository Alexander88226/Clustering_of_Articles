the population life the predominantly rural area compared the the average and where there are consistent discrepancy concerning the level the development consumption investment etc compared with the urban area nevertheless sustainable rural development can not achieved the absence sustainable business especially other activity and sector than agriculture given mentioned the large proportion the population living rural area and the large contribution agriculture the gdp formation jen among them undoubtedly rural tourism meet the condition sustainable nonagricultural activity and adequately address the considerable potential natural and cultural touristic resource the regionunfortunately the venture operating rural area and particularly tourism face overall higher difficulty accessing finance compared similar urban business they get competitive financing offer there are few supplier fund and thus fewer financial product and service adequate local particularity drabenstott and meeker the ruralbased venture tend rely mostly small local bank finance their debt and often have little choice when searching for alternative source the equity finance many case the gap financial

public and private effort should more focused achieving this goal sustainable way however case all smes the survival and the expansion the venture operating rural tourism still face numerous restriction and uncertainty agricecon czech doi agriceconconstraints and obstacle especially related the access the financing resource overview the literature the financing constraint rural tourism currently the access firm financing source could achieved two way source through the internal financing mainly from the owner contribution and retained earnings profit through the external financing fund attracted from the family friend and the capital market source bank financial company and equity investor according demirguckunt developing country the firm order cover their need for survival even growth use external financing significant proportion for large company and about for smes however much lower percentage the productive investment need are covered from the external source bank about for large company and than for small firm the smes access finance particularly more difficult due several constraint and failure coming both from the government institution and from the market environmental factor the macroeconomic instability the role public sector the level development the financial system poor enforcement contract ineffective bankruptcy law etc supply side factor informational asymmetry high transaction cost weak property right the efficiency the banking sector physical barrier accessing fund and the lack exit opportunity for investment and demand side factor deriving from the own limitation the firm such the management skill low willingness access certain type finance and improper corporate practice sinha and fiesta the following part will focus those constraint which occur more frequently the rural tourism activitiesthe macroeconomic instability the fiscal system and policy state intervention boyd honohan high inflation the exchange rate fluctuation the high interest rate and shorter loan maturity make the firm access finance more difficult and more expensive demirguckunt the rural particularly agricultural sector benefit from the public involvement through the establishment and capitalization bank and development agency strategic infrastructure project agricecon czech original paperdoi agriceconwhile positive first glance these intervention create preferential access public fund and bank loan for certain category company usually the large company the overlapping between the state institution and bank private not regarding the smes financing will distort the market mechanism and competition and will reduce the incentive for the private sector participate the market ram consultancy service demirguckunt the informational asymmetry reduces the access lending due the fact that the information about entrepreneurial venture not easily accessible lender the lack the relevant historical record the credit relation and risk profile the few data and knowledge about customer and supplier the precarious and unprofessionally prepared financial statement etc create high risk perception from the bank side consequently limiting the access finance increasing cost and tightening the additional credit condition collateral covenant monitoring which will end off discouraging the firm borrowfinancial institution mainly the bank are sometimes reluctant lend the smes due the high cost per customer risk and impossibility recover these cost through the economy scale widening relationship with those client degryse and van cayseele like corporate financing the smes including rural tourism venture are requested supply detailed business plan documentation and risk scenario and commitment legal form together with long credit approval period while often the repayment period shorter the financial and time cost obtain credit can substantial relative the size the enterprise and hinder the smes from the banking financing ram consultancy service most case the firm can not meet the bank requirement for the loan collateral due the insufficient asset not only because their small size due the early stage development but also because the entrepreneursowners are reluctant reinvest profit their company ram consultancy service physical restriction location also affect the access finance most the developing country banking concentration major urban area contrast with the bank absence rural area sinha and fiesta especially the monoagricultural and isolated community where the physical element the distance can act limiting factor searching and finding the appropriate funding beck poor financial and managerial skill low educational level the impossibility acquire the additional knowledge the disinterest financial matter the modern method monitoring planning and management could easily make the difference between successful stagnant business between growth survival even failurethe unwillingness enter into credit relation attract equity investor even the fear the complication which may arise tax complicated and frequent report also explain why some cautious entrepreneur may choose remain with small business protect their ownership they perceive the benefit economic growth offset the cost the legal system the corruption public official cressy and olofsson financial constraint are higher for the startup and small firm while large firm especially foreignowned with significant history and record seem face fewer difficulty access capital beck carreira and silva financial constraint are particularly experienced firm operating agriculture due specific sectoral risk and the long history public sector intervention world bank moreover smes from information and communication technology ict leisure tourism including rural tourism innovative sector etc may feel discriminated due financing risk asset specificity smes particular profile rural area based series distinctive characteristic the rural environment thus the small size local market including the labour market and occupation associated with low population density and low income per caput household can impose constraint rapidly growing smes smallbone furthermore the availability business premise transport and communication infrastructure barkema and drabenstott and the access information advice and business service and finance smallbone augment the picture rural business smes located rural area are more stable use fewer employee and their financial performance weaker than for urbanbased smes carrington and zantoko term romania comparison notice that apart from some minor difference these factor act relatively similar the difference between romania and other cee country and the rest the country seems reside the behaviour original paper and involvement local authority and institution education and training supporting market institution and banking system accessing the financial support grant etc piasecki and rogut smallbone and welter research methodologyto address our objective investigating creditor involvement the availability and constraint financing venture operating rural tourism designed and implement surveybased research from the supplyside perspective creditor especially bank the research carried out part wider project investigating the relevant issue the importance the relationship between smes acting rural tourism and bank specific sectoral financing issue tourism business risk peculiarity able affect the credit policy the most adequate type bank for the smes tourism etc the questionnaire contained question divided into three main theme the importance relationship banking supply and demand for funding and rural tourism financing issue the majority question have multiplescale response two were open question and finally two question concerned the information about the respondentsthe questionnaire administered during january march data collection focused gathering information especially from the bank manager the smes risk manager and the smes relationship manager from different bank romania took into consideration that the staff holding these managerial position specific training job responsibility direct intermediated contact with loan request and application and consequently they could provide the relevant answer could thus avoid the common general and unrelated opinion from other bank employee without experience specific responsibility the smes financing most the respondent were employed bank unit located the northwestern region romania and the rest the centre region and western region the large majority the respondent work the branch and the rest the bank head office result the survey the primary dataset consisted response from the manager working bank out the total bank existing romania the date performing the survey after removing agricecon czech doi agriceconthe questionnaire containing error the resulted valid sample consisted responsesgiven that the majority response were collected from the northwest region romania and the rest from the centre and west region check the issue their representativeness indeed there are special feature different economic law regulation for this area special behaviour practice coming from the bank and government agency related the smes rural business compared other region romania anything else that could influence the representativeness the result order specifically address our research objective focused the following five research question are the bank interested ineffectively involved financing the rural tourism business similar extent with business operating other sector bank consider the financing ruralbased tourism venture relatively riskier than the business operating other sector the bank size and origin significantly influence their involvement financing the rural tourism venture which are the most important risk factor financing the rural tourism smes which are the characteristic the tourism business proved adequate ensure more probable reimburse loan result and discussionrq are the bank interested ineffectively involved financing the rural tourism business similar extent with business operating other sector starting from the common typology tourist activity practiced rural area the touristic and agrotouristic boarding house the type financing working capital investment financing and cofinancing project with the european fund etc found the following result from the valid response there were respondent indicating that the bank they represent been involved financing the rural tourism business the term the type financing noticed that the working capital loan are the least accessed mentioned only bank representative probably due the banking requirement and the firm manager opinion that operating activity can supported from the agricecon czech doi agriceconcurrent income instead the appeal for the bank support investment project such construction modernization equipment and facility purchasing project that are difficult covered only the distributed profit and the shareholder contribution mentioned bank representative finally the involvement the bank financing project implemented with the fund most often mentioned respectively bank representative there are some explanation for this last situation the existence already checked and approved business and project the existence collateral and certain repayment source especially the case when the bank cofinancing covered the repayment instalment from implementing agency and last but not least acceptable degree utilization these fund considerably higher than the national average aggregately response indicate the bank involvement only one form financing whichever response indicate the involvement bank two different form and response indicate the involvement all three form financing the rural tourism activity regarding how the bank perceive the risk associated with the rural tourism business bank consider financing the ruralbased tourism venture relatively riskier than the business operating other sector the result indicate case the bank representative who strongly agree with this statement agree were neutral disagree and strongly disagree with the weighted average calculated the average response ranging from strongly disagreement strongly agreement the rural tourism business seem considered the bank slightly riskier than the business other sector however the perceived risk lower than the risk expected for the entire tourism sector there are two possible explanation the one hand the rural tourism activity affected the crisis due the reorientation the touristic flow from table bank perception the risk financing the rural tourism business calculated the weighted average the response ranging from strongly disagreement strongly agreement averagebanks ownershipforeign domestic privatestatebanks sizesmall top banksbankssource author calculation based the datasetoriginal paperthe expensive foreign destination more affordable national destination and from the classic resort the expensive guest house rural area the other hand most the respondent indicate that they cofinanced the european project implementation which involved reasonable amount money and lower risk defaultregarding the ownership the bank size bank size and origin significantly influence their involvement financing the rural tourism venture the score recorded the foreign owned bank the subsidiary multinational bank romania which represented about the romanian banking system asset the closest the average while the private domestic bank with score are likely consider rural tourism sector with higher risk than other sector the contrary for the stateowned bank rural business are considered quite risky with the score significantly far beyond the average analyzing the bank perception their size found significant difference both bank from the top size with the score and small bank with are about close the averageanother relevant issue concern the most important risk factor taken into consideration the financing the smes

premise that most these event affect the rural tourism firm reduced manner quite surprisingly relatively low score attributed the collateral problem which can explained the quite frequent involvement cofinancing the european project where the associated risk are limited and the specific collateral requirement are diminished finally surveyed the bank representative regarding their opinion the repayment possibility and more specifically which are the characteristic the tourism business proved more adequate enable the loan reimbursing data from table reveal that the bank rate very important the diversification activity and alternative source income and maintaining low indebtedness level these opinion are predictable they come from the creditor side but they are also appropriate the nature the rural tourism business where the risk concentration sole touristic activity consistent and the excessive investment could fatal small business the case low and unstable tourist flow obviously the affiliation recognized brand and joining the reservation system could provide flow which are relatively stable over time and could generate sufficient cashflow positive aspect the fact that the bank not encourage excessively prudent investment policy aware that the valorisation the opportunity and the diversification activity and income source could achieved only with adequate facility and with reasonable amount specialized asset conclusion and policy implicationsrural tourism could both chance for the rural area revival and possible solution the problem ecting them moreover for sustainable development rural tourism bene cial for the local community also necessary that the business local and capitalize also the favourable naturebased resource and the cultural heritage tradition history and local speci city consistent with other research found that the supply funding for rural business somewhat weaker and competitive compared the urbanbased business financing small business operating rural tourism provided two main source the government program and bank found that the bank could support and supplement the necessary fund both the case independent investment and the case accessing the public source fund although considered slightly riskier than other sector the rural tourism business could good opportunity for the bank under certain condition erefore the smes should made rational and intelligent investment they should diversify their incomegenerating activity and increase the experience and responsibility management our study con rmed however that certain caution the lender can not attributed only the relatively small size the business the collateral the nancial performance but also the quality management and ability transform the existing opportunity into viable plan the other hand partially refuting the previous research found that far from the agglomeration and overlapping between the private funding and the government intervention the bank are involved and complement the funding opportunity ered the public support programswe found that the domestic private bank have greater willingness and propensity finance rural agricecon czech doi agriceconbusinesses and the logical relation between the nature the capital these bank and the local inland specificity these business should not ignored when designing the future economic policy rural tourism business still need genuine adequate support especially for the smes besides the classical corporate investment and largescale public project the tourism infrastructure development however our research show that even there are some difference between the type bank willing get involved the rural tourism business such difference are not consistent they were outlined the literature empirical study conducted other country the existence profitable business the company capacity mitigate risk and generate diversified growth are targeted any bank regardless size capital locationpolicies support the rural business should regional goal and systematic approach avoiding focus only the shortterm ect most rural community have reduced critical mass economic initiative and therefore they can ord very small margin error the moderate interest bank the ruralbased tourism business boosted through better synergy and complementarity with the public assistance program particular through the access the fund for rural tourism the long run these could lead diversi cation the funding supply from all bank the market found that some the perceived business risk and the loan repayment capacity are fuelled external factor which are uenced the administrative action seasonality external event conclusion the policy support the rural tourism business should focused improving other aspect which could help strengthening the rural tourism business such developing managerial skill supporting the association and cooperation between rms providing loan guarantee identifying opportunity for the diversi cation income source authority should avoid the fragmentation program the overlapping erent supporting policy finally considerable attention should
