herein filecaroline stern fintechs and their emergence banking service cesee over the last year the development financial technology the banking sector got new twist with the emergence numerous small startup called fintechs some the new technology will probably make specific area the banking business more efficient while others may have the potential disrupt the traditional banking sector this paper present the outcome stocktaking exercise and show that most the new financial technology are still being used small scale given that the cesee region usually omitted discussion fintechs this paper aim closing this gap giving idea which activity exist this region with regard financial technology focusing three business area financial service payment and financing this study find that the level adoption new technology varies across the cesee country also handful country seem have more active fintech scene some area peertopeer lending than many their western neighborsjel classification gkeywords fintech nonbank financial institution banksin the recent past new financial service company have received ample medium coverage frequently referred fintechs which short for financial technology such firm could change the banking world know the fintech scene characterized thousand small startup but also wellestablished company like alibaba amazon and google the current dynamic this field reflected venture capital investment fintechs which soared from usd billion usd billion worldwide kpmg the financial sector these development are expected hand hand with enhanced efficiency well with workforce reduction moreover fintechs may foster financial inclusion especially emerging country traditional bank have already reacted the rise fintech embarking new digitalization project the european commission defines fintechs technologyenabled innovation financial service regardless the nature size the provider the service small body research dealing with fintechs already exists the usa the and china there are hardly any pertinent study focusing central eastern and southeastern europe cesee however therefore this paper meant fill this gap and shed light the cesee region with regard fintechs structured follows section describes the current development with regard fintechs section give more indepth overview different fintech business area and their emergence cesee and section concludes oesterreichische nationalbank foreign research division carolinestern oenbat the view expressed this paper are exclusively those the author and not necessarily reflect those the oenb the eurosystem the author would like thank peter back thomas reininger julia all oenb well two anonymous referee for helpful comment and valuable suggestion this study includes the following country the cesee member state bulgaria the czech republic estonia croatia hungary lithuania latvia poland romania slovenia and slovakia the western balkan country albania bosnia and herzegovina and serbia russia and ukraine however data are not available for all the abovementioned country all area this study oesterreichische nationalbank fintechs and their emergence banking service cesee fintechs current developmentsfintechs offer financial service which have date usually been provided traditional bank contrast the latter most fintechs not hold banking license yet some fintechs which had risen critical size and started offering additional financial service had licensed bankcredit institution alibaba china and germany still most fintechs are small startup that their own account have competitive advantage over traditional bank after all they offer new and unique innovative financial service while the same time being much more flexible adapting new market situation comparison with big traditional bank fact fintechs usually specialize only one particular type service and consider retail customer andor small and mediumsized enterprise smes their main target group the financial service offer can standardized they may provided very low variable costsunlike traditional bank fintechs which are usually not licensed bank not have fulfill comprehensive regulatory requirement however this doe not mean that these company are not regulated all one approach fintech regulation use the existing regulatory framework andor amend capture fintech company for example the many fintechs fall under the payment service directive psd directive and especially the new payment service directive psd directive which recently amended integrate new business model mainly fintechs still the psd and psd based regulatory requirement for payment service institution are far comprehensive than the regulatory requirement for credit institution laid down the capital requirement regulation crr regulation and the capital requirement directive crd directive that are applicable the however this also implies that credit institution have more farreaching competence than payment service institution the former are allowed take deposit and perform term and risk transformation with deposit and other fund contrast under psd and psd payment service institution are not allowed take deposit they may grant loan very limited extent and have immediately safeguard any fund they receive following different approach some country have introduced special regulatory requirement for fintechs switzerland and the andor regulatory sandbox the latter offer company the possibility experimenting limited scale with innovative financial service without having comply with strict supervisory requirement one may argue that sandbox environment company well supervisor can learn how innovative financial service work usually regulatory sandbox are not limited small startup only but are also open traditional big bank the european commission likewise considers the introduction regulatory sandbox consultation paper fintech pose the question whether regulatory sandbox should facilitated created euwide basis european commission currently supervisory sandbox exist for example the hong kong singapore australia and malaysia how safeguarding mean that payment institution have immediately deposit the fund credit institution invest them secure liquid and lowrisk asset the first option the fund have secured insurance company the second option the fund are insured the credit institution they are part deposit insurance scheme see article directive focus european economic integration fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseeever when come the detail each these country own interpretation how regulatory sandbox should work the author knowledge cesee country yet introduced supervisory sandbox for fintechs russia contrast seen the establishment association for financial technology development which focus particular the development blockchain the technology behind for instance bitcoin once fintech startup grow material size they could pose risk financial stability this may well call for stricter regulationone might assume that fintechs are mainly active developed country fintechrelated medium coverage and research are concentrated developed country the and usa yet there are also remarkable development some emerging country case point china the market with most peertopeer lending platform namely around february with lending volume cny billion according wdzjcom kenya country where twothirds adult use their mobile phone send and receive payment demirguckunt this end they employ service like mpesa that are provided telecommunication company consequently this sparked lively discussion about whether fintechs could act catalyst promoting financial inclusion above all emerging country chart illustrates the state play financial inclusion term having bank account debit card and credit card number advanced economy cesee economy and the two largest emerging market economy one innovative feature fintechs operating payment service that they very often offer payment service which not require the ownership bank account instead for many such service suffices have mobile phone the ownership which already widespread emerging country see also chart even though according global findex data most cesee country more than have bank account bank account penetration still much lower many cesee country than western european country see chart ukraine bosnia and herzegovina around have bank account well albania than have bank account exhibit the lowest level chart also show that the ownership bank account doe not necessarily result the holding debit card moreover credit card are not popular the cesee region where than own credit card and even china where only have credit card hence the distribution and adoption new innovative payment method that not depend bank account could boost financial inclusion significantly albeit one specific area only wdzjcom private company operating china that collect data china lending industry mpesa service offered vodafone for transferring money with mobile phone doe not require bank account internet connection smartphone financial inclusion measured the three dimension access financial service usage financial service and the quality the product and the service delivery the indicator used this study are mainly access and usage indicator the world bank global findex database used this study which comprehensive database financial inclusion data stem from survey carried out partnership with gallup world poll the database based interview with about nationally representative and randomly selected adult aged and over more than country demirguckunt oesterreichische nationalbank fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseeuse traditional banking product varies signi cantly across cesee country respondent aged chart ukeesilv placcount nancial institutiondebit cardsk alcredit cardcn insource global findex database data business model fintechs not only rest payment service though they are extensive ranging from payment financing well financial and investment advisory service moreover fintechs explore new business area continuous basis for clarity this paper center merely company that offer banking service and excludes the following business area virtual currency bitcoin blockchain distributed ledger technology foreign currency exchange company that offer insurance product insurtechs fintechs which offer service related regulatory requirement regtechs corporation dealing with big data analysis and security cyber security hence this study fintech broken down into three broad business area financial service payment and financing chart fintech business areasfinancial servicespayments financingsource author compilationfocus european economic integration analysis personal nance trading platform robotization traditional form electronic payment debit and credit card credit transfer direct debit innovative form electronic payment emoney payment equity crowdfunding debt lending fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseeall these fintech offering may trigger positive change like enhanced financial education financial inclusion the flip side that some these business model may pose threat financial stability the startup reach certain size andor expose their customer various risk they may not fully aware risk related cyber security fintech business area and their emergence ceseethis section explores opportunity and threat different fintech business model and report fintech activity financial service payment and financing the cesee country financial servicesunder financial service summarize business that offer internetbased application for managing personal finance trading security trading platform and automating financial service robotization fintechs providing tool that help individual company manage their finance support customer for instance managing their financial cash flow and optimizing their spending structure they also offer financial accounting solution for smes but also bigger company one example this category the app spendee developed the czech firm cleevio which connects the user mobile phone with the customer bank account and downloads transaction sorting them into different category help the customer track their expense amount and location moreover user may define different wallet and share these with other people such analytical feature are usually not offered traditional bank number which have however already introduced least some analytical feature mostly their online banking application helping improve customer insight into their personal finance income and expense structure likely foster financial educationsecurities trading traditionally associated with high ancillary expense like transactionbased trading fee and relatively high deposit fee for security trading economically viable large volume are prerequisite consequently many people are excluded from security trading yet fintechs operating this business area offer online trading platform with very low deposit fee and very low transaction cost hence lower trading volume make economic sense too rule the customer interacts solely with the trading platform via the internet since these fintechs not offer persontoperson investment advisory service their service cost than those traditional bank the one hand online trading platform lower the entry barrier for private customer and open new investment possibility for them given the reduced transaction cost the other hand not all private customer may fully aware the risk suffering loss when investing financial market security moreover money already transferred the platform but not yet invested may not covered deposit insurance scheme and may lost should the platform become insolventfinally one large business area fintechs are active robotization service offered this area are very often connected the other two business area discussed above one example connection with personal finance the automation invoice payment with program automatically paying invoice time another example superfaktura slovak program for automating the creation oesterreichische nationalbank fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseeof invoice robotization also very popular when come wealth management socalled roboadvisors are program that invest money automatically based mathematical logarithm these automated investment may straightforward the roboadvisor always make deposit the bank with the highest deposit rate the deposit insurance threshold amount but they may also much more complex for instance roboadvisors may base their portfolio investment strategy several customerrelated imputation and decide the optimal investment strategy based these imputation coupled with mathematical algorithm therefore roboadvisors have the potential lower the search cost for personal customer finding the best rate and taking decision the best investment strategy furthermore financial advice based mathematical algorithm may neutral compared with financial advice from human the flip side personal customer might not fully aware how their input translate into investment decision roboadvisors which could lead undesired investment see also philippon moreover large volume are invested and investment decision are based the same mathematical algorithm herding behavior could amplified financial market last but not least customer service being robotized case point the romanian lender banca transilvania introduced livia communicate with customer facebook and skype paymentsfintechs providing innovative form electronic payment mostly via emoney which transferred via the internet via mobile phone the same time some fintechs offer service instant payment that make traditional form electronic payment more efficientwhile the traditional form electronic payment debit card credit card credit transfer and direct debit are linked bank account the more innovative solution work without bank account but have another prerequisite mobile phone internet access only cash continues the payment method universally available without any technical prerequisitescompanies offering innovative payment service have the potential for enhancing financial inclusion many country where bank account are not common advanced economy moreover many these company offer their service free cost very low cost electronic payment may also help reduce corruption and the shadow economy because their traceability see goel and mehrotra yet some these innovative payment method may also used for illegal purpose because their anonymity least the the psd and the revised psd the latter transposed into national law each member state january the latest already regulate most fintech company operating the area payment service worth mentioning that innovative electronic payment service not linked bank account are offered not only small fintech startup but increasingly also large wellestablished commercial bank one example the biggest bank croatia zagreba cka banka which been selected emea for virtual currency the eba considers this major risk european banking authority and the perceives this dominant feature virtual currency that they have already been taken into account the antimoney laundering directive directive focus european economic integration fintechs and their emergence banking service cesee finance the most innovative bank cesee among other service offer mbuy which mobile payment system croatia biggest retail network deloitte chart illustrates the

notably many southeastern european country electronic payment play only minor role financingfintechs offer financing the form equity andor debt individual and company mostly smes usually financing provided via platform matching investor and lender most case the fintech company doe not lendfinance own and doe not take the risk the loan investment financing activity may divided into equityequitylike financing crowdfunding and debt financing lending such business model are also often referred marketplace lending because fund are provided peer the crowd and not single institution equitylike mean that some crowdfunding platform offer participation via deeply subordinated debt convertible instrument instead genuine participation equityfocus european economic integration fintechs

involve interest payment repayment and applicable interest payment may take the form payment kind bread when bakery financed profitoriented crowdfunding platform finance virtually only smes contrast the majority lending platform tend specialized consumer loan the cesee region lending much more popular than crowdfunding see chart there group country the czech republic estonia russia lithuania and poland where several domestic lending platform are active some them also operate more than one cesee country see the list the annex for detail addition the number platform shown chart foreign platform

invest exclusively loan provided via lending platform top the variation already mentioned the business model lending platform may very different see also chart the box oesterreichische nationalbank fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseethe czech republic estonia and lithuania have already started regulate lending platform the czech republic they are supervised small payment institution and are hence restricted term size the average annual total amount payment transaction must not exceed eur million per month and geographic reach they are only allowed provide their service the czech republic estonia the creditor and credit intermediary act introduced march this act also cover activity lender and make necessary for them licensed credit intermediary creditor lithuania turn considering lender public consumer lender intermediary tightened regulatory requirement february note however that new regulation were also introduced regulate other nonbank lender payday lender which had mushroomed the czech republic estonia and lithuania lithuania for example the lending volume nonbank lender well exceeds that lender eur million eur million july lietuvos bankas chart compare the gross lending volume lending platform since their start business chart cesee lender are still very small comparison with international market leaderscesee lending platformseur milliontwinolvprivatbankuamintosltbondoraeekokosplomarahaeesource company websitesleading international lending platformseur millionzlotyskbene czlending clubusyirendaicnzopaukit doe not come surprise that the absolute volume the biggest lender cesee country are much smaller than those recorded the leading platform global level however three cesee platform have already achieved lending volume over eur million namely twino privatbank and mintos the other platform operating cesee pale comparison with twino which boast lending volume eur million interesting note that the company twino and mintos work together with several loan originator also noteworthy that privatbank which nationalized december stopped lietuvos bankas doe not seem consider the company mintos lenderfocus european economic integration fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseelending activity the national bank ukraine announced that would stop privatbank lending activity and bring the loan back onto the balance sheet privatbank comparing the lending volume platform with the amount total outstanding loan the respective country doe not make much sense for two reason first lender usually only disclose the overall amount they have lent over the lifetime given platform and not the currently outstanding loan volume second some lender are active more than one country unless restricted regulatory requirement and not provide information the lending volume each country one approach get idea the relevance lending platform the consumer loan market compare the average yearly new consumer loan volume since the establishment the respective lending platform with the lending volume indicated the platform this calculation result maximum amount lender are also active sme lending and some them business more than one country accordingly lending platform make onequarter average new consumer loan latvia mintos and lithuania twino these figure clearly have upward bias given that these platform which are incorporated small country are also active several other larger market mintos the czech republic and poland twino the czech republic russia and poland contrast the lending volume kokos the biggest lender poland account for only average yearly new consumer loan but also smaller country the region the czech republic and slovakia loan lender amount more than average yearly new consumer loan finally can compare these data with lending volume the united kingdom the finance association which publishes lending volume for almost the entire lending industry the lender provided gbp billion which equal new consumer loan extended this figure too biased upward many ukbased lender likewise business other country and extend also loan other than consumer loansbox business model lending platform ceseebusiness model lending platform may vary greatly identified the following three type the cesee country described more detail chart below classical lending lending platform with one more credit originator and lending platform subsidiary traditional bank and crowdvouchingchart classical lending business modelinvestorspplending platformborrower arrow chart indicate the direction the

oesterreichische nationalbank fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseeinvestors natural legal person invest loan borrower that have posted request for loan via the lending platform this case the role the lending platform only consists bringing together investor and borrower the platform usually earns fee from the borrower andor investor many lending platform use business model which are variation this classical lending model shown chart the first variation the classical lending business model that borrower not lending platform with one many credit originatorspp lending platform with one credit originatorchart investorspplending platform subsidiary credit originator creditoriginatorborrowerpp lending platform with many credit originatorsinvestorspplending platformcreditoriginatorsborroweron their own initiative request credit via the lending platform but rather credit originator grant the loan the lending platform may work together with one credit originator that could also the parent company with many credit originator that collaborate with the lending platform contractual basis this business model work follows the credit originator granting loan also finance the loan and the credit risk first borne the originator second step the lending platform offer these loan the internet once investor decides invest loan the said loan transferred the investor via partial assignment the transfer loan investor could also organized via securitization many case the risk the loan also transferred the investor consequently the loan derecognized from the balance sheet the credit originator finally the cash proceeding the sale the loan are forwarded the credit originator thus refunded the credit originator may use the fund grant new loanstraditional bank with lending platform subsidiarylicensed banknonbank subsidiary lendinginvestorschart borrowerfocus european economic integration fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseechart show another variation this business model where licensed bank establishes lending subsidiary that not bank this platform then act like classical lending platform the parent bank benefit from this that able grant loan and earn fee without permanently taking the risk the loan own balance sheet which eventually relief regulatory capital pressure however this business model observed only once the cesee region privatbank ukraine with privatbank having been nationalized the national bank ukraine announced stop lending privatbankcrowdvouching the final variation lending illustrated chart doe not involve chart crowdvouchingcrowdvouching platform put credit application onto the platform lenderguaranteeloanguarantorsfeeborrowerfunding peer first the crowdvouching platform put the loan application the platform website potential guarantor receive information photo and credit history from each loan applicant their mobile phone app with mere swipe they may then decide they grant guarantee particular applicant not for loan application accepted the crowdvouching platform many positive decision potential guarantor are necessary upon acceptance the application the lender which could also bank grant the loan and transfer the agreed amount fund the borrower the potential guarantor become actual guarantor for this loan and receive fee from the borrower the borrower default the loan the guarantee take effect and the guarantor have pay the open balance the loan the lender this business model offered russian platform called suretly the company still the startup phase but already operates legal entity russia kazakhstan and the usapp lending and crowdfunding can lead positive effect but also involves number risk the positive side lending likely enhance access finance for retail and sme customer catering otherwise unattended segment credit demand study the german lending market found that lender indeed serve slice the consumer credit market which neglected bank namely highrisk and smallsized loan roure hence crowdfunding may increase access equity financing for smes providing more risk capital for smes especially startupson the downside there are also number risk associated with marketplace lender the main feature lending that the risk the credit not borne the platform itself but the investor this very different from the traditional banking business model where the bank take deposit and performs risk and term transformation this case the risk the depositor not directly dependent the risk the loan bank grant borrower the other hand when money deposited bank the depositor can not influence which asset loan oesterreichische nationalbank fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseesecurities the bank invests the money this stand contrast lending well crowdfunding there the investor decides who what project will financedwhen come lending the investor not protected deposit insurance scheme quite the contrary the investor usually bear the full credit risk and subject asymmetrical information because the lender fully dependent the information provided the borrower and normally doe not have the possibility performing any additional due diligence moreover investor will face undiversified credit risk they not actively reduce financing different loan with different risk profile mentioned above most lender grant unsecured consumer loan which usually suffer from high default rate such loss will have borne the investor natural legal person study performed with data lending club the biggest lending platform the usa show that the higher interest rate charged highrisk borrower are not enough compensate for the higher probability default emekter addition most country lender are not subject any special regulatory requirement beyond the normal legal requirement for doing business when come crowdfunding investor are susceptible special risk not yet mentioned above crowdfunding platform enable investor invest smes mostly startup the participating interest take the form equity equitylike investment with all the risk usually inherent equity investment for investor however safe assume that investment startup bear higher risk default than equity investment wellestablished company hence utmost importance with respect crowdfunding that investor are aware the highrisk nature this type investment and the fact that they stand lose their entire investment summary and concluding remarksin recent year the development financial technology the banking sector got new twist with the emergence numerous small startup called fintechs chance are that some these new technology will make part the banking business more efficient while fintech company may have the potential disrupt the traditional banking sector they manage grow certain size even though most the new financial technology are still being used only small scale traditional bank have taken note this development and have started either cooperate with fintechs create innovative financial product their own fintechs are usually specialized they tend offer only one financial product payment contrast traditional bank normally offer the full range financial product from payment loan and financial advisory service moreover fintechs mostly not provide service that require banking license regulator are however already paying attention fintechs introducing special legislation regulatory sandbox better understand these new technology this study only revolves around fintechs that are active three business area financial service analysis personal finance trading platform and robotization payment traditional form electronic payment debit and credit card credit transfer and direct debit and innovative form electronic payment emoney payment and financing crowdfunding and lending which also called marketplace lending focus european economic integration fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseefinancial service business area where many fintech startup are operating and where traditional bank have already started cooperate with fintechs develop their own innovative financial service for the cesee region find some activity this area however not enough meaningful data are available give complete picture this areawith regard payment differentiate between traditional and innovative payment method the main innovative feature emoney payment that are often effected via mobile phone the internet that the customer doe not necessarily need bank account make payment with bank account penetration still low some cesee country the adoption mobile phone payment payment via the internet might boost financial inclusion the region rule thumb traditional payment method are available from traditional bank whereas innovative payment method are offered mostly fintechs there are however exception this rule some cesee country croatia traditional bank have incubated the most innovative form payment yet data from the global findex survey show that mobile payment are not yet widespread the cesee region other european country the fintech business area financing quite vibrant the cesee region with lending being far more common than crowdfunding the czech republic estonia russia lithuania and poland number platform are active the business model lender the cesee region may differ significantly from the classical platform the share loan granted lending platform and company financed via crowdfunding still very small comparison with the total consumer loan market lending may enhance access finance for retail and sme customer catering otherwise unattended segment loan demand the other hand lending entail number risk first the total credit risk borne the investor and remains undiversified long the investor doe not actively reduce financing different loan with different risk profile moreover the investor subject asymmetrical information because the lender fully dependent the information provided the borrower and normally make with the due diligence provided the platformin light this especially lending could pose significant risk customer and financial stability reach critical mass some country namely the czech republic estonia and lithuania regulator have already started introduce special regulatory requirement for these platform usually classified small payment service provider with regard lending the following recommendation might worth considering enhancing transparency and reducing asymmetrical information between the borrower and the lender requiring the disclosure certain figure lending volume loan defaulted and detail with regard the lending platform disclosure how the rating are calculated moreover the most recent financial crisis shown that structure where the originatorintermediary loan doe not bear least part the credit risk lead undesired moral hazard effect therefore requirement that the originator lending platform retain least part the credit risk would probably reduce this moral hazard effectto sum the topic fintechs currently being discussed around the globe but date little attention been paid the cesee region this paper meant close this gap taking stock fintech activity cesee adoption new oesterreichische nationalbank fintechs and their emergence banking service ceseetechnology very heterogeneous across the cesee country interestingly some them seem have more active
