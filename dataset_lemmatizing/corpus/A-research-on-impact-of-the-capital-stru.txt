paid raw material input and production method criterion however the most preferred criterion number employee because easily measurable and comparable definition diverse according economic characteristic and criterion used country own european union adopted definition valid after order prevent confusion both national level and the union and revised according changed condition this new definition became valid after the definition based criterion like number employee volume balance sheet and independence independence criterion mean that more capital equity not undertaken enterprise that capital not owned enterprise that are not defined smes independent enterprise are classified but country may differ their purpose per the following micro enterprise employ than personnel and annual revenue andor balance sheet volume million euro small enterprise employ than personnel and annual revenue andor balance sheet volume million euro middle sized enterprise employ than personnel

factor their structure global competition economic integration and information technology rapid development all urge establishment aiming grow continuous dynamism growth typical process for successful establishment developing economy most the establishment start small establishment and they grow through various stage growth should kept the level production where cost are minimized zgener main purpose establishment for growth can seen profit and maximization profit however recently seen that profit not the first aim growth after enterprise reached certain growth rate recent factor growth the rise productivity that play important role sustainability enterprise profitability becomes important only for productive enterprise tosun recognition enterprise enterprise with succeeded growth properly have enhanced market image reputation and power are closely related with growth therefore smes give big importance growth acquire the advantage big enterprise size besides enterprise create brand value branding and attract customer provide cash flow and competitive advantage creating brand value kava big enterprise have greater possibility for product diversification and market segmentation weakness smes and advantage bigness together are main reason for smes aim grow besides desire entrepreneur and manager smes being owner and manager big and reputable enterprise another motive for smes grow erko even the start scale small rapid adaption market condition and healthy growth strategy should employed aim decision for growth should sound one and the indicator for length life sme growth smes important not only from the point their existence profit making motivating their owner manager and providing prestige for them but also for their contribution economic system and national social wealth because growth smes contributes increase gnp that gnp grows consequently growth smes add value national economy and wealth contributing increase production factor and gnp per caput besides since brings increase employment help disappear some problem result unemployment that are order acquire healthy growth and have competitive advantage global competition smes should apply growth oriented restructuring strategy that are suitable for them zgener smes with well aligned incomeandexpense balance have higher level profit maximization and providing loan through equity may grow regardless difference due sector the application section the study general feature capital structure dividend policy financial characteristic smes and their impact smes growth turkey are analyzed methodology this study aimed compiling data general feature capital structure dividend policy financial characteristic smes turkey and view manager them the impact these feature their growth and transform these data into knowledge besides provision recommendation sample study formed smes various sector istanbul since smes istanbul are plenty and scattered various region quite difficult and costly send the questionnaire all smes istanbul sample that can represent the majority smes istanbul targeted accessed but could not hit because some smes authority decline contribute reasoning that the questionnaire contains question for confidential reply considering this would not appropriate say all the reply for smes general and complete reference information source for them totally smes replied and evaluation are based data from them descriptive and relational research method are employed the study order collect unbiased and appropriate data for statistical analysis descriptive research method questionnaire technique used the data collection method expert view are applied and pilot study employed test reliability the questionnaire before final form decided data collected face face interview carried first half questionnaire feature the participant are asked question like their education level position the enterprise age sector capital structure revenue dividend policy and autofinancing technique enterprise closed end statement are preferred constructing the question order collect clearer data data analysed with computer software statistical package for social science spss central tendency and dispersion technique are used for data analysis cross tabulation test employed determine difference among selected variable all table given this study are data collected the writer analysis data descriptive analysis and analysis for difference among variable are held this section descriptive analysis data for the study carried are collected from smes general characteristic smes and their manager are given table according table first rank position repliers belongs top level manager followed enterprise owner the questionnaire are replied top level manager owner enhancing reliability data great extent therefore the level perception becomes higher and level error becomes lower level education the manager the yurttadur and kaya smes participating the research generally bachelor degree regard level education vocational school and master degree follow bachelor degree this finding provides base for the consideration having the level education the participant higher may make their reply more reliable taking the data sector that are the field activity the smes observed that they are mostly active manufacturing production sector where trade and service sector follow also observed that smes turkey are manufacturingproduction generally limited company are the first rank legal status smes service age smes with year more are majority this fact may lead conclusion that smes are experienced entity and may help them solve problem face table show that among all source finance problem smes come delayed collection receivables first rank delayed
