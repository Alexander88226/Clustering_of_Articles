medium enterprise smes access finance selected east asian economy eria research project report jakarta eria chapter small and medium sized enterprise access finance china sun xuegong liu xueyan small and medium enterprise smes have been suffering from financing difficulty even while china experienced lending spree the future tightening monetary policy will worsen the financing situation smes proper policy response the financing predicament smes imperative and should based good understanding the reason for their financing difficulty which this survey study designed contribute the survey reveals that financial institution are quite selective responding the financing request smes basically the financial institution give preference older larger and fastergrowing smes specific type business the background the smes owner also important experienced wealthier and older sme owner more trusted financial institution other factor matter too for instance the smes have collateral participate international production network their chance getting financing would improved the financial institution also favor sme with strong innovation potential and business capability and good performance china situation number policy area are particular importance both author are from the institute economic research national development and reform commission china the view expressed here are those author and are not necessarily representative the institution for which they work introduction overview past two year china experienced lending spree arising from the exceptional effort the government shield the economy from the impact international financial crisis severity unseen since the great depression the lion share trillion rmb billion dollar stimulus package financed bank loan result the total new loan high trillion rmb trillion dollar doubling level loan grew slower pace but still added another trillion rmb trillion dollar the total outstanding sme financing however did not improve very much this period although systematic statistic are lacking anecdotal evidence show that around the country smes still suffered financing difficulty most loan went localgovernmentsponsored financing vehicle for infrastructure project stateowned big business that expanded rapidly inflation looming larger china now begun cycle policy tightening the people bank china pboc the chinese central bank raised the interest and reserve ratio several time the pboc also scrapped the practice setting loan growth target instead dynamic monitoring and adjustment mechanism been put place that any bank that issue excessive loan would subject higher reserve requirement the tightening credit environment will inevitably make sme access finance ever more difficult policy badly needed address the predicament smes with better access finance smes could play more active role sustaining the recovery stimulus policy come end this study intended shed light factor that have impeded sme financing and put forward recommendation how overcome them literature review despite lack official statistic smes difficulty accessing finance been long recognized china there quite big body literature devoted explaining this situation one school study follows the classical model developed international scholar justin yifu lin cited asymmetric information especially lack soft information major factor leading sme financing difficulty yang fenglai etal argued that the governance smes often run their owner exacerbates the moral hazard problem because there check and balance mechanism between the professional manager and the owner zhang jie showed that the peckingorder hypothesis true china result the startup would seek internal financing first the macro level external financing such loan smes would disproportionately low some researcher the other hand tried identify idiosyncratic factor behind the financing difficulty china smes lee zhiyun pointed out that china big bankdominated banking structure make sme financing more difficult because the higher transaction cost when big bank deal with sme related this argument zhang jie believed the transfer loan decision power from bank local office branch even headquarters measure control financial risk adopted government after the asian financial crisis contributed smes financing predicament the asymmetric problem became ever more severe empirical study china are relatively few zhang jie and wang xiao found their visitingbased survey that the life cycle sme closely related access finance they also tested the ownership discrimination hypothesis which state that the lack access finance smes the result discrimination against the private sector the stateowned banking sector however the survey did not prove this argument yong conducted questionnaire survey wenzhou zhejiang province city famous for booming private sector they found that bank are increasingly displacing informal financing the major channel sme financing the city long history informal financing the proportion smes seeking bank loan while the proportion those who sought financing from relative and from internal reserve were and respectively lin xiankun did field survey sme financing dongping county shandong province concluded that the major barrier sme access finance were unreliable sme financial information due poor book keeping lack collateral many smes operated with rented equipment and property high cost associated with bank loan especially when asset assessment insurance and guarantee were involved poor track record credibility sme access finance empirical analysis description the survey the survey conducted three location ensure that representative they were changxing county zhejiang province dalian liaoning province and tianjing changxing the yangzi delta and close shanghai changxing booming sme sector and traditionally privatesectordominated economy dalian harbor city and the most developed the northeast region strong manufacturing sector and moving quickly towards the hightech sector tianjing together with beijing shanghai and chongqing one four municipality directly administered central government also important port and emerged recent year hub highend manufacturing china the survey conducted local partner three location and data were collected from smes and financial institution the basic characteristic the sample were follows the size distribution sme the sample consistent with the first survey there only one micro enterprise smes with employee had biggest share the sample accounting for followed smes with and employee the total respectively smes with employee accounted for the survey once again demonstrated that the size china smes measured number employee consistently larger than their foreign counterpart figure distribution smes size source author calculation based the survey data industry distribution smes follows smes were the targeted industry this survey namely garment and textile automobile and part and electronics electrical and machinery which account for and respectively clearly quite large number smes are concentrated the electrical electronics and machinery sector consistent with the industrial structure china economy the remaining were mostly the service and building material sector see figure figure industry distribution smes garment and textilesautomotives electrical electronicmachineother source author calculation based the survey data the sample smes were than year old were aged between year and those older than year accounted for almost two third the smes were younger than year and the smaller the sme the younger the sme the average age smes with than employee about year while the average age those with more than employee year figure distribution smes age source author calculation based the survey data most smes the sample were domestically owned while were wholly partially owned foreign investor government ownership rare only two case the sample had government equity economic model and regression analysis this section will reveal the source sme financing and explore the major factor the characteristic smes that the financial institution weigh most their financing decision will first use the descriptive statistic tentatively identify the important factor characteristic then employ logit regression test the conclusion again where applicable source sme financing the survey show that the commercial loan the single most important source sme financing smes reported they had used commercial personal loan and line credit from financial institution some time the past retained earnings were second importance commercial loan with sme having used them than smes used source financing other than commercial loan and retained earnings among them the relatively important one are credit from government lending agency grant personal saving business owner loan from individual unrelated the firm and microcredit more than smes had used each these source lease financing trade credit owing supplier and loan from employee are uncommon china and than smes had used each them there are different reason different case leasing financing usually involves heavy equipment and large scale installation that sme don very often use the weak market power smes may explain the low use supplier credit china loan from employee however may not low the data indicates china arrears employee wage are widely reported and this can seen hidden form loan from employee general our finding are consistent with the earlier study they once again demonstrate that bank remain the primary financing source smes despite the fact that the sme many difficulty dealing with bank internal and informal financing are still important and these are part wide social resource that smes can not afford ignore table the source financing for operation smes source financing used sme commercial personal loan and line credit from financial institution credit from government lending agency government grant retained earnings trade credit owing supplier leasing loan from employee personal saving business owner loan from individual unrelated the firm owner angel microcredit other source financing source author calculation based the survey data percentage for financing when starting business there are some difference from financing for operation our sample out business had been created their owner which answered the question about the source startup finance although commercial loan were still important source financing evidenced the fact that smes had used the most important source the personal saving the business owner reported smes retained earning and loan from friend and relative are also significant each used more than smes and the government lending agency play bigger role than private angel fund the proportion smes who used credit from the government lending agency higher than the for private angel fund table the source financing for startup smes source financing used sme commercial personal loan and line credit from financial institution including credit cardscredit from government lending agency government grant retained earnings trade credit owing supplier leasing personal saving business owner loan from friend relative business owner loan from individual unrelated the firm owner angel microcredit other source financing source author calculation based the survey data percentage what matter for the approval refusal decision financial institution what factor characteristic smes are crucial for the result their financing request this section devoted identifying these factor and characteristic there long list potential characteristic factor that matter and aimed test age size type cost finance collateral firm lifecycle growth sale owner net worth and gender management experience labor productivity and innovation capability age and life cycle sme expected that the younger the sme the more likely refused financial institution due lack record credibility and proven performance the data seem support this argument the average age sme who had ever been declined financial institution year younger than the average age those had not however the difference only year which not substantial comparing the average age those who had never made financing request and those who had lead similar conclusion they are and respectively the result from the logit model confirms that the age sme factor that affect the likelihood access financing the probability being refused financial institution decrease when the age the sme increase table the average age smes which approach financial institution and result their request not refused refused don know total mean age freq source author calculation based the survey data figure probability being refused financing the age sme ytilibaborpage source author calculation based the survey data the life cycle sme related age but not necessarily linear way our sample each sme could identify itself only out stage life cycle say fast growth slow growth and maturity the statistic show the mature sme enjoyed the best financing probability with the lowest proportion being refused and the highest proportion getting fully authorized financing smes the slow growth stage suffered most getting financing with the highest proportion being refused and the lowest proportion obtaining fully authorized financing smes fast growth were between the result the logit model also suggests that the lifecycle sme strong factor sme financing this conclusion consistent with earlier study table the life cycle smes and financing proportion refused proportion fully authorized fast growth slow growth maturity source author calculation based the survey data figure probability being refused financing life cycle sme ytilibaborplifecyclesource author calculation based the survey data size sme reasonable assume that the size sme would matter significantly for access financing not surprisingly our survey data show this for smes with than employee the proportion smes who had been refused financing institution this proportion declined the enterprise had more than employee for those discouraged smes defined those who never made financing request size matter even more the proportion discouraged smes decline significantly with growing size one third smes with and fewer employee had never made financing request while only one tenth enterprise with and more employee had never made financing request the result from the logit regression also show that the probability that sme refused financing decrease size get larger the survey financial institution confirms that sme size matter for ability access financing out bank asked business client provide their number employee employment size table the proportion smes who are refused never make financing request size size proportion refused proportion request more than average source author calculation based the survey data figure probability being refused financing size sme ytilibaborpsize source author calculation based the survey data ownership the literature report that ownership discrimination factor responsible for sme financing difficulty general the private sme said discriminated against the stateowned bank sector because there are too few governmentowned enterprise our sample can not test this statement directly however the sample allows similar comparison between foreign ownership and domestic ownership the data show that having foreign ownership very much improved sme probability obtaining external financing the proportion smes with foreign ownership which had not been refused while domestic counterpart probability only the chance foreign owned firm but for domestic ownership the proportion smes whose loan request were fully authorized tell the same story foreign funded smes obtained full authorization their financing request while only the domestic firm received full authorization the difference telling the logit model confirms that foreign ownership would reduce the possibility being denied access financing conclusion may not able prove that the private sme discriminated against but clearly foreign ownership favored the financial institution table the ownership smes and financing ownership foreign funded domestic total not refused refused dont know total source author calculation based the survey data table the proportion smes result financing request and ownership application the request the full amount authorized partial amount authorized turned down withdrawn ownership foreign funded domestic total source author calculation based the survey data figure the probability distribution being refused financing ownership source author calculation based the survey data type business the earlier study found that different industry suffered different financing gap looking the proportion smes who were refused recent financing request can not find significant industry difference all industry were close the average level looking the smes who had never made financing request however electrical electronic and machinery show outstandingly higher proportion than other industry one third smes from the electrical electronic and machinery industry had never made financing request contrasting one tenth and even fewer the garment and textile and other industry the financing difficulty firm the electrical electronic and machinery industry also demonstrated data the result authorization their latest financing request because most the latest financing request were authorized some extent compare those fully authorized those partially authorized from table can see that the electrical electronic and machinery industry the lowest proportion fully authorized financing request and highest proportion partially authorized the survey data tends suggest that type business factor that matter for sme financing table the proportion smes who are refused never make financing request type type business proportion refused proportion request garment and textile part component and automotives electrical electronic and machinery other average source author calculation based the survey data table the proportion smes result financing request and type business type business garment and textile part component and automotives electrical electronic part and machinery other average the full amount authorized partial amount authorized the request turned down application withdrawn source author calculation based the survey data international production network ipn the last study found that being not being international production network would make big difference the performance sme here can test being ipn impact the chance financing for sme the descriptive statistic seem suggest that firm ipn are par with those not ipn term financing probability this evidenced the observation that the frequency different financing situation for those ipn and those not ipn are roughly the same however the logit regression suggests that being part ipn may help sme financing probability the conclusion not very reliable however only significant the confidence level table the ipn and financing ownership not refused refused dont know not ipn ipn total total source author calculation based the survey data table the proportion smes result financing request and ipn ownership not ipn ipn total the full amount authorized partial amount authorized the request turned down application withdrawn source author calculation based the survey data figure probability distribution being refused financing ipn status source author calculation based the survey data collateral both theory and empirical evidence show that collateral very important for sme financing our survey result agrees with this the smes who made financing request were asked provide collateral much higher than the proportion smes asked provide guarantee cosignature which were and respectively the importance collateral can also shown analysis the reason given for turning down financing request the reason cited smes were insufficient sale income cash flow insufficient collateral inadequate business plan and poor credit history among them insufficient collateral mentioned far more often than any other reason from the perspective the bank however there little difference the importance collateral the data from the financial institution survey show that the bank see insufficient sale income and poor credit history more important reason than insufficient collateral for turning down sme financing request table the requirement credit supplier requirement credit supplier guaranteed government provide collateral cosignatures from nonbusiness owner proportion source author calculation based the survey data innovation capability when technology capability measured spending and number patent relationship with financing probability not clear although smes which were not refused financial institution have higher spending relative their sale smes with fully authorized financing had lower percentage spending this inconsistency also found the relationship the number patent and financing probability the logit model result suggests that spending tends positively correlate with the probability getting financing while the number patent doe not the reason for this may that the quality patent themselves not high china the majority patent are reportedly awarded application that make change product appearance rather than function table spending and financing sale financing request fully authorized partially authorized source author calculation based the survey data financing request sale not refused refused figure probability distribution being refused financing spending source author calculation based the survey data table the number patent and financing patent fully authorized partially authorized not refused refused patent source author calculation based the survey data activity which improve business capability activity which improve business capability help sme financing chance the data show that depends what kind activity the sme adopted the activity that help are meeting international standard establishing new division new plant introducing new knowhow production method and introducing new product service the smes carrying out these activity have much lower proportion refusal financial institution than those not doing the biggest difference found new product service introduction for those smes introducing new product service the proportion refusal compared for those not doing activity such introducing ict buying new machine facility with new function the operation improving existing machine equipment facility not reduce the sme probability being refused financing these activity seem too common serve signal excellence the logit model also confirms this conclusion shown figure table activity improve business capability and financing chance activity improve business capability adopted not met international standard iso others introduced ict information and communication technology established new division new plant bought new machine facility with new function operation improved existing machine equipment facility introduced new knowhow production method introduced new product service source author calculation based the survey data yes yes yes yes yes yes yes proportion being refused financing figure probability being refused financing adopting improvement activity not source author calculation based the survey data sale and sale growth sale and sale growth are important indicator sme performance however the data suggest that they have quite different impact the sme financing sale seems not play important role the financial institution decision making the data consistently suggest that smes with low sale are more likely get financing the data however present contradictory relationship while those who received full authorization have higher sale than those receiving only partial authorization those who had never been refused financial institution had lower sale than those who had been refused the logit regression however fails find significant relationship between the probability financing and sale both and tend believe that sale not important factor concern for financial institution table the sale smes and financing loan authorized sale million dollar financing request source author calculation based the survey data the full amount partial amount not refused refused sale million dollar but sale growth different story both and and for both full and partial loan authorization the data consistently suggest the financial institution prefer high growth smes the difference average sale growth are notably large table sale growth and financing loan authorized the full amount partial amount sale growth sale growth financing request not refused refused source author calculation based the survey data the logit model confirmed the significance sale growth loan decision making shown the figure the probability being refused financial institution decrease sale growth increase figure probability being refused financial institution sale growth salegrowthsource author calculation based the survey data profit profit very important gauge firm performance tested the relationship between the accessibility financing sme and profit percentage sale the descriptive statistic indicate that the chance access financing sme more related recent profit performance than the more distant past the profit those not refused financing and those with full authorization are consistently higher than the profit those refused with limited access financing however their profit doe not signal well their chance financing those with full authorization did have lower profit than those with partial authorization the logit regression also find that the profit significant factor explaining the probability being refused financing tend accept that the latest profit the factor that financial institution give weight table profit and financing profit profit financing request not refused refused loan authorized the full amount partial amount source author calculation based the survey data figure probability being refused financing profit percentage sale profit source author calculation based the survey data productivity here measure productivity term sale per employee the smes with the full amount their loan request authorized least not refused had much higher productivity than those with partial authorization outright refusal this may suggest that productivity important factor sme financing however the result from the logit model reject this hypothesis the pronounced difference productivity were due outlier productivity growth also proved not critical factor deciding the probability getting financing table the productivity smes and access financing loan authorized the full amount partial amount productivity financing request productivity not refused refused source author calculation based the survey data age and sex owner while the average age owner receiving full authorization higher than those who got partial authorization the average age owner whose financing request were not refused lower than those refused both case the age difference were small however the result the descriptive statistic were inconclusive however the logit regression result tends indicate that the age owner play role the decisionmaking financial institution term gender look the female owner slightly favored financial institution however due the small number female owner the sample only the result not reliable tend think the sex doe not play significant role the financing decision financial institution least that female are not discriminated against table the age owner and financing average age fully authorized partially authorized not refused refused average age source author calculation based the survey data figure probability being refused financing age owner ytilibaborpageofownersource author calculation based the survey data table distribution smes result financing request and sex fully authorized partially authorized turndown withdraw male female source author calculation based the survey data management experience owner the data consistently suggest that the owner smes who get full authorization lease are not refused financial institution have longer management experience the difference quite small however the result the logit regression also support the conclusion reached from the descriptive statistic the management experience the owner may therefore play role the financing decision table management experience owner fully authorized partially authorized management experience year year not refused refused management experience year year source author calculation based the survey data figure probability being refused financing management experience owner ytilibaborpexperience source author calculation based the survey data personal wealth the proportion those refused financing among sme owner with than million personal wealth and among those with more than million and the proportion fully authorized financing among sme owner with than million personal wealth and among those with more than million these distinctive difference tend suggest that personal wealth important factor for accessibility financing the sme the result from the logit regression agrees with this conclusion table personal wealth and financing below million over million proportion being refused proportion fully authorized source author calculation based the survey data figure probability being refused financing wealth owner source author calculation based the survey data table summary logit regression result dependent variable

profit experience age owner owner wealth coefficient zstatistic probability log likelihood resid source author calculation based the survey data note statistically significant percent critical value statistically significant percent critical value statistically significant percent critical value discussion the result the survey show that commercial loan are the single most important financing source for sme operation and that the owner personal saving the most frequently used source for the startup sme this conclusion generally line with earlier survey most financing intended for use working capital followed growth the business and purchase machinery and equipment the financing also used for expenditure which ranked fourth china case the financing seldom used for purchase vehicle debt consolidation purchasing business see table smes frequently need financing evidenced the fact that smes had ever made financing request but only smes had used just one kind external financing the difference show that there still financing gap for smes and the survey confirmed again that lack financing serious problem for the growth smes china obtaining financing ranked fourth table however consider the fact that some obstacle listed here are either integral part market economy such competition are rather short term problem such rising business cost the financing difficulty second only lack qualified labor term seriousnessness table which the following obstacle are serious problem for the growth your business obstacle finding qualified labour instability consumer demand obtaining financing government regulation management capacity environmental regulation compliance rising business cost increasing competition insurance premium frequency source author calculation based the survey data table how did the business intend use the financing that requested the use financing frequency land and building vehicle rolling stock computer hardware and software other machinery and equipment working capital operating capital research and development debt consolidation intangible purchase business grow the business other purpose source author calculation based the survey data the empirical study reveal that financial institution favor smes with certain specific characteristic which then have more chance access financing the characteristic that matter include size age ownership lifecycle type business collateral and whether the firm not international production network certain characteristic the owner smes such age personal wealth and management experience are also related the probability financing the capability smes are taken into account financial institution the survey show that the smes which spend more have met international standard have established new division new plant have introduced new knowhow production method and introduces new product service are more likely gain access financing theory performance should important factor that financial institution look for most the survey doe find the sale growth and latest profit strongly affect the chance getting financing however other performance indicator such sale and productivity are not found helpful for sme financing smes policy support general the past ten year sme policy gradually taken front seat the government agenda sme promotion act promulgated and several other major policy initiative have been announced china established policy framework support sme development the major item china sme policy include creating enabling environment which smes can fairly compete with big business and treated equally the discrimination against smes should eliminated the access smes sector previously open only stateowned business expanded mitigating the difficulty smes access financing incentive

that policy can promptly respond changing situation compared the policy index developed the oecd find that china sme policy cover all important area most policy item china score above showing that sound policy framework taken shape however the field entrepreneurship education online access and topclass small business support china policy still weak and another big problem china sme policy enforcement remains the case that many policy remain paper and are not delivered the ground table policy item and score policy item entrepreneurship education and training cheaper and faster startup better legislation and regulation availability skill improving online access more out the single market taxation and financial matter strengthening the technological capacity successful ebusiness model and top class small business support average source author calculation based the survey data score access the finance policy mitigate the financing difficulty smes long been central government sme policy the major policy initiative sme financing include motivating the financial institution make more loan smes risk compensation fund been created subsidize the sme business financial institution and make part any loss from nonperforming loan npl the regulation bad loan have also changed allow the financial institution easily write off npls and not hold bank staff personally account she prof due diligence reorganization the banking sector been carried out allow small community based bank grow the private sector can launch sponsor small financial institution such village and town bank credit company etc the participation the private sector restructuring rural and urban credit union now encouraged the big bank are required set department dedicated sme financing developing financing product tailor the need smes the problem lack collateral should properly addressed the range asset qualified collateral need expanded include property receivables equity intellectual property inventory etc increasing sme access direct financing the sme board the stock market established expand sme access equity financing the number smes listed the stock market will increased the development venture capital leasing financing pledge financing and trust financing also encouraged the issuance sme corporate bond will increased improving the credit guarantee system for smes multilayer guarantee fund and organization jointly sponsored central and local government and the business sector been launched reduce the exposure bank when making loan smes the guarantee organization should entitled the preferential tax treatment and regulatory requirement insurance company are encouraged develop insurance product for smes strengthening the credibility information system help the banking sector better identify sme risk sme credibility system been built collect and evaluate the credibility information smes the system easily accessed financial institution punish and reward mechanism should put into place foster culture honesty enhance the credibility smes conclusion and policy recommendation although many policy initiative have been put forward and macro financial condition are favorable smes still suffer from difficulty financing the financial institution remain the major channel sme financing and they are quite selective approving the financing request smes basically the financial institution give preference older larger and faster growing smes specific type business the good background sme owner help also experienced wealthier and older owner sme more trusted financial institution other factor matter too for instance smes have collateral participate international production network their chance getting financing are improved the financial institution also favor smes with strong innovation and business capability and good performance the selectiveness financial institution reasonable given their nature profitseeking commercial body this show that the financing gap faced sme partly due the development gap the sme infers that along with the development the sme financing situation would improved even without policy intervention but there are financing difficulty coming from drawback inherent the financial system institution framework requiring the intervention policy china case there are several policy area that are particularly important first china big bank dominated financial system exacerbates the problem asymmetry information small financial institution should developed proximity smes financial sector liberalization therefore need expedited barrier the private sector participation should eliminated second the excessive risk aversion financial institution toward sme financing need corrected the asian financial crisis alarmed the chinese government and consequence began tackle npl problem very seriously result the banking sector taken very conservative stance risk control when dealing with the private sector and smes even though the economic situation now changed alleviate the sme financing situation little more risktaking bank should encouraged third china should take bolder step develop direct financing for smes among other thing private equity now booming business china more and more wealthy people seek high return from their asset the sme sector the opportunity benefit from the private equity investor favorable regulatory environment and fair competition should established for the development direct financing fourth the credibility gap smes need addressed government should facilitate the collection and dissemination the credit record smes the governmentsponsored guarantee program can also play important role enhancing the credibility smes reference lee zhiyun
