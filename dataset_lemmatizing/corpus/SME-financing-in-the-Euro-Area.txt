these aim either supporting the liability side bank balance sheet through longterm refinancing operation the asset side via the securitisation sme loan nevertheless from banking sector perspective the

complementary discussion focus internal fund generally the availability internal fund reduces external financing need and may put firm relatively better liquidity position when other form funding dry out this respect crosscountry look smes internal fund and their use bank loan reveals difference and similarity financing structure across europe see chart data from the ecb survey access finance safe show broadly comparable degree reliance bank loan for german french italian and spanish smes between and smes these country report have used bank credit for financing the last six month internal fund play notable role well nevertheless german smes have made far greater use them recently than their peer elsewhere smes germany but only roughly the other large emu economy reportedly used internal funding the last six month pattern that broadly held true since the start the safe survey this may indicate better profitability well higher capital ratio for german smes which can important factor determining the supply and demand for bank credit indeed bank will normally request higher risk premia for loan undercapitalised smes whereas better capitalised more profitable smes are able rely more internal resource for funding and addition may have access cheaper bank credit delve deeper into these trend discus bank loan availability more detail the following section the bach database only look single criterion sale volume for classifying smes but here follows the definition enterprise with annual turnover not exceeding eur million are defined small enterprise with turnover between eur

potentially due weak demand the aftermath the crisis still substantial name difficulty the access finance the single most pressing problem see chart crosscountry comparison reveals striking divergence access finance being obstacle for smes access external funding the single most challenging problem for smes italy indicated firm and the second most challenging problem for smes spain mentioned firm see chart the situation deteriorated particular italy with the share having increased significantly since smes france report moderate problem their access finance cited firm the other extreme only german smes report access finance their most pressing problem down from which seems line with both more relaxed credit supply condition and lower external funding need german smes the survey also asks for more detail about the exact problem smes face accessing their most important source funding bank loan see chart for instance the smes euroland reported that their credit application rejected outright the second half and received only limited part the loan sum they had applied for moreover did not apply all fearing possible refusal there strong crosscountry heterogeneity rejection rate too the one hand germany smes hardly experience problem obtaining bank credit only were rejected when they applied for credit and only report they got smaller loan than needed moreover the rate discouraged smes germany stand around the lowest level the entire euro area and down from the other hand italian and spanish smes report both high rejection rate almost and respectively and high share almost each loan application that were only partly approved overall while having the greatest need for loan seems that smes the country with the fiercest recession and highest unemployment struggle the most their access bank credit which attributable weaker profitability and lower capital position meanwhile smes demand for credit rise due limited availability internal fund supply side problem bank lending become more critical this demandsupply imbalance may more severe country such spain and italy which also reflected unfavourable lending rate smes cost bank credit increased

crisis following this second surge and only slight moderation since then smes borrowing cost today are still around higher than those large enterprise the euro area similar upward trend are observable for the relative borrowing cost micro enterprise too the spread widened from approximately before the aggravation the sovereign debt crisis over summer recently the disproportionally high borrowing cost for micro firm have somewhat stabilised spread around which nevertheless significantly higher than the presovereign crisis period the increase lending rate smes been particularly pronounced southern euro area country therefore demanding greater attention during the boom phase smes relative borrowing cost the largest economy the euro area had converged some remarkably during this period german smes were paying persistently higher rate than smes spain italy and france both absolute and relative term for instance september lending rate for smes france were only higher than for large enterprise compared with spread germany these trend reversed following the collapse lehman brother however even though the borrowing cost smes surged all country the upswing much more evident france italy and spain germany the increase relatively modest and now the relative borrowing cost smes only slightly higher than the precrisis period the other hand significant normalisation over recent month notwithstanding the increase lending rate smes much more pronounced italy and spain with peak spread value around and respectively moreover stark divergence still persists compared with country such germany all all smes and particular micro firm from the country with the deepest recession and highest unemployment pay significantly higher rate for bank loan than large enterprise normal time analyst and policymakers would probably have agreed that action needed reduce these rate however under the current circumstance there consensus among market participant whether elevated rate these country are line with smes fundamental not the one hand some argue that before the outbreak the financial crisis lending rate smes were unreasonably low and fuelled excessive indebtedness according this line argument policy action reduce lending rate would fact negatively affect the economy whole draining fund from the healthier part the economy structurally weak smes the other hand others claim that addition significant negative spillover effect during the crisis among the southern country and other euro area member the unsustainable level unemployment southern country indeed requires policy action furthermore not clear priori the elevated lending rate smes are due smes structural weakness due deleveraging the banking sector bank risk aversion and liquidity problem line with the proponent market intervention reduce lending rate smes the ecb introduced several mitigating measure which discus detail below see moec for detailed discussion see darvas for detailed discussion october monitor

that the feature the ltros have markedly changed since the precrisis period first originally the longest maturity offered only three month which subsequently lengthened one year three year and most recently four year addition the ecb until set fixed amount funding would provide and then obtained bank bid for certain volume overall the amount offer were much lower than today leading almost always excess demand and oversubscription for ltros third the rate applied the ecb usually the normal benchmark rate were much higher all these factor dampened ltro volume significantly until late however with the acceleration the financial crisis and the onset recession the ecb took extraordinary measure switching from auctioning process full allotment any amount the bank applied for furthermore the central bank considerably extended ltro maturity several step and cut the interest rate bank had pay record low currently the ltro rate stand only with duration the latest tender four year shed more light ltro trend chart present the ecb ltro volume across all the different term and condition and total asset over time prior the crisis the outstanding ltro volume were broadly stable around eur bid for ltros still exceeded the allotted amount just before the failure lehman brother september the ratio about after lehman ltro volume expanded and ltro bid and allotted amount have been balanced since course volume reached record level eur the ecb total asset april following significant repayment over recent year ltro volume now stand only eur the ecb balance sheet total the outstanding ltro amount provide limited information the demand for ltros and the reason for the recent decline volume more insight can gained from the total number bidder which proxy for the demand for ltros presented chart similar the surge the outstanding amount the number bidder increased exponentially with the crisis and reached peak demand then remained elevated and allotted amount marked record volume however from onwards demand for ltros and allotted volume decreased significantly and both are now far below even precrisis level undoubtedly mitigating measure such the ltros have supported the banking sector during the crisis and have contributed easing liquidity and funding constraint the industry thereby indirectly also helping bank lending smes and large enterprise alike however the fact that both ltro volume and sme lending rate reached their peak about the same time could interpreted evidence that ltros indeed were hardly successful bringing down lending rate smes will take further look this potential causal relationship empirical analysis below now least both the demand for ltros and the actual flow which course are partly affected the maturing exceptional year ltros have dwindled significantly while the elevated cost bank credit for smes still persist this may indicate that there are factor other than lack cheap liquidity and funding for bank that lead higher lending rate for smes recently the ecb introduced targeted longerterm refinancing operation tltros promote bank lending the real economy bank lending euro area nonfinancial corporation and household excluding loan for

deutsche bank research second follow december will allow bank borrow their outstanding loan the nonfinancial private sector the euro area the ecb loan will have maturity maximum year and will priced above the benchmark interest rate nonetheless considering the subdued impact the year ltros seem have had sme credit supply look unlikely that the new tltros will create meaningful incentive lend smes indeed the september tender result remained well below the eur offer from the ecb with bank borrowing only eur bank own refinancing cost but why did the cheap ecb liquidity not find way small and mediumsized firm bank may refrain from transmitting the favourable condition central bank funding their client due their own balance sheet constraint high refinancing cost perceived risk the sme sector the ecb interest rate statistic deposit rate may help shed light the bank own financing cost chart first glance this data doe not seem suggest rise financing cost rather show noticeable decline deposit rate over recent year however need kept mind that this decline primarily reflects the ecb monetary policy aimed keeping lending rate very low level also shown chart the index bank bond yield which provides the floor rate charged firm indeed bond yield were broadly stable prior the start the crisis around above the benchmark however financial bond spread surged with the outbreak the financial crisis jumping alltime high almost april and reaching another peak more than january even though bond yield have come down since mostly due searchforyield sentiment they remain elevated about twice the precrisis level thus overall bank cost funding via debt security increased considerably from onwards closer look the form empirical analysis the relative borrowing cost smes the ltro volume and bank own refinancing cost proxied bond spread can provide better insight into the relevant transmission channel even though all these element are closely interrelated and are likely correlated with numerous other factor simple statistical method may help determine there empirical relationship between the bank own refinancing cost well ltro volume and lending rate for smes doing this run vector auto regression model and perform granger causality analysis causality this context discussed narrow statistical sense and indicates one series help predict future value the other series and vice versa table summarizes the result this exercise table the rejection causal relation between ltro volume and smes borrowing cost suggests that the success ltros reducing smes borrowing cost may limited moreover the rejection the reverse causality further support weak relation between the two the other hand there causal relation from bank own refinancing cost the borrowing cost smes this implies that bank balance sheet constraint elevated refinancing cost may translate into higher lending rate for smes the rejection reverse causality from smes borrowing cost lends further support

general economic outlook risk collateral demanded source bls deutsche bank research between the two taken together ltros seem contribute relatively little boosting sme lending which may put the effectiveness the tltros this regard into question admittedly the result presented here say nothing about the nature the common trend between these indicator and therefore not claim uncover structural economic relationship bank risk perception regarding smes addition bank own funding cost second factor may have been relevant explaining the substantial rise smes borrowing cost bank risk aversion and increasingly cautious view the outlook for smes and large smes are perceived have higher probability default than larger firm which turn may lead bank generally more selective supplying loan smes the same time shown above bank loan are much more crucial for smaller firm than for larger one which have additional funding option mainly the capital market shed light bank sentiment regarding smes riskiness chart demonstrates the contribution different factor the tightening bank credit standard for loan smes documented the bank lending survey bls the ecb each series show the net change share tightened minus share eased the relevant factor compared with the previous quarter bls data suggests that the height the financial crisis all factor had peak their contribution the tightening sme lending standard similarly negative risk perception reemerged with the intensification the sovereign debt crisis these trend overlap with increase the relative borrowing cost smes even though recent year the risk perception bank seems have contributed tightening bank credit condition which itself also came end largely the much more negative assessment sme risk compared with the pre period may not have reversed yet again important note that the bls defines net change series with respect the level the previous quarter therefore the most recent slightly negative figure almost certainly not imply reversal full normalisation the risk perception contribution credit standard contrast this facto merely reflects halt prolonged tightening process due ever greater risk perception and bank cautiousness with respect lending smes may basically persist all all our finding indicate that the mitigating measure that provide liquidity the market and support the liability side bank balance sheet may have had limited impact reducing the high borrowing cost smes the other hand these cost seem correlated larger extent with bank own refinancing cost specifically the market rate and bank risk perception regarding the outlook for sme credit general hence alternative mitigating measure are worth discussing that allow for the transfer the credit risk sme loan other part the financial system mitigating action securitisation sme loan addition mitigating measure that provide liquidity favourable condition and thus support the liability side bank balance sheet there are other measure such securitisation that target the asset side bank balance sheet facilitate lending smes this can achieved creating tradable collateralisable security linked sme loan thereby transferring their credit risk the capital market effective manner address the securitisation trend recent year chart show the outstanding volume securitised sme loan europe the available data suggests rapid expansion

credit problem securitisation meagre might expected the other hand where smes have significant difficulty their access finance where lending rate are high the volume security backed loan smes higher but there upward rebound potential both italy with positive development recently and spain given that the market used much bigger higher level sme securitisation would allow italian and spanish bank reduce the credit risk their balance sheet transferring further sme loan the capital market doing this bank could benefit from capital relief and free capacity for new loan smes thus securitisation allows bank improve their capital position without damaging lending smes smes may benefit through reduced lending rate eased credit standard general this respect public initiative that support the securitisation sme loan may helpful though course doing this the introduction new risk should avoided for instance new securitised product should transparent and have standardised structure multiple securitisation addition originator should have sufficient skin the game avoid moral hazard etc taken together strengthening sme securitisation may one the most effective way facilitate the flow fund

pressure from the nonbank sector such shadow bank the bls context the nonbank sector consists insurance corporation and pension fund financial auxiliary and other financial intermediary for whom data available from onward see chart the bls result suggest that during the first few year the crisis nonbank competition actually even led some tightening which may largely explained the fragile situation the financial sector whole including nonbanks during this period shadow bank seem have had similar constraint bank thus refraining from providing credit between and nonbank competition only had marginal impact the availability bank loan smes however over the past few quarter competition from shadow lender seems have become somewhat stronger which contributed moderate net easing credit standard this may imply that some sme loan are now being funded lightly regulated unregulated shadow bank see fsb for detailed discussion overall most the other factor driving sme credit condition

given the large spectrum public institution and initiative which aim supporting smes access finance determining the most efficient way public intervention pivotal relevance for market participant and policymakers alike october monitor sme financing the euro area first and foremost private sector involvement crucially important indeed few institution are skilled and experienced assessing and managing risk bank which one the reason why they exist moreover their often longterm client relation may allow bank gauge credit risk more precisely than other creditor addition private involvement reduces the incentive problem that may otherwise arise the distribution loan public intervention could lead credit decision being politically driven instead commercially thus impeding efficient allocation capital and fact taxpayer fund taken together initiative that share the commercial risk loan between the private and the public sector which the authority grant loan through bank are more likely really reach the healthy and most creditworthy smes incorporating bank public initiative can draw their risk management expertise and build bank client relation well ensure sufficient skin the game the large euroarea country least kfw germany seems achieve private involvement most effectively even though public institution other country share similarity with kfw direct government lending scheme loan guarantee southern country could result significant cost taxpayer and due crowding out effect even lead problem credit availability for healthy and creditworthy smes the long run another important aspect efficient coordination and harmonisation public resource indeed too many public institution may lead extensive bureaucracy and cost for public budget result having single umbrella institution seems the best way minimise administrative cost for taxpayer and large this been achieved germany and recently also france however might even more important harmonise resource the level therefore good news that there are now indication cooperation and harmonisation between individual country the recent agreement worth eur billion between kfw and ico finance smes spain meaningful step this direction finally true umbrella institution the european investment fund too significant role play supporting the continent smes accessing finance marketbased initiative addition public support for smes number marketbased initiative were launched recent year their main objective diversify smes funding option facilitating access external financing source such equity bond market many country equity trading platform are better developed than bond market general specific trading platform for sme stock usually target mediumsized firm but not micro firm due minimum size requirement these trading platform have greater growth potential country where the financial market infrastructure better developed and the proportion mediumsized enterprise higher due relatively low share such firm least compared with germany italy spain and france the number smes that utilise these funding platform still relatively low germany the entry standard segment for share give smes the opportunity raise capital under reduced administrative requirement and lower cost france alternext offer small and mid cap alternative way enter the capital market launched may mercado alternativo bur til the spanish trading platform with more flexible regulatory framework exclusively targeting smes similarly italy aim italiamac represents the market course there also the general problem competitive distortion government intervention may prevent market shakeout and keep firm going even without sustainable business model the detriment their better positioned rival october monitor sme financing the euro area segment that attracts smes more flexible and costly administrative framework than the ordinary regulated market addition april the italian exchange borsa italiana cooperation with the italian government and other major italian financial institution initiated the elite programme which specific platform aiming support smes growth intention alternative investment market for sme bond support access debt capital market are the rise germany too for instance the entry standard for corporate bond the frankfurt stock exchange wooing client with reduced requirement regarding disclosure and issuance size the extramot pro segment the italian stock exchange created february order promote external financing smes through bond issuance similarly october spain initiated the alternative fixedincome market mercado alternativo renta fija marf specifically for sme bond trading nonetheless the overall uptake been mixed far and sme funding through the bond market yet develop indeed become meaningful force the development alternative capital market for smes can help mitigate costly administrative obstacle the scope and intensity these marketbased initiative differs substantially between country though term smes which are already listed stock exchange germany and france are ahead spain and italy spanish and italian public initiative the other hand increasingly establish scheme which aim bringing more smes the market including technical and advisory support all case however important note that the national structure smes stock market limit the attractiveness for international investor the debt side germany taken leading role developing bond segment specifically designed for smes whereas other country only recently started promote this channel conclusion this study have taken closer look the funding problem smes the euro area the mitigating measure facilitate their access finance well other public and marketbased initiative among the largest euro area country smes contribution economic activity and employment and their performance during the crisis varies considerably this can largely explained structural difference smes individual country german smes tend rather exportoriented and thus more resilient change local demand whereas there overwhelmingly large share micro enterprise among italian and spanish smes which find harder withstand macroshocks smes usually rely heavily bank credit for funding although germany they currently seem more profitable and thus able fund themselves greater extent internally but there strong crosscountry heterogeneity when come the availability bank credit the tightening lending standard over the past few year far more pronounced the country with the starkest recession and highest unemployment moreover smes and especially micro firm these country pay significantly higher lending rate than large enterprise this shifted the focus some mitigating measure and large policy that aim expand bank lending may address either the liability the asset side bank balance sheet however the mitigating measure such ecb ltros that provide liquidity the market and support the liability side seem have had limited success reducing the borrowing cost smes instead high lending rate for smes are correlated large extent with bank still elevated own refinancing cost market rate and their risk perception regarding the outlook for smes general therefore october monitor sme financing the euro area doubtful whether the new tltros will have meaningful positive impact bank lending smes mitigating measure such securitisation that support the asset side bank balance sheet are more niche topic country where smes access bank credit problem the other hand the securitisation sme loan gained pace over the recent year italy and equally substantial upward potential spain strengthening this option would allow italian and spanish bank partly offload sme credit risk and transfer them from their balance sheet the capital market thereby freeing equity and extending their capacity lend taken together securitisation the potential bridge the gap between smes funding need and the availability bank loan especially those country where smes report significant problem accessing finance there are currently some sign more aggressive competition for bank from shadow lender this may imply that some sme loan are now being funded lightly regulated unregulated shadow bank which may not desired outcome for regulator closing smes financing gap another option that publicsector marketbased entity lend directly smes provide guarantee for sme loan public initiative are extensive the country that focus germany the range public support scheme for smes markedly diversified and may fundamentally lower smes funding risk france newly introduced public institution also offer diversified range financial support italy and spain public support for smes strong upward trend which particular relevance considering the overwhelmingly large share micro firm these country for public intervention effective and efficient private sector involvement crucial direct government lending loan guarantee could result significant cost taxpayer and even hurt healthy and creditworthy smes channelling fund towards firm that are politically better connected addition public initiative should coordinated and harmonised within country and beyond avoid excessive bureaucracy and competitive distortion number marketbased initiative that allow direct access equity and bond market have been launched many european country recent
