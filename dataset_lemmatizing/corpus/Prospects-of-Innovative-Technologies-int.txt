improvement learning technology improvement and multiplication have become integral attribute educational technology the majority country the world innovation educational system development the basis state innovative and technological policythe need improve educational system and introduce innovative technology essential prerequisite able ensure country into the world economic community untrammeled integration this context should noted that modern information and communication technology application enables significantly speed information search and transfer process transform mental activity nature and automate human labor erudition and the ability manage information have long become wealth and power basis most economically developed country the oecd organization for economic cooperation and development report noted that the knowledgebased economy science and technology are the most important source economic growth and welfare oecd expert all definitely agreed that the basic longterm economic growth rate oecd country depends knowledge base maintaining and expanding many oecd country value added real growth the knowledgebased industry consistently outpaced the overall economic growth for the past two decade globalization process accelerated these trend country comparative advantage are determined natural resource richness cheap labor but increasingly technological innovation and knowledge competitive application economic growth today much process knowledge accumulation capital accumulation process chapter social investment contribution smes development according analyst educational technology one the most promising sector for investment despite the fact that educational technology market with trillion year turnover completely shaded not just fintech but other investment sphere well but according techcrunch journalist the situation table have begun turn according the edtechxglobal and ibis capital report investment education and training will have reached billion besides the fact that this industry direct access school institute and university also the most reliable object for investment contrast the financial market upsanddowns education remains constant and secure from geopolitical storm according techcrunch expert digital education the largest and probably the most profitable sector geoff mugan the chief executive nesta british innovation institute adopted four technological trend education which considers the most promising for govinsider they are digital textbook blockchain crowdteaching and adaptive learning more detailed analysis modern innovative technology which may significantly change educational system configuration the nearest future deemed necessaryeducation along with number other sector such health care and telecommunication are subject significant change due digital technology increasing distribution usually the case commercial organization such private university business school and corporate university set trend for digital technology educational and research activity implementation but public university and institute are increasingly starting consider digital transformation rapid online learning adaptation which expressed the form blended learning development and mooc massive online open course active development should noted among the challenging digital innovation the term mooc invented david cormier the university prince edward island canada and brian alexander the national institute for technology liberal education massive online open course mooc training course with mass interactive participation mean elearning technology and open access via the internet and one distance learning form prospect innovative technology into educational system introduction addition traditional curriculum such video reading and homework assignment massive online open course provides opportunity use interactive user forum that help create and maintain student teacher and assistant communityonline learning development dynamic demonstrated particular available online course growth the number which doubled every year more recent time present more than course from over university are available fig online learning development dynamic advancing online segment educational service emergence can completely change this sector landscape according some estimate addition the number course offered and the number trainee annual doubling mooc market projected consolidated revenue will grow more than fivefold development digital library and digital university campus which have already been implemented many university america and europe are additional area digital technology education applicationcurrently three major mooc platform are successfully operation the usa they are edx founded harvard university and massachusetts institute technology udacity structure formed the basis computer science syllabus stanford university and coursera chapter social investment contribution smes development mooc being developed other part the world well iversity germany thousand student more than anywhere else europe open university the cryptyou spain openuped which spring the european union educational structure edukart india etcamericans were the first launch their mooc magnitude beyond competition million audience user edx many udacity and many million coursera however the opinion chikunov shared and along with undeniable advantage online learning disadvantage shall critically catalogued mooc good example technological solution into educational field implementation fact tool that allows change material delivery method instead lecture university interesting video lesson can viewed interactive task exercise etc can solved but emerged that proved ineffective traditional learning format competing due the fact that the same level material understanding impossible reached offer lecture interpretation simple test and survey but all this not enough memorize the material person often need direct communication with the teacher addition not all training fit into the lecture format there are also exercise laboratory class well design workthe matter that college and university are facing now are limited the further development strategy choice and direction focus selection obvious that digital transformation program for transition competitive educational and research model the future should now developedartificial intelligence another innovative technology that rapidly developing educational sector artificial intelligence research area associated with method for modeling individual function intelligence mean software and hardware development many application area are available theorem proving game pattern recognition decision making adaptive programming machine music composition data processing natural language knowledgebased network neural network verbal conceptual learning are among themthus according the laboratory knowledge university college london and pearson report many school and university already prospect innovative technology into educational system introduction apply artificial intelligence technology for educational purpose most them combine with big data technology order monitor whether the student attend class and tasksdue artificial intelligence introduction intellectual training system that are program that simulate the teacher behavior have appeared they are capable checking the student standard knowledge analyzing their answer reporting feedback and even scheduling personalized training programsat the moment the following example introduction both application chatbots and artificial intelligence educational sector are known automated valid classification automated written work essay assessment challenging task faced many teacher for instance both test and essay are evaluated artificial intelligence such online platform coursera edx and udasity such training program carnegie speech and duolingo use natural language processing technology identify mispronunciation and correct intermediate interval training thus polish inventor peter wozniak came with educational application based the interval effect this application back trace what studied and when mean artificial intelligence the application can track when the information likely forgotten and recommend revise only take few refresher course make sure the information stored memory for many year feedback feedback that student assessment teacher centurylong history due modern technology such aidriven chat robot computeraided learning and natural language processing lot interesting opportunity for feedback quality improvement are now available chatbot capable collecting opinion via dialog interface with the same benefit real interview but with smaller amount work required conversation can adapted accordance with answer and student personality the chatbot even capable investigating this that opinion cause besides the fact that good option for conducting survey the chatbot provides many other benefit the teacher who seek improve teaching effectiveness attracting more data source such selfassessment evaluation peer feedback and the latest scientific evidence how effectively teach more aggregate picture training effectiveness can chapter social investment contribution smes development created own data with other teacher around the world data comparison should enable the system offer new and powerful way improve teaching method well result teaching community sharing teacher assistant the georgia institute technology student enjoyed communicating with the new teacher assistant jill watson who quickly and accurately answered their different question but the student did not know that watson true identity actually ibmaisystemequipped computer with the same name with the help ashok goel professor computer science the teacher assistant watson responded with more than post the forumhaving received huge advertising jill watson now being introduced university around the world one the last added the list norwegian business school oslo norway chat campus bot that help student who have just gone the college get accustomed been created admithub student can apply for scholarship register for course issue plea for place the dormitory mean cornell university the courseq bot interview student about various problem associated with the new school year startand the university deakin victoria australia the chat campus now being tested service with the teacher assistant case the intelligence underneath ibm watson supercomputing system the chatcampus being implemented capable answering question related everything student may need know about the campus life such how find the next lecture hall how apply for the next class the semester how obtain assignment where find parking place how contact consultant all these issue can solved the socalled djinn chatbots feedback from student new approach studentcentered educational model where individual personality and student concern are the most crucial factor curriculum development being studiedthe content adapted the individual pace training and can consistently offer more complex challenge accelerate learning process thus both fast and slow student can continue training their own pacethus autotutor for example teach computer literacy physic and critical thinking communicating with student their preferred lan prospect innovative technology into educational system introduction guage and knewton software take into account each student training specific and allows develop personalized learning plan taking into account the degree mastering the material well student frequent mistake bill gate suggested that chatbots can also used tutor theoretically these service can teach almost anything thus nerdfy bot help student homework and uchebabot recommends course university and college for applicant dozen bot related education are already available around the world some help practicing signboard legal issue history etc others present rare and interesting fact however our opinion foreign language study remains the most popular area the bot application this problem come grip with russian startup edwin well the company emphasis made english language skill training the service combine artificial intelligence personalizes training plan communicates with the user the chat manages different language skill training equipment support study etc and tutor service the service needed for individual lesson spoken language practicing the author the laboratory knowledge university college london and pearson report note that artificial intelligence already actively being introduced into the group learning process used appoint group student with the same level knowledge analyze the discussion between people and mark the moment when the conversation participant get off the topicthe report state that artificial intelligence technology are capable tracking each student progress such monitoring may become mandatory the future ensure school district and country whole performance evaluation well effectiveness various training program testingresearchers believe that the future will offer educational partner that will teach person throughout his lifetime being the cloud they will available each device well offline mode instead teaching all subject these partner will able contact expert certain field requirement and then inform the user about his point view artificial intelligence technology which are already called new electricity are rapidly entering new vertical and edtech not excep chapter social investment contribution smes development tion obvious that education application will significantly change learning process the future many important problem can solved mean blockchain technology into education introduction thus currently the distributed blockchain database increasingly being integrated into document storage and control system this technology advantage lack practical capability manipulate the data recorded the system due the fact that the information the database can only added but not recirculated conversely document authenticity can easily traced everyone can trace whom recorded into the blockchain along with identification paper and banking sector kryptorevolution not ignored educational system wellcryptocurrencies including bitcoin operate basis the main blockchain feature immutability posted into the database transaction data can neither deleted nor edited since huge computing resource are required for the smallest revision blockchain technology enabling store information distributed form user key this database will have access the material posted which will provide some openness and transparency many area life however like any new technology the blockchain system date cause lot question and dispute that require solution from the expertsit should noted that currently situation digital economy market the education development sphere the initial development stagethe university nicosia become the first officially use blockchain store their diploma and certificate importantly also became the first university accept bitcoin payment massive
