financial service provider almost all area including the core banking function loan and deposit company financing mechanism changing reshaping the traditional bank activity and promoting alternative financing provider activity nontraditional financing for company alternative solution how get the necessary funding when traditional financing resource credit line loan overdraft and credit card are not available alternative financing new field with gap the theoretical and empirical aspect not clear how manage these resource effectively both from the authority and the entrepreneur point view freshlyestablished firm face many challenge get funding and they have increased since consequence the last financial crisis geopolitical situation and economic uncertainty are effecting bank risk tolerance towards new firm crediting get loan from commercial bank company need stable financial indicator and credit history that not common practise for freshlyestablished firm these process effect small company harder than the large one thus they have pay higher risk premium can get loan for shorter maturity and also need bigger collateral availability capital market issuing equity and bond for smes also problematic only company with good financial statement and positive credit history with good reputation and wellknown general can attract money directly through the capital market small amount listed company and small capitalisation europe confirm the difficulty raising fund through capital market for instance the market capitalization listed domestic company gdp the comparing with the euro area world bank meanwhile venture capital firm have become more risk adverse due pressure the industry and have focused later stage investment angel investor have become more visible and active through group syndicate and network but they also face difficulty result government many advanced economy have sought address the financing gap and perceived market failure supporting the seed and early stage market rupeikaapoga saksonova although the amount publication and research paper the topic raising alternative informal nontraditional financing increased since the availability this financing not been sufficiently researched yet mainly the researcher are specializing one kind alternative resource instead focusing the whole market kuzmina and kublina prohorovs and fainglozs venckuviene and snieska additionally there lack statistic prohorovs and fainglozs this field making the research even harder the research question this study how well known are alternative financing resource for the small and medium company europe literature review statistic report ecb european commission national country economic report indicate that smes are mostly using the formal bank credit

instrument the most popular measure loan guarantee programme which expanded substantially over furthermore new element were added these programme new instrument were created outside the traditional guarantee programme applying for particular grant important understand that grant are available according certain criterion these may related the industrial sector the target group particular development method process size the project etc lot entrepreneur latvia consider the applying process too bureaucratic too much work for rather small financial support bank special support program are temporal and have targetcharacter additionally granting small amount thus this financing type limited availability for smes especially new one solovjova rupeikaapoga saksonova figure satisfaction with the state support employee gdp sse riga and seb suggested the data from ecb and research the sustainable business centre riga school economics business people are still relatively dissatisfied with the state support loan smes venture capital and guarantee implemented from the fund business figure there official statistical data about availability but rather clear that this source come first when

positive more creative than the average market some market segment the competition among venture investor rather tight involving five and more market player financing can provided business project worth over eur and can exceed hundred million figure the baltic and nordic state world economic forum venture capital availability rating world economic forum would fair say that estonia leading the baltic group with more local angel and investment than other baltic country this can partially explained success such company microtask and course skype however the last couple year latvia and

trade system nonregulated market with loyal regulation and lower cost also allowing for listing enterprise bond further popularization the first north baltic market among smes needed well simplification the bond issue process both term the cost and paperwork summarising the availability alternative financing source latvia concluded that company mostly use short and medium loan and leasing provided bank owner funding and state support programme well whereas access venture capital business angel and crowdfunding still rather limited and problematic discussion one the main problem revealed this paper the availability alternative financing mainly researcher from the baltic state are specializing one kind alternative source venture capital latvia problem data collection processing and use informal venture capital hybrid venture capital fund lithuania etc nontraditional financing experienced rapid growth during the first decade the century institutional and private investor together with government are smes alternative financing the case latvia interested and support the further development alternative capital market different region the alternative financing sector the research reveals that there limited access informal investor due lack network uniting informal investor reluctance invest due lack investing experience regional incubator seldom produce startup attractive for alternative investor building single social network alternative financial service provider region the baltic state nordic baltic north europe etc would link them together providing better availability their service even though there are various information dissemination and publicity channel local investment agency development bank etc and knowledge centre responsible for informing smes about the availability private and public financing instrument there still lack sme awareness about that should improved returning the scope this paper with the question would alternative financing provider squeeze out the formal one the near future next year the answer yes and depending the company type and activity area according statistic the loan portfolio the commercial bank system latvia steadily shrank the period between and large extent due the effect the recession characterized writing off the bad debt and gradual correction the household indebtedness nevertheless all interviewed bank are wishing increase their loan portfolio the near future the role bank lending freshlyestablished company rather small this stage virtually impossible ass risk and possible return the investment therefore this segment the role other source funding will retain and speed their significance the current study not free from limitation current sample consists detailed survey smes latvia therefore these finding may have limited generalizability future study that replicate the current proposal including new survey for larger amount company not only latvia may provide
