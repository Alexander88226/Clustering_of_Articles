abstract financing for business crucial the starting point for production and operation activity enterprise the financing process are facing variety risk the major cause which are the external environment factor and internal management reason the paper analyzes the cause small and mediumsized enterprise sme financing risk and put forward some measure that should adopted the small and mediumsized enterprise smes deal with financing risk keywords sme fina ncing risk countermeasure the introduction sme financing risk management smes are the groundwork promote economic development construct the subject market economic and promote the social stability the strategic position which can not replaced with large enterprise the advantage which the solution employment are also prepared concern with the increasing pressure social employment especially therefore the development smes china special significance present reached million smes including individual industrial and commercial household china which constitutes more than percent the total business and become important force chinese economic and social development smes chinese have achieved the rapid healthy and sustainable development the contribution which economic growth increasing present the final product and service worth created smes equivalent about gdp gross domestic product the tax revenue paid smes about the total national however suffered the international financial crisis the capital chain many domestic company facing rupture dangerous especially almost all smes are the shortage fund certain degree owing the smaller scale poor risk tolerance asset quality and credit status difficult achieve the bank loan term there are strict restriction get the access into the capital market for the reason the immaturity and the limited capacity chinese capital market large number smes will rejected outside the security market due their size difficult meet the listing requirement for the motherboard issuance corporate bond also subject strict restriction requiring higher credit rating the larger asset size and higher profit sometimes collateral guarantee issuance corporate bond also subject strict restriction requiring higher credit rating the larger asset size and higher profit sometimes collateral guarantee therefore sme direct financing more difficult and the financing focus indirect financing such bank borrowing this make the financing channel and more financing difficult for smes china than the general business which led the bland financing after for smes finding way finance they have completely ignored the financing risk let alone managed sme financing risk management management activity that taking the initiative create condition order our utmost avoid reduce the deviation between actual benefit and anticipated benefit which caused risk incident and realize smoothly the financing and benefit through risk identification and risk assessment sme financing there are both theoretical value and practical significance explore the financing problem smes china conducive improving the sme overall quality and strength expanding the scale operation occupying larger market share and enhancing the core competitiveness enterprise order raise the fund required the same time with view providing some help for sme entrepreneur how formulate financing strategy the analysis sme financing risk and cause the sme financing risk sme financing risk that the possibility being not implemented the sme raising fund excessive cost financing and falling short the expected return that say the loss uncertainty the business what brought about the uncertainty about fundraising benefit generally there are two kind sme financing risk first the risk caused unimplemented fundraising fund are indispensable factor production the sme development the stable financing channel important prerequisite for the development smes which the most prominent problem present the lack funding and poor financing channel sme financing the conference web based business management scires difficulty have long plagued the development smes present smes which can obtain bank credit support are accounted for only about all smes our country because financing difficulty the funding need smes can not met which seriously restricted the production operation and development enterprise second the risk brought impossibility repays the main purpose enterprise collecting fund generally expand the production scale improve economic efficiency and achieve financial management objective finally fundraising order obtain more economic benefit for business will definitely increase the burden financing debt service schedule which would make the rate enterprise fundprofit higher lower than the loan interest rate due the uncertainty the rate enterprise fundprofit enterprise have the right decision and effective management they can achieve their business objective however the market economy the rapid change the market condition and increasing furious competence among enterprise may all lead failure decision and misconduct management which will make great uncertainty fundraising efficiency resulting financing risk the origin analysis sme financing risk should analyze what factor sme financing risk resulting from and understand their occurrence regularity order adopt scientific response measure protect timely forming factor enterprise finance risk are not only outside the enterprise but also internal influence external reason the first reason the national macroeconomic policy the national macroeconomic condition play very significant impact the survival and development enterprise first bank and other financial institution money supply side responsible for the provision finance for smes china the major bank are stateowned therefore the national policy are very important for sme lending secondly national policy and measure bring direct and indirect effect enterprise operating the most prominent one are the income tax policy and credit policy tax which will encourage company make full use external borrowing rather than their own fund because corporate debt will bring enterprise tax benefit finally the different economic development cycle would have significant impact corporate financing the economic takeoff and boom period for all kind strong demand enterprise product can sold and loan can repaid time the contrary during the economic downturn due reduced demand enterprise product sale are sluggish resulting decreased product yield increased unit cost and amplified enterprise business risk coupled with large number uncollectible account receivable company are faced with severe financial difficulty addition order avoid bad debt bank often develop more stringent lending standard making enterprise loan financing worse the second industry characteristic enterprise business entity the market big environment receiving the impact various factor from the same different industry therefore there are many uncertain factor the production and management activity such sale price sale volume production and operation cost mass consumption level etc the inherent profitability every industry the industry cycle the industry characteristic essential factor determine the profitability enterprise the industry addition with the development market economy and adjustment industrial structure some sunset industry will eliminated gradually enterprise which must eliminated without corporation transformation time such environmental pollution enterprise nowadays the uncertainty the complicated variable and fiercely competitive market lead the expected return uncertain resulting financing risk the third the financial market and interest rate level smes are mainly financed through bank loan the corporate financing subject the effect financial market which mainly refers the money supply and interest rate moreover the interest rate level determines the capital cost directly when the state implement the double loose policy that expansionary fiscal policy and loose monetary policy the money supply increase and the interest rate loan reduces corporate raise the fund this time the capital cost lower and the burden operating cost enterprise will reduce thus the risk enterprise financing will reduce the contrary when the country implement double tight policy that tight fiscal policy and monetary policy the money supply shrink and the interest rate loan rise enterprise finance this time capital cost and operating cost borne enterprise will larger fundraising risk thus enterprise will bear increase the forth financing risk caused the irrational bank credit structure this stage the security regarded the first operating principle for financial institution what led stateowned commercial bank which favor only those large enterprise who have well enterprise credit relatively while cold and distant smes who have the standardized management unstable efficiency and credit difficult grasp therefore the number actual borrowing significantly than their credit limit large enterprise resulting some bank resource idle but then very difficult finance for smes the conference web based business management scires internal reason first the fail financing decision lead financing risk many company with financing risk not carry out scientifically rigorous feasibility demonstration before finance but have great blindness which brings adverse effect company instead value second the imperfect management cause financial risk because lack modern theory and practice enterprise management the management concept backward the internal management basis absent management link weak the financial system unsound and transparent and financial statement provided for bank have low credibility because containing false even completely fictitious smes because various shortcoming management the continued growth smes insufficient high startup rate and high waste rate are main feature smes which make commercial financial institution very cautious china the phaseout rate nearly for year smes approximately small business are the red only about which have potential development capacity about which have poor development ability and only smes can survive more than decade therefore either the direct financing indirect financing will faced with many obstacle and the financing risk often great for smes third asymmetric information lead financing risk the difficulty sme financing the credit risk the one hand the sme credit risk difficult control the other hand the information transparency smes relatively low and the information disclosure system remains established financial institution are difficult make accurate evaluation for sme credit condition unable make effective credit decision borrowing enterprise with information superiority are likely take action which are conducive their own but harm bank and conceal the selfincriminating information thus bank will identify the type enterprise risk before lending enterprise the business the lowrisk bank will extend loan otherwise not only when the benefit greater after identification than identification bank would pay some transaction cost which are owing asymmetric information for the identification the enterprise the existence asymmetric information increase the transaction cost both financing party and restricts the level financing for enterprise most chinese smes are familyowned partnershipbased single property right small sized low technology content low antirisk capability and nonstandard financial and operation management the phenomenon untrue without financial statement exists about smes moreover the outbreak the financial crisis falling house price and increasing corporate bankruptcy make bank more reluctant lend private enterprise internal and external factor financing risk are interlinked and interact together induce the risk financing countermeasure improve management financing risk smes smes should strengthen the training financial risk awareness their manager improve the level financial budget management and enhance the scientific rationality decisionmaking first the sme manager must make clear that risk are inevitable have face and undertake risk and adopt effective measure reduce and prevent risk particular the leadership should have more clear understanding and vigilance the potential crisis and have some risk management knowledge and the capacity prevention and control secondly the sme manager should all financial projection and plan well arrange for all the budget work the accurate financial budget play important role the prevention and circumvention the sme financing risk according the shortterm production and business activity and longterm development planning smes can forecast their own demand for capital financial budget well arrange the financing plan and estimate the potential amount money raised the same time smes can determine whether fund can meet their need based the predictable funding and upon which they arrange production and business activity thus can link sme production and business the fundraising organically avoiding cash flow problem caused the two divorced from each other and guarding against the sme financing risk finally after determining the total capital demand accordance with the need production and operation smes should arrange time and number fundraising rationally that the fundraising time link with the use capital closely the amount idle fund reduced and the capital profit rate increase meanwhile the process financing decisionmaking based the calculation the cost capital and the analysis risk various funding method should arrange the capital rationally give full consideration the repaying ability and formulate the plan borrowing repaying and financial arrangement construction project order avoid the financing risk caused fund being not implemented unable meet maturing obligation they come due short the sme manager should based reality plan for the long term give consideration interest and longterm development and pay attention the scientific decisionmaking immediate both the the the conference web based business management scires smes require the strong rather than pursuing big the development process every company only enhance own core competitiveness indomitable vitality the pursuit size excess would cause heightening the debt ratio and increasing the enterprise financial risk and operational risk absence the consciousness sound and being too risky are the primary reason for indebted business failure consequence indebted management are not the business failure but also serious affecting the future commercial credit and thus affecting the refinancing capacity therefore smes should expand the endogenous financing channel actively explore the potential internal fund fully bring their enthusiasm reproduction extended scale into full play speed the flow fund and improve continuously the efficiency fund allocation and use smes should establish the modern concept that cash king and distinguish the importance between cash flow and profit cash flow the momentum for enterprise maintain the capital liquidity and sustained development which the amount affect their financing decision investment risk credit standard and enterprise value directly keeping adequate and stable cash flow particularly the net operating cash flow able show the ability generate positive earnings and the potential growth and beneficial reduce the bankruptcy risk and investment risk for smes therefore budget preparation the enterprise cash flow very important part the financial management the object corporate finance the cash and flow the short term business can maintained not entirely dependent profit but whether there enough cash for various expense accurate cash flow budget can provide early warning signal for enterprise enable operator take early measure smes should enhance the risk management related information gathering first all term financing risk smes should collect least the following important information domestic and international macroeconomic policy and economic performance industry condition state industrial policy the new law regulation and policy affecting enterprise the relevant content scientifictechnical progress and technological innovation credit condition major customer and major supplier and etc they should enhance the sensitivity interest rate change order grasp the dynamic and lay the foundation for interest rate forecast secondly they must strengthen the basic study financial theory and knowledge analyze and research the law financial situation policy change and strengthen the forecast interest rate change finally they should increase introduction risk manager and training make full use external talent and improve forecast accuracy order provide basis for investment and financing decisionmaking smes should prevent financial risk caused change interest rate for the financing risk brought about change interest rate smes should investigate carefully the capital market supplyanddemand situation and grasp development trend according interest rate accordingly make the appropriate funding arrangement funding should raised little possible only for shortterm muchneeded during the period high interest rate while the interest rate the transition from high low should minimize fundraising also and adopt the floatingrate interestbearing way for the must needed fundraising beneficial finance when the interest rate low level during the period interest rate being the transitional from low high enterprise should raise longterm fund actively and adopt the fixedrate interestbearing manner far possible reduce debt interest rate conclusion modern society sme financing channel and method have become more extensive but the risk also growing smes need strengthen their internal management improve operational strength give full consideration each risk weigh the pro and con enhance risk awareness establish the mechanism risk prevention control risk throughout every aspect business operation build risk prevention wall that they can find their selfdevelopment and boom the fierce competition reference zhao liyun zheng
