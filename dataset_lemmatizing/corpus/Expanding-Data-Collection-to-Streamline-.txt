uncaptured data increasingly available lender assessing the creditworthiness msme borrower this policy brief recommends that the define common framework for establishing new type digital regulated entity called databank facilitate sharing alternative data msme lender secure efficient and streamlined fashion promote msme lending the databank would domestic entity that draw upon data from the local jurisdiction propose databank that would house wideranging set data point acting custodian data for customer individual msmes and corporates customer would have consent right their own data data generated their mobile device shared with the databank addition customer would have the right determine which data service provider the databank could link with collate data attributed them relevant data service provider for msme customer would the ecosystem stakeholder that the msme transacts with part operation government entity the msme register with and report utility company the msme transacts with supplier the msme the msme downstream customer the key value the databank from lending perspective ability provide broader range data that may relevant lender making robust credit decision this end the databank would not define what constitutes relevant data not exclude other data that might otherwise serve factor lender credit decision rather the databank should have the

could important input such databank the databank would not have predefined boundary international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech scope term the data would store unlike pcr that structure predefines the scope data would store key feature the envisioned databank are follows databank entity the databank would repository collected data structured systematic way for easy and quick retrieval data whenever needed this data repository could accessed both local and remote server and could store information single dedicated subject multiple subject wellorganized manner databank eligibility any regulated entity managed public private enterprise could eligible databank the entity would need enter into new type licensing arrangement and operate under the ambit data privacy norm applicable that particular jurisdiction mode operation any msme could enter into agreement with the databank sharing their data return for certain specialized service offered the databank other ecosystem player using their data the databank would turn act the custodian the msme data across private and public enterprise the ecosystem upon obtaining upfront consent from the msme the databank could monetize this data sharing access with the other ecosystem player exchange for data accessconvenience fee for instance msme can share know your customer kyc document relevant address document proof with data bank the msme can then authorize the data bank share this information with any external service provider that intends use and which requires such documentation kyc requirement lender this would eliminate the need for the msme submit such document each time liaises with service provider while address proof not typical data point that lender may use for credit underwriting and may therefore not necessarily stored pcr the databank offer the lender the opportunity decide which know your customer protocol refers the process verifying the identity customer either before during the time they start doing business with the respective organization international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech data would use make credit decision lender may choose use this data location variable credit decision model data privacy access control and data security securing customer right critical ensuring the success the databank this end clear access right and data handling policy should established ensure the integrity the databank ecosystem upfront consent mechanism should implemented that customer have knowledge the possible their data participant should conduct regular risk assessment and communicate cyber incident relevant party including consumer timely manner cyber threat continuously evolve participant should create adaptable and dynamic process ensure continuous monitoring for the databank sufficiently comprehensive should allow customer minimum link the following data service provider lender alternative data provider private database iii credit bureau and credit registry government public database and credit rating agency lender lender would primarily include bank nbfcs fintechs and alternative lender these financial institution should provide granular credit information all msme borrower the databank they should also report all material event for each msme loan without any threshold amount alternative data provider private database they include organization that provide alternative data about the borrower which can aid lender decision making this can include payment company mobile operator utility online cloudbased accounting system etc credit bureau and credit registry existing credit reporting institution like credit bureau and credit registry will play crucial

ensure that there minimal overlap the data collection effort between these institution and the databank international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech government public database these entity control access key public database including litigation case collateral registry unique identifier federal and state tax information etc proposed that the databank should have external linkage these database give full profile the msme borrower credit rating agency this refers organization that assigns msme credit rating assessing borrower ability and willingness repay the debt while the above list indicative the scope data service provider would constantly evolve and grow based input and consent from the databank customer thus ensuring
