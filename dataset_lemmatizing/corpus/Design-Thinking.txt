the design business why design thinking the next competitive advantage harvard business review press framing the conceptmany people think that design thinking mean going into room with postit note and having brainstorming session with clear objective and limited business application however that far from realitydesign thinking tool for innovation which consumercentered approach that put the discovery highly nuanced even tacit consumer need the forefront the innovation process beyond consumer need take into consideration feasibility including both the available technological landscape can and viability will have commercial market hiwhile design thinking may seem radical and new been use for some time the history design thinking can traced back the participatory design the movement that characterized the quick development software prototype and that incorporated customer input into the development phasej participatory design gave way usercentered design the which focused more the need and interest end user placing them the center the processkin the design thinking started seen alternative way tackle problem solving stated nigel cross designerly way knowing paper peter rowe published book called design thinking coining the phrasel finally the design thinking popularity soared and started used for business purpose regular basis with positive impactexperts the earlier literature have established the link between the use design thinking and firm performancem fact according the design management institute design value index designled company have maintained significant stock market advantage outperforming the stock index extraordinary percent from ncopyright oliver wyman and iese few would dispute that the use design thinking and incorporation into organization innovation effort create value for customer and build loyalty nonetheless how make design thinking work and effective the banking sector open questiondesign thinking versus traditional business thinkingwe will put forward what believe are the key difference are between design thinking and traditional business thinking broadly these difference can grouped into three main categorieso importance the end customer ideating environment team compositionfirstly design thinking the focus shifted towards the end user this achieved empathy exercise trying better understand customer need and behavior from their own perspective this process result identifying possible solution that respond customer problem satisfy their need the solution are not necessarily designed justify ongoing initiative but rather learn from customer find new initiativesfurthermore research that relies exclusively data rather than incorporating subjective element like empathy may allow one know the fact what the customer did and when they did but doe not reveal the rationale and mechanism driving these action engaging design thinking and getting closer the end customer bank are better able understand the reason behind those action and turn prepare for possible future pattern behavior the same reason remain play this also implies that one ought not rely necessarily what the customer say that customer research but rather what the customer actually doe this mix relying data intuition and experimentation can provide more relevant insight than just validating problem with the current mean data analysissecondly design thinking accompanied with stimulating atmosphere that promotes new idea and encourages the participation the entire team combining creative brainstorming with structured process and team diversity creates fruitful environment that give rise idea that would not occur one single person this reinforced the test and learn philosophy that integral component design thinking encouraging team member learn from failure and reduce their aversion risk facilitating more frequent breakthrough and feedback from customer such approach ultimately enables organization think outside the box and frame the future more imaginativelythirdly design thinking doesn require that the people solving the problem expert the specific subject but rather that they have different profile and diverse way thinking bring the process also promotes collaboration and the airing new idea thus reducing the risk relying any one personcopyright oliver wyman and iese conclusion the combination enduser focus stimulation creative idea process and leveraging diverse team set the ground help organization challenge their thought process developing competitive advantageptable difference between design thinking and traditional thinkingtraditional business thinkingdesign thinkinggoalmanagementinnovationimportance end user the customer another important factor take into account the process the

them evaluate different potential business model scenario well the requisite execution capabilitiesat the intersection between business modelling and design thinking find the upstream application design thinking which make reference understanding the underlying customer need and behavior from leadership perspective and working back from them design new product serviceson the other hand the intersection between agile execution and design thinking result the downstream application the method which entail rapidly building out and prototyping capability according identified customer need

tested tool such day the life dilo provide structured way tackle this process adopting such approach bank will able focus both what consumer really need not what they say they need and why deep need and goal customer logically this requires change mindset that implies that end user will have still greater importanceonce the behavior customer understood the firm should adjust business model and position itself develop sustainable competitive advantage and new source growth given new life and work standard due disruptive technology financial service firm need adapt their business model build

thinking process can split the following five stage empathize define ideate prototype and testexhibit building capability with design thinking processesprototypeempathizeideatetestdefinesource adapted from introduction design thinking process guide hasso plattner institute design stanfordthe empathize phase been covered earlier part the strategic application design thinking process that are humancentric empathy essential understand the problem and need the end user and model the firm strategy define involves reviewing all the information gathered during the empathize stage order define the problem that solved and start setting goal and objectivescopyright oliver wyman and iese ideate encompassed within the operational application design thinking this stage the objective think about new way solve the problem identified with your business strategy involves generating idea come with innovative solution some specific technique such bodystorm brainwrite are commonly used prototype necessary once the idea have been generated essential start producing cost effective and simple prototype that generate feedback from potential user developer and give shape more refined prototype little little this way conversation around the product started test the next phase which the purpose get feedback from the end user this stage related the empathize one since the objective understand what the customer think about the product and why heshe think that here dilos are again very useful since they enable one test the product reallife settingskey challenge overcome the application design thinking financial servicesthe result our research provide initial foundation frame the main challenge that bank face when applying design thinking and some preliminary solution mitigate them this research included review literature study business case data analysis field interview and several experiment see appendix method grouped the challenge into three level leadership team and individual the leadership level there lack resource carry out the last stage the design thinking process and unrealistic expectation about generated output plus the level detail too low the team level there loss focus during the process time constraint and other specific management issue the individual level the team leader were sometimes described weak facilitator and there were also some participant issue see exhibit the following section the report provide more detail for each the challenge bodystorming rollplaying act which the design team play scenario situation gain deep understanding that situation the method most valuable use mean extract new way thinking and new information about the situation rather than only discussed brainwriting technique similar brainstorming and trigger session the general process that all idea are recorded the individual who thought them they are then passed the next person who them trigger for their own idea over one year with eight

for example participant came with proposal that did not directly solve the problemin the second place the team asked for more time during each session lacked time for one the step design thinking usually team did not sequence their activity properlyfinally there were other management issue during the whole process such difficulty arranging concrete time slot the executive agenda team member

feedback after each session about how improve the processin order tackle these challenge bank should redefine their execution adopt agile principle the case auckland saving bank the adoption requires change mindset for example embrace agile development methodology recommended that software built incrementally from the start the project instead trying deliver all once near the end this done breaking project down into smaller bit user functionality called user story prioritizing them and then delivering them continuously twoweek cyclescase auckland saving bank new zealandthe competitive

customer over mobile device reducing the need for visit physical branchcompetitors that have remained the sideline may argue that intheflesh interaction still form essential part daytoday operation however the rapid growth branchless banking both traditional and emerging market should sound the alarm for stragglersthis redefinition includes focusing not what customer said but what they did including team member from the business side early specifying deadline for intermediate step the design thinking process and fostering senior management the understanding that output can preliminary and not necessarily fully scalable and usable from the startengaging into design thinking partial way creating innovation lab but leaving the rest the organization unchanged can create issue downstream particularly the right collaborative mindset and structure not adopted from the start specifically this fragmentation may make difficult develop scale the idea generated during the ideation phasecopyright oliver wyman and iese the individual level our research also identified two challenge that arose when applying design thinkingfirstly team member sometimes described their meeting
