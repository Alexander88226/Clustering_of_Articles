penetrate the market match the momentum cowen lendingbased crowdfunding treated differently this case since clear that islam prohibits interest all cost with rabah equitybased and mur salebased based crowdfunding model islamic finance responding that the two most prominent islamic crowdfunding platform namely kapitalboostcom and ethiscrowdcom both company will screen every project and give risk rating well the expected return for each investment activity based the principle rabah all capital unguaranteed and the case default all the material the business will liquidated and returned the

where provides lot job creation across all economic sector their central challenge islamic crowdfunding there are several challenge islamic crowdfunding illustrated figure such regulatory issue project management secondary market fraud case and shariah issue this section elaborate these issue and challenge the islamic quarterly vol buerhan saiti muhammad hamal musito ensari cel figure challenge islamic crowdfunding regulatory issue all the issue raised crowdfunding regulatory issue are the most challenging the security and exchange commission sec established regulatory principle crowdfunding which cover four main point crowdfund limit investor financial background intermediary role investment eligibility meanwhile developing country like indonesia however the regulation crowdfunding fintech appears stricter where ten point are proposed financial service authority regulation malaysia regulated the islamic crowdfunding the guideline recognised market security commission where state that all the islamic financial service must comply with ifsa looking the regulation islamic crowdfunding potential and challenge various condition for example the financial service authority regulation mention risk mitigation required the credit risk where the crowdfunding operator shall take credit insurance credit guarantee since islamic crowdfunding the arabah the islamic quarterly vol islamic crowdfunding fundamental development and challenge model big question how the model can guarantee the profit returned comply with the law also malaysia guideline recognised market the regulates the fundraiser well fundraising limit crowdfunding business this guideline creates underlying perception that crowdfunding should not overlap the existing banking business therefore rather than becoming solution support real economic development this regulation hold back the business contribute more society shariah issue the business activity the first concern shariahbased crowdfunding some the business proposed the current crowdfunding are not shariahcompliant such liquor business found indiegogocom thus there need for shariah screening crowdfunding campaign comply with the shariah lendingbased crowdfunding the primary challenge for islamic crowdfunding replacing the interest rate and guaranteed capital since this type crowdfunding the leading practice the market where the massolution report stated that hold usd billion over total usd billion islamic crowdfunding should concerned with this particular type funding one solution practised ethiscrowdcom and kapitalboostcom the arabah and murabaha model however since the capital not guaranteed there can huge difference perception the market interestbased model with changing the project assessment for project assessment islamic crowdfunding mainly the banking concept financing the business should involve underlying asset that publicly known and market suitable such clothes trading this established ethiscrowdcom where involves more significant project like property business thus still challenge for islamic crowdfunding select innovative and out the box project like oculus rift which raised ten time more than usd which funded kickstartercom the islamic quarterly vol buerhan saiti muhammad hamal musito ensari cel nevertheless some onlinebased credit assessment have been established complete the demand rating agency the crowdfunding campaign such creditmonkcom modefinancecom however the perception investor the business still the stage ability pay not intention pay therefore still difficult for crowdfunding entity create trustbased transaction platform fraud case crowdfunding one the most notable issue crowdfunding scam because crowdfunding built trust challenging maintain trust the event fraud the most wellknown example crowdfunding fraud occurred the where oil and gas company named ascenergy raised usd million from crowdfunding platform about usd million that spent the founder nonbusiness material well payment other company late sec froze the asset the company for fraud another example august which revealed that skully san francisco startup designed motorcycle helmet using augmented reality and used fraudulent bookkeeping practice designed trick investor the startup had raised usd million from indiegogocom and additional usd million succeeding round venture financing alleged the company founder used the fund cover personal expense and since filed for bankruptcy these situation reveal the natural risk for investor startup company that not demonstrate the same operational control established and more tightlyregulated organisation many campaign website are being established for unveiling scam crowdfunding and related online financial market such kickscammedcom facebook gofraudme page and androidpolicecom however since the shariah all about prevention rather than treatment emphasis the significance robust due diligence the fundraising process well the need for risk management control and assurance need for secondary market since the crowdfunding platform launched the need for secondary market trade liquidity management recognised being essential the islamic quarterly vol islamic crowdfunding fundamental development and challenge however currently there fully functioning and competent secondary market leaving crowdfunding investor with option trade their share credit line this condition will result detested state play for investor who not like their money tied for the longterm according crowdfunding hub there are currently two scenario how this secondary market can developed either the leading platform will establish internal market trade liquidity from campaign their platform specific secondary market will launched however due strict regulation these initiative will most probably created backed existing stock exchange the existing stock exchange successfully create the secondary market islamic finance may disadvantage since compliance with the current secondary market already issue the near term likely that these model will coexist where will create fragmentation within the industry and continuing difficulty for investor seeking trade their asset conclusion and recommendation islamic finance the capacity face the unpredictable impact current financial activity the economy with the help technology islamic finance can compete for necktoneck with the conventional system crowdfunding can one the main game changer this industry since disrupted the financial system introducing islamic crowdfunding islamic finance can promote the real value the maqasid shariah the current financial market promoting real impact sustainability and competency the real economy islamic crowdfunding also face many challenge compete with the current crowdfunding system since the regulator are more concerned with the majority industry player for example malaysia regulates crowdfunding business secondclass player the market limiting the fund raised and the fundraiser therefore recommended have regulation supporting both banking and crowdfunding player and combining the expertise technology and financing business furthermore one the strength islamic financial institution the presence shariah member this strength impacted the public greatly since all solution are derived from shariah principle with the presence shariah member islamic crowdfunding can make their platform the islamic quarterly vol buerhan saiti muhammad hamal musito ensari cel from investor fintech business more interactive with distinguishable engaging interaction for example engaging the shariah department staff give realtime feedback issue that arise within transaction give realtime shariah screening each business offered thus one the strength islamic finance shariah workforce which can utilised effectively islamic crowdfunding protect fraudulent crowdfunding campaign crowdfunding institution should carefully screen the business offered webpage regulator can introduce regulation for crowdfunding make periodic check the campaign offered the public other than that the crowdfunding entity can create stricter application use unique credit scoring available prevent scam crowdfunding can also create open discussion the platform for the investor well the entrepreneur produce transparent system investment crowdfunding player could also create secondary market exit strategy the business regulator could create online platform secondary market for crowdfunding investor this could include two section which are equitybased and debtbased crowdfunding this platform the crowdfund holder could market and trade their asset due transparency the
