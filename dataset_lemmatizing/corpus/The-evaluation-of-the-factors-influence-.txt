the rural area the coefficient industry the firm positive and statistically significant and confirms the study hypothesis the odd ratio for primary firm industry with pvalue odd ratio for secondary industry with pvalue odd ratio for tertiary industry with pvalue while odd ratio for quaternary industry with pvalue result implies that access debt financing positively related firm industry whereby most the source financing prefer lending more the secondary sector while other sector left unsupported lender therefore result comply with hall and barbosa moraes that industry that firm operates influence access debt financing the coefficient size business measured the number employee confirms the study hypothesis carrying positive sign and significant statistically the odd ratio for small

european journal business and management wwwiisteorg issn paper issn online vol access debt financing than smaller and medium sized firm because economy scale therefore larger firm find easier borrow

age business which burden young firm whereby smes are dominant the result supported coleman and cohn finding the existence positive association between the firm employing debt with incorporation and per study hypothesis the odd ratio for limited firm with pvalue the odd ratio for the sole proprietorship and partnership note with pvalue this study find out most the firm operating sole proprietorship partnership face difficulty access the debt finance from lender because high cost and lack trust openness declared the financial statement and limited liability make limited company and

support bougheas and fatoki and assah that collateral requirement key characteristic for smes succeed access debt finance from financial institution the result the regression result ownermanager
