strategik penting dalam pengurusan fasiliti yang dapat membantu dalam mengekalkan kelangsungan perniagaan dan memastikan kemandirian perniagaan semasa bencana berlaku oleh itu industri kecil dan sederhana iks yang membentuk sektor perniagaan yang paling besar dalam ekonomi dunia perlu dilindungi daripada bencana dengan satu sistem yang dapat memulihkan keadaan sesuatu perniagaan dengan cepat dan tanpa gangguan walaupun pkp telah wujud malaysia hampir sedekad majoriti iks malaysia mempunyai tahap pengetahuan yang rendah terhadap kewujudan dan kepentingan bcm kepada organisasi perniagaan iks mereka juga mempunyai masalah dalam melaksanakan bcm secara sistematik kekurangan perbincangan ilmiah dalam bidang akademik berkaitan pkp terutama yang menjurus kepada faktor kejayaan kritikal fkk bagi perlaksanan pkp dalam iks telah mendorong bagi menyiapkan kajian ini objektif kajian ini pula adalah untuk menentukan fkk yang terlibat dan untuk menggambarkan hubungan antara struktur fkk bagi mejayakan perlaksanaan pkp untuk iks malaysia berdasarkan kajian literatur menyeluruh yang telah dibuat fkk telah dikenal pasti bagi melaksanakan pkp iks malaysia oleh yang demikian sesi temubual telah diadakan bersama dengan pakar pkp melalui kaedah interpretive structural modelling ism bagi mengesahkan dapatan kajian literatur yang telah dibuat dan seterusnya membangunkan hubungan struktur antara fkk yang telah dikenal pasti hasil temubual telah diubah kepada satu model yang berasaskan ism melalui beberapa prosedur untuk membangunkan model berasaskan ism berikutan hasil temubual komitmen dan sokongan pengurusan tertinggi merupakan faktor penggerak utama diikuti oleh industri fokus pihak berkepentingan utama sumber manusia perubahan budaya pemilikan dan anggaran kewangan manakala input program adalah faktor yang paling bergantung dengan kuasa kebergantungan dan diikuti oleh komunikasi berkesan penyertaan kemudahan dan kakitangan jawatankuasa bcp kempen kesedaran dan kepimpinan terdapat dua fkk iaitu pertubuhan pkp dan pendidikan dan latihan pkp telah disimpulkan sebagai tidak stabil kerana mempunyai nilai yang sama terhadap nilai penggerak dan kebergantungan fkk perundangan tidak mempunyai kaitan dalam sistem kerana faktor ini tidak memberi banyak pengaruh terhadap faktor yang lain bagi memastikan kejayaan perlaksanaan pkpdi malaysia kajian kebolehlaksanaan kemudiannya dijalankan untuk membandingkan model tersebut dengan keadaan sebenar dalam aspek sosial teknikal dan ekonomi justeru mengesahkan secara empirikal model berasaskan ism itu tadi secara ringkasnya kajian ini telah mencapai objektifnya apabila senarai fkk telah ditemui dan seterusnya dibangunkan satu model hubungan berstruktur fkk bagi membangunkan strategi yang berkesan untuk
