strategic tool that able help ensuring the survivability any business time disruption accordingly small and medium enterprise that make the largest business sector world economy need protected from disruption and provide fast and uninterrupted recovering system however while bcm been malaysia for decade most the smes have low level knowledge towards the existence bcm and importance towards their business organisation they are also confronting difficulty implementing bcm systemically the success factor for the implementation bcm smes the current academic resource are limited there are objective this research intended determine the csfs and describe the structural relationship between the successful bcm implementation malaysia smes based literature review csfs were identified top management commitment and support industry focus key stakeholder human resource cultural change ownership bcm organisation financial and budget effective communication education and training bcm legislation participation facility and staff bcp committee awareness campaign leadership and input bcm programme expert opinion interview through interpretive structural modelling were sought confirm the literature finding the expert opinion were also sought develop the relationship between the csfs converting the opinion into ismbased model through stepbystep procedure developing ismbased model the model revealed that top management commitment and support the major driving factor followed industry focused key stakeholder human resource cultural change ownership and financial budget respectively input bcm program the most dependent factor followed effective communication participation facility and staff bcp committee awareness campaign and leadership accordingly the bcm organisation and education and training bcm were deduced unstable for having strong dependency and driving power legislation found disconnected because doe not influence other factor much for the successfulness bcm implementation malaysia smes feasibility study then conducted compare the ismbased model with the actual implementation the aspect social technical and economic aspect hence empirically confirmed the established ismbased structural model summary this research accomplished objective providing the list csfs required and consequently developing the structured relationship

pengurusan fasiliti yang dapat membantu dalam mengekalkan kelangsungan perniagaan dan memastikan kemandirian perniagaan semasa bencana berlaku oleh itu industri kecil dan sederhana iks yang membentuk sektor perniagaan yang paling besar dalam ekonomi dunia perlu dilindungi daripada bencana dengan satu sistem yang dapat memulihkan keadaan sesuatu perniagaan dengan cepat dan tanpa gangguan walaupun pkp telah wujud malaysia hampir sedekad majoriti iks malaysia mempunyai tahap pengetahuan yang rendah terhadap kewujudan dan kepentingan bcm kepada organisasi perniagaan iks mereka juga mempunyai masalah dalam melaksanakan bcm secara sistematik kekurangan perbincangan ilmiah dalam bidang akademik berkaitan pkp terutama yang menjurus kepada faktor kejayaan kritikal fkk bagi perlaksanan pkp dalam iks telah mendorong bagi menyiapkan kajian ini objektif kajian ini pula adalah untuk menentukan fkk yang terlibat dan untuk menggambarkan hubungan antara struktur fkk bagi mejayakan perlaksanaan pkp untuk iks malaysia berdasarkan kajian literatur menyeluruh yang telah dibuat fkk telah dikenal pasti bagi melaksanakan pkp iks malaysia oleh yang demikian sesi temubual telah diadakan bersama dengan pakar pkp melalui kaedah interpretive structural modelling ism bagi mengesahkan dapatan kajian literatur yang telah dibuat dan seterusnya membangunkan hubungan struktur antara fkk yang telah dikenal pasti hasil temubual telah diubah kepada satu model yang berasaskan ism melalui beberapa prosedur untuk membangunkan model berasaskan ism berikutan hasil temubual komitmen dan sokongan pengurusan tertinggi merupakan faktor penggerak utama diikuti oleh industri fokus pihak berkepentingan utama sumber manusia perubahan budaya pemilikan dan anggaran kewangan manakala input program adalah faktor yang paling bergantung dengan kuasa kebergantungan dan diikuti oleh komunikasi berkesan penyertaan kemudahan dan kakitangan jawatankuasa bcp kempen kesedaran dan kepimpinan terdapat dua fkk iaitu pertubuhan pkp dan pendidikan dan latihan pkp telah disimpulkan sebagai tidak stabil kerana mempunyai nilai yang sama terhadap nilai penggerak dan kebergantungan fkk perundangan tidak mempunyai kaitan dalam sistem kerana faktor ini tidak memberi banyak pengaruh terhadap faktor yang lain bagi memastikan kejayaan perlaksanaan pkpdi malaysia kajian kebolehlaksanaan kemudiannya dijalankan untuk membandingkan model tersebut dengan keadaan sebenar dalam aspek sosial teknikal dan ekonomi justeru mengesahkan secara empirikal model berasaskan ism itu tadi secara ringkasnya kajian ini telah mencapai objektifnya apabila senarai fkk telah ditemui dan seterusnya dibangunkan satu model hubungan berstruktur fkk bagi membangunkan strategi yang berkesan untuk perlaksanaan pkp iks

plan bcp introduced assist organization reengineering and strategizing their business the inevitability crisis within the business environment suggests that the majority the organisation should have bcp pitt goyal however bcp only part the element that constitutes bcm whole explained jones bcp part bcm process that identifies potential risk and vulnerability and their impact organization provides process and procedure for mitigating the risk and effectively responding disruptive event way that safeguard the interest the organisation key stakeholder reputation brand and valuecreating activity the strategic contribution offered both bcp and appears acknowledged and understood the theorist academic professional body and key stakeholder pitt goyal nonetheless survey conducted manager revealed that over the business surveyed did not have basic plan mitigate the effect disaster furthermore half all business that are impacted disastrous event are out business for two week and two out five enterprise that experience disaster will longer business five year after the event momani thus difficult under estimate the importance having bcm organization accordingly like any other organization the world malaysia smes are susceptible event disaster which can disrupts the normal business operation hour and also will result loss productivity loss revenue and potentially loss professional reputation matter fact disaster that took place neighbouring country also potential disrupt the malaysian business organisation for instance the earthquake taiwan disrupted internet connection several country asia and had large impact malaysia too nazri fact everest highlighted that emergency preparedness longer the sole concern business located earthquake tornadoprone area the world the preparedness must also take into account for manmade disaster such terrorist attack well pandemic and natural disaster moreover natural disaster represents only all serious business jeopardized nemzow malaysia most the threat towards organization came from cyber space such hacking harassment forgery malicious wormsviruses and threat wlan niser niser also stated that the number incident reported more than case and that mail spamming intrusion and virus attack are the most common threat organization malaysia furthermore survey the current bcm adoption status the small and medium enterprise smes the apec region revealed that flood fire and blackout were chosen the respondent the major potential threat for private sector organization malaysia asian disaster reduction centre nevertheless during the conference for the asian ministerial conference disaster risk reduction lin from pricewaterhousecoopers pwc malaysia pointed out that the implementation bcm malaysia not comprehensive varies sector generally sector with comprehensive bcm program only cover financial service telecommunication multinational oil and gas corporation and the airline and aerodrome sector while other sector such smes are more adhoc lin fact survey conducted asian disaster reduction centre adrc and taiwan institute economic research tier bcm adoption status smes industry among apec highlighted that the respondent from malaysia answered that they did not know about bcm thus indicating low level bcm development and awareness among the smes asian disaster reduction centre further supporting the above recent literature review uncovered the issue and problem that lead poor awareness and implementation bcm among smes the issue stated are lack top management commitment and support complexity business plan iii too costly for smes lack understanding and coordination organisation financial performance lack bcm knowledge and expertise vii lack information needed for bcm development and lacking commitment cultural change the organisation enisa botha von solms furthermore until today there academic research malaysia focussing the bcm implementation smes there only three study done mansol that focused the success factor bcm implementation malaysia organisation realising the research gap that existed there need study the success factor bcm implementation malaysia smes smes important and critical the big organisation problem statement ideally bcm organisation last line defence when all other control have failed bcm may prevent drastic event such injury loss life failure organisation ensures that the business will operate prior during and after the disaster event gibb buchanan conrad enisa bcm also capable minimising the time interruption business operation reducing the impact disaster enables rapid recovery and resumption critical business function for the fulfilment business obligation botha von solms garrett syrmoula nevertheless despite realising the significant bcm implementation smes malaysia and all the effort related authority most the local smes still failed understand what bcm all about let alone implement the reason behind the failure lie much the late awareness the importance bcm malaysia shamsudin jalil certified cyber defence associate with cyber security malaysia and also abcp certified with dri malaysia started discus how raise the awareness bcm importance malaysia suggesting five crucial point one the point increase the number certified bcm professional the country hence result dri institute continuity management for malaysia chapter established promote bcm educational and certification program malaysia the second crucial point suggested shamsudin jalil develop fasttrack bcm national standard guide the organisation consequently the year the first malaysia standard bcm framework published sirim however the new standard discus and provides the endusers with structured process developing bcm framework but not guideline how implement the bcm framework organisation the failure understand bcm further highlighted survey adrc and tier that the respondent from malaysia smes answered that they did not know about bcm and apart from that recent study also showed that bcm malaysia seldom discussed academically currently malaysia there are only three academic paper published researcher from usim that discussed bcm academically focused public organisation but not smes majority the academic paper bcm were published international researcher and focused the concept bcm only there are international academic paper that discussed bcm smes malaysia the first out three study mentioned above focused exploring and identifying the success factor the execution bcm the organisation that had been carried out mansol this study carried out local licensed public key infrastructure pki authority the finding identified four success factor namely management commitment training and skill iii awareness and information and knowledge sharing the second study aimed explore and identify the effect organisational culture the successful implementation bcm malaysian organisation carried out mansol and malaysian organisation and department were selected the respondent the study highlighted the organisation employee view the importance and effect organisational culture bcm implementation and the result are very useful guidance for organisation malaysia specifically monitor security incident threat for the third study aimed present the organisational culture metric model using goalquestionmetric gqm approach measuring the readiness the organisation implement bcm and bcm compliance the finding this study would definitely help the organisation term their readiness set bcm and bcm compliance the organisation short the review the above literature highlighted several salient point firstly successfully execute bcm the malaysian organisation the four success factor namely management commitment training and skill iii awareness and information and knowledge sharing must achieved secondly organisational culture greatly impact and play important role organisation term bcm readiness and implementation organisational culture the control mechanism guide and bind employee the organisation through the acceptance defined standard and rule the literature also highlighted that gqm approach shall help assist developing the organisation that they adapt bcm culture and implementation thirdly clearly show that there are academic research far that focus bcm implementation malaysian smes hence this prof that the research the subject timely and called for accordingly the problem statement laid the foundation for the study focus answering the following research question what are the csfs for the bcm implementation malaysian smes what are the structural relationship between the critical success factor for successful bcm implementation malaysian smes objective the research based the problem statement and research question this study focused achieve the following objective determine the csfs for the bcm implementation malaysian smes develop the structural relationship between the csfs for the bcm implementation malaysian smes scope research the research encircled the bcm and due the rarity bcm implementation smes industry malaysia the research cover the following scope bcm professional manager and consultant alike that been trained and credited with professional certification dri malaysia institute continuity management the reason choosing such scope due strong reason that the professional skill experience and credibility are acknowledged and certified nonprofit world organisation such dri malaysia institute continuity management this prevent uncertainty and doubt over the professional bcm experience and course the opinion that are stated during the interview which will dictate unfavorably over the outcome the research plus dri malaysia institute continuity management certification and credibility recognised bnm sirim unisdr and iso research methodology achieving the research objective two methodology were applied throughout this study the two method are literature review expert opinion interview the aim and technique each these method and consequently the relevant methodological issue the data collection technique are briefly discussed the next page literature review literature review archival research exists report finding from individual study collection study that help reader appreciate and understand the quality evidence supporting the research divided into two whether primary secondary data wayne menzer and influenced different paradigm that affect the way research are designed the finding and the claim that the researcher might make crossan brotchie the objective reviewing provides overview and critical evaluation related literature within prior bcm smes research finding the literature gap methodology been used and the csfs bcm implementation smes hundred article from dozen journal and database search were explored using keywords identified from the literature review related with bcm regardless the type industry are included this phase also enabled the researcher design appropriate strategy collecting and analysing the data expert opinion interview interview can take many form however highlighted yin interview may fall into two type structured interview and qualitative interview there are option within these two type how carry out the interview the researcher free conduct facetoface interview with the participant interview participant telephone engaging them focus group interview with six eight interviewee each group usually qualitative research the sample are purposively selected that will best helping the researcher understands the problem and the research question creswell this study the interaction between the interviewer and interviewee were carefully scripted into the ism structured interview the interviewer start with formal questionnaire that list every question asked then the interviewer formally adopts the role interviewer trying elicit response from the interviewee the interviewer then try adopt the same consistent behaviour when interviewing with every participant their demeanour will also scripted usually the result some earlier and studyspecific training aimed conducting the data collection uniformly possible highlighted yin structured interview also tend favour certain kind question namely question where interviewee are limited set response predefined the researcher moreover majority the respondent are not available for facetoface interview thus telephone interview skype interview and email conversation were also employed the interviewer give more flexibility towards the interviewee the ism structured interview constructed particularly obtain the relationship between the csfs that the study can achieve objective the sample purposively selected from the list bcm professional available dri malaysia website and also linkedin account generally expert opinion interview were sought for two main purpose the first purpose that the expert opinion were sought determine the structural relationship the csfs construct for successful implementation bcm malaysia smes using the ism method meanwhile for the second purpose second interview were done gathering expert opinion the validity and feasibility the csfs model identified result obtained the completed ism method the flowchart for this study shown
