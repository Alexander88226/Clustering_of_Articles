economics the university ttingen ifh phone the distinguishing feature small and mediumsized enterprise smes are not only their size and the economic sector they belong they also pursue wide range innovation activity and consequently face different barrier innovation enterprise that not pursue pioneer strategy face barrier innovation particularly often different barrier innovation predominate different sme group with financing problem affecting primarily small and young smes and business pursuing growth strategy bureaucratic obstacle turn mainly affect company the construction industry for further group smes organisational and skill problem combination with financing difficulty and high market risk are the most widespread barrier innovation these are often company traditional lowtech sector craft industry and business with low level profitability the two group mentioned last are also characterised the fact that they usually bring forth incremental innovation the heterogeneity the sme sector and the diversity obstacle innovation suggest that innovation support for smes should broadbased well and comprise both financial and nonfinancial support particularly enterprise whose innovation are not based their own but emerge primarily from the normal work process and through interaction with customer and supplier that the availability skilled worker organisational problem and lack technological expertise constitute key obstacle developing innovation major building block that promote innovation include measure aimed training and upskilling staff support for the development innovation management system and the transfer scientifictechnical knowledge addition continuous improvement the financing situation small and mediumsized enterprise smes are regarded guarantor growth and employment smes innovation activity key source competitiveness declined the past year however the proportion innovator among smes company with turnover eur million fell from between and between and the share innovation expenditure enterprise with fewer than employee also dropped from smes innovation activity developed different way the proportion innovator remained comparatively steady the intensive manufacturing sector engineering electronics pharmaceutical over the past ten year but innovation momentum declined particularly among the small enterprise and company the construction and service sector and the doriented industry the manufacturing sector other word innovator have been lost precisely those segment that conduct more rarely and bring forth innovation irregular interval this development itself indicates that contrary what often assumed smes are anything but homogeneous group besides their size and the branch industry which they belong smes differ substantially particularly the focus their innovation activity for example just under two fifth innovator conduct activity their own occasionally continuously that also mean that around three fifth conduct all their innovation strategy and goal also differ two third use their innovation develop individual customer solution one fourth them aim the technological leader their respective industry equally many smes state that they merely respond their competitor innovation stand reason that smes include diverse type innovator that also face barrier innovation different intensity the institute for small business economics the university ttingen ifh ttingen and kfw research have therefore examined together what obstacle hamper the innovation activity various group smes see box for methodology the analysis focused the dactive segment the sme sector where the innovative output fallen most sharply since the middle the last decade digitalisation addressed separate study the analysis allows the sme

cluster includes roughly extrapolated the surveyed smes these are mainly larger and older enterprise with average employee they are significantly bigger than the enterprise the other cluster table the average company age also the highest year importantly the enterprise this cluster are characterised high profit margin these characteristic should explain why barrier innovation affect them than

cluster financing problem cluster bureaucratic barrier source kfw sme panel own calculation box two mode bringing forth innovation reasonable distinguish between very dintensive and dintensive segment because each segment brings forth innovation different way economic literature therefore distinguishes between two different mode bringing forth innovation the first mode based conducting innovation primarily emerge the framework systematic and formalised work inhouse department this activity generates new scientifictechnical knowledge this new knowledge form the basis for innovation created the respective enterprise partnership with research facility also contribute innovation this dintensive mode fall under the label science technology and innovation sti mode contrast the second mode based experiencebased skill acquired through learning doing using and interacting duo mode generating innovation informal process learning and understanding dominate here given the key importance applicationrelated skill innovation result from the normal production process close interaction with customer and supplier the ability bring forth innovation therefore strongly based applicationrelated and employeebased experiential knowledge acquired over the year innovation that emerge this manner are often incremental and very specific problem solution they are frequently tailored specific need the course gradual optimisation these two mode obviously represent theoretical extreme practice enterprise must capable combining various form learning and knowledge order successfully generate innovation the sti mode relatively easy capture asking whether the enterprise conducted own this much more challenging for the knowledge component applicationrelated employeebased experiential knowledge obtain answer the survey examined whether company primarily conducted activity that can attributed the skilled craft this seems appropriate because the craft sector can expected dominated experiencebased learning and innovation mode precisely the masterapprentice learning relationship that typical the skilled craft which the apprentice develops particular skill under guided learningbydoing approach which regarded showcase example how experiential knowledge transferred smes facing barrier innovation the area organisation and skill feature cluster smes facing barrier innovation the area organisation and skill older company traditional lowtech sector other manufacturing food industry manufacture metal product rubber and synthetic product construction craft enterprise low profitability investment goal rationalisation and cost reduction innovation goal incremental innovation for enterprise cluster the main barrier innovation activity are the level organisation and skill these include lack technological expertise lack relevant market information and shortage skilled worker financing difficulty and market risk also constitute obstacle innovation this cluster extrapolated smes are this group this group company the lowest profit margin which among other reason probably consequence problem the area organisation and skill can assumed that these internal difficulty adversely affect business success which probably give rise their financing difficulty well the business this cluster are slightly older than the sample average and are often found dintensive manufacturing and more often construction figure focus economics problem with organisation and skill are therefore widespread particularly the sector that comprise large number rather more traditional industry figure skilled craft and cluster assignment variance the proportion skilled craft from the sample share the respective cluster percentage point cluster strong focus cluster barrier the area organisation and skill cluster financing problem cluster bureaucratic barrier source kfw sme panel own calculation cost reduction and rationalisation are important investment goal which may indicate the preponderance price pressure this segment business this cluster seek evade such pressure through incremental innovation activity consequently their most important innovation strategy consist specialisation customerspecific solution and flexibilisation product and service cluster also includes comparatively high number smes that primarily operate the skilled craft sector figure innovation here often result from the normal work process and through interaction with customer and supplier applicationrelated and employeebased experiential knowledge likely their most common source innovation the high importance problem the area organisation and skill this cluster underscore the particular learning and knowledge condition under which innovation are brought forth here box smes facing financing problem barrier innovation feature cluster smes with financing problem young and small enterprise research and knowledgeintensive segment the manufacturing and service sector belowaverage profitability growth orientation page kfw research financing problem are the main obstacle innovation for business cluster these business represent the biggest group small and young business tend more abundant this cluster this finding impressively underscore the structural disadvantage these company face financing innovation since young and small business per constitute higher risk and often request low amount from the point view potential lender obtaining external financing for innovation particular challenge for these enterprise business this cluster also tend achieve low profit margin this too reduces their ability finance innovation from internal external fund financing problem are therefore most common this group contrast cluster not marked any single innovation strategy individual specific target however investment undertaken these enterprise are directed strongly increasing turnover and expanding and renewing their product range this consistent with the fact that the enterprise this cluster are small and young business investment aimed increasing turnover and introducing new product line are probably expression drive towards growth which often hampered financing problem this cluster smes facing bureaucratic barrier innovation feature cluster smes facing bureaucratic barrier innovation older company construction high profitability investment goal rationalisation and cost reduction innovation goal incremental innovation finally bureaucratic barrier are the main problem for enterprise cluster they include obstacle that originate legislation legal requirement and standard well lengthy administrative and approval procedure the affected business tend older and their size corresponds with the sample average this cluster mainly includes construction firm bureaucratic obstacle are surprise here construction activity particular subject strict legal and regulatory framework similarity exist between cluster and with respect investment and innovation target cost reduction and rationalisation are important investment goal for these enterprise well incremental innovation activity also prevalent this cluster specialisation

own calculation page focus economics significant difference between the business these two cluster consists the fact that the innovation target compliance with law regulation norm standard make very likely for them belong cluster this may seem surprising first glance because enterprise this cluster also perceive the legal and regulatory framework major obstacle however noted that legal requirement may also provide incentive for innovation environmental regulation that encourage the development ecologically safe product and process are one example conclusion the above analysis examined the innovation obstacle faced smes the focus sme segment not characterised pronounced orientation the analysis show that enterprise that not pursue any pioneer strategy are affected particularly often obstacle innovation line with the broad diversity the sme sector various innovation obstacle exist variety constellation thus financing problem primarily affect small and young enterprise and company pursuing growth strategy the next two group business turn are characterised incremental innovation bureaucratic obstacle innovation are particularly significant for construction enterprise further group which includes business from traditional lowtech segment and the skilled craft sector affected primarily problem the level organisation and skill combined with financing problem and market risk given the heterogeneity the sme sector and the diversity obstacle innovation innovation support for smes must broadbased well and comprise both financial and nonfinancial support this allows different support offering address the main innovation obstacle faced various sme group table obstacle the area organisation and skill play important role particularly enterprise whose innovative output based applicationrelated and employeebased experiential knowledge the demographic trend likely further exacerbate the skill shortage measure aimed mobilising training and upskilling worker are therefore very useful addition the competencerelated obstacle demonstrate that more traditional smedominated segment particular need support incorporating external scientifictechnical knowledge moreover innovative smes can compensate the lack inhouse certain degree structuring their learning and innovation process more systematically support implementing adequate employeeoriented innovation management system should therefore another important approach removing skillsrelated barrier innovation table approach promoting innovation dactive segment the sme

fivepoint scale for the period the survey also included range additional information that permitted more indepth classification innovation obstacle the specific context the surveyed business the survey included enterprise with fewer than employee that introduced product process innovation within the enterprise from the survey also limited enterprise which specific obstacle innovation activity
