the collapse the bubble economy much criticism came regarding the fact that the ministry finance held dual function financial administration and public financing there also increasing criticism regarding the discretionary and obscure financial administration the ministry finance which had led the collapse the bubble economy therefore the function financial supervision removed from the ministry finance first this function transferred the financial supervisory agency later july the financial service agency fsa founded and given authority for overall financial administration that time the fsa commissioner discourse the commencement the financial service agency promised japanese citizen greater clarification rule prompt and stricter implementation those rule well improvement the

aimed creating desirable financial system for the future borrow slogan from the fsa the system entering phase that saw qualitative progress financial regulation better regulation however the third stage suddenly terminated reality the global financial crisis directly triggered the bankruptcy lehman brother occurred and financial regulation respond the crisis had implemented again japanese economy and financial institution under the global financial crisis macroeconomic impact the global financial crisis shown figure real gdp growth rate for the fourth quarter negative naturally japanese corporate performance deteriorated shown figure the average return asset roa sharply declined from for for natural expect that these sharp decline economic activity would lead substantial increase corporate bankruptcy the number corporate bankruptcy shown figure although the number increased from the previous year considerably smaller than around when the figure reached over that measured corporate bankruptcy the effect the global financial crisis not unprecedented direct reason for this unexpected result that firm could borrow new money and obtain japan society monetary

difficulty japanese firm might have been severer than what figure show figure show borrower side data this figure show that large firm borrowed substantial money from bank during the peak the global financial crisis but small and mediumsized firm smes did not increase borrowing the same time however notable that smes paid back lower amount than before the crisis bank might support smes giving smes period grace why did bank extend more loan borrower who had become riskier due the global financial crisis when bank conduct business model called transaction banking bank evaluate credit risk borrower timely manner natural that bank downgraded credit evaluation most borrower during the global financial crisis bank loan might have decreased reality bank loan increased most japanese bank perform the relationship banking business model where bank and borrower have longterm relationship which mitigates information asymmetry bank can support firm who face temporal difficulty because the bank believe that firm will become profitable after the crisis end therefore natural that bank performing relationship banking tend increase loan longterm customer during the crisis this might the case for japan however the government worried about whether voluntary support provided bank were enough keep smes afloat rather the government afraid that bank might overestimate borrower risk and hesitate extend supportive loan the japanese economy experienced such situation during the financial system crisis the late and early therefore the government decided introduce various measure protect

measure taken the government ensure smooth supply fund smes during that period public capital injection brief description capital injection observer recognized that many japanese bank suffered from insufficient capital because huge loss caused nonperforming loan and decline asset price however there were japan society monetary economics fysmepsn japanese journal monetary and financial economics vol strong political criticism that the government intended save guilty bank the sacrifice taxpayer the government experienced bitter negotiation provide billion yen and rescue almost bankrupt housing loan company jyusen although the government recognized that scheme inject public fund into weak but still solvent bank necessary protect the financial system hesitated propose the scheme the congress respond the financial crisis that aggravated the failure bank such hokkaido takushoku bank november the financial function stabilization act finally established based the act the first injection public fund into bank japan increase capital occurred march total public fund trillion were injected into bank including large city bank however because the injection small the weak management bank such ltcb that received the injection remained unresolved the reason why the injection small that the government still concerning the political criticism and that bank were afraid the reputation risk that capital injection would signal weak bank and trigger depositor bank run summer the world financial crisis that originated japan feared due the increase japan premium while international financial crisis including asian currency crisis were expanding thus the japanese public recognized that largescale capital injection necessary and the act emergency measure for early strengthening financial function enacted october total capital injection trillion prepared based the act beginning with injection trillion for bank march march total trillion injected based the act after the bank recapitalization bill lapsed the financial crisis response ordained the deposit insurance law the only possible scheme for further injection public fund into bank amount trillion public fund injected into resona bank may based this scheme because the scheme supposed exercised only state emergency this measure taken only after problem occurred therefore the financial function strengthening act approved which enabled the government inject capital prophylactically into financial institution that are solvent but that japan society monetary economics japanese journal monetary and financial economics vol can not perform adequate financial function due insufficient capital revised act special measure for strengthening financial function because bank japan are subject the capital adequacy rule they are required hold additional equity capital increase lending therefore after the lehman shock the concern that credit crunch credit withdrawal would triggered regarding smes given this capital adequacy rule moreover many bank had weak capital adequacy ratio the financial system would become unstable the financial function strengthening act which enabled the government inject public fund for prevention purpose based application from financial institution implemented strengthen the financial condition regional financial institution japan the act effect from the end august the end march unfortunately when the lehman shock hit japan the act not effect given the seriousness the global financial crisis the government decided implement new financial function strengthening act hereafter the revised act december the revised act scheduled effect until march because the old act placed significant responsibility the director bank that received public fund bank manager hesitated apply for such assistance only two bank kiyo holding inc kiyo bank and howa bank received public fund unlike the old act the revised act doe not impose heavy penalty bank executive when the bank applies for capital injection table list the bank that received injection public fund under the revised act the table indicates that the number bank that applied for injection much higher than under the old act the other hand because penalty imposed management and shareholder were not significant under the revised act there concern that serious problem moral hazard may occur namely the government assigned the highest priority making bank continue provide loan smes japan society monetary economics japanese journal monetary and financial economics vol table bank that received capital injection under the revised financial function strengthening act name financial institution date capital injection amount million hokuyo bank fukuho bank minami nihon bank michinoku bank kirayaka bank daisan

taiyo bank march note the capital injection into shinkumi federation bank made through purchasing trust beneficiary right other injection were made purchasing preferred share source deposit insurance corporation japan redefinition nonperforming loan november the fsa revised several rule that defined nonperforming loan before the revision the regulatory rule generally classified loan borrower whose loan condition such payment schedule and interest rate were changed nonperforming loan difficult for bank provide new loan such downgraded borrower therefore firm hesitated ask bank change loan condition bank also hesitated change loan condition because they had write down these conditionchanged loan resulting lower capital ratio the new rule introduced wider exceptional instance under which bank were allowed not japan society monetary economics japanese journal monetary and financial economics vol classify conditionchanged loan nonperforming loan for example under the new rule the borrower have credible restructuring plan and are confidently expected attain the normal status borrower classification within approximately five year within year appropriate the borrower whose loan condition changed are allowed classified normal status this revised rule had significant impact figure section show that the balance nonperforming loan increased only slightly despite the fact that the economic slowdown significant regarding the fsa report factor change nonperforming loan trillion loan originally classified nonperforming loan loan that require monitoring were upgraded normal status because credible restructuring plan drawn while the figure for before the rule changed only trillion also the amount loan downgraded from normal status nonperforming status trillion which than before the crisis namely the figure and were trillion and trillion respectively this suggests that many borrower maintained normal status drawing credible restructuring plan amid the global financial crisis this regulatory measure controversial downgrading likely damage borrower and decrease the chance for them recover also reasonable that loan borrower with truly credible restructuring plan are classified normal status owing this measure bank can support borrower without worrying about loss due the writeoff this measure enables the financial system continue functioning smoothly however this measure downside speaking the extreme always possible draw year plan for borrower revitalize sweeping real issue under the rug both bank and firm might not forced perform painful reform harada hoshi hosono koibuchi and sakuragawa among others pointed out that this measure damage the trustworthiness japanese bank disclosure because subjective judge whether restructuring plan credible japan society monetary economics japanese journal monetary and financial economics vol temporal loosening capital adequacy ratio regulation the government released economic policy measure package named seikatsu taisaku october part this measure the government decided loosen the capital adequacy ratio regulation tackle the global financial crisis this measure scheduled end march before the measure bank following the domestic capital adequacy rule were forced deduct valuation loss other availableforsale security from capital however after this measure bank were allowed not deduct any valuation loss other availableforsale security from the capital security price sharply decreased during the crisis many bank suffered huge valuation loss security their portfolio therefore without this measure the regulatory capital ratio these bank would have fallen substantially the security market did not function well during the crisis and thus market price security seemed temporarily differ from fundamental value this sense this temporal loosening may reasonable however this measure also make bank disclosure opaque new measure for financial facilitation new measure for financial facilitation were announced march facilitate firm borrowing because business condition not only smes but also middlesize and large firm deteriorated remarkably during the recession after the lehman shock there are three main measure first special offsite interview were conducted the end investigate whether bank were eager supply fund firm based the result the interview the operation from april june major bank well regional financial institution that were swamped with complaint were examined second the fsa changed the risk weight given emergency guaranteed loan for calculating regulatory capital asset ratio emergency guaranteed loan were fully guaranteed public credit guarantee corporation and bank hold credit risk for them the fsa decreased their risk weight from exceptional this measure intended decrease amount risk japan society monetary economics japanese journal monetary and financial economics vol asset which the denominator the capital ratio adding the temporal loosening capital adequacy ratio regulation discussed regulatory capital ratio regional bank actually increased for when they recorded negative profit namely average capital ratio regional bank including regional bank rose from the end march the end march third capital injection based the revised act discussed section this paper were promoted during open hearing financial institution requesting that they consider more positive use the act act facilitate financing for smes kinyu enkatsuka act act temporary measure facilitate financing for smes hereafter the smes finance act implemented december assist smes that had difficulty with management and finance result the recession after the lehman shock the smes finance act imposes obligation financial institution make effort respond request best they can when smes and mortgage borrower apply for softening borrowing condition such extension repayment deadline the smes finance act could cause increase nonperforming loan therefore bank might hesitate respond borrower request thus some additional measure were taken promote the implementation the act financial institution admits softening loan condition doe not have classify them nonperforming loan most case under the act moreover although bank must make effort respond borrower request legal penalty bank not specified they fail however bank must organize their implementation system report their implementation result the authority and disclose them the public legal penalty imposed for false disclosure report table summarizes the implementation the act from the beginning enforcement the end september the implementation ratio relatively higher level because the supportive measure discussed above however from the point view financial stability are concerned that bank hold many unreported nonperforming loan because substantial loan japan society monetary economics japanese journal monetary and financial economics vol with extended repayment period may classified normal loan can admit that the smes finance act directly contributed decrease the number corporate bankruptcy the difficulty borrower face are cyclical the cost this measure seem moderate however borrower face structural difficulty procrastination will make issue harder resolve procrastination often disinclines bank and borrower conduct painful restructurings unfortunately teikoku data bank japanese major industry information provider report that failure firm that obtained softening loan condition under the act are increasing suggests that the cost procrastination will larger japan society monetary economics japanese

implementation number divided both the implementation number and the rejection number note column display the implementation ratio that equal the implementation number divided the total application number the discrepancy between column and due the number application under review note saitama resona bank included the regional bank source financial service agency concluding remark this study explains how japanese bank and banking regulation have responded the global financial crisis although the japanese financial system weakened significantly after the collapse the economic bubble the early had recovered stability and soundness before this global crisis occurred japanese financial institution did not hold large amount securitized asset related subprime loan thus direct loss related these asset were not large during the global financial crisis therefore unlike europe and the united japan society monetary economics japanese journal monetary and financial economics vol state there little need for the fsa assist damaged financial institution however bank supervision regulation had changed response the financial crisis japan namely smes business condition deteriorated sharply the government had encourage bank assist smes historically the main purpose bank regulation keep the banking system stable and sound but the fsa had shift the emphasis from prudential consideration economic activity consideration although there are some measure such the public capital injection scheme that actually increase bank soundness most measure are regarded financial windowdressing including the change the definition nonperforming loan and the exclusion valuation loss security from capital ratio calculation how should evaluate these windowdressing measure these measure mitigated negative shock limiting corporate bankruptcy may understand that the fsa implicitly modified procyclicality which the basel capital adequacy regulation criticized having done during the crisis the fsa reduced effective capital ratio while the nominal ratio remained unchanged without these measure bad economic condition might have reduced bank capital ratio and bank with lower capital ratio would have been forced cut lending deteriorating the economy further after the crisis many observer criticized the capital adequacy regulation for procyclical nature this sense the fsa pioneer however pointed out before these measure make reported figure such badloan ratio and capital ratio opaque now hard for depositor know how much bank hold real capital and bad loan based the disclosure report the true financial condition japanese bank may worse than what disclosed fortunately far this ambiguity not created public distrust bank additionally procrastination problem often damage motivation bank and borrower tackle difficulty and therefore the possibility resolve problem likely becomes smaller also note that the fsa utilized the double standard under which different rule are applied for internationally active bank bank having overseas subsidiary and branch and for domestically operating bank for example hard for the fsa modify capital adequacy japan society monetary economics japanese journal monetary and financial economics vol rule for international bank which are subject the basel international agreement however rule for domestic bank are not subject the international agreement and the fsa can modify the rule when crisis hit japan the fsa had relatively high degree freedom for modifying regulatory rule that were only applied for domestic bank responding the crisis the fsa could flexibly modify several regulatory rule furthermore domestic bank are major lender smes therefore regulatory measure that mainly affected domestic bank were effective for protecting smes recently imf pointed out for domestic and internationally active bank different minimum capital level and different definition capital are used although similar capital adequacy framework applies trigger for early intervention measure due shortfall minimum capital level are set too low level especially for domestic bank then imf insisted the authority should seek enhance the standard for capital adequacy and streamline the rule applicable for domestically and internationally operating bank implicitly imf criticizes the double standard approach taken the fsa the future are not sure whether the fsa approach accepted other country sum have big challenge have search for policy that flexibility countercyclical nature stabilize the shortterm economic fluctuation but that doe not hurt the credibility bank disclosure which necessary condition for longterm economic stability furthermore the japanese economy cope with recurring crisis after the collapse the bubble economy the japanese economy still stagnant and more and more necessary stimulate the economy from the financial side need search for new policy measure that encourage bank take more risk stimulate the economy and yet also effectively prevent bank from taking excess risk acknowledgement this research financially supported the japan society for the promotion science jsps grantinaid for scientific research this paper

earthquake obtained public fund based the act examination board been established review the application and monitor the performance bank currently nobuyoshi yamori author this paper serf member this examination board strictly speaking these asset are generally classified other performing loan with some concern for the future spiegel and yamori find that bank with larger bad loan tended not disclose figure bad loan ratio when the disclosure not compulsory furthermore kondo also showed that financial institution with more bad loan tended passive japan society monetary economics japanese journal monetary and financial economics vol regarding disclosure especially they were rated foreign rating agency june the fsa decided extend this measure until march exemplifies the difficulty ending temporal measure according the japanese banker association total valuation loss other availableforsale security amounted trillion the end march while bank held trillion valuation profit the end march tier capital regional bank most which followed the domestic capital adequacy rule around trillion yen the end march this measure had substantial impact their capital ratio one year the financial service agency fiscal year indicates that there were regional financial institution that were swamped with complaint under the act the definition nonperforming loan revised now borrower who have restructuring plan when they request softening borrowing condition but who will surely make credible restructuring plan within one year are classified normal status see teikoku data bank httpwwwtdbcojpreportwatchingpressphtml course the sense that prosperous economy reduces the possibility corporate failure these measure indirectly contribute the soundness the banking system the fsa already implemented basel iii regarding internationally active bank the fsa plan implement different capital adequacy rule for domestic bank regarding imf the fsa expects the imf understand that
