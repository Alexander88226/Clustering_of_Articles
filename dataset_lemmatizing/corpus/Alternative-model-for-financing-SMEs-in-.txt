not overemphasized they contribute employment gdp innovation human resource development and poverty alleviation however they are constrained access credit the main objective this paper develop alternative model for raising fund also looked why lender are cynical advancing credit smes found that inappropriate risk management moral hazard and possible adverse selection limit their access credit the smes network fund developed suggested the formation self managed fund the smes finance their activity which would require collateral smes access fund and offer relatively cheaper capital smes keywords small medium enterprise finance model introduction and statement the problem the role micro small and medium enterprise msmes been identified both developed and developing economy been found that not only the big business that provide the foundation the nation economy but small enterprise also play significant role developing the economy nation view their crucial role some developed

holding training workshop and seminar and improvement the common infrastructure smes actively use information technology and promote business innovation cope with the revolution sme agency smes have been found contribute employment generation gross domestic product entrepreneurial skill development and innovation many developing country cook nixson agyapong but pointed out page inadequate research the sector pose policy constraint that area this continues the situation ghana where research interest the critical role small business economic growth still remains very low despite small business widespread ghana though the data this group not readily available the little information available from the registrar general indicates that company registered are micro small and medium enterprise mensah this target group been identified the catalyst for the economic growth the country they are major source income and employment addition identified boachiemensah and marfoyiadom the ghanaian experience smes and entrepreneurship not been impressive that the developed economy smes had not been fully integrated into the main stream economic activity before the advent the economic recovery programme erp support for these entity been hoc irregular and uncoordinated despite their contribution the development the country they are confronted with the problem raising adequate funding how would the entrepreneur managing these smes raise adequate least improve upon their access fund the rest this paper divided into four part the second the definition and the economic importance smes the third looked financing smes ghana and the fourth part looked the conclusion and the policy recommendation definition and importance small and medium enterprise the term smes been severally defined institution region and based number people employed sale asset egypt they are business employing between and lee that people vietnam they are firm employing and employee according the world bank venture employing people with million annual revenue and million asset sme but the interamerican development bank sme business employing employee and earning not more than million revenue dalberg global development advisor furthermore european union defines smes venture that employ fewer than person and which have annual turnover not exceeding million euro andor annual balance sheet total not exceeding million euro small and medium enterprise are thus defined firm with employee and more than million euro turnover annual balance sheet total similarly the nbssi provided operational definition small business according this body small business any business that employ people they are divided into micro small and medium enterprise micro enterprise employing employee with fixed asset excluding land and building not exceeding the value small enterprise employ between and employee having fixed asset international journal art and commerce vol october excluding land and building not exceeding and medium enterprise employ between and employee with fixed asset according international institute for environment and development when the firm are classified size the assessment sme firm get ranged with employee size that than declared ghana statistical service the firm that are functioning with than employee are recognised small scale enterprise with more than employee will firm with medium large enterprise kufour from the definition provided obvious that there empirical consensus the use number employee defining small business although the actual employee size differs from one definition the other the paper adopted the nbssi definition small business since the main body regulating the activity small business the country economic importance smes ghana smes have been and continue play significant role the economy ghana this especially true most graduate learning institution well policy maker are beginning accept the fact that the larger organisation can not provide all the needed job but would have complemented the smes fredua cited world bank report which state that ghana informal sector contributes economic activity especially contributing significantly employment estimated around the total labour force small firm help create bulk the job well contribute the national revenue way tax revenue but also improve upon national income keskin abor quartey kayanula and quartey and aryeetey found among others that smes are source employment generation help conserve foreign exchange increase export through the nontraditional commodity export well contributes economic growth and development through innovation and creativity these business are also considered abor and quartey providing about employment the manufacturing sector and are believed contribute about ghana gdp and also account for business they have often been described improving the efficiency domestic market and making productive use scarce resource and thus facilitating longterm economic growth poor country aryeetey ahene ghana small business make the largest portion the employment base and are the bedrock the local private sector kufour apart from these broader contribution there are some other identified importance these entity according buame smes are very important economy because they make more efficient use resource act source skill creation cradle entrepreneurship utilises financial resource that are otherwise dormant like family saving innovative have much lower cost per job created wider geographic spread wider presence rural area and higher capacity for absorbing labour small business are often found have some advantage over large firm large firm have been found often have undesirable working condition such weaker autonomy stricter rule and regulation flexible scheduling and more impersonal working environment brown medoff edmiston also smes are seen rely personalised tailormade service moreover they tend provide quicker service quality product fair price well providing both formal and informal after sale service vossen opined while largefirm strength are mostly material nature smallfirm strength are mostly behavioural perhaps the most critical strength the lack entrenched bureaucracy that often characterizes larger firm entrenched bureaucracy can lead long chain command and subsequent communication inefficiency inflexibility and loss managerial coordination edmiston international journal art and commerce vol october further small firm the extent that they operate more competitive environment may have greater incentive innovate stay ahead rival finally because ownership and management are more likely intertwined smaller firm the personal reward potential innovator are higher related factor smaller firm may better able structure contract reward performance zenger but despite such advantage small business continue face especially financial difficulty because they often start with inadequate capital society where fewer bureaucratic firm exist and given the significant role smes job creation mensah strategy are devised solving their smes problem they could contribute more the development the society cook and nixson outlined numerous merit smes including the basis for entrepreneurship utilising labour intensive technology and thus having impact employment generation encouraging the process both inter and intraregional decentralisation addition they put forth that smes have become countervailing force against the economic power larger enterprise and finally the development smes seen accelerating the attainment social and economic objective including female unemployment poverty alleviation especially rural africa financing small and medium enterprise ghana small enterprise and most the poor population subsaharan africa have very limited access deposit and credit facility and other financial service provided formal financial institution for example ghana and tanzania only about per cent the population access the banking sector basu blavy yulek according hfc bank smes ghana tend marginalised have limited access credit coupled with the fact that few informal support exist way business angel and personal saving this tends affect their ability adopt modern technology unido been found that only few these business are financed from commercial bank loan government assistant program other informal source osei baahnuakoh tutu sowa ban similarly abor and biekpe pointed out that access finance dominant constraint facing smes ghana must noted that access funding not the only constraint sme development liedholm macpherson chuta finance and access funding are often the major challenge for smes development see bigsten buatsi should noted that the availability fund could improve smes access other resource such human information and physical resource with low level technological support because they are unable finance technological resource they can not get adequate amount production and subsequently sale and profit this obviously leaf small business vicious cycle financial constraint view this often imperative that external capital injection are necessary help boost small business performance besides several empirical study have recognised the issue financial constraint the main problem thwarting the speedy growth small business developing economy including ghana arthur mensah deakins north baldock whittam other study have developing economy have found funding the major problem smes these study have made varying recommendation but smes continue constrained funding suggested the empirical study cited earlier whereas some country have set small business equity market help raise equity capital others have set state grant and develop list business angel assist small business but the situation ghana more moral suasion where appeal are often made policymakers and the nbssi lender grant credit small international journal art and commerce vol october business study that propose peertopeer lending funding alternative yet carried out hence the need for the present study the main method access fund for smes are basically through debt equity source both equity usually may the business owner relying personal saving bank saving susu from previous work gift from friend family member even remittance from abroad individual remittance ghana for and amounted million and million respectively venture capital fund and share rare ghana for small firm ideally entrepreneur would want rely only such source but typically such fund may not adequate and they may have fall debt borrowing there also financing through trade credit ghana apart from few traditional lender and some other nonbanking lender greater proportion debt capital could only obtained through the bank however financial institution fis such bank would not just lend till smes are able make convincing case about the future prospect and sustainability their business such loan seeker should able demonstrate their management awareness and competency cope with business risk well satisfy provider fund that they are taking acceptable risk and will receive reasonable return lender would give out loan when they have satisfied themselves with the loan seeker capability and developed transparent relationship built mutual trust with the loan seeker because cook and nixson posit credit provided the context information asymmetry both side fischer and can resolved demonstrating creditworthiness and business viability however because poor accounting practice and record keeping many such loan seeker are unable this increase the risk and transaction cost small business lending bank require collateral manage this risk tagoe nyarko anuwaamarh such indicator are used financial institution ass the likelihood business failure and payment default that way avoid adverse selection the well prevent moral hazard due their high risk consciousness fis any point time find way protect themselves from future negative outcome notwithstanding these smes look financial soundness being their ability achieve business target and success and try predict and portray future positive outcome satisfy repayment time seeking for such funding that time seeking debt funding the risk failure the last thing the sme owner would want consider but this what interest the nevertheless the possibility failure can not ruled out the when the smes submits loan application some internal cause such poor target selection product positioning inadequate business management experience financial management well inappropriate management practice can lead the collapse the venture addition external cause such high cost compliance with regulation fierce competition and difficulty obtaining external funding are likely lead the failure the venture accounting web sme reliance bank and credit scoring according keith smes may selffinance but typically have very limited capital and rely external finance when seeking external finance most smes rely the fis but these fis would not grant credit without relying credit scoring method the problem here that credit scoring will increasingly impact susu practice where business owner make periodic usually daily saving with another susu collector the collector then mark card these periodic saving the amount accumulated given back the saver usually the end the period the collector usually rewarded taking the last amount deposited the saver bank ghana monetary policy committee press conference tuesday february international journal art and commerce vol october smes there are usually smes credit officer evaluate loan application such borrower their application are eventually given the same consideration like that the larger organisation what more that due the risk perception smes fis their application tend given more critical scrutining and loan are granted more cautiously than the larger firm evidence from the bank survey credit condition continues point tightening credit both enterprise and household small and medium enterprise smes access credit tightened marginally while large enterprise remained unchanged bank ghana but society where smes provide the junk the job created providing financial assistance this sector crucial for economic wellbeing the country and the economically active labour force wolfensen fredrick agyapong typically lending smes ghana been found have high moral hazard tendency smes not using the fund for the purpose intended agreed with the borrower dishonesty leading loss problem with financial credit facility were always predominant the smes ghana mensah since there the context providing information that actually asymmetry both side the credit option get limited the other hand can well resolved with the help demonstrating the sme owner with the creditworthiness and all kind project viability however since smes some developing world including ghana have poor record keeping and accounting practice will hard for them get out kwarteng cook nixson binks ennew reed mean restricting credit they can somehow plan for new persuasion nbssi pointed out that number smes who benefit from credit scheme not use the credit for the intended purpose some them use the fund meet personal need the detriment their business whilst others invest their business but not according their business plan still others invest only part the fund their business with the intention getting higher yield this adversely affect repayment plan but they added that the trend changing with education second lending smes have own adverse selection tendency give inaccurate information their asset capital liability and character leading the selection high credit risk borrower addition location major wrong information given due poor address system and bad town planning the small business policy report analysing from credit risk and rationing model perspective indicated that underlying assumption lender that small business borrower posse salient private knowledge that not shared with lender investor this make difficult for lender prevent adverse selection make difficult for lender differentiate between high quality and low quality borrower potential risk faced lender ghana the inability locate defaulting small business borrower due inappropriate location and the tendency for the venture owner give wrong information about their location event where such risk perceived the lender likely charge higher rate interest the loan being granted wynant hatch but the problem adverse selection not only associated with lending smes but with large firm gaul stebunovs well third there high tendency for default because there lack capital thus making smes more vulnerable failure notwithstanding there limited suitability sme business asset collateral also ownermanager guarantee may impaired personal revenue reliance sme business effect the ability access the view kwarteng the bank can hardly blamed for their rather dismissive attitude towards the informal sector because they lack proper book well defined management structure sense appreciation for accountability point out the case ghana that the personal residential address system nearly nonexistent and many people not have proper title their asset afford them the opportunity use them collateral for loan international journal art and commerce vol october funding will depend largely the entrepreneur the sme owner ability manage the risk his her firm through right business balance the problem inadequate information disclosure and lack data the number and role smes ghana make difficult ass the real contribution the sector economic development however the contribution smes ghana have been identified very pivotal the nation economic transformation attempt attain middleincome status analyst say the sector account for about per cent enterprise the ghanaian economy generating significant proportion job created ghana according abor and quartey the sector contributes about manufacturing employment ghana they estimate that the sector contributes about ghana gdp and account for about business ghana view this successive government have their own way try find some solution the greatest challenge facing smes ghana problem financing thus they have introduced varying smes funding scheme the form debt and equity financing these official scheme are mostly state originated with international donor support but others are international their origin and operation among the scheme include business assistance fund ghana investment fund export development and investment fund bank loan australian import program nbssi loan revolving fund venture capital trust fund and fidelity equity fund therefore imperative that these smes devise alternative solution the problem access funding hence the proposed model problem with official credit scheme ghana despite the numerous financing scheme available smes still contend with the problem financing the country thus impacting negatively their operation and the ability positively affect the economy the country the first place most these official scheme are debt nature requiring collateral before entrepreneur able access secondly the nature the scheme such that they are not meant only for smes but the private sector that the smes would have compete with some well established private firm for fair share such fund thirdly the scheme are mostly for importation which could defeat the economic growth purpose smes this because one the objective ensuring that the sector thrives serve import substituted industry help conserve foreign exchange for instance the austrian import support program used beneficiary procure equipment machinery raw material and related service from austria addition the above problem there more often than not over subscription excess fund demand over supply this stem from the fact that money usually made available the state inadequate the numerous fund applicant also international donor support complement government effort may sometimes not come come with some string attached only meant for smes specified sector the loan revolving fund set promote the development smes service and manufacturing sector additionally high default rate due operational difficulty discrimination among applicant and ineffective scrutinising loan applicant and their firm before granting credit have served major setback this direction view the foregoing equity funding would have been alternative however equity financing for smes tend inadequate mensah posit that smes find difficult raising equity funding because equity investor seek high return consistent with the high risk investment especially with small firm addition smes investment hard evaluate compared other larger organisation example listed firm furthermore international journal art and commerce vol october smes investment take time mature and are difficult liquidate case the investor want opt out unlike some developed economy there stock market for smes ghana enable the possibility capital acquisition through the floating share the proposed model for financing smes doubt that the existing scheme are bedevilled with several problem and hence the need look for more effective and efficient funding scheme help improve the access fund smes the smes network fund model figure suggests fund setup with pooled fund from individual smes though the fund would made mainly contribution from the smes owner themselves contribution from the state venture capitalist and international donor would also sought into the fund what more smes can ass capital from the fund well continue access existing government venture and external fund the difference between this scheme and what existed that unlike others this scheme would manned committee headed fund manager the member this committee would constitute volunteer from the smes representative from other contributor such the government international body and other institutional investor the fund manager would responsible for making the necessary investment decision the fund this different from existing scheme usually controlled the state some body other than committee made member from smes again unlike previous scheme that may not have form seed money smes this one contains contribution business owner equity stake from smes fund manager and the committee would undertake scrutinise applicant document for assessing fund from the scheme not mean turning their application down but enable the them advise and possibly offer training and counselling the member how utilise the fund fund accessed from the smes fund would not require any collateral other lender member belonging the fund would required deposit their monthly report the committee which way could help deal with the problem asymmetry and invariable moral hazard not all there would periodic visit member business way monitoring help ensure fund collected are being reasonably used smes for the purpose intended this would also help deal with the problem moral hazard sme lending additionally the scheme would opened all smes all sector and activity admission member into the scheme would not require stringent requirement but that they are ready contribute towards the fund addition those who would undertake member there would also nonmember who can access the scheme accessing the fund member would made pay relatively lesser interest than nonmember thus unlike others that restrict accessibility specific sector this fund could accessed for different purpose and category smes those who are into production processing service rendering meanwhile those who access the fund made contributor from the government and international donor can still access separate additional fund from these body effect smes can obtain more fund with the setting the smes network fund theoretical basis the sme network fund model the model foundation from three theory the social network theory social exchange theory and the theory large number the sme network fund model based the network theory small group which also foundation from five others including the theory selfinterest theory social exchange dependency theory mutual collective interest cognitive theory and theory homophily international journal art and commerce vol october the social network theory the view that actor are not significant the relationship tie and contact with other actor the network hazzardrobinson loch borgatti jorgensen ulhoi the theory focus the assessment social relationship between among actor network the sme network fund model based this premise that once smes pool resource they can have adequate fund given one time besides fund manager can invest the pool short term security enable appreciate addition according the social exchange theory human social situation choose behaviour that maximize their likelihood meeting self interest those situation this theory assumes that the individual owner the venture are rational and engage costsbenefits analysis social exchange this implies they act both actor and reactor social exchange but the core social exchange theory are the concept equity and reciprocity where the group this network pool resource and give member time this theory been applied various economic and social relationship see nomaguchi milkie sprecher lawler monge contractor although some weakness have been reported miller several empirical work cropanzano mitchell zafirovski liu deng have reported gain from application the theory large number the law large number financial risk management practice often used insurance and for individual with little fund invest the law large number simply pooling little resource into the fund although smes are deemed cash starved they can periodically make little contribution into the fund per the model proposed together with contribution other stakeholder smes could have access funding and cheaper rate than other lender term management necessary fund manager can employed manage such fund ghana such practice common especially with cooperative society assumption underlying the proposed smes network fund firstly smes should willing disclose their operational and managerial information the fund manager this would enable the fund manager create database smes well determine the appropriate contribution made each sme failure disclose such vital information could lead the failure the scheme secondly the smes should pay back the fund obtained from the scheme with accompanying interest periodic check the owner determine how the fund being utilised can help the sme payback into the fund thirdly the assessment documentation who qualifies access the fund devoid all political social cultural and religious affiliation but access made available those who proof the fund manager and the committee they require the fund finance viable project this criterion mainly the member proof financial constraint meanwhile decision making authority regarding how the fund invested should rest with the entire member who are contributor the fund international journal art and commerce vol october figure the smes network fund model state contribution venture capital fund private investor international donor smes fund small and medium enterprise author construct one the strategy sustain the fund the manager would required update member monthly basis their receipt and payment this they would and way peertopeer check information about member not good standing would disclosed colleague during meeting monitoring would done the committee the fund manager and the entire member through the periodic circular the number time business would receive assistance from the fund and the rate interest even free would agreed upon all member there would also incentive for member who payback money received from the fund before time much possible the number time one can withdraw for particular period would reduced they consistently delay default payment however these assumption not hold then the scheme could encounter some problem feature the model the feature the model are illustrated the individual arrow defined the alphabet this arrow indicates fund flow from international donor directly smes such donation can channelled through arrow state institution such the venture capital fund then flow onwards into the fund this arrow indicates what received return the international donor this usually dependent the type donation for grant international donor would want project progress completion report similar report may expected from the state agency institution arrow the donation channelled through them arrow indicate flow donor fund directly into the smes fund whilst arrow report from fund manager about the possible use fund arrow indicates fund flow from state institution into the smes fund while arrow the feedback from the fund manager the feedback may come form periodic financial report and possible return investment the state international journal art and commerce vol october arrow indicates the flow fund directly from state institution capital trust fund ghana business advisory fund smes such fund may government guaranteed loan small business the smes report back the state agency paying back the soft loan and the interest arrow arrow indicates the flow fund from private investor directly smes while arrow show the potential return which purely kind economic profit this because private investor would put their fund into venture only when they expect obtain good return the fund invested arrow indicates the flow fund from private investor directly into the smes fund while arrow show the potential return which purely kind economic profit arrow indicate the flow fund from the smes directly into the smes fund while arrow show fund flow from the smes fund finance their activity the fund flow arrow may come form member contribution conclusion and policy recommendation smes contribute significantly the economic development the country the area employment creativity and entrepreneurship the course setting and operating they face financial and non financial challenge although both challenge have the tendency slow down the growth these business the one that often highlighted that access finance order deal with the problem funding institution and different government have put some intervention measure but still the problem persists smes have had rely financial institution fis alternative source funding however these financial institution would not grant credit smes until collateral provided even though society usually discern fis for such conduct fis are also trying manage their risk way sustain institutional survival view this there the need look for alternative model funding smes the paper developed alternative model financing smes policy recommendation there the need for smes network form partnership pool financial resource and sometimes have joint project such fund can help these business take such step this because they interact they could identify common area strategic partnership and collaboration secondly such fund would smes have access fund with string attach and possible cost capital again they would under relatively lesser pressure payback without interest compared with loan from bank other lender also smes would access fund without any collateral there the possibility donor support from international and domestic agency there the evidence that the fund being managed well again not only member have access cheap capital they could also benefit from investment their fund pool smes could benefit from additional group training and counselling the peertopeer check would self monitoring system for business member would have say how the fund managed reference abor biekpe small business
