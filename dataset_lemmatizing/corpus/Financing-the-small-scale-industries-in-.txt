difference fixed investment cost the creation one unit employment generation amount nearly taka between ssi and large scale industry the absence availability any current national level estimate about the nature and magnitude contribution the ssis difficult provide any dependable basis about their importance the economy despite their contribution the economy term employment and value addition the ssis suffer from numerous operational constraint resulting from the scale barrier and resource constraint comprehensive policy support including various fiscal and financial incentive are thus required foster enabling environment improve competitive strength these industrial unit the financing environment for the ssis the ssis not have dominant presence the bangladesh economy compared mediumsized industry and general lack the capability being dynamic firm the process economic development however considering the scope employment generation and making use relatively lower capitalintensive technology these industrial unit are indeed important nonetheless these firm often face economic institutional and legal obstacle such restraint include limited ability acquiring sufficient amount credit including initial capital and longer term credit inadequate infrastructure support high transaction cost limited managerial and technical knowhow and forth despite these obstacle which are mostly interdependent the general opinion which ssi supporting policy are based stem the fact that lack finance make the principal restraint their growth and intensification the ssis barrier obtaining access formal finance emerged from multifaceted but interrelated objective subjective factor before discussing the prevalent financial mechanism available for the ssis some the barrier ssi access finance are highlighted below barrier finance most formal financial institution prefer hold mostly riskfree and highincome generating asset the ssi lending unattractive due anticipated risk associated with this type business unit the same time there high transaction cost involved extending smaller chunk loan nature the ssi sector not homogeneous and therefore the attractiveness enterprise financial institution varies with the size the firm maturity the firm type industry the firm belongs and forth the basic problem encountered the commercial bank lending ssis are the bank capital adequacy requirement assessment the riskbearing exposure and making riskcovering provision besides there are some inherent factor that make ssi financing motivating the financial institution one the main criterion for loan disbursement the country the sound financial condition the company and economic history but the ssi unit usually not have credit history this criterion pose insurmountable barrier all small enterprise that are not position satisfy such condition even the one that were set couple year ago and have good economic indicator find difficult meet the requirement some the entrepreneur underreporting nonreporting the profit avoid tax more often than not the company not have any business plan accounting record which they need attest their turnover the ssis can not make longterm financial projection nor can they guarantee any stable income addition when seeking medium longterm loan ssis are often not position offer sufficient collateral that fulfil the requirement financial institution one the major hindrance faced the ssis the interest rate level charged the financial institution the average lending rate range between and according entrepreneur most ssis can not afford this rate since their average profit far lower than asbbs annual conference vega february volume number proceeding asbbs this even the interest rate charged bangladesh small and cottage industry corporation bscic which specially set assist the development such enterprise range between recent drive the bangladesh bank set the lending rate plus the bank rate for the woman entrepreneur with aim encourage the latter enhanced participation economic activity but the move not been that successful till todate the financial institution claim that given the market setup whatever lending rate they charge logical and that the international financial institution impose explicit condition concerning the market interest rate level regardless the high interest rate spread approximately between and the financial institution also assert that they face difficulty covering the lending risk their expense and tax lower rate level the fact that the bank did not have knowledge the entrepreneur another frequently cited factor furthermore evidence showed that the association between loan application and size the firm remains positive and statistically significant even when location and sector are included centre for development hence for number reason the smallsized enterprise run into many difficulty when they apply for bank loan any sort credit facility from the formal sector the ssis can not even mobilize resource from the country capital market still the most common source capital especially startup phase are saving and loan from the family and friend according sedf survey smes did not approach formal financial institution seek financing over the year some development partner tried assist the ssi sector along with the government these financing type are mainly used finance credit line ssis accompanied with technical assistance the credit line fund are given from donor soft loan and the government allocates them bank used commercial loan without harming banking practice and the use own bank capital consequence the greater part financial crediting source converted into commercial fund and again the ssi unit face difficulty obtaining those fund brief various study showed that the most important financial barrier faced the ssis are the high cost credit and loan the lack access equity capital bank not being interested small firm the lack access venture capital the delay obtaining loan the refusal bank finance high collateral requirement bank bureaucratic procedure the cost preparing business plan and too high bank charge and fee existing financial mechanism the ssis have rely limited range financial source and typically rely their own saving and loan from friend and relative especially during the startup phase institutional credit mainly from the commercial bank are available mostly when the firm become larger informal lender and other similar source traditionally also provide finance for the expansion the ssis reinvested earnings are also major source fund for the fixed capital from the formal sector the flow credit ssis mainly come from the bangladesh small and cottage industry corporation bscic

more readily available for smes effectiveness the existing financial support public institution including the bangladesh bank ncbs and dfis engaged extending loan the agriculture and industry sector currently have financing facility for smes the performance and effectiveness which have been uneven these facility have varying feature and term some the facility are targeted certain industry subject limited geographic coverage for example the bangladesh bank ruralbased agroprocessing industry refinancing facility originally set for taka billion had low utilization rate owing mainly the restriction use fund agroprocessing industry located outside the major city later the size the facility reduced taka billion and the rest taka billion reallocated set the small enterprise fund sef the

establishment the utilization rate not been that much satisfactory the other hand some credit facility provided ncbs and dfis impose ceiling loan subborrowers certain sector such agricultural credit thus distorting interest rate and further exacerbating the vulnerable financial position these entity there indicator measure the effectiveness outreach impact these facility thus indepth study need conducted identify way rationalize the existing government assistance and ensure efficient and effective delivery mechanism the credit flow ssis majority bank taken together not very significant compared the mlis one reason that the mlis requirement for capital far greater than that ssis one the other hand mentioned earlier formal financial institution prefer extend credit facility bigger firm those firm which are gradually expanding and have viable business record the available data show that outstanding amount ssis very low compared total outstanding this may due the fact that ssis occasionally approach the financial institution for financing well small amount money are disbursed the ssis also been observed that classified loan the ssis are higher for the dfis than pcbs even ncbs the amount fcbs loan extended the ssis negligible compared the amount extended the mlis and accordingly classified loan the account ssis are also minimal addition given the fact that the ssis are now need complex financial product there can initiative tie with various fcbs for providing wide range the derivative product various study and experience suggest that the enabling environment for the growth ssis been limited official document only reality much been done promote the smallindustryoriented industrialization the country addition the environment for the growth the sector been somewhat adverse due the ever increasing competition from other industrial unit both domestic and foreign emerging from the trade liberalization policy the government the protective regime largely been discontinued leaving the ssis stiff competition arising from the influx foreign good through both official and unofficial channel true that ssis are afflicted with number built constraint resulting from entrepreneurial and managerial deficiency this also inhibited their access formal credit various study revealed that lack working capital been the single most important cause among all the external factor that make industrial unit sick although sickness the industrial unit not new phenomenon evident the developing country and industrial unit may face number odds during implementation and operation stage because number factor the environment internal and external leading sickness experience suggests that ssis are more prone sickness compared medium and large scale industry the bid sick industry study revealed that small scale industry the top term incidence sickness followed medium and large scale industry and respectively bid strengthen the sci sector the country during the national association small and cottage industry bangladesh recommended introduce special credit scheme and simplified credit policy establish separate bank leasing company adopt special measure for sick industry and retain percent the total industrial credit for ssis the high cost fund another issue raised the small scale entrepreneur for entrepreneur though the supply and access finance very important the cost fund asbbs annual conference vega february volume number proceeding asbbs also factor for their sustainability and expansion very often argued that the interest rate ssi loan too high and need lowered today liberalized market the bank and financial institution consider the fact that the rate interest too high then the profitability entrepreneur especially for those the innovative project will adversely affected the high cost sme finance also contradicts the government industrial policy that committed boost small business sector recent study the sme foundation had found rate interest for the sme financing ranged between percent and percent interest rate are not declining although many bank and financial institution are opening separate window for the sme financing such high rate interest force smes especially those involve manufacturing activity and especially smaller size become sick and out business overseas fund percent rate and the bangladesh bank fund percent rate still could not help lower the lending rate for the small entrepreneur entrepreneur have pay interest retail banker rate three four time higher than the rate offered the bangladesh bank currently the sme foundation working with the government formulate guideline bring down interest rate single digit for the smes once enacted the sme credit wholesaling guideline will help bank and financial institution channel low cost finance small venture such guideline would also facilitate the foundation work apex body such palli karma sahayak foundation and channel fund into small business more prudently through network bank and nbfis the sme foundation feel that the proposed sme credit wholesaling guideline would enable reserve refinancing fund and give bank and financial institution rate lower than that the bangladesh bank finding new avenue ssis operate environment whereby barrier their establishment and growth are very evident strengthening the financial sector one the most important issue for enabling ssis perform successfully most the commercial bank well other financial institution are somewhat reluctant provide loan from own fund ssis due the high credit risk associated with such lending overcome this problem mechanism can devised set special insurance scheme with fund from the government donor and even may contribution from local financial institution this fund can used cover say the risk though there already exist various guaranteed financing mechanism for the ssis their implementation have enhanced opt for the desired level success argued that difference the financial institution structure and lending infrastructure significantly affect the availability fund ssis affecting the feasibility with which financial institution may employ the different lending technology which they have comparative advantage provide fund different type ssis ahmed argued that financial service for the poor have proved powerful instrument for poverty reduction enabling the poor build asset increase income and reduce the vulnerability economic stress however while formulating effective financing mechanism for the ssis the following three issue need considered highlight the most effective ssi finance practice and program especially the region and inform both private and public sector institution about the impact these policy and practice properly implement innovative ssi finance policy and vehicle identify mechanism solve common ssi finance obstacle and encourage ssi development generally recognized that guaranteed scheme various form are required the ssis along with customized financial product the ssis are especial need for longerterm resource the bangladesh bank propagated some option for enhancing financial facility asbbs annual conference vega february volume number proceeding asbbs the sme sector the country box which are also applicable for the ssis addition bank and financial institution can encouraged offer more and more innovative financial product such factoring venture capital etc however the ssi entrepreneur well the financial instrument provider should well acquainted with such product academician and expert time and again opined for dedicated new financial institution for sme which will also look after the ssis provide sufficient longterm lowinterest fund with liberal term collateral box enhancing sme funding the smes financially which can used subsidy lack efficient interbank market channel excess liquidity lack legal framework for development alternative for longterm financing such securitized debt security lack term fund reasonable interest rate high interest rate offered for government bond often crowd out longterm borrowing for smes financial institution the following factor deserve consideration like the developed country government can use grant major instrument support government can provide credit guarantee scheme smes that common feature both developed and developing country such guarantee ensures repayment any default loan taken sme government can directly guarantee loan certain limit small business purchase land building equipment loan may made through bank other financial institution implementing analytical software like credit scoring model based available data from reliable source bank and financial institution can provide loan smes with growth potential and good track record case providing refinance the bank and nbfis government should have some directive related collateral requirement and high interest rate source financial sector review bangladesh bank conclusion financing ssis one the key prerequisite for the achievement growth the sector evidence from around the world demonstrate that access finance key problem that much the private sector and particular the smallest enterprise face both developed and developing country case bangladesh also the small entrepreneur both entrant and existing entrepreneur significantly face obstacle relation the cost and lack access investment capital spite the effort which have been made alleviate them maximise the benefit financial structure the provision finance should accompanied parallel effort improve the investment climate and develop other ssi support service this paper doe not however propose for generous assistance provided the ssis various study revealed that financial opportunity higher effective rate assistance provided earlier the ssis have contributed the inefficiency the sector hence wellorchestrated financial mechanism supported other support service such promotional human resource development and forth are required foster enabling environment for the ssi sector recognizing this fact the industrial policy stated that conduct survey determine the demand the local market good produced sick industry primary step towards the rehabilitation and development those industry view competition the local market take action reduce the production cost good sick industry costeffective way that the qualitative standard good and productivity are ensured informal financial institution still play important role many developing country particularly the rural area they importance higher for the formal financial institution asbbs annual conference vega february volume number proceeding asbbs the market presence different type institution and the competition among them have important effect ssi credit availability because institution different type may have comparative advantage different lending technology the other hand the lending infrastructure the information environment the legal the judicial and bankruptcy environment and the tax and regulatory environment may directly affect ssi credit availability affecting the extent which the different lending technology may legally and profitably employed the lending infrastructure may also restrict ssi credit availability indirectly constraining the potential financial institution structure through restrictive regulatory environment ahmed argued that the smes are unwelcome customer the profit seeking and collateral oriented commercial bank even when there credit boom and availability loanable fund not any constraint from the discussion can concluded saying that the financing mechanism required the ssis exist although
