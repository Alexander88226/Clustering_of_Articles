herein filethe role crowdfunded debt early stage entrepreneurial finance jerry coakley winifred huangmeier daniel tsvetanov this version january abstract recent year crowdfunded debt become popular among risky and relatively early stage small young and privately held firm this paper investigates the role crowdfunded debt financing decision from using unique dataset private small firm the result indicate that firm debt ratio are sensitive crowdfunded debt and firm characteristic like firm size asset tangibility and debt composition but sensitive firm profitability the larger target leverage deviation the higher the probability firm issuing having crowdfunded debt find evidence that capital expansion play important role explaining increase crowdfunded debt our finding provide new insight into the traditional pecking order theory capital structure that crowdfunded debt considered additional financing source for private firm they also show that line with the tradeoff theory private firm have higher proportion debt equity due the high cost issuing equity capital jel classification efm classification keywords crowdfunded debt peertopeer market pecking order private firm acknowledgement

investigates the role crowdfunding major source outside entrepreneurial capital for small private firm since the seminal and comprehensive cosh cumming and hughes study the external funding source for privately held entrepreneurial firm crowdfunding emerged novel source outside capital crowdfunded debt also known peertopeer business lending and growing very rapidly both the usa and zhang baeck ziegler bone and garvey provide comprehensive overview crowdfunding the and their analysis suggest that business lending accounted for the lending small and medium enterprise smes although been linked microfinance credit union and other antecedent the finance arena the real driver the meteoric rise market such ebay amazon and uber that demonstrates the potential draw electronic marketplace over the past decade however crowdfunded debt very distinctive and recent market that despite having own specific characteristic remains largely underresearched particularly within the context firm capital structure this paper aim fill this gap the literature and shed new light specialist but growing segment the crowdfunding market the paper employ unique handcollected dataset privately held small firm that have raised fund the funding circle platform during the period the data are linked with company data from the fame database create unique deidentified crowdfunding database the paper first contribution that shed new light specialist area forprofit crowdfunding known debt crowdfunding crowdlending debt crowdfunding involves investor large the crowd funding small firm and others recent year crowdfunding platform have come provide two main novel source outside entrepreneurial capital for small firm equity and debt crowdfunding see einav farronato and levin for overview market general whose focus mainly good and service via internet portal these investor include financial institution that can contribute any crowdfunding project funding circle the main debt crowdfunding platform the and indeed europe this part crowdfunded debt some parallel with nonbank private debt but funded via public internet platform lending club the main debt crowdfunding platform the crowd been squeezed out and institution now dominate this crowdfunded private debt market now known marketplace lending can viewed internetbased private placement debt this pure businesstobusiness debt and therefore contrast sharply with the dominant role many small investor crowdfunded debt the our finding confirm that crowdfunded debt play increasingly important role the external financing small private entrepreneurial firm our paper link with both the cosh study the source outside entrepreneurial capital for private firm and the brav study the characteristic public and private firm the cosh finding support the traditional pecking order hypothesis and indicate that smaller private firm may face capital gap brav establishes that private firm depend almost entirely debt finance have higher leverage ratio and tend avoid external capital market debt crowdfunding platform have emerged the aftermath the cosh and brav study and can regarded hybrid external debt source crowdfunded debt differs from conventional public debt two respect the first that economises transaction cost notably flotation cost the fund are raised via internet platform contrast the public debt sold the corporate bond market the second and major difference that while conventional public debt raised large established corporation with strong credit rating with the notable exception the junk bond market crowdfunded debt raised small young risky and nonlisted privately held firm that would have difficulty accessing medium term bank debt the paper second contribution that investigates the driver the decision the small private firm raise crowdfunded debt opposed alternative source debt financing indeed this the first study the driver firm choice relay crowdfunded debt during period where the other major source debt financing bank lending heavily constrained the focus two major mediumterm external source fund available small private firm crowdfunded debt and bank debt such complement the path breaking study brav that focus only the external financing private medium and largesized smes new external equity typically not feasible source funding for small private firm thus our sample firm largely confined choice between different source debt loan capital crowdfunded debt share some characteristic with nonbank private debt institution can also invest however even though institutional investor contribute the majority fund are raised from the public crowd via internet portal and such must considered new hybrid form public debt our empirical result show that crowdfunded debt play unique role the funding risky and relatively early stage small private firm and gradually considered additional source outside debt capital although still not the first preferred choice than bank debt the implication our finding that crowdfunded debt add new layer outside capital the traditional pecking order external fund for private firm and this novel finding the paper organised follows section outline the distinctive feature the lending market the compare crowdfunded debt and bank debt and provides the hypothesis development section describes the data and variable used this study and present descriptive statistic section analysis the empirical result final section concludes see cosh for comprehensive list the other source outside capital crowdfunded equity may new source equity for such firm but beyond the scope this paper crowdfunding debt and hypothesis development lending market market are revolutionising uberising traditional market for good service that often are dominated monopolistic oligopolistic supplier einav view the main function market making easy for buyer find seller and engage convenient and trustworthy transaction market finance developed later than general market however their recent rapid growth and particular the mushrooming crowdfunding platform led them being designated leader the fintech financial technology alternative finance sector other prominent example the latter include foreign exchange transfer platform such transferwise and currencyfair interestingly the latter share most the common feature market identified einav these include lowering entry cost for seller engaging spot transaction employing technology match buyer and seller doing little upfront screening and maintaining quality using feedback mechanism crowdfunded debt market enable small firm and consumer access financing from the crowd and far the most prevalent form crowdfunding these market are characterised three distinctive feature that distinguish them from market general first crowdfunded debt involves ongoing relationship between the lending platform acting behalf the investor and the borrower crowd typically for period one five year depending the term the loan facility contrast most general market like ebay amazon involve spot transaction only this refers the disruptive effect uber had the taxi market potentially spreading other market see cumming and schwienbacher for interesting study fintech venture capital note that most early crowdfunding project were generally the art and creative industry and were reward product based rather than for profit see agrawal belleflamme belleflamme and mollick for more discussion second they take advantage technology and machine learning aggregate pool the saving individual investor well screen and allocate borrower into different risk category indeed the aggregation part loan what distinguishes debt crowdfunding from marketplace lending the usa where financial institution supply the whole debt third they seek maintain quality using market design mechanism and reputation continue successfully attract investor fund one the most important task the provision point mechanism highlighted agrawal this case the sme only receives the fund the funding target level met exceeded within particular time period time such mechanism solution classic coordination and freeriding problem that arises the provision public good one the big issue addressed this paper where crowdfunded debt might fit into the pecking order outside debt link with denis and mihov who employ incremental approach study new debt financing the choice between bank debt nonbank private debt and public debt they establish hierarchy pecking order debt funding and are one the first stress the role credit quality this process they find the highest credit quality firm indicated credit rating issue public debt the bond market medium credit quality firm borrow from the bank while the lowest credit quality firm are financed nonbank private lender under sec rule this paper seek provide answer the question whether crowdfunded debt rank above below bank debt term the firm likely attract since debt crowdfunding often described business lending this may give the false impression that similar bank lending not because crowdlending can viewed form regulatory arbitrage disintermediation crowdfunded debt not subject basel iii capital requirement under which commercial bank operate note that basel iii capital requirement rise tandem with risk and bank were discouraged from lending smaller riskier smes the wake the banking and financial crisis the implication that lending platform have lending rate comparative advantage relative commercial bank thus firm that have crowdfunded debt are likely small firm that may also have had difficulty were discouraged from raising medium term bank loan the external funding problem particularly acute for privately held small firm their account are sparse and opaque for instance small private firm are required company law publish balance sheet financial information with their annual report but are not obliged publish their profit and loss account this make risk assessment more challenging for bank finally crowdfunding provides complicated and more rapid mean for private firm raise external debt since time consuming apply for bank loan the evaluation process can lengthy and complicated due the ease raising fund via the internet more and more small and private firm have obtained crowdfunded debt recent year hypothesis development this paper are interested private firm financial decision the both traditional and unconventional capital source the issued capital bank debt and crowdfunded debt aforementioned recent year many firm especially small private firm consider raise capital from the public crowdfunding platform although the capital size crowdfunded debt not large bank debt can not ignored that crowdfunded debt part the firm capital structure while virtually all small firm have short run overdraft financing from their clearing bank more risky firm are unlikely have access mediumterm bank debt where the latter maturity year conjecture that this make small private firm more likely candidate for crowdfunded debt borrower when their credit quality lower than that required bank particular denis and mihov find that firm preferring debt financing tend have higher leverage ratio thus the first empirically testable implication crowdfunded debt contributes firm debt ratio following shyamsunder and myers use the financing deficit regression model examine the pecking order behaviour these small private firm our sample since costly particularly for smallsized firm raise capital externally private firm are general likely raise retire capital until the internal fund are insufficient for the deficit these private firm thus seek for external funding source therefore the next empirically testable implication when private firm have financing deficit they are likely issue either debt request more equity capital than retire debt repurchase equity most small private firm are typically owned founder entrepreneur and thus are unlikely make large investment fixed asset due funding gap fraser bank debt unavailable perceived unavailable the discouraged borrower hypothesis then firm will credit constrained and thus unable invest this context crowdfunded debt probably the only accessible source external financing for such firm and particularly for those pursuing growth opportunity then the next empirically testable implication small private firm are more likely issue crowdfunded debt next examine the relationship between firm size and crowdfunded debt most prior study focus public firm and find that firm size matter the pecking order theory for instance frank and goyal document that the pecking order theory applies well large firm but doe not explain the financing decision small firm well denis and mihov find that firm size positively related public debt than bank debt using public firm fama and french conclude that many publicly listed firm not follow the pecking order theory and issue equity the first place than debt however these study not explore whether firm size influence the financing decision private firm since the vast majority small private firm are tiny term their firm size total asset many them yet have wellstructured financial and accounting report that can provided the webbased public funding platform the information that mostly available and reliable lender the value firm total asset thus crowdfunding investor are likely invest relatively bigger rather than smaller private firm because these firm are more stable term their economy scale this lead the hypothesis crowdfunded debt positively impacted the size small private firm the pecking order theory suggests myers and majluf firm would first use internal fund finance corporate activity before pursuing external finance external finance debt financing preferable equity financing the latter more costly and manager are reluctant cede control their enterprise outsider such our next empirical testable implication debt either crowdfunded debt other debt preferable issued capital other debt mainly bank debt the main difference between bank and crowdfunded debt the degree information asymmetry which influence the order sequencing how external financing source are chosen compared with other nonbank public debt provider bank request more financial information application order better ass and monitor borrower such firm with lower asymmetric information will normally borrow from bank first and those with higher asymmetric information will tend borrow privately fama moreover crowdfunded debt amount typically are much smaller than those bank loan therefore hypothesise that other debt mainly bank debt the main debt capital alternative crowdfunded debt for private firm crowdfunded firm are the early stage their entrepreneurial finance life cycle and thus are unlikely have sufficient level retained profit finance their capital expenditure these expenditure are the main reason for cash outflow for small private firm and particular those that pursue growth opportunity such firm will need fund their growth through bank debt more likely the case our sample period crowdfunded debt thus predict that crowdfunded debt larger impact than other mainly bank debt and equity capital the capital expenditure small private firm the year following that which debt raised data and sample sample construction this subsection report the data for our unique sample small private firm with outstanding crowdfunded debt raised via the funding circle platform this platform chosen for two reason first funding circle founded the and indeed europe largest crowdlender over investor and lent more than firm second the only large crowdlender that specialises lending small firm the while rival zopa also lends small firm still primarily lends consumer funding circle make available website aggregated data lending risk category interest rate region industry and reason for borrowing extant crowdfunding study typically use such aggregated data from large longestablished platform such kickstarter our approach different from the previous work that handcollect large sample firm with outstanding crowdfunded debt from the funding circle website financial information for these firm obtained from the financial analysis made easy fame database create deidentified database the sample firm are overwhelmingly small private nonlisted firm they are defined company house small and are required submit balance sheet financial information only since they are not obliged submit profit and loss statement income data from the balance sheet had extracted create the control variable for the empirical analysis thus firm not listed fame are excluded also exclude utility firm ussic code financial firm ussic code and public sector firm ussic code due the regulation they are subject and their distinct financial policy and capital source this filtering process result final sample firmyear observation and firm since the sample fraction the funding circle loanbook interesting see how representative for the purpose our analysis appendix summarises the firm profile industry along with the share the corresponding industry from the total number loan the funding circle portfolio may the sample includes diverse range firm overall the sample industry percentage are quite close the total number funded project there are two exception first the sample overweight the manufacturing and engineering industry and second underweights the property and construction industry however the combined percentage for these two industry are very close with figure and for the sample and total respectively available from httpswwwfundingcirclecomuk accessed from september january fame compiled bureau van dijk bvd the data are collected from jordan leading provider legal information the united kingdom turn jordan collect the data from company house the data are deidentified avoid any confidentiality issue our interest solely the data aggregated level and not that individual firm one the interesting and attractive aspect crowdfunded debt that contrast with traditional bank debt the borrower are not geographically constrained borrowing from local source only principle any firm with internet connection can become borrower assuming that the capacity repay the loan appendix provides the location the sample firm region benchmark report the regional sample and total loan share well the proportion the population located each region the figure suggest that london and the south east are slightly underrepresented our sample compared with funding circle loanbook our sample account for loan against for total loan this region however the london and the south east sample share clearly exceeds the region population share just and line with the spatial concentration crowdfunding highlighted agrawal this expected for two reason first london and the south east were least affected the post recession second london been described the crowdfunding capital the world the northern powerhouse north west and north east region accounted for crowdfunded debt against total loan and the population this consistent with manufacturing being overweighted our sample the midland sample share representative relative the total and the region population share the remaining region like scotland wale northern ireland and east england the proportion sample debt and underweighted relative the region population share contrast overweighted for the south west region against population share overall all sample figure are reasonably close the percentage share each region from the total loanbook suggesting that our sample representative population estimate were downloaded from the office for national statistic mid this term used shorthand for proposal boost economic growth the north england the coalition government and conservative government the united kingdom particularly the core city manchester liverpool leeds sheffield and newcastle descriptive statistic table show the debt characteristic for the sample also report summary statistic for the dependent and independent variable used the regression model this paper the detailed variable definition are summarised appendix the table show the sample mean and standard deviation parenthesis under the mean the variable for firmyear observation with crowdfunded debt column for observation with crowdfunded debt column and all observation column the final column give the tstatistic and corresponding pvalues parenthesis for equality mean for column and table around here several observation can made first firmyear observation with crowdfunded debt are characterised higher leverage total and net term spend more capital expenditure capex are larger proxied total asset and older enjoy higher turnover turnover and profitability profit level and have smaller deficit negative deficit gap second firmyear observation with crowdfunding are indistinguishable from firmyear observation without crowdfunding term both average return asset roa and tangible asset tangiat finally firmyear observation with crowdfunding have lower ratio short long term debt shorttolong relative firmyear observation without crowdfunding table present the correlation matrix for the variable included the econometric specification for our full sample the table separately present the correlation between variable for firmyear observation with crowdfunding the shaded upper triangular matrix part and the firmyear observation without crowdfunding the lower triangular matrix part table around here the table show several significant correlation the critical value better and some the coefficient are relatively low the case firmyear observation with crowdfunding leverage positively correlated with crowdfunded debt but negatively correlated with firm size the other hand the case firmyear observation without crowdfunding leverage positively correlated with firm size both subsample group leverage positively correlated with tangible asset and the deficit but negatively correlated with net working capital also crowdfunded debt significantly inversely related with capital expenditure tangible asset firm size age turnover profitability and the deficit empirical result this section analysis the determinant debt ratio the small nonlisted firm our sample and their external financing choice following brav use firm balance sheet data quantify their leverage and differentiate between capital issuance repurchase particular measure leverage the sum shortterm loan and overdraft plus long term liability all divided total asset the context debt financing also analyse the key factor that affect firm decision whether crowdfund not this calculate the outstanding balance each company loan the end the fiscal year using amortization schedule calculator and assuming that the monthly payment are fixed the firm more than one loan first calculate the outstanding balance the end the fiscal year for each loan individually and then sum these outstanding loan amount obtain the total value crowdfunding debt for this firm all crowdfunding loan our sample are being amortized for each company assume that the accounting reference date reported fame the end the fiscal year given that funding circle provides the duration and date which the loan accepted calculating the outstanding balance using amortization schedule straightforward exercise leverage this section analysis the determinant firm debt ratio using regression framework brav and rajan and zingales the choice explanatory and control variable motivated the previous theoretical and empirical literature capital structure for example berger and udell rajan and zingales hovakimian and petersen and rajan among others find that firm size asset tangibility growth profitability and age are key determinant firm debt ratio also include the composition firm debt shorttolong control for contracting problem faulkender and petersen brav and dummy variable help quantify the increase leverage due crowdfunding table present pooled ordinary least square regression estimate for net leverage leverage for the full sample from and the corresponding tstatistics adjusted for clustering firm the independent variable are lagged one period except for the binary crowdfunding dummy variable avoid potential endogeneity issue and all variable are divided total asset mitigate for heteroskedasticity table around here the coefficient growth and capital expenditure are always statistically insignificant which consistent with brav who posit that private firm leverage more sensitive operating performance since their absolute cost capital high line with the tradeoff theory capital structure however leverage positively and significantly related the proportion shortterm debt and asset tangibility these finding are robust regardless whether not take into account bank deposit and investment when measuring leverage the table show negative relation between net leverage and profitability proxied roa and between leverage and age but both are only marginally significant the level there also positive and statistically significant relationship between net leverage and size interestingly both leverage measure net and total are positively and significantly related crowdfunding dummy the critical value and these remain significant even when the usual control variable are added this novel finding the context leverage consistent with the fact that crowdfunded debt cost advantage relative bank debt since unlike bank debt disintermediated debt and thus not subject basel iii capital requirement overall the result indicate that firm debt ratio are sensitive crowdfunded debt predicted hypothesis and firm characteristic like firm size asset tangibility and debt composition but sensitive firm profitability these finding depart important respect from those brav for his sample medium and large private firm establishes that leverage highly sensitive performance variable like roa line with traditional trade off theory however also find highly significant coefficient for all his other independent variable including growth capital expenditure tangible asset firm size age and debt composition contrast our finding indicate that roa significant just one regression the level and apart from tangible asset firm size and debt composition the other variable are mostly insignificant decision raise retire capital this subsection examines how access capital market affect the decision small private firm whether raise retire capital brav argues that private firm tend rely more debt than equity since their cost equity higher for two reason one that the owner manager and other large shareholder private firm are reluctant cede dilute their control the other that the equity private firm will attractive outside investor due the high degree information asymmetry between insider and outsider these two factor combine raise the cost equity for private firm the context this paper crowdfunding offer new source external debt and equity capital private firm that are expensive than their traditional counterpart but this paper focus crowdfunded debt only explore the capital issuance and retirement decision firm within our sample using multinomial logit model brav the dependent variable take the value the firm take action the base category issue either debt equity and either retires debt repurchase equity firm defined issuing repurchasing equity the percentage change shareholder fund the face value total outstanding share larger smaller than similarly define firm issuing retiring debt the percentage change the sum shortterm debt and long term liability larger smaller than following leary and robert and brav firm deficit and net working capital nwc are used control variable the multinomial model result are presented table interpreting the result note that the sign the reported coefficient estimate show whether small change the explanatory variable increase decrease the odds ratio the indicated alternative relative the baseline case taking action model includes all the explanatory variable excluding zscore employed brav and similarly firm deficit and net working capital nwc are used control variable the difference between this and model and that the latter successively add leverage and profitability respectively explanatory variable table around here the result are interesting small private firm are more likely raise capital when they have deficit and retire capital when they have surplus the result support our hypothesis the implication that private firm are likely raise external capital only when they have which consistent with the higher cost capital they face the result indicate that the larger the firm size the likely raise retire capital possibly due economy scale cash management both these finding are consistent with those brav for his sample private firm however growth opportunity our sample have insignificant impact unlike brav where the probability that private firm issue retire capital positively negatively related increase growth opportunity consistent with firm raising capital finance future investment our result show that small firm with higher level net working capital are more likely both raise and retire capital possibly using the new capital retire debt contrast brav find that his sample private firm with higher level net working capital likely retire capital our model add leverage explanatory variable while our model add profitability well leverage these have the impact our previous result with one exception model and including leverage and profitability the effect rendering insignificant the impact net working capital the probability raising capital but not retiring capital the model result indicate that the higher the leverage level the lower the probability both raising new capital and retiring existing capital the model result also show that the higher the profitability level the higher the probability raising new capital these two set result are novel sum our result the decision raise retire capital are highly consistent with those brav for his medium and large private firm sample our finding produce two novel result first the higher the leverage level small private firm the lower the probability both raising new capital and retiring existing capital second high profitability level boost their probability raising new capital crowdfunding and external financing choice this subsection present result the decision small private firm crowdfund not crowdfund the crowdfunding decision interesting can shed light the aversion private firm external financial market that well documented the literature tested within probit regression framework where the response binary variable assumes value one for firm that prefer crowdfunding the source debt financing and zero for firm that take action issuing crowdfunded debt the choice general explanatory and control variable motivated brav and the theoretical and empirical literature capital structure for example rajan and zingales and havakimian find that firm size and profitability among others are key determinant firm debt ratio building brav model the decision crowdfund the spirit hovakimian using the predicted debt ratio from the leverage regression column and table proxy for the target debt ratio the independent variable include the target adjustment leverage roa and firm size the target adjustment net leverage tmalev tmanetlev the difference between the predicted net leverage ratio from the leverage regression model table column and the actual net leverage ratio the previous year the result from the probit regression are reported table table around here the target adjustment hypothesis the static tradeoff theory posit that the larger the target leverage distance relative the startingperiod leverage and the more profitable the firm the more likely the firm will choose debt the issuance decision the result table offer support for our hypothesis the coefficient both the target leverage proxy are significantly positive for both crowdfunding dummy variable these indicate that the larger target leverage deviation the higher the probability firm issuing more crowdfunded debt regression and and having crowdfunded debt regression and this consistent with the tradeoff theory capital structure table show that profitability level are inversely related the probability raising crowdfunded debt the significance level all specification possible that low roa level imply low retained earnings and thus need raise external capital this contrast with the brav finding insignificant coefficient this variable for the private firm his sample finally include firm size measured taking the natural log total asset our probit regression the result indicate that the larger the firm size the higher the probability issuing crowdfunded debt the significance level the result are line with the hypothesis that larger firm face lower cost asymmetric information and thus are more likely have crowdfunded debt table present probit regression result financing choice for the full sample from the choice between debt and equity result are given the first and second column where the dependent variable equal one the firm issued debt including crowdfunded only and zero issued equity capital only table around here firm defined debt issuer change total debt debt exceeds debt defined the difference between the total short term loan and overdraft and long term liability the current year and the corresponding total the previous year scaled the latter total similarly firm defined equity capital issuer the change issued capital between given year and the previous year divided the issued capital the previous year exceeds the column result indicate increased probability issuing debt when firm net leverage deviation from target increase but this significant the level only the dependent variable the third and fourth column equal one the firm issued other noncrowdfund debt most likely bank debt only and zero issued equity capital only the result column show increased likelihood issuing other debt when net leverage deviation increase and this also significant the level the final four column table present result the choice between the decision raise crowdfunded debt versus other financing choice the dependent variable the fifth and sixth column equal one firm issued crowdfunded debt only and zero they issued equity capital only the last two column the dependent variable equal one the firm issued crowdfunded only and zero they issued other debt firm defined crowdfund issuer the change crowdfunded debt between given year and previous year greater than zero the tmalev independent variable the deviation the predicted leverage ratio from the leverage regression model table column and the actual leverage ratio the previous year the result column and indicate increase the probability issuing crowdfunded debt rather than equity both net leverage and leverage deviation from target respectively both coefficient are significant the level this plausible private firm are more likely prefer crowdfunded debt equity for both cost and control reason these result and those column indicate our preference for debt over equity receives strongest support from crowdfunded debt hypothesis the result column and indicate lower likelihood raising crowdfunded debt rather than other debt the firm experience increase both net leverage and leverage deviation from target respectively both coefficient are significant the level finally the result indicate inverse relation between the probability raising crowdfunded debt and profitability and the coefficient are significant the level the implication from these result that small private firm have better chance raising crowdfunded debt their leverage deviation from target are decreasing and their profitability low funding capital expenditure the main purpose for crowdfunding given application shown the funding circle platform for capital expansion therefore interesting analyse the link between the raised capital and the subsequent investment the firm using regression model similar the one employed kim and weisbach capital expenditure are related the three competing source funding for the sample period the dependent variable the total amount capital expenditure capex year and after the base year which the fund are raised the funding independent variable include crowdfunded debt other mainly bank debt and the change issued capital the result are summarised table table around here the result indicate that capital expenditure are positively and significantly related both crowdfunded and other debt but not equity funding this consistent with the view that small private firm mainly rely debt rather than equity funding early stage entrepreneurial finance hypothesis the positive impact crowdfunded debt capital expenditure significant the level year and following the funding year and the level year the drop significance level may explained the fact that crowdfunded debt very recent phenomenon one can deduce from the declining sample size from year year following the funding year the result also show that capital expenditure are positively and significantly related other mainly bank debt year the coefficient are significant the level year following the funding year and the level year one can use the result perform some test pecking order theory first while both debt and the equity capital the level only coefficient are significant year and after the capital raised those debt are significantly larger than those equity second the crowdfunded debt coefficient are all economically significant and are numerically larger than the corresponding other debt coefficient however unreported result indicate that these two coefficient are not statistically different the spirit kim and weisbach also calculate the implied change the dependent variable when each source fund increased one pound for mediansized firm the twodigit sic code business service the result these calculation are also presented table the implied change per pound raised either crowdfunded other debt financing positive and increasing for the first three year after the base year during which capital raised but decrease the fourth year number for every pound raised capital expenditure rise penny for the first year after crowdfunding over year and year horizon capital expenditure rise and penny these finding suggest that firm not exhaust their crowdfund once contrast the implied change per pound raised issuing capital negative over all year conclusion crowdfunded debt business lending novel form external debt financing for small young entrepreneurial firm which fund are raised from the crowd via internet the result were not reported order preserve space however they are available upon request also perform test that all three coefficient are equal and this hypothesis rejected only for the first two year after the capital raised and the significance level platform this paper investigates unique sample small private firm financed funding circle over the period this the largest crowdfunding platform europe and specialises solely raising debt for small firmsthe platform data are supplemented financial data from fame analyse crowdfunded debt the context theory capital structure the result indicate that small private firm debt ratio are sensitive crowdfunded debt and firm characteristic like firm size asset tangibility and debt composition but sensitive firm profitability small firm are more likely raise capital when they have deficit and retire capital when they have surplus these result are highly consistent with those brav for his medium and large private firm sample the probit regression result show that the larger target leverage deviation the higher the probability firm issuing having crowdfunded debt which consistent with the tradeoff theory capital structure finally the result indicate that crowdfunded and other debt larger positive impact capital expenditure than equity capital the year following that which the external fund were raised this result intuitive because the main crowdfunding purpose given the funding application for capital expansion document that the first year after having crowdfunded debt other noncrowdfunded debt capital expenditure increase penny for every pound raised reference agrawal catalini goldfarb the geography crowdfunding nber
