fintech expert agree refers company develop financial service product relying much intense use information technology varga arner barberis buckley stated fintech could refer incumbent new financial company regardless size product portfolio business model hussain kim mcauley affirm instead fintech refers firm use also focus providing efficient service try enter traditionally nonbanking market hand ernst young definition implies firm take part fintech revolution manage build innovative business model implement adequate supporting technology overall still agreement boundary arising sector lie definition better suit paper author idea one given financial stability board bcbs defines fintech technologically enabled financial innovation financial service could result new business model application process product associated material effect financial market institution provision financial service therefore company traditional bank startup firm technology giant enter fintech sector implementing new technology improving disrupting financial service product currently offered competitor currently fintech company operate wide array different service building business around one specifically developed technology fintechs activity include microfinancing platform credit provision facilitated peertopeer lending businessrelated data analysis however reason really make difference traditional bank emerging fintech company lack regulation towards latter still clear wellmarked distinction service offering regulated heavily currently done incumbent financial institution better understand distinguish company divide several different category according main feature characterize based level innovation developing customercentred service first may consider traditional bank still believe bricksandmortar banking maintaining costly network branch limited digital footprint bank might accrued significant technologyrelated debt running obsolete system extremely expensive support updated today customer need traditional bank threatened exponential growth digitized ever efficient financial competitor market bank already experimenting new business model yet modernized infrastructure fully digitized business process referred transformational bank length paper nowadays bank since large financial institution yet reacted threat emerging fintech firm bank play significant role evolutionary process financial sector thanks large client base copious funding opportunity deep knowledge regulatory framework successful technologically advanced transformational bank already gone process transformation adopted innovative way business related financial service may called digital bank neobanks king neobanks usually adopt broadly digitized core banking system quickly implement innovative service bank also updated digital channel management compliant regulation established solid profitable new business model therefore digital bank could working transparently lens institutional regulator capturing many benefit fintech innovation well distinguishing traditional financial institution innovative disruptive newcomer needed proof show financial technology firm already affecting digitization banking sector also clear one category bank going face different opportunity change threat order cope newly emerging fintech company defined different type bank within current banking system due give overview emerging global fintech sector term number firm operate within market various function application financial technology company offering market nowadays moreover following paragraph also observe amount invested fintech company around world helpful tool measure growing interest notyet fully exploited market although exact number fintech company may vary depending definition fintech company generally agreed approximately fintech company around world forbes recently founded startup others largely affirmed corporation firm emerging city hong kong london new york beijing singapore affirming financial technology center fintechenthusiast head developing idea better understand global phenomenon finovate one largest fintech conference important source uptodate sector news firm valuation aggregated major financial technology company world clusterized field interest company valuation proof fintech rapidly growing market number unicorn company firm valued one billion dollar identified finovate meeting increasing year year look like stop soon following map show unicorn company along country origin giving overlook fintech flourishing market figure fintech unicorn around globe source wwwcbinsightscom bank key activity fintech potential going deep function application fintech due give overlook bank main activity fintech company could develop competitive advantage bank institution whose current operation consist granting loan receiving deposit public stated freixas rochet requires simultaneous performance three distinct activity transforming characteristic financial asset liability supplying payment service gathering processing information data barba navaretti first activity mainly achieved maturity transformation taking shortterm source finance turn longterm borrowing mortgage process fundamental economic system allows funding longterm investment thus stimulate productivity simultaneously protecting depositor nonsystematic liquidity shock thanks ease providing liquidity customer bank able accomplish second abovestated activity well offering payment service payment service form field great interest major fintech firm form broad market plenty opportunity growth particular interest emerging country eventually third bank key activity information processing includes task related exante assessing potential borrower expost tracking behavior buildup management welldiversified portfolio maximizes return respect risk existence three service provides rationale bank existence reasonably bundled within one institution therefore deeper analysis activity drawn upon understanding potential effect fintech banking industry transmuting feature financial asset liability first main task bank especially maturity transformation make use diversified pool small size depositor deal effect idiosyncratic liquidity shock bank put aside limited cushion liquid asset concede longerterm loan thanks unlikeliness depositor could withdraw fund simultaneously core bank capability deliver liquidity service liquidity management service unlikely provided fintech company would need specific authorization granting illiquid loan acquiring liquid asset fact providing service would turn company bank definition would regulated traditional financial institution moreover bank also detach loan provide financing depositor thanks maturity transformation achieving much wider portfolio diversification individual depositor could obtain contrary peertopeer crowdfunding platform provide diversification risk investor would would add part risk book issue security falling either banking regulation security regulation fact financial intermediary currently apply agency model profiting commission fee paid side transaction retaining risk loan generate interfering price therefore fintech company likely higher liability riskier asset portfolio bank mean far bank also implement innovative information management technology regulatory arbitrage excluded fintech threat bank activity credit liquidity risk realm seems limited moving second key service provided bank regard payment strongly related bank ability providing liquidity risk management customer need liquidity much better pay directly deposit account indeed barba navaretti reason many nonbank financial intermediary well nonfinancial institution company recently emerging payment service market taking advantage large client base example mpesa mobile phonebased money transfer financing microfinancing service launched vodafone developed country kenya tanzania lighter regulatory requirement better technology effective economy scope may three reason allow fintech company compete bank payment service offering higher interest payment despite incapability neither earn interest margin provided maturity transformation exploit fractional reserve requirement also implementation blockchain technology would boost use digital payment virtual currency expanding market nonfinancial nonbanks institution could flourish blockchain technology register kind information permanently digital ledger manipulated guarantee actual legitimacy transaction need state notary intermediate lastly bank involved third major activity information processing whole financial sector set upon information information management recent development related technology affected three different aspect data storage processing data transfer data availability information sector fintechs bank take two diametrically opposed approach whereas latter mostly exploit soft relationshipbased information financial technology company function big data processing standardization information therefore significant advancement lead fintech operator better production distribution financial service regarding production financial service massive quantity personal data gathered analyzed nowadays thus large customer base behavior allow company provide financial product better suit client need distribution financial service driver change possibility match demand supply side market easier efficient way thanks big data processing assessment customer profile ability recognize pattern rapidly processing analyzing huge data set make machine learning useful financial application exploiting customer information thanks computer algorithm help financial service provider developing tailormade service clientele however collection elaboration private information legal ethical implication term cyber risk privacy concern likely regular restraint set regard legit holder private data significant competitive advantage competitor overall activity brought upon bank analyzed segment feasible fintech company expansion financial technology company

traditional banking forward looking scenario basel committee banking supervision within bank international settlement depicted five different scenario describing potential effect rise fintech bank effort ass kind impact would fintech product service banking industry bcbs scenario would obviously differ depending size geography various actor also considered mutually exclusive comprehensive likely evoluion banking industry may proceed combination various scenario namely better bank scenario new bank scenario distributed bank scenario relegated bank scenario disintermediated bank scenario bcbs main question addressed develop forwardlooking scenario player lead customer relationship user experience interface player eventually provides service bear risk former point advance fintech innovation ended kind battle customer relationship customer data outcome define actual future role bank another main consideration relates potential change bank business model various role traditional bank fintech company may play either owning customer relationship supporting banking activity service provider latter question instead involves ultimately responsible tradtional core banking service lending managing risk offering payment investment service however basel committee banking supervision conscious future regulation provision shape result depicted scenario manner interact following different scenario described analysed better comprehend fintech innovation could lead banking industry near future also example innovative technology process could implemented banking industry given first scenario analysed better bank one modernisation digitisation incumbent financial insitutions brought upon case traditional bank innovate keep core banking service customer relationship implementing enabling technology transform current business model traditional bank usually pressure improve cost efficiency customer relationship time however thanks market knowledge better investment capacity potential result incumbent financial institution improve offering service product exploiting new technology upgrading existing one bank adopt new technology provide value proposition could effectively offered current infrastructure technology adopted nonfinancial innovator also put action incumbent bank instance biometry chatbots artificial intelligence might help bank develop sophisticated way sustaining valueadded remote customer relationship keeping transtactions safe reducing fraud risk bcbs many incumbent bank already introduced mobile payment service employed payment service offered third party innovative payment service would support better bank scenario fact customer could believe traditional bank would provide safer payment transaction nonbanks alternative would however although early sign suggesting incumbent player increased investment digitisation modernisation strategy plan still seen magnitude scenario actually dominant second scenario considered one new bank incumbent financial instituions replaced challenger bank according scenario traditional bank able adapt incoming technologyenabled disruption thus supplanted neobanks bank established bigtechs fully digitalized banking platform new bank provide costeffective innovative banking service implementation advanced technology may receive banking license existing regulatory system may traditional financial institution partner neobanks german chinese webank moved away branchcentred customer relationship model thanks technologybased relationship model may able exploit innovative process instrument lower cost quickly uptodate manner compared incumbent player due fact neobanks constrained legacy infrastructure said evidence suggesting current agglomerate challenger bank reached market power new bank scenario predominant one distributed bank scenario described situation fragmentation financial service among specialised fintech firm incumbent financial institution financial service become progressively modularised incumbent bank still capture enough market share survive several new business rise provide specialised service focusing specific niche without attempting become universal retail bank business may decide compete ownership whole customer relationship incumbent bank challenge provide core banking service customer relationship distributed bank scenario delivery financial service shared across various party bank fintech firm operating joint venture partner structure therefore bank prone offer service product thirdparty supplier order satisfy customer whose expectation term transparency quality soared also consumer may use various financial service provider instead using one financial partner bcbs increasing adoption open apis application programming interface evidence scenario already playing market element signalling likeliness scenario increasing partnership online lending platform traditional bank growth innovative digital payment system emerging joint venture bank fintech firm steadily increasing presence roboadvisors automated investment advisory service provided fintech company bank described next relegated bank scenario incumbent bank considered commodity provide service direct customer relationship owned financial service provider fintech company bigtechs fintech bigtech company operate frontend customer platform perform various financial service heterogeneous group supplier also take advantage incumbent bank banking license offer core banking service uncertain relegated bank would bear risk attached activity may depend contract stipulated along fintech bigtech firm specific scenario frontend customer platform fully exploit cloud computing artifical intelligence big data various configuration making heavy use connectivity data gathering improve customer experience innovative way point entity managing platform enough resource compete incumbent owning customer relationship therefore bank relegated mere commoditised function provider carrying basic service risk management operational process playing role service provider abovestated platform operate customer relationship currently relegated bank scenario seem unlikely due extreme assumption however example modularised financial service may arise near future instance alternative payment platform experienced steady growth lately leading bank provide back office operation aid fundamental area compliance treasury function fintech company directly interact customer also arising online lending platform could extend array service offered beyond lending become intermediary traditional financial institution customer case incumbent bank would keep existing provide operational funding mechanism required party another example sustaining likeliness relegated bank scenario given instant messaging application wechat china exploit customer data provide customer financial product service better suit moreover wechat linked licensed banking platform webank eventually relegating bank product risk management last five scenario analysed disintermatied bank one case incumbent bank longer playing significant role financial industry customer interact directly financial service provider need intermediary bank therefore replaced leaner agile platform based stateoftheart technology effectively secure direct matching end user depending financial requirement borrowing raising fund making payment customer direct approach choosing financial service provider scenario justifying inutility intermediary bank however also may exposed higher risk performing transaction bearing whole responsibility instance peertopeer lending industry common customer would lender borrower depending need therefore exposing either credit risk former conduct risk latter extreme scenario seems far reality near future however example component disintermadiated bank scenario already happening example include cryptocurrencies ensure value transfer payment without need involving incumbent bank intermediary using public distributed ledger technology dlt adoption daily use base however struggle become reality cryptocurrencies constrained several factor price volatility antimoneylaundering issue aml due anonymity transaction scarcity scalability another example sustaining likeliness scenario given lending platform employed extremely innovative trustworthy credit scoring process nonetheless lender market share currently relatively small country many peertopeer platform adopted different business model relies involvement incumbent bank investment fund rather retail investor origin overall five forwardlooking scenario hereby described analysed extreme likely future provide mix scenario fintech firm bank different part customer relationship simoultaneously offering modularised financial service product back office operation giving foundation assumption case lending club marketplace lending company display three five scenario taken consideration fact incumbent bank exploit lending club platform issue price consumer loan balance sheet could considered distributed bank since incumbent keep owning customer relationship allocates revenue process fintech company bcbs lending club match customer loan retail traditional investor well thanks support regulated traditional bank included transaction order make loan issuing easier operation incumbent bank role could characterised relegated bank scenario various marketplace lender instead display disintermediated bank scenario due fact enable direct peertopeer lending without involving bank process recapitulate close impossible single scenario reflect whole banking industry situation market differ significantly size need jurisdiction therefore blend five scenario likely emerge future following graph summarizes five scenario key player red represents incumbent bank purple indicates new player grey fintech company blue bigtechs google amazon shown first scenario traditional bank would retain current role service provider owner customer relationship undergoing modernisation process next case depicted new bank characterized solid digital user experience overall digitization service distributed bank scenario presented incumbent fintech company bigtechs involved providing financial service offering digital customer interface relegated bank scenario differs
