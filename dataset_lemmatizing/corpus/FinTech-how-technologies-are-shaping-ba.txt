wwwcbinsightscom bank key activity fintech potential deep function application fintech due give overlook bank main activity fintech company could develop competitive advantage bank institution whose current operation consist grant loan receive deposit public state freixas rochet require simultaneous performance three distinct activity transform characteristic financial asset liability supply payment service gathering processing information data barba navaretti first activity mainly achieve maturity transformation take short term source finance turn longterm borrowing mortgage process fundamental economic system allows funding longterm investment thus stimulate productivity simultaneously protect depositor nonsystematic liquidity shock thanks ease provide liquidity customer bank able accomplish second abovestated activity well offering payment service payment service form field great interest major fintech firm form broad market plenty opportunity growth particular interest emerge country eventually third bank key activity information processing include task related exante assess potential borrower expost track behavior buildup management welldiversified portfolio maximizes return respect risk existence three service provide rationale bank existence reasonably bundle within one institution therefore deeper analysis activity drawn upon understand potential effect fintech banking industry transmute feature financial asset liability first main task bank especially maturity transformation make use diversified pool small size depositor deal effect idiosyncratic liquidity shock bank put aside limited cushion liquid asset concede longerterm loan thanks unlikeliness depositor could withdraw fund simultaneously core bank capability deliver liquidity service liquidity management service unlikely provide fintech company would need specific authorization grant illiquid loan acquire less liquid asset fact provide service would turn company bank definition would regulate traditional financial institution moreover bank also detach loan provide financing depositor thanks maturity transformation achieve much wider portfolio diversification individual depositor could obtain contrary peerto peer crowdfunding platform provide diversification risk investor would would add part risk book issue security fall either banking regulation security regulation fact financial intermediary currently apply agency model profit commission fee paid side transaction retain risk loan generate interfere price therefore fintech company likely high liability riskier asset portfolio bank mean far bank also implement innovative information management technology regulatory arbitrage exclude fintech threat bank activity credit liquidity risk realm

barba navaretti reason many nonbank financial intermediary well nonfinancial institution company recently emerge payment service market take advantage large client base example mpesa mobile phonebased money transfer financing microfinancing service launch vodafone less developed country kenya tanzania lighter regulatory requirement well technology effective economy scope may three reason allow fintech company compete bank payment service offering high interest payment despite incapability neither earn interest margin provide maturity transformation exploit fractional reserve requirement also implementation blockchain technology would boost use digital payment virtual currency expand market nonfinancial nonbanks institution could flourish blockchain technology register kind

tradtional core banking service lending manage risk offering payment investment service however basel committee banking supervision conscious future regulation provision shape result depict scenario manner interact follow different scenario described analyse well comprehend fintech innovation could lead banking industry near future also example innovative technology process could implement banking industry give first scenario analyse well bank one modernisation digitisation incumbent financial insitutions brought upon case traditional bank innovate keep core banking service customer relationship implement enable technology transform current business model traditional bank usually pressure improve cost efficiency customer relationship time however thanks market knowledge well investment capacity potential result incumbent financial institution improve offering service product exploit new technology upgrade exist one bank adopt new technology provide value proposition could effectively offer current infrastructure technology adopt nonfinancial innovator also put action incumbent bank instance biometry chatbots artificial intelligence might help bank develop sophisticated way sustain valueadded remote customer relationship keep transtactions safe reduce fraud risk bcbs many incumbent bank already introduce mobile payment service employ payment service offer third party innovative payment service would support well bank scenario fact customer could believe traditional bank would provide safer payment transaction nonbanks alternative would however although early sign suggest incumbent player increase investment digitisation modernisation strategy plan still see magnitude scenario actually dominant second scenario consider one new bank incumbent financial instituions replace challenger bank accord scenario traditional bank able adapt incoming technologyenabled disruption thus supplant neobanks bank establish bigtechs fully digitalize banking platform new bank provide costeffective innovative banking service implementation advanced technology may receive banking license exist regulatory system may traditional financial institution partner neobanks german chinese webank move away branchcentred customer relationship model thanks technologybased relationship model may able exploit innovative process instrument low cost quickly uptodate manner compare incumbent player due fact neobanks constrain legacy infrastructure say evidence suggest current agglomerate challenger bank reach market power new bank scenario predominant one distribute bank scenario described situation fragmentation financial service among specialise fintech firm incumbent financial institution financial service become progressively modularised incumbent bank still capture enough market share survive several new business rise provide specialise service focus specific niche without attempt become universal retail bank business may decide compete ownership whole customer relationship incumbent bank challenge provide core banking service customer relationship distribute bank scenario delivery financial service share across various party bank fintech firm operating joint venture partner structure therefore bank prone offer service product third party supplier order satisfy customer whose expectation term transparency quality soar also consumer may use various financial service provider instead use one financial partner bcbs increase adoption open apis application program interface evidence scenario already play market element signal likeliness scenario increase partnership online lending platform traditional bank growth innovative digital payment system emerge joint venture bank fintech firm steadily increase presence roboadvisors automate investment advisory service provide fintech company bank described next relegate bank scenario incumbent bank consider commodity provide service direct customer relationship own financial service provider fintech company bigtechs fintech bigtech company operate frontend customer platform perform various financial service heterogeneous group supplier also take advantage incumbent bank banking license offer core banking service uncertain relegate bank would bear risk attach activity may depend contract stipulate along fintech bigtech firm specific scenario frontend customer platform fully exploit cloud compute artifical intelligence big data various configuration make heavy use connectivity data gathering improve customer experience innovative way point entity manage platform enough resource compete incumbent own customer relationship therefore bank relegate mere commoditised function provider carry basic service risk management operational process play role service provider abovestated platform operate customer relationship currently relegate bank scenario seem unlikely due extreme assumption however example modularised financial service may arise near future instance alternative payment platform experienced steady growth lately lead bank provide back office operation aid fundamental area compliance treasury function fintech company directly interact customer also arise online lending platform could extend array service offer beyond lending become intermediary traditional financial institution customer case incumbent bank would keep exist provide operational funding mechanism require party another example sustain likeliness relegate bank scenario give instant message application wechat china exploit customer data provide customer financial product service well suit moreover wechat link license banking platform webank eventually relegate bank product risk management last five scenario analyse disintermatied bank one case incumbent bank longer play significant role financial industry customer interact directly financial service provider need intermediary bank therefore replace leaner agile platform base stateoftheart technology effectively secure direct match end user depend financial requirement borrowing raise fund make payment customer direct approach choose financial service provider scenario justify inutility intermediary bank however also may expose high risk perform transaction bearing whole responsibility instance peertopeer lending industry common customer would lender borrower depend need therefore expose either credit risk former conduct risk latter extreme scenario seem far reality near future however example component disintermadiated bank scenario already happen example include cryptocurrencies ensure value transfer payment without need involve incumbent bank intermediary use public distribute ledger technology dlt adoption daily use base however struggle become reality cryptocurrencies constrain several factor price volatility antimoneylaundering issue aml due anonymity transaction scarcity scalability another example sustain likeliness scenario give lending platform employ extremely innovative trustworthy credit score process nonetheless lender market share currently relatively small country many peertopeer platform adopt different business model relies involvement incumbent bank investment fund rather retail investor origin overall five forwardlooking scenario hereby described analyse extreme likely future provide mix scenario fintech firm bank different part customer relationship
