introduction chapter the rise fintech what fintech bank key activity and fintech potential how the fintech sector developing fintech trend watch for the near future expert opinion fintech chapter the impact fintech traditional banking forward looking scenario opportunity and risk emerging from fintech central bank initiative facilitate financial innovation focus the fintech credit market the fintech credit market development implication the credit market conclusion bibliography sitography introduction during the last decade the world economy undergone thorough process modernisation and digitalisation mostly each sector the point where entirely new industry have emerged the silicon valley played major role such transformation demonstrating how the concentration several innovative company single area facilitates the flow and contamination idea within different industry leading flourishing economic sector and revolutionary innovation such disruptive wave innovation now converging towards historically bound tradition and renovationadverse industry banking this upcoming flow innovation under the name fintech that financial technology and the goal disrupt the currently dated and inefficient financial sector through the implementation new technology and process foreseeing what this phenomenon might imply nowadays banking industry question spontaneously arises how will fintech shape the future banking this thesis the ambitious objective answer this research question through overlook over the current state the fintech sector and deep analysis the market and main player financial technology are not banksonly affair indeed many new actor are entering the market financial service and product provider such bigtechs like amazon and google emerging neobanks and startup like and monzo therefore due delineate array potential scenario for the future banking and more broadly the economy while considering the important role that incumbent bank will have this dispute will they embrace this wave innovation try maintain their current status relying their centuryold legacy fulfil the thesis objective two chapter have been devised the first one give overlook fintech attempt better comprehend what fintech and potential implication the banking sector moreover the uptodate size this sector assessed along with state development and upcoming trend finally expert opinion are brought upon understand the different point view concerning the topic and the general sentiment about the possible disruption the financial service industry known today the second chapter five forwardlooking scenario are outlined and analysed order comprehend how fintech company could impact the financial system and which role would played incumbent the newly emerged framework then opportunity and risk embedded the rise financial technology are considered leading presentation the various initiative taken central bank and jurisdiction facilitate financial innovation eventually focus the fintech credit market given both the business model fintech credit company and the size the sector are researched with particular attention given emerging country which are the main beneficiary the development such innovative channel credit conclude fintech implication the traditional credit market are discussed ass their potential benefit the economy conclusion the rise fintech seem beneficial the global economic framework improves financial service and the overall customer experience through the implementation innovative technology and disruptive method moreover fintech would facilitate access financial service and product boosting the economy emerging country providing new form financing and enhancing the overall efficiency the banking industry developed country thanks the increased competition and the application innovative process within the industry the other hand additional risk attached fintech must taken consideration this regard jurisdiction and financial institution should embrace path regulatory renovation through the implementation regulatory technology regtech aimed hedging these new form risk chapter the rise fintech what fintech giving unique definition fintech difficult task since several variety the concept coexist academic paper and business journal fintech expert all agree that refers company that develop financial service and product relying much more intense use information technology varga arner barberis and buckley stated that fintech could refer all incumbent and new financial company regardless their size product portfolio business model hussain kim and mcauley affirm instead that fintech refers firm that not only use but which also focus providing more efficient service and try enter traditionally nonbanking market the other hand ernst young definition implies that all firm can take part the fintech revolution they manage build innovative business model and implement adequate supporting technology overall there still agreement where the boundary this arising sector lie the definition that better suit this paper author idea the one given the financial stability board bcbs which defines fintech technologically enabled financial innovation financial service that could result new business model application process product with associated material effect financial market and institution and the provision financial service therefore any company traditional bank startup firm technology giant can enter the fintech sector implementing new technology for improving disrupting the financial service product that are currently offered competitor currently fintech company operate wide array different service building their business around each one specifically developed technology fintechs activity include microfinancing platform credit provision facilitated peertopeer lending businessrelated data analysis however the reason that really make difference between traditional bank and emerging fintech company the lack regulation towards the latter there still not clear and wellmarked distinction which service they are offering and they should regulated heavily currently done for incumbent financial institution better understand and distinguish such company will divide them into several different category according the main feature that characterize them and based their level innovation developing more customercentred service first all may consider the traditional bank that still believe bricksandmortar banking maintaining costly network branch and with limited digital footprint such bank might have accrued significant technologyrelated debt running obsolete system that are extremely expensive support and not updated for today customer need these traditional bank are the most threatened the exponential growth digitized and ever more efficient financial competitor the market bank that have already been experimenting new business model but have not yet modernized their infrastructure fully digitized their business process will referred transformational bank during the length this paper these are most nowadays bank since there are large financial institution which have not yet reacted the threat emerging fintech firm such bank play significant role the evolutionary process the financial sector thanks their large client base copious funding opportunity and deep knowledge the regulatory framework the most successful technologically advanced transformational bank which have already gone through the process transformation and adopted innovative way doing business related financial service may called digital bank neobanks king neobanks usually adopt broadly digitized core banking system that can quickly implement innovative service such bank are also updated digital channel management and compliant with regulation having established solid and profitable new business model therefore digital bank could working transparently under the lens institutional regulator while capturing the many benefit fintech innovation well distinguishing between traditional financial institution and innovative disruptive newcomer needed proof show that financial technology firm are already affecting the digitization the banking sector also clear that each one these category bank going face different opportunity change and threat order cope with the newly emerging fintech company once defined the different type bank within the current banking system due give overview the emerging global fintech sector term number firm that operate within the market and the various function and application that financial technology company are offering the market nowadays moreover the following paragraph will also observe the amount invested fintech company all around the world they are helpful tool measure the growing interest this notyet fully exploited market although the exact number fintech company may vary depending the definition what fintech company generally agreed that there are approximately fintech company around the world forbes some them are recently founded startup others are largely affirmed corporation such firm are emerging city such hong kong london new york beijing and singapore that are affirming themselves financial technology center where any fintechenthusiast should head for developing his idea better understand this global phenomenon finovate one the largest fintech conference and important source uptodate sector news and firm valuation aggregated all the major financial technology company the world and clusterized them field interest and company valuation proof that fintech rapidly growing market the number unicorn company firm valued more than one billion dollar identified during finovate meeting increasing year year and doe not look like will stop soon the following map show each unicorn company along with country origin giving overlook fintech most flourishing market figure fintech unicorn around the globe source wwwcbinsightscom bank key activity and fintech potential before going deep into the function and application fintech due give overlook what bank main activity are and where fintech company could develop competitive advantage bank institution whose current operation consist granting loan and receiving deposit from the public stated freixas and rochet this requires the simultaneous performance three distinct activity transforming the characteristic financial asset and liability supplying payment service gathering and processing information and data barba navaretti the first activity mainly achieved through maturity transformation that taking shortterm source finance and turn them into longterm borrowing such mortgage this process fundamental any economic system allows the funding longterm investment and thus stimulate productivity while simultaneously protecting depositor from nonsystematic liquidity shock thanks their ease providing liquidity their customer bank are able accomplish the second abovestated activity well offering payment service payment service form field great interest for major fintech firm they form broad market with plenty opportunity for growth with particular interest emerging country eventually the third bank key activity information processing includes all the task related the exante assessing potential borrower the expost tracking their behavior and the buildup and management welldiversified portfolio which maximizes the return with respect risk the existence these three service provides rationale for bank existence they can reasonably bundled within one institution therefore deeper analysis each these activity should drawn upon for understanding the potential effect fintech the banking industry transmuting the feature financial asset and liability the first main task for bank especially through maturity transformation they can make use diversified pool small size depositor deal with the effect idiosyncratic liquidity shock bank can put aside limited cushion liquid asset concede longerterm loan thanks the unlikeliness that depositor could withdraw their fund all simultaneously this the core bank capability deliver liquidity service such liquidity management service are unlikely provided fintech company they would need specific authorization for granting illiquid loan acquiring liquid asset fact providing such service would turn those company bank definition and such they would regulated traditional financial institution moreover bank also detach any loan that they provide from the financing each depositor thanks maturity transformation achieving much wider portfolio diversification than what individual depositor could obtain the contrary peertopeer crowdfunding platform can not provide any diversification risk investor they would then they would have add part that risk their book issue security falling under either banking regulation security regulation fact most the financial intermediary currently apply the agency model profiting through commission fee paid both side the transaction but not retaining any risk from the loan that they generate nor interfering with price therefore such fintech company are likely have higher liability and riskier asset portfolio than bank which mean that far bank also implement innovative information management technology and regulatory arbitrage excluded fintech threat bank activity the credit and liquidity risk realm seems limited moving the second key service provided bank regard payment which are strongly related the bank ability providing liquidity and risk management customer need liquidity are much better off they can pay directly from their deposit account indeed barba navaretti for this reason many nonbank financial intermediary well nonfinancial institution such company are recently emerging the payment service market taking advantage their large client base example for this mpesa mobile phonebased money transfer financing and microfinancing service launched vodafone developed country such kenya and tanzania lighter regulatory requirement better technology and more effective economy scope may three reason that allow fintech company compete with bank payment service offering higher interest payment despite their incapability neither earn the interest margin provided maturity transformation exploit the fractional reserve requirement also the implementation blockchain technology would boost the use digital payment and virtual currency further expanding market which nonfinancial nonbanks institution could flourish blockchain technology register any kind information permanently digital ledger which can not manipulated this guarantee the actual legitimacy the transaction with need for the state notary intermediate lastly bank are involved third major activity information processing the whole financial sector set upon information and information management where recent development related technology affected under three different aspect data storage and processing data transfer and data availability the information sector fintechs and bank take two diametrically opposed approach whereas the latter mostly exploit soft and relationshipbased information financial technology company function big data processing and the standardization information therefore any significant advancement lead fintech operator better production and distribution financial service regarding the production financial service massive quantity personal data gathered and analyzed nowadays thus large customer base and their behavior allow company provide the financial product that better suit each client need distribution financial service the driver change the possibility match both the demand and supply side the market easier and more efficient way thanks big data processing and the assessment customer profile the ability recognize pattern rapidly processing and analyzing huge data set what make machine learning and useful for financial application exploiting customer information thanks computer and algorithm help financial service provider developing tailormade service for their clientele however the collection and elaboration private information have legal and ethical implication both term cyber risk and privacy concern likely that regular restraint will set this regard and legit holder private data will have significant competitive advantage their competitor overall the activity brought upon bank that were analyzed this segment are feasible for fintech company expansion will the financial technology company exploit these three area interest whereas for bank will crucial the approach they will take either act and innovate wait for other nonfinancial company take their place how the fintech sector developing interest around the fintech world keep building investment into innovative financial technology company are steadily increasing well reaching astonishing billion with deal worldwide alone kpmg from the sector gone through path massive growth the graph below show figure total investment activity and fintech source pulse fintech global analysis investment fintech kpmg international data provided pitchbook better comprehend the magnitude such number should noted that fintech investment globally more than doubled during growth that been driven partly small number megadeals such the acquisition worldpay vantiv and the billion venture capital funding round raised ant financial the first semester the second half the same year saw significant number large deal well including private equity firm blackstone billion investment refinitiv and the billion acquisition prepaid card company blackhawk network silver lake jointly with capital partner while new startup sprang across emerging fintech subsectors more mature area like digital payment consolidated themselves for instance the danish payment firm net merged with germanbased concardis multibilliondollar deal the same time net also went through several other deal including the acquisition polandbased payment firm dotpay during growth hot topic for fintech company all around the globe with numerous fintechs any kind closing large financing campaign agreeing international partnership and carrying out their own acquisition propel global expansion activity matter fact there were numerous crosscountry deal stemming from the reason that company are eager find opportunity which could helpful better exploit their potential finesse their fintech branch the following picture show the global crossborder activity the last few year figure global crossborder activity fintech source pulse fintech global analysis investment fintech kpmg international such expansionary campaign were particularly common among digital challenger bank neobanks which have historically focused their domestic market rather than global scale several challenger bank took strategic move spread beyond their border including nubank brazil germany and numerous challenger bank based the united kingdom the aimed growth level these company been strong factor attraction for global investor for example chinese technology giant tencent joined insurance company allianz march invest million the emerging neobank help boost the bank growth international scale several others asian fintech firm have also aimed the use acquisition mean for scaling globally other than expanding globally many the abovestated digital bank also focused developing their service offering during moving from niche offering into wider range service similar those provided traditional bank keep competing effectively both regionally and globally such expansion service should continue main priority for neobanks either through internal development with the help strategic partnership along with digital bank many big tech player including alibaba and google are thoroughly working expand their cloudservices offering while some these firm are looking compete directly with financial institution others have mainly focused developing cloud and machine learning service enable traditional bank and other financial institution launch their own fintech solution enhance their internal efficiency many fintech company also made their own fintech investment september the izettle payment platform acquired paypal for billion while earlier the year workday purchased adaptive insight spending billion kpmg together with cloudservices development numerous fintech company have spotted the opportunity help enable bank comply and get ready for open banking that offering financial service which are heavily reliant data sharing customer management and digital identity management for instance the venture capital sector data republic raised million series funding during the last quarter with the support innov and singapore airline also the irish firm priviti helped australian bank comply with new open data regulation open banking will probably lead more competition established fintechs work increase their competitiveness and new fintech company are trying enter the market however growth will still the main issue with customer acquisition and scaling key challenge therefore likely that open banking will primarily cause for the development partnership that will allow fintechs growth sector that keep growing due enormous potential regtech that regulatory technology the regulatory framework going through renovation process the implementation mifid payment service directive psd general data protection regulation gdpr new ifrs standard and the benchmark regulation forced many organization adjust their operation moreover the fundamental review the trading book frtb and the central security depository regulation csdr are expected bring further change and beyond the ongoing regulatory change arised interest regtech during both from traditional corporates seeking better management their compliance obligation and from other kind investor while regtech investment primarily focused compliance management and risk exposure reduction there also increasing interest data and predictive analytics they are considered crucial for the future financial service and product highlighted the billion refinitiv deal also billion corporate venture capital investment fintech nearly doubled the previous high billion registered with the quantity corporate fintech deal increasing for the eighth consecutive year the growing corporate participation evidence that fintech becoming mainstream well competitive response the emerging threat fintech company that have scaled with both traditional financial institution and broad range company outside the financial service industry joining through investment and acquisition the growing maturity the sector also led some the most developed fintech company make their own investment part their drive expand either geographically product basis and some case partnering with financial service incumbent fact there expanding interest partnering with fintechs provide service addition increasing interest from corporates with internal fintech branch provide businesstobusiness service corporate client and other financial institution sum terrific year for fintech the sector keep growing global scale with deal outside the core market usa and china accounting for the total and venturecapitalbacked fintech unicorn worth total billion the following graph depicts investment across european country from showing that the sector growing outside core market well although the disparity between country still quite strong figure investment fintech company across country source fintech and banking friend foe barba navaretti also the are still the top market for deal with investment worth billion funding both new annual high insight will fintechs keep the pace during this year well according insight research partnership with mastercard start path very likely fact key driver fintech growth such record level deal and financing the emergence new global tech hub and favorable regulatory tailwind characterised the combination these factor position the fintech sector further digitize the customer journey make inroad new and adjacent market and collaborate across the industry moreover the development have lowered the barrier for market entry and enabled established recent entrant expand into new market while incumbent firm are feeling the pressure put fintech startup legacy infrastructure customer acquisition and business model then reasonable try predicting upcoming trend for the industry during fintech trend watch for the near future one magnet for fintech funding that seems destined continue artificial intelligence while there been lot discussion around potential data support that investor are excited about the impact could have across the financial service industry fintech company backed venturecapital fund have raised approximately capital across investment the funding growth understandable application are rapidly increasing popularity and proliferated into virtually all aspect financial service from personal finance and chatbots insurance although with varying level maturity also this year seen rise deal going regulatory technology startup regtech although still early for many bank embrace full automation expected overflow regulatory change the future will further incentivize adoption technology another global trend keep eye for open banking during number regulation were enacted europe including gdpr mifid open banking and the revised payment service directive psd two the most impactful are the open banking and the psd which have common goal requiring bank open apis customer data consumer are the biggest beneficiary open banking and psd the new regulation create choice through competition and establish consistency around security protocol protect consumer insight for instance startup like truelayer token and tink are using bbc model truelayer creates access point for developer build application top the data and authorized the fca for both access data aisp and access payment pisp account information service provider can aggregate wide range account information and payment initiation service provider can facilitate remote payment for consumer these service enable range fintech solution such alternative financing platform like clearbanc personal finance tool like plum and digital banking startup like monzo and starling globally bank are actively looking for way engage with and provide better service consumer leveraging the model laid out open banking one way achieve that the third upcoming trend considered the growing implementation financial technology for small and medium business smbs smbs are increasingly critical component for deal across the fintech ecosystem indeed firstly smbs remain underserved established player that target bigger corporate customer and additionally the core fintech largely been focused helping smbs obtain loan and financing digital banking startup neobanks have seen funding surge globally consumer drove earlyadoption this category which quickly spread smbs who seek for the same ondemand experience frictionless engagement and lowcost service that digital bank can provide scale revolut good example startup that entered the market focused service but responded the demand from smbs offering them tailored bank account therefore clear that consumer and smbs will enormously benefit this newly emerging focus the fintech industry the following figure sum what been discussed during this subchapter displaying each major area fintech and highlighting the potential trend that will shape for financial technology therefore the picture useful comprehend the still unexploited function that these area could serve the financial sector figure fintech trend watch for source wwwcbinsightscom expert opinion fintech due status potential disruptor the traditional banking system know opinion fintech are still vastly heterogeneous since many can not imagine yet the magnitude impact the banking industry and others think just new trend speculative bubble that will burst out very soon according christine lagarde managing director and chairwoman the international monetary fund imf individual and community have the capacity shape technological and economic future that work for all more importantly have responsibility make this happen such statement proof lagarde ability see beyond present while keeping mind what the past taught fact many people the past thought that process and innovation would have been the endgame for human being and society know while only the human race make good use such new technology and implement them our advantage therefore fintech should considered opportunity improve our current system instead considering threat our job place ian pollari global coleader fintech for kpmg international common opinion the topic recognizing possible application and function state the growing complexity cost and risk managing regulatory and legal obligation global basis persistent challenge for the financial service industry through the application and machine learning global and regional bank are able now gain access emerging regtech solution that can help them more accurately ass and monitor their compliance obligation across multiple market real time and with greater confidence backing the paper assumption that fintech going through process steady growth and sector that keep drawing the investor interest anton ruddenklau global coleader fintech for kpmg international said the fintech industry particularly resilient partly because the very strong participation corporates saw corporate investment more than double while corporates also drove large degree the activity and not just the traditional financial institution getting involved fintech deal even when other investor might more cautious heading into corporate participation will likely remain strong they are primarily investing for strategic reason assessment what the fintech industry currently look like given the world fintech report from capgemini and linkedin collaboration with the european financial management association efma which state most successful fintech firm have focused narrow function segment with high friction level those underserved traditional financial institution but have struggled profitably scale their own traditional financial institution have vast customer base and deep pocket but with legacy system holding them back therefore suggests that traditional bank and fintech company partner take advantage each one strength and achieve better outcome also many party involved the fintech industry are sure that tech giant will play fundamental role this race towards financial innovation according bain company indeed many the tech giant posse the ingredient success digital prowess large customer base organization well versed improving the customer experience and ample leeway extend their corporate brand into banking alibaba group cofounder and executive chairman jack instead make clear analysis what the future fintech look like and distinguishing the two major opportunity offer saying there are two big opportunity the future financial industry one online banking where all the financial institution online the other internet finance which purely led outsider shown these various opinion there not single view fintech still what everyone agrees that technology will eventually deeply affect the banking and financial system whole thus make change for the better professional service firm pwc conducted interesting global survey addressed executive from any sector questioning the threat related the rise fintech the result are displayed the following graph figure what are the threat related the rise fintech within your industry source pwc global fintech survey figure what percentage your business risk being lost standalone fintech company within year source pwc global fintech survey the last graph show bank related business are the most exposed the incoming fintech threat therefore reasonable think that they will more prone arrange partnership with fintech company order maintain their current position the market chapter the impact fintech traditional banking forward looking scenario the basel committee banking supervision within the bank for international settlement depicted five different scenario describing the potential effect the rise fintech bank effort ass what kind impact would fintech product and service have the banking industry bcbs such scenario would obviously differ depending the size geography the various actor also they are not considered mutually exclusive and comprehensive likely that the evoluion the banking industry may proceed combination the various scenario namely the better bank scenario the new bank scenario the distributed bank scenario the relegated bank scenario and the disintermediated bank scenario bcbs the main question addressed develop such forwardlooking scenario were which player lead the customer relationship that the user experience and interface and which player eventually provides the service and bear the risk for the former point the advance fintech innovation ended being kind battle for customer relationship and customer data outcome will define the actual future role bank another main consideration relates potential change bank business model and the various role traditional bank and other fintech company may play either owning the customer relationship supporting banking activity service provider the latter question instead involves who will ultimately responsible for the tradtional core banking service such lending managing risk and offering payment and investment service however the basel committee banking supervision conscious that future regulation provision will both shape and result from the depicted scenario and the manner which they interact the following each different scenario will described and analysed better comprehend where fintech innovation could lead the banking industry the near future also example how the innovative technology and process could implemented the banking industry will given the first scenario analysed the better bank one where the modernisation and digitisation incumbent financial insitutions brought upon this case the traditional bank innovate keep the core banking service and customer relationship implementing enabling technology transform their current business model traditional bank are usually under pressure both improve cost efficiency and customer relationship the same time however thanks their market knowledge and better investment capacity potential result that incumbent financial institution improve offering service and product exploiting new technology upgrading existing one bank adopt new technology provide value proposition that could not effectively offered with their current infrastructure the same technology adopted nonfinancial innovator can also put into action incumbent bank for instance biometry chatbots artificial intelligence might help bank develop sophisticated way for sustaining valueadded remote customer relationship while keeping transtactions safe and reducing fraud risk bcbs many incumbent bank have already introduced mobile payment service employed payment service offered third party innovative payment service would support the better bank scenario fact customer could believe that traditional bank would provide safer payment transaction than nonbanks alternative would however although there are early sign suggesting that incumbent player have increased investment digitisation and modernisation their strategy plan still seen what magnitude this scenario will actually dominant the second scenario considered the one new bank where incumbent financial instituions have been replaced challenger bank according this scenario traditional bank will not able adapt the incoming technologyenabled disruption and thus will supplanted neobanks bank established bigtechs with fully digitalized banking platform the new bank will provide costeffective and innovative banking service through the implementation advanced technology and may receive banking license under existing regulatory system may have traditional financial institution partner neobanks such the german the chinese webank moved away from the branchcentred customer relationship model thanks their technologybased relationship model and may able exploit innovative process and instrument lower cost more quickly and uptodate manner compared incumbent player due the fact that neobanks are not constrained legacy infrastructure that said there are evidence suggesting that the current agglomerate challenger bank reached such market power for the new bank scenario the predominant one then the distributed bank scenario described this situation there fragmentation financial service among specialised fintech firm and incumbent financial institution financial service become progressively modularised incumbent bank can still capture enough market share survive several new business rise provide specialised service focusing specific niche without attempting become universal retail bank such business may decide not compete for ownership the whole customer relationship while incumbent bank challenge each other both provide core banking service and own the customer relationship the distributed bank scenario the delivery financial service shared across various party with bank and fintech firm operating joint venture partner other structure therefore bank are more prone offer service and product from thirdparty supplier order satisfy the customer whose expectation term transparency and quality have soared also consumer may use various financial service provider instead using only one financial partner bcbs the increasing adoption open apis application programming interface evidence that this scenario already playing out some market other element signalling the likeliness this scenario are the increasing partnership between online lending platform and traditional bank the growth innovative digital payment system emerging from joint venture between bank and fintech firm and the steadily increasing presence roboadvisors automated investment advisory service that are provided fintech company through bank described next the relegated bank scenario which incumbent bank are considered commodity that provide service while the direct customer relationship owned other financial service provider that fintech company bigtechs both fintech and bigtech company operate frontend customer platform perform various financial service from heterogeneous group supplier they also take advantage incumbent bank banking license offer core banking service uncertain the relegated bank would bear the risk attached these activity may depend the contract stipulated along with the fintech bigtech firm this specific scenario frontend customer platform fully exploit cloud computing artifical intelligence and big data through various configuration making heavy use both connectivity and data gathering improve the customer experience innovative way this point the entity managing such platform have enough resource compete with incumbent for owning the customer relationship therefore bank are relegated mere commoditised function provider carrying out basic service such risk management and operational process playing the role service provider the abovestated platform that operate customer relationship currently the relegated bank scenario seem unlikely due extreme assumption however there are few example modularised financial service that may arise the near future for instance alternative payment platform have experienced steady growth lately leading bank provide back office operation aid fundamental area such compliance and treasury function while fintech company will directly interact with the customer also arising online lending platform could extend their array service offered beyond lending become intermediary between traditional financial institution and customer which case incumbent bank would keep existing just provide operational and funding mechanism required other party another example sustaining the likeliness the relegated bank scenario given the instant messaging application wechat china exploit customer data provide their customer the financial product and service that better suit them moreover wechat linked the licensed banking platform webank eventually relegating bank product and risk management only last the five scenario analysed the disintermatied bank one this case incumbent bank are longer playing significant role the financial industry customer interact directly with financial service provider with need for any intermediary bank are therefore replaced leaner and more agile platform based stateoftheart technology which effectively secure direct matching end user depending their financial requirement borrowing raising fund making payment customer have more direct approach when choosing financial service and their provider this scenario justifying the inutility intermediary bank however they also may exposed higher risk when performing transaction bearing the whole responsibility for them their own for instance the peertopeer lending industry common customer would the lender borrower depending their need therefore exposing themselves either credit risk for the former conduct risk for the latter this extreme scenario seems far reality the near future however some example component the disintermadiated bank scenario are already happening such example include cryptocurrencies which ensure value transfer and payment without the need involving incumbent bank intermediary just using public distributed ledger technology dlt their adoption daily use base however struggle become reality cryptocurrencies have been constrained several factor such price volatility antimoneylaundering issue aml due the anonymity the transaction and scarcity scalability another example sustaining the likeliness this scenario given lending platform which have employed extremely innovative and trustworthy credit scoring process nonetheless lender market share currently relatively small most country and many peertopeer platform have adopted different business model which relies the involvement incumbent bank and investment fund rather than retail investor origin overall each the five forwardlooking scenario hereby described and analysed extreme while very likely that the future will provide mix these scenario both fintech firm and bank will own different part the customer relationship while simoultaneously offering modularised financial service and product for back office operation giving foundation this assumption the case lending club marketplace lending company which display three the five scenario taken into consideration fact incumbent bank that exploit lending club platform issue and price consumer loan for own balance sheet could considered distributed bank since the incumbent keep owning the customer relationship but allocates the revenue and process with the fintech company bcbs lending club match customer loan with retail traditional investor well thanks the support regulated traditional bank which included the transaction order make the loan issuing easier such operation the incumbent bank role could characterised relegated bank scenario various marketplace lender instead display the disintermediated bank scenario due the fact that they enable direct peertopeer lending without involving any bank during process recapitulate close impossible that single scenario will reflect the whole banking industry situation market differ significantly for size need and jurisdiction therefore blend the five scenario the most likely emerge the future following graph that summarizes the five scenario and key player where red represents incumbent bank purple indicates new player grey fintech company and blue bigtechs such google amazon shown the first scenario traditional bank would retain their current role both service provider and owner the customer relationship undergoing modernisation process the next case depicted new bank are characterized solid digital user experience and overall digitization their service then the distributed bank scenario presented where both incumbent fintech company and bigtechs are involved providing financial service and offering digital customer interface the relegated bank scenario only differs the customer interface which built and managed solely fintech company bigtechs lastly the disintermadiated bank scenario displayed both service and interface are provided fintechs bigtechs with focus both peertopeer lending and digital ledger technology figure the five forwardlooking scenario source bcbs implication fintech development for bank and bank supervisor february opportunity and risk emerging from fintech stated the previous section the banking industry might undergo period radical innovation and disruption the upcoming future due the rise financial technology company and the increasing number bigtechs approaching the financial service industry such development will entail the presence both new opportunity and risk for the whole banking sector therefore bank supervisor should lookout for opportunity improve both safety wellbeing and financial stability while surveilling over ongoing practice which might excessively unintendedly hamper enhancing innovation the financial sector meanwhile remaining alert ensuring the safety and health the banking system bcbs the potential benefit embedded financial technology implementation are several and they would improve the financial service experience all user such benefit include better financial inclusion underserved consumer would easier reached the reduction transaction cost more transparency the cost product and service and increased efficiency both spending and budgeting process altogether these benefit could lead improved customer experience supplying easier comprehension product and term such opportunity will heavily depend the development the technology which would empower them example considerable opportunity might include enhanced banking service with the inclusion fintech company the financial service industry bank could helped improve their range traditional service and product provided for instance they may supply bank with roboadvisors improve the customer experience related investing also partnership with fintech could result more efficiency for the incumbent bank financial inclusion thanks the implementation innovative technology financial service are now available remote location well helping the growth small economy through microfinancing plan and enhanced access credit moreover mobile device could the tool help digital finance broadening use scaling and reducing cost thus financial service could offered wider array people with greater reliability speed and efficiency improved banking process the use cryptography and more interoperable system would decrease the likeliness error and may grant run operation more secure environment inferior transaction cost and highspeed banking service fintech company could accelerate transfer and payment while lowering their cost thanks their innovative technology potential improvement financial stability due intensified competition the banking service market could eventually disrupted the incoming new player challenging incumbent bank lowering the systemic risk attached actor systemic size fsb regulation technology regtech financial regulation increasing worldwide the employment regtech could significantly ease compliance financial institution for instance application could automatize regulatory and compliance process other than smoothing cooperation between different sector and jurisdiction significantly enhancing the compliance and regulatory framework despite the many benefit stemming from fintech safety and soundness the financial system should keep being priority for both bank and bank supervisor therefore they should continue focusing risk management monitoring and supervision over the newly unfolding innovation the financial service market fundamental however that such supervision and regulation must not hamper the implementation innovative beneficial technology along with the benefit applying innovation the banking industry however come new risk fintech embeds various crosssectoral risk indeed most these threat are featured almost each the five scenario previously described and are illustrated beneath strategic risk profitability individual bank put risk the swift transition bank service fintech company new player are capable applying innovation efficiently and provide customer with cheaper and more tailored service than incumbent financial institution could lose considerable slice their market share along with part their profit margin growing difficulty reaching compliance requirement the increasing interaction between bank and fintech company through the exchange product and service may result lack transparency the transaction processing and who hold compliance responsibility such situation could lead increased conduct risk for incumbent player since they could held liable for the fintech partner misconduct consumer encounter loss regulatory requirement are not reached compliance risk related data privacy the surging use big data provide better financial service and product could lead compliance risk concerning data privacy rule the fierce contention for owning the customer relationship may lead inappropriate exploitation personal data outsourcing risk more party are included the supplying financial service and product ambiguity related the accountability the player involved could spread out increasing the probability operational mishap therefore financial institution will face the challenge monitoring and managing outsourced activity conducted third party moreover incumbent will have adjust their operational control process order assure the safety both the bank and customer higher operational risk the growth fintech heighten operational risk both systemic and idiosyncratic level the financial market player become more interdependent level failure the information technology infrastructure could easily lead systemic crisis moreover the increasing presence fintech company the banking industry result more complex system composed novel actor which may have little expertise risk management for the idiosyncratic dimension system inherited traditional bank may not adjustable enough simply obsolete with respect the one owned fintech firm thus incumbent would increase their use third party provide uptodate service which may lead higher risk related data protection money laundering cybercrime privacy issue and customer tutelage additionally bank may have sustain fintech partner financial distress due their common involvement the supply chain financial service cyberrisk the wide adoption technology ease interconnection between different player and sector require the banking system increase control and innovate regulatory system may more exposed cyberthreats putting risk huge quantity sensitive data such threat highlight the urgency for financial institution fintech company and supervisor update their monitoring process and stress the importance withstanding cyberrisk liquidity and volatility risk customer are facilitated changing saving account for the sake greater return thanks new technology and neobanks which are rapidly lowering fee with the objective enlarging their customer base while the increased competitiveness could improve efficiency could also worsen customer loyalty and raise deposit volatility resulting notable liquidity risk for bank eventually the following table provided the basil committee banking supervision show the main risk for each the five scenario analysed the previous subchapter assessing their likelihood and impact the whole society
