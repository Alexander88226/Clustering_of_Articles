multibilliondollar banksbhcs the larger small business loan market loan million appears deteriorating among the possible explanation are giant bank are concentrating credit card and credit line market

bank participation local business market after merger acquisition passive rather than active table loan rate charged commercial bank small business loan small business loan rate charged bank are affected many factor the size the market and thus the level competition the credit quality the borrower the cost extending and administering small business loan and the cost money the lender the variable affecting the rate include the risk the loan loan size collateral commitment and many other loan underwriting term the federal reserve board began collecting information about the loan rate charged commercial bank the late and subsequently instituted several major revision data collection and reporting format statistical release provides information the rate charged bank corporate and small business customer for the first week february may august and november the year small loan rate are used proxy for small business loan rate effective weighted rate charged bank are reported risk

but with reference the repricing period the use collateral commitment and the base rate used for adjustable loan are also reported for each loan group the release difficult generalize about the rate spread between loan different size and different risk group reported release because discussed previously small business loan market are made hundred even thousand submarkets characterized the size the geographic area which different type borrower and lender participate table provides overview the loan term charged commercial bank business loan different size large and small domestic bank the following observation can made about the term bank loan small firm most small business loan are made adjustablerate loan arrangement that the rate are adjustable over the term loan the basis change the base index rate which adjusts market rate adjust what this implies that the cost borrowing small business change the interest rate the capital and credit market change small firm not know the precise cost borrowing anymore special tabulation the rate loan size and repricing period have been made available the small business administration office advocacy moreover since large loan make major share the overall business loan market the estimated share weighted loan value provided release reveal limited information about the characteristic small business loan fact would most revealing look the variation the rate charged small firm special tabulation using simple average rather than valueweighted average were provided the federal reserve board the office advocacy for information the percentagesshare loan with collateral precommitment and using the prime the base rate econometric estimate for the rate determination would the only way identify the significant factor explaining the

business loan under million and basis point between large domestic bank and small bank the united state most small business loan are made with the prime rate the base rate since the prime may not adjust promptly change the market rate especially when the market rate are falling the rate spread between small business loan rate and the prime may differ significantly from the spread rate charged the bank best customer difficult estimate the rate spread over the base rate the index rate that change the market rate change the convention that most small business loan have rate spread rate premium percent above the base rate however the spread over the rate charged the bank best customer are much higher chart summarizes the rate spread between small business loan for two loan size under

small business loan and the prime puzzle hard imagine adjustableloan formula with negative spread over the base stipulated the loan contract for this loan size several explanation are offered loan made larger bank did not use the prime the base rate would revealing know how the actual rate charged the time borrowing compared with the rate charged the basis the formula the loan contract there incentive for lender use teaser rate rate below the rate based the adjustable rate formula when competition for borrower strong this practice likely when market rate are rising are expected rise the near future for their larger loan prime rate used larger bank are lower than the market average during this period falling interest rate large bank used teaser rate rate lower than the rate determined the formula the rate paid the prime customer are basis point below the average prime rate this period fluctuation the spread between the prime and primecustomer rate were also observed during this period possibly indication rigidity the prime rate the spread between the smallest loan and the rate paid prime customer were percent iii the repricing period range from zero day twothirds small business loan have zero repricing period that rate are adjustable soon the base rate change compared with fixed interval adjustment such monthly quarterly etc rate premium over rate with shorter repricing period were observed only for loan with overday repricing period most small business loan were made with collateral conclude there still much learn about the rate spread between the rate for small business loan and the prime the primecustomer rate information about the rate spread loan contract might more useful than information about the actual rate paid borrower the time borrowing econometric study factor affecting the rate rate spread using individual loan data would certainly most revealing the prime become more common the base rate the index for small business loan than the rate charged the bank best customer been commonly assumed the rate charged the bank best customer are usually below prime especially when money market rate are low some percent the loan have repricing period than day likely that this refers loan other than business credit card which show huge increase the number loan originated but not the dollar amount competition and performance small business bank loan market the united state the degree competition the small business loan market the united state differs widely because different degree participation local market regional and national lender large national and superregional lender enter the local market through two channel mass marketing through all public medium and relationship lending through the development direct relationship between bank branch officer and small business borrower the productsservices marketed through the former channel will generalpurpose loan with limited requirement how and where the loan fund are used loan application are evaluated the basis the borrower andor the business credit history well other business financials the latter channel for specialpurpose lending specific knowledge the borrower well the loan purpose and the characteristic collateral are required specific loan covenant might required and effective monitoring process used assure loan performance course there are other loan type that use combination these two financing channel difficult evaluate the performance small business loan market providing financing small firm reasonable price because the difficulty defining the market from the statistical information collected the issue further complicated limited information available for statistical analysis purpose competition and performance the small business loan market the united state will briefly discussed under three heading the emerging nationwide market for credit line and credit card for small business competition larger small business loan market and interest
