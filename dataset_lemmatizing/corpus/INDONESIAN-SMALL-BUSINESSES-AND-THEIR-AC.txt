with respect formality mies are mainly unregistered business activity found informal sector whereas all firm from the category are registered have permanent address and they pay tax with respect woman engagement business owner entrepreneur they are more prevalent smaller enterprise than large company and among msmes the number tiny enterprise mies whose owner entrepreneur are woman far more than the number especially compared the number for the following two main reason first according the nature the activity type business item made the pattern method production applied mies not really need advanced machine and modern and expensive production tool and highly educated worker indonesia generally mies are activity that generate low income just enough live survive such roadside food stall tiny shop that sell daily essential small meal snack production street vendor and handicraft second also because that activity mies not need special space many married woman from low incomepoor household rural area their own small business activity their home front their house small shop handicraft they can more easily share their time between doing business and conducting their household duty tambunan literature review httpijbmerorg page international journal business management and economic review vol issn literature growth barrier facing msmes developing country quite large which includes many journal article official report and working paper with crosscountry evidence beck beck beck and demirguckunt beck ayyagari abdulsaleh and worthington kuntchev adb and wang there are also many country case study for example study from chowdhury ahmed and chowdhury aziz and siddique hoque and islam hossain constraint facing msmes bangladesh they show that lack financial support serious obstacle facing many especially the country different from and also from certain extent most bangladesh not have access bank instead they depend heavily loan from informal source the same evidence also found india and pakistan study such kshetri and khandke show that experienced variety problem that make many them mostly traditional enterprise difficult survive which include lack fund only few have access bank because owner most not have valuable asset used loan collateral and their business are often considered unprofitable bank indonesia tambunan identified development constraint and again lack access formal source funding their main barrier grow other serious problem facing many this country are difficulty marketing distribution and the procurement raw material meanwhile china shen yin and jiang among yet many others also come with the same conclusion that general experience financing difficulty which are partly due lack access credit from formal source such banking and other nonbank financial institution africa finding from case study country such ghana south africa and mozambique suggest obviously that only msmes with easy access finance from formal source have great opportunity grow quartey abor and biekpe abor and quartey and dinhucha gon alves fumo and jose chiappetta jabbour these study found that access bank credit hampered various factor such collateral requirement poor knowledge financial provider strict eligibility criterion lack knowledge about loan and bureaucratic criterion conclusion what emerges from the literature review that msmes developing country face various constraint however the general finding that lack fund their main serious problem especially although many country studied their government have tried help funding providing special subsidized guaranteed credit scheme and making various regulation that the banking sector give more opportunity for obtain credit only minority them have access bank other word most the that need additional capital are still dependent informal source there are three reason often mentioned the literature namely the absence collateral business are considered unprofitable because they only serve the local market that most consumer are from lowincome poor household and most not have good record their business performance financial condition object the study this study attempt been made examine the impact msmes financing policy indonesia msmes access financing from formal source more specifically the study had httpijbmerorg page international journal business management and economic review vol issn three main objective namely examine the main constraint faced msmes their access financing from formal source and iii various alternative credit scheme available for msmes the country research methodology data source the approach used this study descriptive and analytical nature and based secondary data collected from three official source namely the ministry cooperative and sme bank indonesia the central bank indonesia and national statistic agency bps for the purpose analysis simple statistical tool like percentage and volume are used empirical analysis recent development said before msmes play crucial role indonesian economic development there are million unit see table around all firm all sector national data show that the total workforce work this business group especially are very important for many low income poor household either their main source income additional secondary income seasonal income during the dry season rural area can found that many poor farm household men work rice plantation field while woman some simple income generating activity not seek profit but merely supplement family income such mse activity not only help them survive have decent life but also they help the government effort alleviate poverty because indonesia doe not have unemployment benefit many developed country the existence very important indeed table total enterprise size category indonesia unit description period mies source state ministry cooperative and sme wwwdepkopgoid and bps wwwbpsgoid one characteristic msmes indonesia also evident other country that their contribution gdp formation always far smaller than their contribution job creation however because their number are far more than the number their gdp share greater than the contribution gdp can seen from figure based constant market price the contribution msmes gdp recorded around this structure gdp size firm that the greater gdp share msmes than that simply because the number than total number firm compared that msmes that reach give clear impression that the level productivity per worker per firm the msmes group very low this can understood because msmes are dominated mies httpijbmerorg page international journal business management and economic review vol issn which consist traditional trade activity like street vendor various service provider and traditionalhome industry which manufacture simple and low quality product with low degree mechanization and not use advanced technology see again table figure real gdp share msmes and indonesia and miessesmesmsmesles source state ministry cooperative and sme wwwdepkopgoid and bps wwwbpsgoid main growth constraint other developing country msmes indonesia face many problem that make many them especially difficult develop even maintain their business although there data available support very possible that the number experiencing many obstacle rural area far more than those urban area city simply because the farther away from the center government and the center economic and financial activity the hope for them get assistance from the government and access funding and market the number the constraint the magnitude the seriousness the obstacle faced msmes may differ between region between rural and urban area between sector between msmes manufacturing industry and those agriculture and subsectors between msmes food industry and their counterpart garment industry even between msmes the same sector subsector region however there are number problem commonly experienced many msmes anywhere and any sector namely limited fund finance their daily production activity and expand their production capacity difficulty transportation and procurement raw material and other input needed difficulty getting skilled worker with relatively inexpensive wage unable use advanced technology limited access uptodate and comprehensive information complicated bureaucratic procedure especially dealing with business and other businessrelated permit and requirement regulated the government regarding many aspect such clean production product quality and safety and government marketing distribution httpijbmerorg page international journal business management and economic review vol issn macroeconomic policy price policy labor policy foreign trade policy monetary policy fiscal policy which resulted market distortion all these problem the literature are referred external obstacle msmes growth with limited fund the most serious constraint for many msmes especially developing country abdulsaleh and worthington tambunan based data obtained from national survey the manufacturing industry conducted and bps table show their main constraint can seen limited fund indeed the main problem experienced many them the second most serious problem marketing difficulty various form such many them are unable compete with imported good difficulty getting strategic location and building rental are too expensive the third most serious problem lack costliness raw material table manufacturing main constraint indonesia and constraint lack capital marketing difficulty difficulty getting raw material too expensive other main constraint high labor cost difficulty finding worker with appropriate skill transportation distribution obstacle high price short supply energy total respondent source bps while the result the survey bps show that out the total million experienced serious difficulty increase their production volume expand their production capacity order meet increasing market demand even stay business figure show the type problem experienced which include difficulty financing marketing and getting raw material the number entrepreneur experiencing these difficulty however differs according industry group for example the food industry the are entrepreneur experiencing serious difficulty and around them said that their main constraint find external source funding while the paper and paper good industry only about entrepreneur having difficulty said the same figure type difficulty faced manufacturing indonesia httpijbmerorg page international journal business management and economic review vol issn transportationlabor costskilled workersenergyothersraw materialsmarketingfinancing source bps msmes financing the demandside not easy know exactly how many the approximately million msmes indonesia need fund from outside source who have ever applied for loan bank other formal financial institution however the national survey manufacturing although only survey not census and only the manufacturing sector may provide clue regarding the source capital reveals from the survey three category namely fully financed own money respondent the total surveyed partially funded external source respondent and the rest respondent who are wholly dependent fund from external source those who wholly partly used fund from external source only small percentage them fully used bank loan there are more respondent who used fund from nonbank such saving and loan cooperative credit union pawnshop multi financeleasing company microfinance institution from informal source such friend relative money lender payment advance from consumer debt the supplier raw material payment raw material after good have been sold many owner especially mies prefer informal source fund because they can get the money they needed immediately with administration cost although interest rate that they pay are often much higher than commercial bank rate bps the supplyside figure provides general picture about financial service provider msmes indonesia the financial service provider can grouped into two category namely bank and nonbanks the bank category can divided further into two subcategories namely rural bank well known indonesia bank perkreditan rakyat bpr and commercial bank then each subcategory can distinguished between sharia islamic bank and conventional bank

httpskeuangankontancoidnewsinilahperusahaanmodalventurayangterdaftardiojk many other ministry also have their own credit scheme for msmes their sector such the ministry agriculture ssrg kups kpenrp the ministry maritime affair and fishery kkpe the ministry communication and information bpti the ministry stateowned enterprise pkbl the ministry finance kumk the ministry public work and public housing ppp and the ministry forestry and environment klh finally the past few year fintech peer peer lending grown rapidly indonesia which can hood alternative source financing for msmes data from the financial service authority ojk show that per october loan have reached trillion loan not need collateral and the loan ceiling can reach idr million per january there are fintech company based lending one them amartha mikro fintek which the end had distributed loan more than billion msmes mostly the trade and agricultural sector other company include drrupiahcom cekayacom taralitecom credycoid duitpintarcom and modalco main reason for lack access both data the total number msme bank credit account for the period well the result the survey manufacturing shown above give clear impression that although there are already many formal source funding for small business both from bank and nonbanks only small number msmes indonesia have used these source there are several reason from the survey manufacturing reveals that many them were unable lend money from bank because they did not have valuable asset used collateral many family rural area who run small business have large house and land obtained from their parent but certificate that their land and house can not accepted bank collateral bps while other respondent said that they dont dare borrow because high interest especially for those whose production are seasonal such the craft industry tourist area that make various kind souvenir that only highly demanded during the holiday season those who make child uniform that only have many buyer when new school period about start also many mse owner not dare borrow from bank because their sale average per month are not much uncertain there are also many respondent confessed that they have difficulty fulfilling credit application procedure their proposal were rejected this can understood because most particularly the owner have only elementary school education even though they can httpijbmerorg page international journal business management and economic review vol issn read they have difficulty understanding all kind requirement the credit application form therefore the government often asked for various party such ngo university official related ministry even the bank themselves assist owner applying for credit there are also some respondent whose limited information about credit application procedure their main reason for not borrowing money from bank often ministry commercial bank issued special credit scheme for msmes but without extensive socialization about the scheme let alone msmes remote location isolated rural area many msmes city urban area are also not aware existing funding scheme special designed for them that they actually can easily get because without collateral indeed often recommended that bank government department that have msmes funding scheme actively look for identify potential borrower not just wait until meme come them conclusion this indonesian case study show that even though the government tried make easier for msmes gain access official source financing including providing number special designed credit scheme for msmes such kur only very few msmes that ever borrowed money from bank nonbank financial institution course there are many msmes who were initially not interested borrow money from bank for various reason but for those who want get loan from the bank not all them have managed get them for various reason including the absence collateral high interest rate and their proposal were rejected perhaps the important message this study that making many credit scheme specific for msmes and the active participation the banking sector msmes funding not guarantee the success the government policy msmes financing there must also done the demand side such mentoring for prospective borrower preparing all administrative requirement for loan application and perhaps more importantly making easier for msmes owner arrange land certificate used collateral indeed recent year the indonesian government distributed many land certificate for farmer and other villager who own land but are not certified this effort must continue and must comprehensive all rural area indonesia reference abdulsaleh worthington small and mediumsized enterprise financing review literature
