processing and sharing due micro small and medium enterprise second payment system directive msmes psd executive summary lack credit data one the major obstacle individual and msmes financing developing country despite the insufficient credit data msmes and individual generate vast amount noncredit digitized data daily msmes and individual are leaving vast digital footprint and data trail mobile and online payment platform social network and other nonbanking platform such online record keeping and trade transaction financial institution are starting mine these vast amount digitized alternative data aid their decisionmaking process and promote financial inclusion traditional and nontraditional lender are now leveraging alternative data including transactional payment data behavioral data and social medium data determine capacity and willingness repay loan alternative data also being used provide granularity customer preference and behavior which can help designing new financial product and service credit reporting service provider have also begun adopting alternative data for credit worthiness evaluation the use alternative data credit reporting can promote access credit for borrower with credit file while can also complement traditional data for borrower with thin credit file notwithstanding the benefit alternative data there are various challenge that impede the adoption alternative data for credit reporting the challenge include lack enabling legal and regulatory environment difficulty verifying identity data subject multiplicity and fragmentation data source which often result inaccurate incomplete information and the opaqueness alternative scoring methodology absence supportive legal environment the potential constraining the use alternative data for credit scoring the use certain data attribute might prohibited some the alternative data source such social medium are susceptible inaccuracy might difficult authenticate the identity the account owner emerging market the use alternative data also hampered the low level digitization government and private sector service such company registry and tax filing are not digitized resulting vast amount potential alternative data being not captured the adoption alternative data for financial and other sensitive decision also brings the fore additional risk that should mitigated manner that ensures the expanded and sustained use alternative data responsibly key risk include data inaccuracy the use data that based uninformed consumer consent potential for discrimination and heightened exposure cyber risk some category alternative data such social medium data end being used crsps without the data subject consent thus exposing the firm potential legal risk social medium data usually not originally collected and consented used for credit reporting purpose the use alternative data also susceptible risk discrimination some the data attribute that are collected including race color sex and marital can result discriminatory scoring practice unmonitored finally the credit reporting ecosystem expands include the new player such alternative lender and other data provider the risk cyber threat increase against this background this policy guide provides practical policy recommendation how country can adopt and leverage the use alternative data for credit reporting while mitigating the risk inherent the use such data the matrix below provides list impediment and the iccr policy recommendation policy topic impediment for financial inclusion main recommended action for policymakers regulator and policy maker should issue guidance how alternative data may sourced and processed policy maker and regulator should the unique consider following identifier passport for individual implementing option number number smaller msmes alternative such social tax security identification financial number generated regulator financial institution passportid the owner the unregistered msmes legal entity identification lei number for larger msmes company regulator should the extent possible provide access national lack clarity alternative data and how this data should treated absence unique identifier passport financial etc that link collected from various source particular individual msme data improving the availability and accuracy information lack digitized public information unavailability poor data quality lack digital footprint msmes transaction expanding credit limited coverage information sharing database purpose for validation policy maker should ensure that data managed governmental agency digitized and where appropriate shared efficient and costeffective manner with crsps policy maker should promote the development and provision access open data system and standard for msmes where case regulatorspolicy maker promote collection and processing automation applicable should data digital platform awareness policy maker should promote use through digital consumer financial and offering incentive msmes lender and consumer literacy policy maker should promote digitization service relevant governmental agency such tax filing and company registration encourage digital record msmes and individual regulator should consider reviewing regulation require all financial service provider including nonbank financial institution report credit data and other relevant information crsps regulator should promote open credit fair information sharing crsps competitive and case inefficient market policy maker should ass the feasibility establishing credit registrydatabank promote information sharing policy maker regulator should explore the feasibility regulating oversight new credit reporting service provider high minimum loan size threshold for business loan data crsps enabling responsible cross border data exchange difference national law and regulation cross data sharing border inconsistent cross border data sharing and enforcement law lack harmonized core data set policy maker should consider reducing eliminating minimum threshold for reporting financial commitment crsps policy maker and regulator should coordinate and collaborate the international through standard setting body like develop cross border data sharing standard border information regulation cross level and law policy maker and regulator should work towards harmonization data protection and privacy relation alternative data the absence harmonized law policy maker should consider adopting law that allow for the export personal data other jurisdiction only condition that either the jurisdiction where the data exported adequate level data protection law place other instrument such standard contractual clause binding corporate can rule compensate for the lack legal framework the importing country the level policy maker domestic and should international that attribute collected crsps make difficult compare applicant across jurisdiction lack ability identify msmes different due andor standardized identification system regulatory barrier innovation jurisdiction inconsistent nonagree encourage adoption harmonized set data attribute shared domestically and across border core policy maker should ass the feasibility implementing the global legal entity identifier variant for individual such idd order address crossborder usage and sharing data policy maker and regulator should collaborate the development principle responsible innovation policy maker and regulator should ass implementing utilizing regulatory innovation tool such innovation hub sandbox feasibility the data policy maker should ensure alternative data should collected and processed lawfully cost efficient consent mechanism accuracy where necessary and alternative data reliability consumer access and ability correct their information well request the deletion data where appropriate consumer should also able object the processing their information and should accorded opportunity transfer their data any other service provider cybersecurity risk assessment are balancing integrity innovation and competition data privacy consumer protection and cyber security inadequate privacy law inadequate transparency disclosure regime and potential for alternative data usage that form unacceptable discrimination result restrictive lack consent adequate lawsregulations growth cyber risk and potential impact global financial system embedded management procedure participant into the overall risk and industry policy group discriminate the use alternative data doe not against unfairly that protected adopt participant measure that predictiveness alternative data tested and verified and ensure should and maintaining pricing transparency lack pricing riskbased industry participant implement clear process that guarantee consumer receive all the relevant information the data collection policy maker should ensure that lender adopt risk based pricing methodology for borrower benefit from lower lending cost introduction and background background the recognizes that micro small and medium enterprise msmes play major role economic development particularly emerging country study indicate that formal smes contribute percent employment and percent gdp developing economy these number are significantly higher when taking into account the estimated contribution msmes operating the informal sector the informal sector present one the greatest challenge the msme space with issue that well beyond finance promoting msmes development important priority the context the international development agenda and given the critical importance job creation following the latest financial crisis the estimated million msmes emerging market only million are formal enterprise access finance remains key constraint msmes development emerging economy according the msme finance gap there are million formal smes developing country which estimated percent not have access formal institutional loan overdraft despite need for one the estimated financing gap for formal smes trillion annually the finance gap far bigger when considering the smes the informal sector the estimated potential demand for smes the informal sector stand trillion annually the proportional size the finance gap percentage gdp varies widely across region and particularly daunting subsaharan africa and south asia lack credit data often cited one the major obstacle msmes financing developing country this problem heightened for economic agent operating informal sector since most their business cash transaction which most instance unrecorded due lack financial awareness most developing country the entrepreneur behind the msmes especially those operating informal market tend have thin credit file which affect their ability access personal credit from formal financial institution the lack sufficient andor high quality data and other creditrelated information for decisionmaking also limit access finance for micro small and mediumsize enterprise msmes and especially for those operating some level informality most msmes not have accounting package record their transaction and generate credible financial statement and projection very often the only standard information that available ass their creditworthiness the personal credit file paperbased record the entrepreneur which expensive access and process and limited scale digital age business are getting access large volume structured and unstructured data which can used for decision making daily basis estimated that the world stock digital data will double every two year through fueled the phenomenal intersection and growth mobile big data and electronic payment the financial system already generates digitized data that considered alternative data such information includes mobile and online banking transaction digital payment and automated utility payment many instance alternative data being created outside the financial system every time msmes and their customer use cloudbased service browse the internet use their mobile phone engage social medium use ecommerce platform ship package manage their receivables payable and recordkeeping online they create digital footprint data collected through mobile phone and telecommunication call record airtime top ups and payment transaction are also exponentially increasing data trail including for low income consumer developing and emerging market traditional and nontraditional lender have option mine this realtime and use for credit granting decision making lender can use the alternative data determine capacity and willingness repay loan using alternative data enhance credit reporting thus represents large opportunity expand access finance individual and msmes lender may leverage alternative data such information from utility retail lending behavioral data online platform and mobile application reach new customer segment including micro and small enterprise beyond being used provide access credit alternative data may offer valuable granularity customer preference and behavior that can help design new financial product and service encourage positive financial behavior and support the real sector linking financing energy commerce health other sector notwithstanding the benefit the use new type alternative data for financial and other sensitive decision brings the fore additional risk resultantly authority should balance promoting the benefit the expanded use alternative data while ensuring that inherent risk are managed while beneficial alternative data might come from unreliable source and might not the desired quality inconsistency incompleteness resulting financial exclusion data subject the high level principle digital financial inclusion recognize the role that the use alternative data for credit reporting can play promoting access credit for individual and msmes the informal sector against this background the objective this paper not direct adoption prescriptive legislative provision but provide guidance for country use considering adoption and use alternative data enhance credit reporting selection criterion topic and policy this policy guide brings together evidence and consensusbased policy recommendation and guidance that can used support four policy area that are deemed important promote the use alternative data enhance credit reporting the policy area are improving availability and accuracy information expanding credit information sharing iii enabling cross border data exchange and balancing integrity innovation and competition order ensure completeness the guide this report also considered policy related data privacy consumer protection and cyber security far they relate the use alternative data for credit reporting issue the policy area were defined preserving data privacy and consumer protection balancing optin and opt out model vii safeguarding cyber security and data integrity and viii maintaining pricing transparency for policy vii this report adopted the policy proposal advanced the gpfi financial consumer protection law fcpl subgroup discussion paper data protection and privacy for alternative data organization the policy guide the rest the document organized follows section includes discussion the definition category and source alternative data and section cover the challenge impediment and policy opportunity using alternative data and the policy proposal finally section provides some conclusion and recommendation this policy guide policy are organized into the eight policy area highlighted above the policy guide contains key content and guideline for relevant policy within each topic area definition category and data source alternative data definition although generally agreed that the term alternative data can used interchangeably with nontraditional data there been consensus the single definition alternative data most definition take descriptive rather than normative approach defining alternative data the cfpb the other hand define alternative data any data that are not traditional lexis delineates alternative data include information that not found traditional credit report and this includes public record business association professional license education and address history oliver wyman definition alternative data introduces two dimension that financial information and predictive power they defined alternative data providing additional financial payment information consumer otherwise information with predictive power such information includes utility telecommunication rental asset record alternative lending payment and demand deposit account information the gpfi priority paper defines alternative data generic term that designates the massive volume data that generated the increasing use digital tool and information system for the purpose credit reporting the iccr view alternative data merely serving describe way collect and analyze data creditworthiness which are alternative conventional method such documented credit history alternative data also considered through technologicalelectronic platform readily available collected digitized information form that the definition alternative data expected continue evolve more work the area come the fore notwithstanding important highlight that the definition alternative data will remain country specific and dependent the kind credit information that crsps these jurisdiction are currently collecting result what alternative one market can traditional another category alternative data the gpfi identified two main category alternative data namely structured and unstructured data structured data structured data defined information with high degree organization such that inclusion relational database seamless and readily searchable simple straightforward searchengine algorithm other search operation structured alternative data could include for example reporting data payment utility mobile phone and certain other obligation like rental information tax etc data crowdfunding transaction factoring leasing and credit insurance data transaction from lending platform invoice account payable sale volume merchant transactional data mobileemoney transaction procurement data historical business cash flow shipping history bill lading and data from online accounting platform reporting relevant data associated asset movable and fixed reporting data other payment flow received disadvantaged individual subsidy pension domestic and crossborder remittance etc when appropriate unstructured data unstructured data defined information that either doe not have predefined data model andor not organized predefined manner unstructured data include but not limited social medium and internet usage email text and messaging file audio file digital picture and image gps data mobile usage how many call the same number peak usage etc other meta data psychographic psychometric and other nonfinancial behavioral data alternative data that structured and focus transactional and other information that demonstrate the ability repay debt usually the most useful notwithstanding unstructured data can more useful case first time borrower with thin credit history and complement credit history more established msmes source alternative data the adoption digital platform and technology individual and business alike have increased the source nontraditional data every time individual msmes and their customer use cloudbased service conduct banking transaction make accept digital payment browse the internet use their mobile phone engage social medium buy sell electronically ship package manage their receivables payable and recordkeeping online they create digital footprint this realtime and verified data can mined determine both capacity and willingness repay loan rapidly growing crop fintech lender are putting the use msmes digital data customer need and advanced analytics the center their business model adding additional source alternative data alternative data source should provide credible information relied upon there are generally accepted characteristic good source alternative data coverage the data source must cover broad proportion the population and must consistent enable comparability regulatory compliance data source should comply with existing regulation for credit data sharing predictive power the data must able predict repayment behavior orthogonality the source should provide information that enriches already existing traditional data accuracy and timeliness the source should provide data whose accuracy can validated and the data should frequently updated depth information data source should provide detailed data element about individual iii challenge impediment and policy opportunity the adoption alternative data can help promote the inclusion individual and msmes with thin credit file into the mainstream credit market notwithstanding the potential benefit there need address the impediment that can curtail the use alternative data for credit reporting important ensure that the use alternative data will preserve the accuracy quality and completeness credit reporting data line with globalization there need ensure mobility data across border balance innovation and stability and protect the right consumer addition the use alternative data should ensure that the credit reporting ecosystem not exposed additional vulnerability adoption alternative data for credit reporting the use alternative data present new set risk and challenge that should mitigated for the world fully benefit the risk and challenge associated with the use alternative data include business practice data privacy and consumer protection issue the explanation box below capture some risk associated with the use alternative data box challenge associated with alternative data noncompliance with credit law and regulation difficulty verifying identification multiple fragmented data source which are difficult collect and aggregate minimum threshold are set level lower collection and submission cost which tend leave out inaccurate incomplete information msmes and individual the informal sector unintended side effect such potential for discrimination opaqueness scoring methodology the adoption digital solution such distributed ledger blockchain technology can contribute addressing some the inefficiency associated with verification data ownership and security order ensure effective and responsible use alternative data and standardization approach within country there need for policy maker provide guidance and certain case reform their law and regulation policy recommendation guidance the use alternative data regulator and policy maker should introduce amend law and regulation clarify how alternative data may sourced and processed taking into consideration privacy and data protection international standard some example that can useful alternative data source include reporting data payment made individual and msmes utility mobile phone and certain other obligation like rental information tax tuition etc data crowdfunding transaction factoring franchise history leasing and credit insurance data transaction from lending platform ecommerce provider invoice account receivable and payable and procurement data historical business cash flow shipping history bill lading economic indicator tax paid reporting relevant data associated asset movable and fixed that belong disadvantaged individual and msmes reporting data other payment flow received disadvantaged individual subsidy pension domestic and crossborder remittance etc when appropriate improving availability and accuracy information the era big data policy maker should ensure the accuracy data remains sacrosanct crsps are effectively leverage alternative data promote access credit for msmes and individual general principle the general principle for credit reporting herein the general principle highlight that credit reporting system should have relevant accurate timely and sufficient data implementing such principle however more complex when data obtained from wide variety source data accuracy and reliability may harder check one way increasing data accuracy ensuring that data subject access rectification correction and opposition arco right are safeguarded according the world bank new type data coming from multiple source are generally used ass creditworthiness when financial information about the borrower absent either because the individual msme borrowing for the first time when the credit information system not developed aggregation and accuracy data one the inherent challenge that arises from having multiple data source the need link and aggregate data collected from various source particular individual msmes able link and aggregate data msmes and individual from various source there need for unique identifier that unequivocally identify individual and msmes reasonable cost some country not have national system that can uniquely identify individual failure uniquely identify data subject can result inaccurate unreliable and incomplete information the inherent risk with using inaccurate unreliable and incomplete data that the score credit worthiness assessment may erroneous leading potential risk exclusion the error result the underestimation the ability the borrower repay potential risk over indebtedness the error overestimating the capacity the borrower repay policy recommendation unique identifier ensure accuracy alternative data policy maker and regulator should implement unique identifier that unequivocally identify data subject policy maker should consider the following option unique identifier for jurisdiction with efficient and consistent national identification system policy maker should make use the identify smaller msmes well individual instance where the national not exist policy maker should consider the use alternative such social security agency tax number consider working with financial regulator credit registry banking institution establish financial bank identification number jurisdiction should consider implementation consistent identification framework like the legal entity identifier lei long run policy maker these the for larger and established msmes policy maker and regulator can examine the potential for establishing company registration framework make use the lei provided the global legal entity identifier system gleis order connect data from different source credit reporting financial statement payment system improve accuracy linked data policy recommendation validation unique identifier relevant publicsector agency their role other data source specifically the extent they provide identification service should provide access national database for validation purpose availability and quality data across the globe government store and manage data that can used crsps enrich the information available for credit worthiness assessment yet some developing and emerging country that data most not shared most government agency these economy keep the data within their system while releasing controlled amount information individual and other stakeholder for research other purpose this resulted crsps duplicating the collection that data through inefficient and costly method more often than not the cost are passed consumer and translate high cost credit developed economy most government have implemented the policy making data available publicly the community part open government partnership initiative based the realization the economic value sharing this data other initiative such the psd can used indirectly create open data environment for financial service box open data system and psd open data system are platform where some data freely available everyone use and republish they wish without restriction from copyright patent other mechanism control open data system can either private government initiated some example opendata initiative include datagov datagovuk and datagovin and open banking open banking when banking data shared between two more unaffiliated party through apis deliver enhanced capability the marketplace open banking one the driver behind the revised payment service directive psd which requires financial institution the release customer data authorized third party using open and standardized applied programming interface apis this approach open apis will allow bank and nonbank lender obtain transactional data and liquidity information order provide very dynamic view creditworthiness some provider such bonifyde germany are using transactional data debit and credit movement account liquidity level and historical change create creditworthiness score which quite different from the static approach the past instead looking long term statistical mean they maintain always uptodate score based both historical and current transactional data notwithstanding benefit open data system introduces new challenge the form cybersecurity potential for fraud and data privacy and protection issue there therefore need consider various prerequisite address these issue psd also includes rule improve security measure through twofactor authentication well data protection and privacy including provision ensuring informed consent requirement for consumer the reliability open data platform dependent the quality and timeliness the data that collected and stored these platform there thus need ensure that the process collecting and processing data enhances the quality the data that stored policy recommendation digitizing government data management service policy maker should ensure that data managed governmental agency digitized and where appropriate shared efficient and costeffective manner with crsps this includes but not limited datasets corporate registry court law data and collateral registry policy recommendation open data system and standard policy maker should explore the option developing open data system and data standard for msme data including corporate financial banking and other relevant alternative data policy recommendation automation policy maker regulator should promote automation data collection processing and ensuring data properly updated and able accessed comprehensive and granular coverage alternative data most the individual and msmes operating the informal sector not have sufficient credit related information the bulk their financial and economic transaction are not recorded digitally instance where that information recorded the cost crsps extract and process expensive and often end being passed consumer form high fee thus impact access credit the lack sufficient quality data and other creditrelated information for decisionmaking also limit access finance for micro small and mediumsize enterprise msmes and especially for those operating some level informality most msmes operation such sale purchase and accounting process are not automated which affect their ability generate credible financial statement and projection very often the only standard information that available ass their creditworthiness the personal credit file history owner operator business adopting digital platform individual and msmes the informal sector will leave digital footprint the digital footprint will promote access more comprehensive and granular digitized transactional data which can processed crsps well other service improve access credit policy recommendation promote digital footprint policy maker and regulator should promote msmes use much possible digital service run their business since these service leave digital record that can accessed and combined with other information analyzed for creditworthiness policy makersregulators should consider offering financial and nonfinancial incentive credit provider msmes and consumer way promoting use digital platform important note that research still building the effectiveness incentive policy makersregulators should consider digital financial literacy and consumer awareness campaign educating individual and msmes the benefit challenge and safeguard associated with using digital platform box incentivizing digital payment experience colombia india south korea there are several example country that have utilized financial and nonfinancial incentive promote digital payment three case are discussed hereunder south korea the south korean government introduced tax incentive scheme promote digital payment tax rebate were offered more than individual entity annual income spent through credit debit card resultantly credit card transaction grew from the country gdp colombia the government led the way transacting primarily through electronic payment approximately percent the value money changing hand colombia each month paid electronically which the government the country now cashlite economy with government and business bulk payer colombia shifting electronic mean payment support this shift colombia passed law that provides tax benefit small merchant earning than usd per year for all revenue captured terminal india move that will encourage small shop accept electronic payment the government india decided bear the charge merchant pay bank purchase using debit card bhim aadhaar the subsidy will available for period two year starting from january these example offer several insight and lesson learned for other country including the important role government lead the way providing the right enabling environment well incentive the important role that the private sector should play creating digital payment infrastructure government and private sector need work together have coherent publicprivate strategy shift toward inclusive digital finance policy recommendation digitize government service policy maker should also encourage government agency digitize government service such tax filing company registration and other government service encourage digital footprint for msmes and individual once digitized that information should made available much possible for public use expanding credit information sharing comprehensive data coverage the digital age significant amount data that relevant for evaluating the creditworthiness borrower not collected crsps some jurisdiction alternative lender other nonfinancial entity that generate digital credit data are not required share their data result there are vast amount data that would promote access credit for msmes and individual that are currently not being captured crsps there need expand credit information sharing economy are benefit from broader set digital data which now available and relevant the role the crsps may change going forward starting the way the information collected them traditionally the crsps especially credit bureau have relied data provider put together the information specific format applying validation rule minimize error and using predefined script upload the data into their database more recently bureau are developing new credit scoring model based application that extract the information directly from source including digitized data that not available before with this opportunity come more responsibility well challenge the amount data collected also been limited minimum threshold that been set for reporting creditsdebtors certain instance the minimum threshold are set the level which might too high for individual and msmes this result these data subject being unable build credit history thus impacting their ability access credit market with inefficiency there inadequate credit information sharing with and between crsps certain jurisdiction the absence regulation that compels credit provider share information resulted some data provider not sharing information and the case when they the information not frequently updated those market the failure share credit data resulted incomplete data that may lead erroneous credit decision and impact negatively the performance credit portfolio policy recommendation legislative reform policy maker regulator should consider reviewing their legal framework require all financial service and credit provider including nonbank financial institution and payment firm that are not regulated financial authority and utility company report credit data and other relevant information crsps their jurisdiction policy recommendation promoting information sharing regulator should promote open fair and competitive credit information sharing between and with crsps policy recommendation establishment credit registry country with credit market inefficiency policy maker should consider the feasibility establishing credit registrydatabank play the role credit information aggregator and share this information with crsps policy recommendation regulatory oversight new credit reporting service provider certain instance the regulatory oversight role financial authority over new credit reporting service provider such fintech lender and payment system could elaborated further accommodate for the use alternative data for assessing the capability the msmes get loan policy recommendation minimum threshold policy maker regulator should explore the possibility reduce eliminate minimum threshold for reporting financial commitment crsps promote the capturing much data possible the submission requirement and process should streamlined box lowering eliminating minimum threshold where threshold for the loan included credit bureau database are high retail and small business loan are more likely excluded this can hurt those that benefit the most from credit reporting system such female entrepreneur and small enterprise whose loan are typically smaller therefore credit bureau and credit registry that collect and distribute microfinance data are more likely benefit female entrepreneurship building credit history for woman credit registry usually set relatively high threshold for loan since their primary purpose support bank supervision and the monitoring systemic risk credit bureau tend have lower minimum loan threshold indonesia tunisia and west bank and gaza eliminated their loan threshold azerbaijan eliminated threshold manat for individual manat for firm and manat for credit card this action spurred the rapid growth consumer loan which had led bank request more detailed information larger group borrower mongolia credit registry eliminated the minimum threshold for loan included database result the registry coverage doubled after just year brazil the threshold the central bank credit registry been reduced starting with brl and decreasing brl and brl more recently the threshold reduced brl usd these reduction increased the level identification debtor and loan from the total credit volume granted the financial system the central bank cyprus adopted directive december eliminating the minimum threshold for loan included credit bureau database result loan all size are now included the database the credit bureau artemis bank information system much possible reduce cost enabling responsible cross border data exchange the gpfi alternative data for msme finance document talk about several example where crossborder take place through partnership like any crossborder activity international cooperation essential ensure effective implementation and equal treatment some national regulator have put place cooperative arrangement promote innovation and share information about financial service the multilateral level international standard setter such the international organization security commission basel committee banking supervision and committee payment and market infrastructure well the financial stability board are monitoring and studying the implication technological change for financial stability market integrity efficiency and consumer protection addition general challenge associated with cross border flow identified general principle the general principle movement alternative data across border complicated difference various national law and regulation the regulatory treatment some data category such personal data not consistent across country some country there are regulation relating handling personal data and certain instance these rule prohibit the sharing information across border given the international flow data likely that enforcement regime and customerrecourse system will not clear particularly developing country and case where alternative data held the cloud andor based unstructured data further consideration could given this aspect involves the need for harmonized international approach consumer right disputeresolution mechanism accountability for data error and datasecurity measure another challenge associated with sharing msmes information across border the absence unique identifier that can link the credit information the msmes across border failure identify business across border will affect the ability crsps accurately aggregate msmes global exposure addition will affect the ability msmes access offshore funding and trade credit from their global supplier the use the globally unique legal entity identifier lei would support unambiguously identifying msmes also crossborder there are difference the specific data that crsps different country collect both individual and msmes borrower thus making difficult aggregate draw comparison applicant data across border the data variable that crsps collect across border are not standardized and this will become worse with the adoption alternative data the absence defined core set variable comparing and aggregating credit information applicant using information from across border might difficult policy recommendation collaboration there need for further collaboration the international level with standard setting body like the task force data sharing improve the comparability and consistency msmes credit data that shared across border box apec crossborder credit information sharing the ifc and biia were invited apec business advisory council conduct pilot the crossborder access smemsme credit information involving some crsps from five jurisdiction thailand cambodia lao vietnam and china part the implementation the credit information system element the apec financial infrastructure development network find effort are currently underway create regional data dictionary enable easier interpretation cross border credit report these effort will also include identification any data element such gender that might prohibited from being reported within particular jurisdiction but which are commonly reported other jurisdiction policy recommendation harmonization data law policy maker and regulator should work towards harmonization data protection and privacy law relation alternative data policy recommendation harmonization data attribute there need encourage the domestic and international level harmonized core set data attribute shared domestically and across border msmes covering both financial data and credit performance aspect policy recommendation global legal identifier policy maker should ass the feasibility implementing the global legal entity identifier variant such identification for development idd for individual address crossborder usage and sharing data box global legal entity identifier lei the legal entity identifier lei digit alphanumeric code based the iso standard uniquely identify distinct entity that engage financial transaction the broadest definition connects key reference information that enables clear and unique identification legal entity participating financial transaction simply put the publicly available lei data pool can regarded global directory which greatly enhances transparency the global marketplace the financial stability board fsb reiterated that global lei adoption underpins multiple financial stability objective such improved risk management firm well better assessment micro and macro prudential risk result promotes market integrity while containing market abuse and financial fraud last but not least lei rollout support higher quality and accuracy financial data overall the publicly available lei data pool unique key standardized information legal entity globally the data registered and regularly verified according protocol and procedure established the lei regulatory oversight committee cooperation with partner the global lei system the global legal entity identifier foundation gleif continues focus further optimizing the quality reliability and usability lei data empowering market participant benefit from the wealth information available with the lei population the driver the lei initiative the group the fsb and many regulator around the world have emphasized the need make the lei broad public good the global lei index made available gleif greatly contributes meeting this objective put the complete lei data the disposal any interested party conveniently and free charge the benefit for the wider business community generated with the global lei index grow line with the rate lei adoption maximize the benefit entity identification across financial market and beyond firm are therefore encouraged engage the process and get their own lei obtaining lei easy registrant simply contact their preferred business partner from the list lei issuing organization available the gleif website balancing integrity innovation and competition their financial stability role regulator and public authority often face the challenge striking the right balance between promoting innovation and ensuring stability market the use alternative data expands regulatory authority should ensure that they not stifle innovation while the same time ensuring adequate data protection and attention consumer privacy this challenge heightened the fast pace technological change and the limited knowledge the actual risk and their consequence for consumer and market too lenient standard could result overindebtedness and fraud while too strict standard might curtail access credit the world bank the committee payment and market infrastructure payment aspect financial inclusion pafi and the high level principle for digital financial inclusion highlight the need balance innovation and competition the financial service marketplace preserving integrity the financial system while encouraging access shared information challenge for regulator and policymakers addition there insufficient regional global information about the status commercial credit reporting provider how they may serving msme credit provider and the credit market more broadly many case this information not available even the domestic level statistic and detailed information the various feature commercial credit reporting and current practice around the world could doubt useful all participant policy recommendation responsible innovation policy maker and regulator should collaborate the development principle responsible innovation such collaboration can take the form task force which are composed both public and private sector player global level authority should participate global survey similar tool performed periodically obtain detailed comprehensive and systematic information about credit reporting activity policy recommendation regulatory innovation tool policy maker and regulator should consider the feasibility implementing utilizing regulatory tool for enabling innovation such hub and sandbox promote alternative data centric innovation including alternative scoring technique their market the framework should consider country specific context and the market dynamic data privacy cyber security and consumer protection notwithstanding the many benefit alternative data use raise some significant data privacy and consumer protection issue around disclosure confidential information third party transparency and discrimination per the general principle credit reporting system should safe and efficient and supportive data subject and consumer right addition the adoption new technology and incorporation new player the creditreporting ecosystem introduces new source vulnerability system security some common threat data security include cyberattacks from outsider improper data use employee service provider andor from the user accidental disclosure data accidental loss data and natural disaster among others inadequate data protection practice standard and rule can result experiencing financial harm loss privacy and loss trust the financial system consumer many the new financial service provider andor fintech player may not have sufficient resource invest robust system security standard and data protection such these institution might find themselves risk and might eventually become source vulnerability the whole ecosystem some regulatory agency such the financial industry regulatory authority finra have developed basic checklist for alternative lender especially new financial player and thirdparty provider who support alternative lending approach these include identifying and assessing cybersecurity threat protecting infrastructure and platform from cyber intrusion detecting compromise vulnerability responding through riskbased plan and recovering andor replacing lost data since most alternative lender third party aggregator and data
