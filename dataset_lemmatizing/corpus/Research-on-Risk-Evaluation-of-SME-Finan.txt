bottleneck and obstacle appear for further growth smes especially with respect financing sme financing different from that larger corporation since they are younger and subject more growth uncertainty than large firm especially developing country the main problem related sme access finance china are the risk involved performing bad loan higher significant for manager and investor both theoretical and practical field ass the financing risk smes this paper aim propose analytical framework risk evaluation sme financing based grey theory firstly this paper discus the current sme financing china secondly set multihierarchy index system thirdly confirms the weight every index with ahp and gave general assessment mean grey clustering method finally case study conducted validate the evaluation model and the evaluation process keywords small and medium enterprise financing risk analytic hierarchy process grey theory introduction the availability financing for smes have the subject growing attention recent year based the role smes play economics growth due their privateownership nature entrepreneurial spirit and the ability adapt the everchanging environment they contribute sustainable growth and employment generation significant manner aung kyaw smes have unique characteristic their own they are naturally more labor intensive easy start focus small market require lower investment and promote customer intimacy now recognized that smes make significant contribution the socioeconomic and political infrastructure developed and developing country well the nation transition from command market economy matlay westhead small business with than worker the united state represent onethird domestic employment and sale value smes the account for about onehalf the total value added and twothirds labor force european union smes contributed between percent and percent manufacturing output chinese taipei japan and the republic korea the wattanapruttipaisan after moving towards more marketoriented economy china experienced decline stateowned enterprise and important expansion for small business walter the role smes economic development published sciedu press wwwscieducaijfr international journal financial research vol january well documented for advanced economy and been crucial china process economic reform last decade there are currently more than million china small and medium enterprise creating nearly total gdp tax amounting almost also smes provide about urban employment opportunity nevertheless some bottleneck and obstacle appear for further growth smes especially with respect financing the main problem related sme access finance china are the risk involved performing bad loan higher than for larger firm the evaluation financing risk small and medium enterprise significant because the process can help find the latent problem and reduce the risk evaluation and monitoring warranted for measuring the efficiency and effectiveness financing multilevel grey evaluation method been set out this paper and proven especially useful the following instance when data only partially available when using qualitative variable when using quantitative variable which are inaccessible the professional and their quantification can not therefore deduced extend the ahp approach for the multicriteria assessment problem and propose use gahp technique the application the multilevel grey evaluation the field financing risk small and medium enterprise advance with respect previous study the application multicriteria method current sme financing china current state sme financing comparing with stateowned corporation private enterprise majority those are smes rarely got favorable treatment from government term subsidy tax relaxation and development loan according the world bank investment climate survey for china conducted for the period and smes china face much more serious credit constraint and limited access private finance than large firm even compared other asian country dollar etal the project group research chinese private enterprise organized china industrial and commercial union and research commission chinese private business showed survey conducted that selfaccumulated money the major source for starting firm approximately percent complemented money borrowed privately percent and bank and rural credit corporation loan percent smes opposed larger publicly held business typically depend external financing for liquidity the evidence suggests that the private enterprise performance associated with access formal finance bank loan and more firm using formal financing source grow faster than those financed alternative channel cull maksimovic demirg kunt ayyagari table about here table show that the financing preference ownermanagers china and changed according the development need their smes along with the growth the enterprise most the ownermanagers the came rely primarily financial institution contrast ownermanagers the chinese depended primarily their immediate family and lesser extent financial institution hussain eta main problem related sme access financing from credit risk point view smes are different from large corporate for many reason for example dietsch and petey analyze panel german and french smes and conclude that they are riskier but have lower asset correlation with each other than large business there are scale economy lending per unit cost screening and monitoring loan decrease the size loan increase firm size positively related loan size then the average cost serving smes larger than that for larger firm according since most smes are nonstate enterprise the risk involved performing bad loan higher than for larger firm where there are still more stateowned enterprise most the smes rarely keep accounting record their business systematic manner which resulted the information asymmetry between the business and the bank kanamori zhao extent such cost information asymmetry can reduced through relationship banking collateralized loan designing index system financing risk any risk associated with any form financing risk probability unfavorable
