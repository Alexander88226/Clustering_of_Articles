gengzigao com abstract with the progress society and the rapid development the economy china economy undergone qualitative change the business mode changed from the previous one that solely relied the stateowned collective enterprise that dominated small and mediumsized private enterprise nowadays smes have become indispensable part china economy and they are the largest and most innovative organization group china small and mediumsized enterprise not only promote the steady development china economy but also provide more than the tax revenue for china economic income and create more than the gdp the same time made tremendous contribution improving people livelihood relieving employment pressure and promoting technological innovation according statistic small and mediumsized enterprise account for the total enterprise china providing more than urban employment job china and completing more than patent invention however china still the transitional stage economic development and financial environment still not perfect which led the stagnation smes financing difficulty addition with the impact the international financial crisis the international and domestic financial market and their financial environment are unstable state which greatly affected the development china smes and made more difficult attract financing this paper will take the financing difficulty smes the starting point combining the theory and case analysis this paper analyzes and study the meaning the internal meaning behind the financial environment data and analyzes the influence the financial environment smes from five aspect finally based the result theory and case analysis this paper proposes improve the financial ecological environment accelerate the improvement law and regulation financial support for smes the financial environment thereby promoting the healthy development financial market the end the optimization financial ecology will alleviate the big problem financing difficulty faced smes keywords smes financing financial ecology gao research the impact financial ecological environment sme financing ekoloji introduction the main body the market smes play central role promoting the development the national economy and promoting the harmonious development society since the fifteenth conference due the rapid growth smes the chinese communist party paid more attention the development small and mediumsized enterprise the backbone china economic development turkson smes development status related the future direction national economic development and the change the internal structure the current national economy some obstacle however recent year china smes have generally encountered their development since china implemented reform and opening and actively implemented own foreign policy the golden development stage china small foundation environmental protection researchfepr and mediumsized enterprise passed due change the external environment the competitive advantage china small and mediumsized enterprise have gradually disappeared such china manufacturing enterprise with the development technology and the changing market demand consumer some manufacturing industry are facing market with poor demand and are state powerlessness the cruelest argument that most manufacturing industry may have close down and withdraw the next year paulo and paulo stated due the disappearance many small and mediumsized enterprise competitive advantage and poor management the financing difficulty smes have become tough problem under the impact the financing difficulty smes have new feature the one hand with the improvement the overall material life the financial crisis international the received may accepted jan gao society which led increase the production cost enterprise and the overcapacity some industry smes need maintain their normal operation and the demand for liquidity financial company become more urgent the other hand under the constraint credit scale especially under the rigid agreement continuously increasing the deposit reserve ratio bank are more cautious about the financing need smes solve the longstanding problem financing difficulty for smes the one hand depends the improvement the external environment which smes survive such the reform the financial system the other hand depends the effort smes themselves the economic addition since financial environmental issue have been one the hot issue discussed expert field from macro perspective good financial ecological environment play decisive role the good operation the market the optimization the economic structure the liquidity fund and the strengthening security therefore under the current economic condition china supriti and damodar said that inseparable solve the problem financing difficulty for smes and the state the external environment which enterprise are located china current economic structure coexisting many form however from the perspective overall economic development the financial ecological environment not perfect such the irrational allocation financial resource the lack innovation capacity financial institution the imperfection financial supervision system and system these are the reason for the asymmetry economic structure and financial structure and the difference credit supply and demand structure the same time this greatly increased the extent financing difficulty summary the impact the existing defect the financial ecological environment and the imbalance the financial ecological structure smes must combine the theory financial ecological environment and sme financing related with the current financing situation smes and propose way solve this problem the status quo and problem sme financing the status quo sme financing under the current economic situation china the potential function sme development are constantly the road being stimulated however sme development not smooth china the stage transition from the planned economy the market economy most smes still have many traditional color therefore chinese smes will generally face difficulty financing during the development process the specific analysis follows single financing approach since the reform and opening although the development smes become more diversified the financing method smes are still relatively simple and their financing method are still based financial institution small and mediumsized enterprise are still the early stage growth and all business activity are still the exploration period which extremely uncertain difficult obtain assistance from relevant financial institution not only that because implement socialist market economy the scope government intervention broader and profound impact luo therefore the existing legal system issuing bond china adverse effect financing and the imperfection the development the capital market make difficult obtain fund through other mean the cost high since the implementation the reform the commercial bank market interest rate system china reform and opening the loan review work been improved certain extent the same time however the loan review fee been increased which greatly increased the loan cost and increased the financing cost coupled with other financing cost this greatly increased the overall financing cost smes and brought certain financing pressure the operating environment poor with obvious differentiation small and mediumsized enterprise have weak foundation small scale production relatively backward technology unstable work performance large employee mobility weak antirisk ability difficult management later loan and relatively low credit this caused financial institution such bank reluctant lend small and mediumsized enterprise the same time sometimes countylevel government and smes will choose sacrifice the interest bank for their own benefit which make them subject enormous risk pressure making bank more cautious handling sme loan moreover there ekoloji research the impact financial ecological environment sme financing still imbalance the development small and mediumsized enterprise china and highquality small and mediumsized enterprise have become active target for loan from various financial institution company that are not very good will left out the cold because the danger bankruptcy analysis financing for smes through the analysis the abovementioned status quo can seen that the current situation sme financing the continued development smes and imperative analyze the cause the problem the specific reason are follows china seriously hindered the credit evaluation system and the credit guarantee system are not perfect present china credit evaluation mechanism and supervision mechanism are not perfect and there national uniformity and china not yet clarified the issue guarantee fund and unified guarantee system not been formed smes started late and have weak foundation when faced with these problem front china they have greatly restricted the support relevant financial loan therefore there are countless example smes being unable implement guarantee and being denied loan institution for sme the financial system and the bank management system are inconsistent with the development need smes lin and zhi proposed that small and mediumsized enterprise are currently large number china and are widely distributed however due the limited credit capacity china small and mediumsized financial institution and the relatively dense distribution small and mediumsized financial institution with strong capability they can not meet the need most sme financing addition the bank sometimes can not understand the actual operation the lending company resulting mismatch information therefore bank usually adopt simple guarantee method ignoring the future development smes which further increase the difficulty financing for smes law and regulation supporting the development smes are not sound enough small and mediumsized enterprise are environment imperfect financial market the face market imperfection government agency must intervene behalf the government although china promulgated many law and regulation adjust ekoloji the status quo macro finance such company law security law etc but there still provision for unified guarantee evaluation system even law and regulation have been promulgated there are problem such poor implementation which seriously hinders the development smes liu the enterprise own management system not sound enough smes are the primary stage development and the overall level productivity still weak the level technological development obviously weaker than that listed company the financial data transparent and more prone distortion these factor are all manifestation weak management concept and business concept addition smes tend pay more attention their own interest and ignore other development lower credit consequence which make more difficult use capital and financing guo resulting factor the impact financial ecological environment sme financing the financial ecological environment been receiving much attention from researcher since introduction this complex system like the natural environment and component are full diversified element according the analysis yang there are five major component that determine the quality the financial ecology including economic foundation financial legal environment integrity culture and the independence the financial sector moreover not difficult find that highquality financial ecological environment play significant role improving the financing smes the specific analysis follows industry development level the impact economic base sme financing the economic foundation the cornerstone the development all thing society mainly includes economic development industrial structure economic activity and infrastructure construction these are all necessary condition for the development other element good social and financial ecological environment can enhance economic activity which conducive creating relatively healthy social market economy that can alleviate the financing difficulty smes with the selfregulating power the market economy the contrary relatively poor financial ecological environment which will easily lead market out control that the government intervention market activity occurs then other related factor will lose their meaning addition gao good financial environment can attract more investor make more external capital inflow and improve their economic competitiveness this not only drive the development listed company but also benefit smes the impact financial development the financing smes when evaluating the state financial development tend consider financial industry contribution financial intermediation and financial market good financial environment will certainly have prosperous financial market which provides more diversified financing channel for smes moreover when the financial market relatively perfect the role bond and equity financing will brought into play and smes will develop rapidly the impact legal environment sme financing the law way maintain the order the financial ecological environment and direct influence the financial ecological environment for the financing behavior small and mediumsized enterprise all smes want minimize their own cost free and expense and achieve their optimal configuration region with sound legal environment when financial institution and smes cooperate the law can serve the most powerful basis for safeguarding the interest both party therefore this can greatly reduce the cost cooperation between the two party accelerate the overall progress smes financing promote the virtuous circle financial ecological environment and resolve the financing risk smes the impact government action sme financing the operation the market can not separated from government intervention judging from the role sme financing the government interference the economy will help improve the financing environment for smes alleviate the problem poor regulation the market economy and low level social security however excessive government intervention will interfere with the good operation the market economy resulting poor market regulation causing unnecessary trouble for sme financing activity and curbing the financing efficiency enterprise xue the impact credit environment sme financing credit the cornerstone the establishment cooperative relation between financial institution and smes mainly includes four aspect social security level education development resident education investment and social integrity these factor can improve the credit rating smes reduce the various cost incurred the financing process smes and improve the ability smes obtain fund when financial institution consider whether handle loan business for certain small and mediumsized enterprise they will pay more attention these four aspect especially commercial bank summary these five major element that constitute the financial ecological environment are crucial solving the financing problem smes highquality financial ecological environment can not only attract more fund flow into but also reduce the cost financing for smes increase financial instrument that match their financing need and promote the continuous optimization financial institution this will provide richer financing path for their financing taking the study china financial development case province with good financial development prospect jiangsu province certain proportion the total number smes china however the problem financing difficulty for smes restricted the development enterprise and the regional financing difference jiangsu province more obvious below analyze the impact financial development jiangsu province the financing smes various region data source the data this paper mainly come from the national database the national bureau statistic the people republic china and the china statistical yearbook this paper excel for data statistic and plot and table financial development jiangsu province since the reform and opening along with the rapid development china economy financial asset and economic development have been increasing trend which caused china financial ratio rise substantially however china financial development uneven across region ekoloji table financial related ratio zhejiang province research the impact financial ecological environment sme financing the entire province hangzhou ningbo wenzhou jiaxing huzhou shaoxing jinhua quzhou zhoushan taizhou lishui table deposit jinhua unit million yuan deposit unit deposit personal saving deposit shortterm loan medium and longterm loan personal loan ordinary unit loan personal loan ordinary unit loan the financial correlation ratio the most commonly used indicator measure the level financial industry development country region calculating the financial related ratio jiangsu province from can understand the financial development various region jiangsu province shown table from the table can seen that the overall average value zhejiang province during increasing year year that say during the sixyear period the region are generally state financial deepening and the overall difference are constantly shrinking this phenomenon may due the local government intervention the rational allocation resource which make the market allocate more space for financial resource comparing the financial ratio the region can easily found that the financialrelated ratio hangzhou for year far higher than the overall level this show that the competition all financial resource hangzhou more financial resource than other region making possible turn the competition for market financial resource and the allocation financial resource longer solely dependent stateowned financial institution analysis financing situation small and mediumsized enterprise various region jiangsu most chinese smes have relatively simple financing method and jiangsu province ekoloji jiangsu province exception therefore necessary analyze the distribution sme loan balance according loan balance jiangsu province the overall loan balance jiangsu province the rise indicating that the phenomenon loan from smes relevant financial institution been the rise for nearly six year the main reason may due the better financial development environment jiangsu province which enables the rational allocation resource and the increase loan business according the statistic relevant website the best deposit and loan resource jiangsu financial institution are hangzhou which closely related the development financial market various region analyzed above not difficult think that where the financial market more optimized the financing threshold for smes can reduced large amount foreign capital poured and smes are open fair and just financing environment the contrary the financial market that not perfect the proportion medium and longterm loan related unit low and the financing small and mediumsized enterprise jinhua taken example for analysis can seen from table that jinhua deposit and loan institution are relatively unbalanced the medium and longterm loan are relatively small and the average medium and longterm loan only account for about the average medium and gao table the added value jinhua financial industry and share gdp value added the financial industry million yuan proportion the financial industry gdp gdp million yuan longterm loan the unit only about while the medium and longterm loan small and mediumsized enterprise are often loan such fixed asset for the relevant financial institution the case relatively weak financial market development considering that the size small and mediumsized enterprise too small credit generally not high and loan have certain risk faced with the mortgage real estate they often reluctantly lend fear they will raise the the opportunity for sme loan however from vertical perspective jinhua deposit and loan since unit shortterm loan have shown gradual upward trend and the increase rate far higher than the medium and longterm financial development jinhua been significantly improved and the opportunity for sme loan have increased significantly loan this show threshold financing reduce that and the for can seen from table from the financial added value jinhua city increased more than billion yuan and the proportion financial industry gdp increased from this show that the financial sector constantly the continuous expanding which will promote improvement economic structure and continuously drive the development the financial market the based the analysis from the comparative analysis the financial development situation jiangsu province and the financing situation smes concluded that china financial development great impact the financing smes suggesgtions improve the status quo sme financing through the above summary the financing problem existing smes china will make recommendation the issue from the perspective the five component the financial ecoenvironment the detail follows constantly improve the legal system interenterprise exchange not only require the open and transparent implementation the legal system but also the integrity and practicality the law ensure the efficiency law enforcement the establishment sound legal system requires the establishment legal system with practical application value and the independence work addition the actual situation the region also necessary improve the regulatory regulation and system improve the mean supervision reduce administrative into regulatory mechanism based legal supervision and severely crack down illegal financial activity relevant personnel who violate the law and maliciously for criminal evade debt shall responsibility according strengthen cooperation between other department and the financial sector interference and transform investigated law and reduce excessive government intervention and maintain market independence government intervention direct mean correct market adjustment error the government ability improve financial market management and service enhancement can effectively improve the level financial ecological environment however the face the current situation financing difficulty for smes this kind intervention need transformed into public service management and change the intervention method follows first resource allocation rationalized china financial ecological environment unbalanced regional development the government need balance fairness and efficiency increase the promotion policy adjustment underdeveloped region and development promote capability second strengthen the government behavioral restraint mechanism and establish testing system which will help strengthen the supervision the government administration and try reduce the development financial market administrative mean during the normal operation the market ekoloji research the impact financial ecological environment sme financing accelerate the construction credit system china with the increasingly close trade between enterprise the credit issue become another major obstacle the financing smes the face this problem need start from the following three aspect for smes first all china one the problem financing difficulty information asymmetry bank and other institution are often afraid lend relevant enterprise the face such status quo however with the development technology the internet become daily tool for communication therefore the face this problem should rely more the power the network when enterprise want finance enterprise and individual can send their credit record and financial transaction activity accurately and timely relevant financial institution through the joint credit information network platform this can greatly reduce the cost both party and reduce the difficulty financing for smes secondly support the establishment and improvement various type loan guarantee and insurance institution diversify the risk bank and promote the healthy development various type loan finally the cultivation trustworthy market entity should severely punished such fraudulently obtaining loan and maliciously evading bank debt and maintaining good external environment law fraudulent act for optimize the structure the financial market and enhance the steady development the economy china the initial stage financial market development the financial development market still unstable and the economic foundation still need develop steadily faced with this situation imperative optimize the structure the financial market and stabilize economic development the specific practice are follows first all each region should broaden own bond

inevitable development path will use science and technology drive productivity use innovation drive product value use information technology drive industrialization achieve steady and steady economic development and cooperate with each other economic factor maintain virtuous circle economic market under such good development situation smes can find their own support point acknowledgement this
