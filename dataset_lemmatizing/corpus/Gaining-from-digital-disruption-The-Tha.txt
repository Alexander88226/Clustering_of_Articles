bherein file gaining from digital disruption the thai financial landscape the digital era thammarak moenjak vorapat praneeprachachon tanatas bumpenboon pornchanok bumrungruan chompoonoot monchaitrakul abstract this paper examines competitiveness the thai financial sector through the dimension depth access efficiency and stability compared peer the paper find that while the thai financial sector compare reasonably well with peer most dimension doe not fare well term sme access bank credit using panzarrosse hstatistic the paper also examines competition the thai banking sector and find that the level competition the thai banking sector consistently high over the sample period the result raise the question why doe sme access bank credit remain low despite high level competition the banking sector this puzzle important since smes are key driver the thai economy reviewing result from various study and interview with smes and bank credit officer the paper identifies several bottleneck the sme lending process that may lead market failure using data from million individual sme loan contract obtained from thai commercial bank and six specialized financial institution sfis the paper find that only few bank attempt penetrate smes the lower tier loan size and income although sme lending sfis are found good complement sme lending bank the fact remains that fewer than half smes thailand have loan from these financial institution the paper then discus how several initiative have been attempted harness the power technology and data help improve sme access finance whether from traditional bank other type player lesson from the case sme financing and from other segment financial sector selected country are then drawn into common theme that might help guide the design

the ability the financial sector perform function well important policy implication economy with financial sector that can cheaply and quickly turn saving into consumption and investment often found attain higher longterm growth the level financial development also found many researcher also influence income inequality whether directly indirectly this paper first present stylized fact the thai financial sector before assessing competitiveness the thai financial sector term depth access efficiency and stability using the framework proposed cihak focusing financial institution the paper find the thai financial sector competitiveness line with asean most measure except sme access bank credit the paper also ass degree competition among thai bank dominant player the thai financial sector using panzarosse hstatistic framework together with consolidated balance sheet thai commercial bank and their subsidiary the paper find the degree competition among the thai commercial bank quite high thai bank and their subsidiary not seem posse much market power and have been competing rather intensely puzzle thus emerges the thai bank are already competing intensely why doe thai sme access credit remain low there seems market failure since competitive market theory dictate that smes demand for credit should reasonably well met delving into the root these market failure important because smes are key driver see for example knoops cihak wongswan luengnaruemitchai and boonthaveepat cihak belly lochner kerr nanda beck demirguckunt levine the thai economy accounting for around percent employment and percent value added the gdp the paper thus investigates and analyzes what might the cause such market failure sme access credit reviewing result from various study and interview with smes and bank credit officer the paper identifies several bottleneck and market failure that are hampering sme access finance these includes burdensome manual process heavy paper documentation and lack data particular the latter also key bottleneck term credit decision credit risk model rely heavily upon availability reliable data other word information asymmetry friction process and unintended consequence regulation have all contributed market failure sme access credit our conjecture that the presence these bottleneck make sme lending costly time consuming and perhaps too risky for bank using data from million individual sme loan contract from the bank thailand bot sme database smd and loan arrangement database lar check the profile these loan the paper find that only few bank have attempted penetrate sme market the lower tier loan size and income the paper observes that smaller sme loan also incur more npls sfis are observed have stepped and complement bank their lending smes the lower tier despite the presence sfis fewer than half the smes use credit from bank sfis the digital era however rapid development digitization and process automation offer promising potential unlock those bottleneck the paper thus review the effort number thai player including fintech bank smes themselves and regulator harness the power technology and data solve these bottleneck and help improve sme access finance reviewing the initiative being implemented thailand along with those being implemented proposed other country the paper find that digitalization and data are being leveraged help alleviate market failure presented the financial sector not only sme access credit ultimately the paper identifies three common theme that might help the financial sector harness the power technology and data improve competitiveness the digital era these theme include interoperability reduce switching cost encourage competition and allow for better collection flow and usage data robust ecosystem with various type player collaborating competing and innovating meet customer need and more flexible and forward looking regulatory framework reduce unintended consequence regulation while ensuring that stability and consumer protection are not compromised part the thai financial sector stylized fact part highlight stylized fact regarding the thai financial sector which reflect the underlying trend competition within the thai financial sector the stylized fact are shown from both the macro view reflecting the evolution the thai financial sector term key service provider and micro view reflecting the evolution usage financial service household and firm macro view evolution the thai financial sector the landscape the thai financial sector undergone number transition over the past year from post asian financial crisis reform that strengthened core financial system and established important infrastructure number initiative that helped improve access efficiency and resilience the financial system over the year the thai financial sector particularly the banking sector adopted number important international standard and practice comply with the basel core principle thailand also setup important infrastructure such the deposit protection agency protect depositor against failing financial institution thus creating resilient financial system supporting growth the thai economy scanning the current landscape the thai financial sector consists six main group player namely commercial bank bank specialized financial institution sfis other deposittaking institution including saving cooperative and credit union the macro view represents those regarding financial institution and market while the micro view represents those associated with individual mutual fund insurance and other nonbank financial institution from regulatory perspective formal financial institution include bank sfis mutual fund insurance other depositing taking institution and nonbank financial institution under the regulatory purview financial regulator semiformal financial institution refer financial institution whose legal status are granted specific law and are supervised other government agency such cooperative village fund and leasing company breakdown the financial sector player and their asset size displayed figure bank and sfis account for the majority total financial sector asset making over percent the end total financial sector asset reached percent gdp worth noting that while bank continue account for sizable share the financial sector share total asset declined over the past decade this may reflect important transition the thai financial sector that bank competitiveness being challenged greater competition from other player also begs the question whether bank can remain competitive going forward figure asset share the thai financial sector and review financial system asset figure show that since bank share financial sector asset declined around percentage point from around percent percent instead asset share mutual fund sfis saving cooperative and credit union have seen notable increase likely diverting the fund that would have gone into bank deposit and lending activity meanwhile asset share insurance company increased markedly figure compound annual growth rate important financial sector participant figure show that while bank asset continue grow their growth rate slower than those other player bank asset exhibit compound annual growth rate percent since compared with the average growth the financial sector percent these indicator suggest growing role nonbank player the thai financial system micro view thai financial service from the user perspective analysis the demand for financial service provides better clarity the changing financial landscape for household the financial access survey thai household ass household demand for financial service and access channel the survey measure conducted the bank thailand and the national statistical office thailand level household financial access eleven key financial service commonly provided financial institution according the latest survey conducted bank remain the overall primary provider financial service for household table and table fact more household are using bank compared with the survey result while access through other player remains largely unchanged the most used financial service are deposit payment money transfer and loan with reported usage percent percent percent and percent respectively bank sfis village fund cooperative deposit saving sfis bank village fund leasing company table primary provider financial service loan bank sfis epayment provider individual provider transfer bank sfis epayment provider village fund payment table primary provider financial service cont among these user bank remain the primary service provider for deposit transfer and payment service for deposit percent household reported bank the primary service provider notable increase from for payment and transfer service bank are also the primary service provider with reported usage percent and percent respectively bank dominance these service likely augmented the introduction defined household who have used least one financial service and those who have access financial service but choose not use any financial service the eleven financial service include deposit saving loan excluding credit card money transfer payment credit card life insurance nonlife insurance mutual fund government and central bank debt security private security and rotating saving group promptpay payment service well standardized code for payment which allow convenient and instant payment through banking mobile application zero fee another interesting observation the increasing usage payment through epayment service provider including banking agent counter service and convenience store this evidence may point changing structure the financial landscape bank transition towards greater digital adoption they may outsource basic service banking agent counterservices these service point also provide easy access point and convenience for consumer access financial service lamsam term loan service the household survey find that sfis remain the primary usage channel for household loan moreover large proportion household reported usage semiformal service provider their main loan provider fact percent household use semiformal financial institution including saving cooperative village fund and leasing company the primary lending channel proportion far outweighed usage bank while household demand and usage financial service can analyzed through household survey similar analysis for corporate made more challenging due data availability instead this paper used the data corporate financing activity imply corporates demand and usage financial service figure show corporate financing activity based bank loan corporate bond and equity the figure show that corporate financing through commercial bank remains the primary channel but proportion declined substantially corporates have relied much more debt and equity financing compared their financing activity the past increased financing activity through the financial market are likely result relatively eased financial market condition thailand and globally while domestic policy interest rate kept near historical low percent from april december these have resulted lower funding cost for corporate than the past indicated corporate new loan rate that continued decline and remained low level during the bot ratecutting cycle figure furthermore corporate credit spread have remained relatively rangebound since the end figure figure corporate financing activity figure new loan rate and other rate new loan rate nlr the rate interest payment loan contract excluding loan household and financial intermediary and weighted loan size calculated from the median rate individual loan contract with credit amount above thb million from database loan arrangement lar reported the bank thailand from thai commercial bank figure average credit spread thb arating bond from the supply financial service perspective the accessibility financial product including saving and credit supported continued expansion physical financial access point such increase number branch atm and edcs relative the number adult population lamsam however there large variation coverage financial service infrastructure across different region thailand with higher concentration larger city fact estimated that percent village thailand not have access financial access point within five kilometer nevertheless twothird these village are located area with good mobile broadband coverage suggesting potential for increasing access through mobile and internet banking chantarat access point include the formal channel such bank and sfis semiformal channel such cooperative and village fund and potential banking agent such convenience store gas station postoffices and shop with edcs average credit spread thb arating bond aaaaaaaaaaaa moreover continued increase mobile and internet broadband usage also provides support for further financial access through internet and mobile banking channel figure thus far increasing digitization banking service along with establishment key financial infrastructure such the promptpay fasterpay infrastructure have enabled greater electronic payment usage consumer the volume epayment increased substantially over the past five year from around transaction per person per year almost transaction per person per year figure infrastructure for financial service part iii competitiveness the thai financial sector depth access efficiency and stability part iii aim ass competitiveness the thai financial sector compared with asean peer noted yokoiarai and yoshino competitiveness the financial sector can elusive concept and hence reference various index will provide starting point for discussion this paper follows framework set cihak for the benchmarking global financial system foundation for global financial development database developed the world bank according the framework competitiveness the financial sector could assessed through four dimension depth access efficiency stability figure competitiveness financial institution term depth figure measure depth the financial sector through the lens domestic credit private sector bank gdp deposit money bank asset gdp and liquid liability gdp such measure reflect how deep the financial sector embedded the economy using competitiveness financial market will need separate paper own these four characteristic can measured two front financial institution and financial market this paper will only focus competitiveness financial institution latest data from global financial development database could seen that from thailand around the asean average for the period all measure figure competitiveness financial institution term efficiency figure measure efficiency the financial sector through the lens bank net interest margin bank return asset bank overhead cost total asset and bank return equity these measure reflect the ability bank squeeze down their cost and generate return should noted however that indonesia rather outlier whether term bank net interest margin and bank return asset pushing the average the sample above considerably these measure among asean thailand average over the sample period rank third term bank net interest margin second bank return asset and fourth bank return equity thus safe say that thai bank are somewhat middling term efficiency figure measure access the financial sector through the lens percentage population aged and above with account financial institution percentage population aged and above who made received digital payment the last year firm with bank loan line credit and small firm with bank loan line credit the first two measure reflect financial access household while the last two reflect financial access firm and smes figure competitiveness financial institution term access term household thailand above average term both access account financial institution and usage digital payment what should noted the significant increase percentage those who made received digital payment thailand from around percent almost percent reflecting the fast rise digital access thailand however term firm access bank loan line credit and small firm with bank loan line credit thailand rank last both measure excluding singapore whose number are not available this point will explored depth later the paper small firm and smes are key driver the thai economy and the inability thai firm access service from financial institution warrant investigation figure competitiveness financial institution term stability figure depicts measurement stability term regulatory capital riskweighted asset car common equity tier cet ratio liquidity coverage ratio lcr and percentage nonperforming loan npl total loan according figure using number from emeap the thai banking sector hold high buffer term car cet and lcr against possible shock ranking second the three area average over the sample period thailand however rank last term npl ratio the level thailand npl ratio however not much higher than the sample average roughly about percentage point above from the assessment the four dimension thai financial sector competitiveness namely depth access efficiency and stability reasonable say that the thai financial firm surveyed world bank enterprise survey include large medium and small with the number small firm dominating term number should note large firm can also access financial market their external funding source while small firm typically can not easily sector performing line with peer however one notable weakness the thai financial sector ability serve smes part competition the thai financial sector part ass competition the thai financial sector understanding competition important various study have shown that competition financial sector matter term allocative productive and dynamic efficiency well depth part start reviewing several literature how competition might affect competitiveness the financial sector reflected access efficiency and stability finally part measure the degree competition among thai bank dominant player the thai financial sector competition and competitiveness depth access efficiency and stability number study have attempted establish link between competition and competitiveness the financial sector particularly term access efficiency and stability competition and access research the effect competition firm access finance suggest complex relationship between competition and financial access with result depending factor such the level competition development and financial inclusion the country many finding indicate positive relationship between competition and firm financial access while others present evidence otherwise beck find for panel country that bank concentration raise firm financing obstacle and thus reduces the likelihood firm receiving bank finance with the effect being exacerbated more restriction bank activity based data from country claessens and laeven find that more see for example beck should noted that there not much literature that aim capture the relationship between competition and depth the financial sector financial depth capture the financial sector relative the economy the size bank other financial institution and financial market country taken together and compared measure economic output such could said that competition doe not have direct influence depth the financial sector but possibly work through access efficiency well stability since would need take account both the size the financial sector and the size economic output the economy competitive banking system exert positive effect firm access finance love and peria using lerner index for sample country find that competition positively related firm access finance using data from sample firm developing country study the effect financial market structure and financial inclusion firm performance chauvet and jacolin find that more competitive banking system favor firm growth only high level financial inclusion while bank concentration positive impact firm growth low level financial inclusion contrast fungacova using both structural concentration ratio and nonstructural lerner index indicator for panel firm from european country find that competition increase the cost credit and the effect stronger for smaller firm cetorelli and gambera also find that more concentrated banking system increase firm access finance however lack competition that lead high switching cost may strictly tie borrower individual institution making the borrower willing engage with other institution petersen and rajan and boot and thakor competition and efficiency intuitively competition expected provide welfare gain reducing monopoly rent and cost inefficiency and thus reducing the loan rate and encourage investment despite such intuition however theoretical literature provide argument for both positive and negative relationship between banking competition and efficiency the intuitive hick quietlife hypothesis suggests that competition positive influence efficiency higher degree banking competition should prevent monopoly power bank and therefore reduction banking price alternative efficientstructure hypothesis proposed demsetz suggests negative impact efficiency competition the most efficient bank would benefit from lower cost and therefore higher market share furthermore the reduced competition argued allowance for bank benefit from scale economy monitoring and form stronger relationship with customer the relatively scarce empirical literature the topic the relationship between competition and efficiency also suggests mixed result with both positive and negative relationship being found berger goldberg and rai using the data from the european banking industry punt and van rooij find that xefficiency help improve both bank profitability and market share average xefficiency and profitability have improved after bank consolidation however punt and van rooij find indication unfavorable price setting behavior result increased market power competition and stability competition also complex relationship with stability while there consensus the definition stability definite conclusion the relationship between competition and stability some literature opt define stability attempting define counterpart for example instability often refers individual systemic banking distress see for example claessens and carneiro intuitively when bank compete attract customer relaxing their lending standard this may lead bad credit culture where bank underprice risk increased competition can for example lead more access but also weaker lending standard observed the subprime lending market the see for example dell ariccia laeven and igan however many theoretical literature prior the depth global financial crisis suggest that tradeoff between competition and stability doe not necessarily xefficiency theory introduced harvey leibenstein who suggests that under imperfect competition firm can maintain some degree inefficiency other word level efficiency hold see for example carletti and hartmann boyd and niccolo allen and gale and perotti and suarez theoretical argument these paper prior the global financial crisis often rely modelling incentive structure bank and their behavior boyd and niccolo for example argues that there exists fundamental risk incentive mechanism that cause bank become riskier their market become more concentrated perotti and suarez suggests that the behavior bank today will affected both current and future market structure and the contestability level that their authority impose open system the future such dynamic model concentration level the present day doe not necessarily reduce risky lending the other hand expected increase future market concentration could lead bank pursue safer lending today carneiro suggests that there tradeoff between financial stability and efficiency financial intermediation specifically large buffer stock capital may actually curtail intermediation activity carniero also find that nonhighincome country were more protected from the global financial crisis but that protection appeared originated from efficient globally integrated but more capitalized financial system designing policy encourage more competition regulator thus need consider tradeoff among competition stability and access measuring competition the financial sector practice measuring competition rather difficult various measure used several literature can broadly classified into three group first group measure are market structure measure such concentration ratio number bank hirschmanherfindahl reduce complexity author such carneiro sometimes collapse the potential tradeoff among different factor into that between efficiency and stability index hhi assessment such measure consider only market share without allowing inference the competitive behavior bank for example these measure not take into account that bank with different ownership behave differently bank might not compete directly the same line business second group measure such hstatistic ass the reaction revenue output price input price and thus gauge the competitive behavior bank under perfect competition increase input price would cause marginal cost and marginal revenue move together while imperfect competition they not hstatistic imposes certain restrictive assumption the bank cost function and only valid the market the study equilibrium third group measure are indicator the regulatory framework that provide indication market contestability the banking system such measure include entry requirement formal and informal barrier entry for domestic and foreign bank activity restriction and other regulatory requirement which might prevent new entrant from challenging incumbent beck also suggest that the wider institutional framework such contractual and informational framework could also included among these indicator complexity measuring competition further compounded the question how properly define the relevant market measuring degree competition the thai banking sector using hstatistic while the stylized fact part have shown that competition the financial sector seems growing with bank now competing with financial market player nonbanks and payment service provider intensity such competition not clearly seen this section thus panzarosse hstatistic framework new empirical industrial organization neio approach ass the degree competition within the thai banking sector the framework measure the degree competition directly from market power player within the market according panzarosse degree competition within market high revenue firm the market are sensitive change input cost that firm need pas change input cost their customer the other hand revenue firm are not sensitive change input cost firm are considered have sufficient market power they can maintain their customer base without altering their product price even when there are change cost hstatistic can calculated first estimating how revenue trta the equation below are sensitive different input cost equation below equation hstatistic hstatistic then calculated the summation the elasticity trta different input cost equation hstatistic cont hstatistic near zero then change input cost not affect revenue firm the industry firm are thus price maker they have high degree market power note that panzarosse hstatistic different from the traditional approach such the herfindahlhirchman index hhi which measure the degree competition indirectly through concentration ratio the other hand hstatistic equal one then firm the industry pas all the change input cost the consumer thus these firm are effectively price taker operating perfectly competitive market hstatistic competition level monopoly collusive oligopoly monopolistic competition perfect competition table hstatistic and competition level hstatistic recently been used preferred method for measuring the degree competition within the banking industry contrast previous measure used such the hhi concentration index that infer the degree competition indirectly from the level market concentration hstatistic measure the degree competition directly assessing pricing behavior the firm recent year the use hstatistic measure degree competition the financial sector particularly the banking sector grown popularity and been applied quite extensively recent research such ventouri using data from suggests that hstatistic for the thai banking sector quite high also important note that there strand literature which argues that the level concentration good indicator competition for example neal banking competition the rhetoric and the reality adelaide contends that the level concentration measured concentration ratio hhi not enough determine the level competition the article take the view that contestability must also examined evaluating the ability for firm enter and exit market contestability issue that will examined the next section promoting competition see for example molyneux for major european country molyneux for japanese commercial bank bikker and haaf for industrialized country claessens and laeven for country study and liu for southeast asian banking market ass how degree competition the thai financial sector might have evolved over time the author apply the hstatistic framework the data from consolidated balance sheet thai commercial bank from the author estimated hstatistic using mixed effect model allow variation the coefficient equation over time examine the dynamic competition the dependent variable total revenue total asset while the independent variable are three type main cost namely funding cost labor cost and physical asset cost the control variable are total equity total asset fixed asset total asset and npl ratio reflect bank strategy and credit risk figure hstatistic for the thai banking sector consolidated balance sheet also include data from the bank subsidiary which include operation their nonbank subsidiary such credit card and personal loan nonconsolidated balance sheet and income statement contrast include only data from the bank own operation the estimation done with markov chain monte carlo mcmc sampling using stan the baysian probabilistic programming language accessed through the brms package the programming language created rkner with prior distribution the coefficient assumed normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation one reflecting the fact that the author not assume much what the coefficient might but that extreme value the coefficient are assumed very unlikely figure indicates that the degree competition thai banking sector remains high over the sample period although there are some intertemporal dynamic worth noticing the hstatistic dropped from the low around and before edging around suggesting that the degree competition did change over time allowing for uncertainty surrounding different estimation method mixed effect model with varying coefficient ols the result this paper are line with ventouri which indicate that the sector operating under monopolistic competition and consolidated revenue are relatively sensitive change cost limitation the hstatistic measure for financial sector competition while recent figure for thai banking sector hstatistic are relatively high should reminded that for most country data available for the calculation hstatistic are only banking sector data anything inferring degree competition from the hstatistic above requires least two caveat first while banking sector remains dominant many country thailand financial service are being offered not only bank but increasingly also nonbanks and financial market player competition the banking sector reflected the hstatistic thus doe not wholly reflect degree competition the financial sector second high competition reflected high hstatistic doe not necessary mean that bank are all competing serve all segment the population given that bank are deposit taker and bank failure could lead contagion and financial instability that impose great cost the economy regulation are often put restrict banking activity limiting bank potential diversify exploit scale and scope economy oecd such bank are dashed line figure represent upper and lower bound percent confidence band the hstatistic estimate only competing limited segment customer and market those allowed regulation and those with relatively low risk this second point should noted that despite hstatistic the thai banking being found high the percentage sme access bank finance remains low this quite puzzling since market where competition high demand should reasonably well met low sme access finance warrant attention given that smes are considered key driver the thai economy accounting for percent employment and percent value added gdp and many recent survey smes identified financial constraint and high funding cost one key area help needed see for example angklomkliew phekanonth nuntramas such could said that competitiveness the thai financial sector can still very much improved upon least term sme financial access even banking sector competition already quite high when seen through the lens hstatistic part the paper will explore more the bottleneck sme bank finance remains one key weak point competitiveness the thai financial sector part puzzle sme low access finance part analyzes puzzle arising from the analysis part iii and part despite high competition the thai banking sector sme access finance remains weak point this suggests that there are market failure sme access finance the point particularly important since smes are important for the thai economy whether term employment valueadded gdp part delf into this puzzle sme financing first examining what might bottleneck and market failure that limit sme access finance this done breaking down sme loan origination process and identifying bottleneck and market failure using result from survey and interview smes and bank credit officer part then examines the implication that the bottleneck and market failure have sme lending using data from million individual loan account smes later part review various initiative being done various player including bank fintech smes and regulator harness the power technology and data help alleviate some the key bottleneck and market failure sme financing lastly part discus how technology and data might used help unlock bottleneck and eliminate market failure the financial sector whole sme bank financing where are the bottleneck discussed earlier there seems both quantitative and qualitative gap sme financing despite the result part indicating that competition the thai banking sector measured hstatistic high such worth investigating what might the bottleneck that cause market failure sme bank financing why both quantity and quality gap still appear obstacle sme finance broad view reviewing various survey and study thai sme financing key obstacle sme access bank finance are found include the practice collateralbased lending whereby bank require smes pose asset such real estate property manufacturing equipment and financial security collateral for loan such practice prevents smes including those with high business potential but without sufficient amount asset posed collateral from accessing bank loan high borrowing cost which partly arises due the absence reliable financial information owing substandard accounting practice lack financial document for verification and substantive business plan the operator lack relevant experience such factor make bank deem smes being high risk and more likely become npls and thus charge smes higher borrowing cost government and regulator being well aware the problem sme financing have introduced number initiative reduce obstacle sme financing including credit guarantee scheme thai credit guarantee corporation partially eliminate collateral requirement traditional collateralbased lending several credit scheme were also introduced help reduce financing cost for targeted smes such those operating the ten scurve industry addition smes are provided with credit for investment technology and innovation and help enhance smes competitiveness and credit for smes upgrade their water air and waste treatment system line with the policy protect the environment and promote energy conservation nuntramas furthermore several sfis have stepped help with smes financing yet sme access finance remains low see for example angklomkliew phekanonth and nuntramas bottleneck sme loan origination micro view while number scheme and measure have been introduced the government and regulator eliminate obstacle sme financing such scheme and measure are rather the macro level specifically address the sme financing issue might still worthwhile drill down check what could the bottleneck sme financing the loan origination process and determine how these bottleneck might have caused market failure the author review several survey done smes and bank credit officer according bot regulatory guillotine project sme financing conducted between june september which representative various sme coalition and bank representative bottleneck sme loan origination are summarized table below action pain point market failure step sme loan origination borrower inquiry fill inquiry form and submit preliminary information manual process paper documentation lack data prescreening and data collection fill loan application and provide required document and additional document that highlight creditworthiness manual process paper documentation lack data verification underwriting credit decision quality control funding collection and default review for accuracy and completeness kyc borrower and request additional information needed run the application through process taking variety component into account credit score risk score and many lender will generate their own unique scoring criterion the application approved denied sent back the originator for additional information denial may revisited certain parameter are changed application would sent quality control where the final decision will analyzed against internal and external rule and regulation loan contract are signed and money will disbursed accordance with the contract manual process paper documentation lack data manual process paper documentation lack data others need collateral manual process paper documentation lack data manual process paper documentation lack data the loan due collect payment and interest the loan

information asymmetry unintended consequence regulation table example market failure sme loan origination cycle the bottleneck and market failure sme loan origination process suggest that manual process paper documentation and lack data are present various step loan origination process these bottleneck have resulted high transaction cost loan origination whether term time money and opportunity cost furthermore these bottleneck prevent effective use data construct accurate credit risk model without good credit risk model bank find difficult distinguish between those smes that might deserving loan but might not have adequate collateral good smes and those that might not deserving bad smes such difficulty compounded with the fact that smes themselves typically have higher credit risk than large firm resulted smes failure access financing the presence bottleneck sme loan origination suggests that sme lending costlier more timeconsuming and riskier when compared large corporate loan large corporate lending bank often have more reliable information hand possibly owing ongoing relationship well public information and audited financial statement that can used ass the risk the loan and can price the loan more accurately also quite safe say that for bank lend thb billion large corporate single transaction would take much time and effort than lend smes thb million each furthermore large corporate being large and wellorganized entity with verifiable and public information tends risky for bank lend when compared smes that are still young not wellsupported and with verifiable information these obstacle sme access bank finance reflect market failure various dimension information asymmetry where bank are unable easily ass risk consumer well enough and thus are opted collateralbased lending behavioral distortion resulting from high transaction cost whereby bank neglect sme lending favor other type lending despite potential immense demand from smes implication market failure sme bank financing ass how market failure might have affected sme bank financing this paper data from million individual sme loan contract from bot sme database smd and loan arrangement database lar ass how sme loan are distributed where smes are defined according the criterion set thailand ministry industry these loan contract are collected from thai commercial bank well six sfis mapping our sme loan contract data sme data from office sme promotion osmep the paper find that mere percent smes use loan from bank percent use loan from sfis while the majority percent not use loan from bank sfis reflecting either selfexclusion lack access loan they not use loan all despite the fact that the author can not distinguish smes that selfexclude from usage loan from bank sfis and those who actually lack access loan the fact that more than half smes not use loan from bank sfis should raise some concern smes often rely bank sfi credit for external funding they typically can not easily raise fund financial market other mean see for example yokoiarai and yoshino and nuntramas figure sme loan provided commercial bank location from figure could seen that sme loan provided thai commercial bank concentrated mainly bangkok and vicinity and the central region thailand figure size new sme loan provided bank drilling down sme loan size originated bank the result suggest that most the bank concentrate sme loan size larger than thb figure although the number loan below thb grew rapidly the past few year from than percent more than percent found that only two bank concentrated this small loan segment figure income sme customer who got new loan considering income smes who got new loan figure the number smes with income between thb million who are able get loan risen considerably over time again loan the lower income tier than one million baht and thb million concentrated mainly among two bank figure npls new sme loan over time looking npls smes loan size could also see that smaller sme loan are riskier than larger sme loan figure this consistent with our hypothesis that higher transaction cost and higher credit cost lending smaller borrower would lead bank lend larger firm with larger loan size figure sme loan size provided bank sfis from figure the result suggest that for tiny loan size sfis are key player meet smes financing need sfis account for around percent sme loan with size than thb and more than percent sme loan with size between thb figure sme customer bank and sfis figure sfis contribution sme financing table sme customer bank and sfis figure indicates that mediumsized enterprise use bank loan rather than sfi loan while the reverse true for smallsized enterprise however the presence sfis found greatly contribute sme financing especially smes area where bank are not concentrated for example rural area outside bangkok illustrated figure table illustrates that bank and sfis serve distinct group smes only percent smes have loan from both bank and sfis addressing sme financing challenge using technology and data bank borrower fintech and regulator despite having sfis stepped address market failure sme lending worth exploring whether bottleneck and market failure identified the previous section could also addressed harnessing the power technology and data digital disruption that ongoing various industry are also starting pervade into the financial sector digital disruption brought about innovative solution that harness the power technology and data solve pain point various industry sme financing the success harnessing the power technology and data seems require various player work tandem bank recent year bank many country acting alone sometimes working with fintech have come with number solution that could help unlocking the bottleneck sme financing some the solution relieve bottleneck sme credit origination identified from the bot regulatory guillotine project sme financing are summarized table below with many include the use technology and data step sme loan origination pain point borrower inquiry prescreening and data collection verification underwriting credit decision quality control funding manual process paper documentation lack data manual process paper documentation lack data manual process paper documentation lack data manual process paper documentation lack data others need collateral manual process paper documentation lack data others model accuracy manual process paper documentation lack data manual process paper documentation lack data collection and default manual process paper documentation lack data others market for collateral possible solution alleviate pain point online inquiry online comparison and online application digitization prescreening process ekyc digitization informationbased lending data sharing enhance credit risk model regulatory guillotine regulatory guillotine epayments regulatory guillotine table possible solution alleviate pain point sme loan origination borrower apart from bank this age digital disruption smes themselves borrower also have the potential leverage technology and help alleviate bottleneck sme loan origination process among other thing smes could digitize their business leverage cloudbased platform for accounting adopt digital payment and automate invoicing and settlement process create digital footprint substantiate their business activity and become eligible for finance digitalization and adoption technology smes however might require right incentive since they could incur shortterm cost for smes before longer term benefit including access finance are realized fintech thailand fintech player have also started emerge acting alone working with bank provide solution that help smes digitize their business and create digital footprint well help bank analyze those footprint using artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithm many these fintech firm focus providing solution that allow smes focus their core business taking care peripheral but necessary activity accounting and logistics for smes for example flowaccount cloudbased platform for business accounting online account management system that linked sme business the end each day total sale turnover and cost are updated flowaccount smes spend almost time bookkeeping effectively control their income and expense while account report can viewed anywhere and anytime currently large thai commercial bank already allows api link the account flowaccount customer sme online application lenddo credit and scb abacus the other hand are thai fintech player that have emerged leverage and various source data including those from social network platform and telecom company build credit score which will make easier for lender verify and make credit decision for smes and micro entrepreneur such fintech also often work with bank with scb abacus itself being subsidiary another large thai commercial bank apart from those fintech player that work with bank there are also fintech player that compete with bank least indirectly offering alternative source smes financing recent year peertopeer lending technology taken root asia particularly china singapore and indonesia business model allow lender and borrower link via online platform for borrower this mean that the underbanked are able secure loan where previously lack credit history posed considerable obstacle this may lead faster access capital for smes and much simplified process for reaching broader base potential investor rather than solely reliance bank thailand the bot first announced their intention regulate lending september and the bot issued notification regulating lending april the notification imposes requirement and condition for platform provider borrower and lender the applicant must also enter and pas the bot regulatory sandbox before launching their service the general public regulator regulator are also looking for way help bank and fintech leverage technology help mitigate sme financing problem both the bank thailand bot and security and exchange commission sec thailand have established regulatory sandbox that allow bank and fintech test new innovation that have the potential help alleviate bottleneck sme financing from ekyc debt financing and crowd funding platform figure reducing market failure using technology data and new player the case sme financing the importance data and data sharing one key market failure that occurs throughout the sme loan origination process information asymmetry data essential reducing asymmetric information and reduce the degree uncertainty associated with credit extension the accuracy credit risk model tends increase data pool becomes larger more and better data should help lender more precisely identify the probability loan default and nondefaults and thus reduce type and type error lending sme database create more value from data many advanced economy have opted create platform integrate generalize and share sme data among financial institution and other player such fintech firm japan for example the japan risk data bank rdb and credit risk database crd cover most financial institution including credit union japan rdb anonymously cover credit information company and the crd cover million company nemoto and koreen addition financial data data transaction through company bank account information are collected and constantly updated france the fiben fichier bancaire enterprise database collect relatively comprehensive set data smes nemoto and koreen such data been used for loan review interest rate setting and portfolio management they have also contributed the advancement credit risk analysis bank thailand osmep the process trying connect database that are pertinent for sme credit analysis but the final design yet decided efactoring platform recent year there have also been initiative various country including mexico japan and india create efactoring platform harnessing the power data and technology make factoring more efficient through factoring smes can obtain working capital selling their account receivables the right receive payment from buyer sme product factor lender discount pain point typical factoring process include information asymmetry and search cost smes and factor might not know each other could take time verify whether the account receivables are legitimate and that they had not already been sold someone else doublefinancing problem the electronic nature efactoring factoring one the main type sme lending identified berger and udell which include financial statement lending which lending based informative financial statement and expected future cash flow small business credit scoring lending based hard information about the sme owner well the firm relationship lending lending based information through contact over time with the sme owner and the local community assetbased lending where subset the firm asset pledged collateral and primary source repayment factoring involves the purchase account receivables from sme lender known factor fixed asset lending lending against asset that are longlived and are not sold the normal course business equipment motor vehicle real estate leasing which involves the purchase fixed asset lender known lessor and then simultaneously enters into rental contract with the lessee the borrower that specified the payment schedule the first three are already informationbased lending which could directly enhanced with technology and data while the latter four typically are seen more collateralbased type lending platform ensure that the process cheaper faster more transparent and more secure than normal factoring process efactoring platform data account receivables are verified and entered into the platform trusted party secured way and shared only needtoknow basis among smes buyer sme product whose account receivables are issued against and factor which may include bank and also fintech some case party can work seamlessly based the data presented the platform some the efactoring platform smes can even post their account receivables onto the platform and interested factor including bank could come and bid for those account receivables those account receivables that have been successfully bided are marked such the case india three license have been the central bank bank and fintech firm operate efactoring platform and each the platform database are connected each other and record are ensured consistency using distributed ledger technology dlt guard against doublefinancing and fraud see ruksapol part lesson learned policy recommendation and conclusion part have discussed sme finance key pain point reflecting gap thai financial sector competitiveness have discussed the bottleneck that might have hampered the ability bank efficiently lend smes and explore how technology and data might help alleviate the bottleneck discussed part harness the power technology data and competition help improve sme finance various player would need work tandem whether bank work with fintech come with new solution smes work with fintech and bank create digital footprint competition from fintech alternative finance should also spur more innovation from bank themselves going forward given the ongoing digital disruption legitimate ask how the ability harness the power technology data and competition unlock bottleneck sme financing might applied reduce market failure other part the financial sector part drawing from the analysis done part along with reviewing lesson learned from various country the author tease out guiding principle that might applied help reduce market failure and improve country overall financial sector competitiveness lesson learned and guiding principle for policy recommendation the key question here how harness the power technology data and competition help reduce market failure and improve the competitiveness the thai financial sector the digital era reviewing the case sme financing along with initiative various country harness the power digital disruption identify three guiding principle that might help guide the thai financial sector improves competitiveness the digital era interoperability interoperability this context mean the ability for data shared transaction made across different platform interoperability beneficial the improvement financial sector competitiveness least three area reduction information asymmetry collaboration and competition among different player the capture network value reduction information asymmetry discussed part the ability integrate generalize and share sme data among various player would allow for more efficient loan review interest rate setting and portfolio management lender well contribute the advancement credit risk model such this well help reduce information asymmetry which key market failure credit origination this concept applies not only sme financing but also retail and corporate financing the digital era more digital footprint are being created variety way and most likely different platform including social medium ecommerce epayments and the near future with the arrival the internet thing iot capture the most value from such immense and diverse source data requires seamless integration generalization and sharing across platform other word interoperability among different platform will key help harness data that arise from separate digital platform and reduce information asymmetry collaboration and competition apart from reduction information asymmetry interoperability could also enhance collaboration and stimulate healthy competition the australia hong kong and interoperability through open banking and standard api initiative also been highlighted key ensure collaboration and competition among bank and fintech while open banking many meaning the gist that allows data customer one bank shared electronically another bank fintech firm the customer give consent term lending this mean customer can give consent for financial statement held one bank seamlessly shared with another bank that the other bank can have more complete view the customer and offer lending term that are more attractive and accurate the risk that customer the concept can also applied customer desiring optimize his saving and investment whereby the customer give consent allowing fintech firm aggregate and present information from his account saving security and mutual fund several bank one place and help him optimize his allocation fund among the account interoperability could help spur collaboration fintech could work with bank provide innovative product interoperability could also spur competition there will lower switching cost for customer shopping product from one bank another they see fit and thus bank and fintech will compete innovate and improve the efficiency their service capturing network value interoperability also essential capture network value china the emergence bigtech company such alibaba and tencent highlight the issue interoperability data from alibaba and tencent can not integrated and shared the lack interoperability between the two mean that data from one platform can not easily combined for even more accurate analysis payment also can not made directly across account the two platform the humongous size these two platform however compensates for the lack interoperability both alibaba and tencent have their own separate ecosystem each with many hundred million user typically country whose size the population much than million the lack interoperability could result the inability player effectively capture network value market becomes too fragmented robust ecosystem seen the case sme financing different player play different role collaborating and competing help bring the power technology and data help solve bottleneck and market failure broader financial sector perspective harness the power digital disruption robust ecosystem will also needed fintech can bring technology and knowhow payment solution biometrics and help alleviate bottleneck other domain besides sme financing bank meanwhile can also adopt process automation many their business process and collaborate with fintech bank can also collaborate with ecommerce social network platform bigtech company area such customer acquisition behavioral data analysis and colending many country the regulator also introduced new type licensing encourage new player with new technology come the financial sector and serve the underserved segment including smes and retail for example hong kong and singapore recently introduced virtual bank license for new type bank with physical branch these bank will rely digital channel for interfacing with their customer and thus save cost staff and physical premise being startup these new type bank will also not burdened with costly and inefficiency legacy system they can operate fraction the cost traditional bank and are more likely able serve very small customer with digitalization and the use technology they will able ass the customer more granular manner and thus provide product that are tailored individual customer need whether term the loan which may priced daily deposit which can offer more attractive rate nudge saving behavior meanwhile the success harnessing the power technology and data also requires widespread adoption technology the user financial service themselves for user adopt any new technology they would need see that benefit would outweigh the cost given that many the benefit technology adoption might occur later stage the digital footprint that will enable the user access financial service cheaper cost later while some the cost are upfront the cost upgrading the system and the cost associated with digitalization process right incentive structure whether from financial service provider from the regulator will key adaptive forward looking and agile regulatory framework given more diverse player this ecosystem many regulator are still grappling with the complexity that the new ecosystem might bring the one hand the regulator might need adopt more activitybased approach regulation rather than purely entitybased regulation this new ecosystem bank nonbank player fintech and bigtech might competing with bank certain market segment lending and payment such activity regulation might need ensure that there level playing field between kyc bank payment service and kyc wallet provider service however given limited resource the regulator the regulator might also need regulate the basis riskbased proportionality supervisor might need emphasize more examination systemically important institution which may not necessarily bank however many case financial regulator might not necessarily have the legal power examine for example bigtech firm unless they have pertinent license issued the regulator figure how can technology data and competition harnessed broader level the order reduce market failure conclusion the paper ass competitiveness the thai financial sector four dimension depth efficiency access and stability the paper find the thai financial sector compare reasonably well those asean peer except access bank credit firm and small firm this point particularly poignant since smes are key driver the thai economy the paper also ass the degree competition among thai bank the dominant player the thai financial sector using panzarrosse hstatistic framework the paper find consistently high degree competition over the sample period with relatively high hstatistic throughout the period the high degree competition taken together with sme lack access bank financing creates puzzle competition among thai bank high why doe sme access bank credit remain low analyzing result from various study and interview the paper identifies various bottleneck present sme loan origination process including manual process paper documentation and lack data these bottleneck make sme lending costly timeconsuming and risky using data from million individual loan contract from thai bank and six sfis the paper find that only few bank are attempting penetrate the sme market lower tier loan size and income smaller sme loan however are found also riskier their percentage npls are higher bank lending smes are also found concentrated bangkok and large province the paper find sfis good complement commercial bank both term their focus smaller size loan offered smes and their geographical coverage still when mapped sme data from osmep more than half smes are not using credit from bank sfis the age digital disruption however the paper find that bank fintech smes and regulator are all attempting harness the power technology and data help alleviate the bottleneck sme lending thailand bank are automating their process some thai fintech firm are collaborating with bank offer innovative solution and product while others are competing with bank offering platform for alternative finance smes themselves are also automating their process and create digital footprint regulator meanwhile are also adopting more agile and forward looking approach regulation order reduce unintended consequence regulation teasing out lesson learned from various initiative aimed help alleviate bottleneck sme financing along with lesson learned from other country other segment the financial sector the paper identifies three common theme that should help guide the design financial landscape the digital era interoperability infrastructure that will help reduce information asymmetry allow for collaboration and competition and create network value robust ecosystem with various type player including new type digital player competing and collaborating better serve the need customer and adaptive forward looking and agile regulatory framework that will help foster innovation that serve customer need without compromising financial stability consumer protection appendix appendix equilibrium test based panzar and rosse
