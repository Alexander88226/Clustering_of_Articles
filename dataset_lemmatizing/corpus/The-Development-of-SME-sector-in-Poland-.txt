more favorable situation the cooperative sector about per cent employee worked enterprise having employee although should taken into consideration that state industrial enterprise employed approximately seven time more people than the cooperative one the relation similar the case state and private sector this partly resulted from the law obligatory till the end that private enterprise

sector published and entitled government policy towards small and medium size enterprise until poland the were marked steady growth the private sector significant rise growth occurred when the government removed the majority administrative barrier preventing private firm from entering the market further change economic environment caused next increase the number private firm the number private firm increased while the number state enterprise grew the industrial output the private sector increased the same time industrial output state sector fall result private firm share total industrial output over against only some estimate put importance about this difference caused the existence shadow economy poland employment the private sector outside agriculture reached about total employment the end the the gdp structure number gross value added generated private enterprise within these gdp generated private firm created small enterprise and medium enterprise these data bring the conclusion that polish gdp generated the smes sector when only total gdp generated large company according the structure smes output can observe trend that great part them operates with trade and repair sector around the other branch are construction and industry communication real estate and other service activity gemini manufacturing transport poland shadow economy see also gikas wisniewski landau charemza gronicki quandt and schneider the second important figure the number people working smes comparing the whole economy there were slightly above million people employed the economy excluding agriculture fishery and forestry whereas almost million people working small and medium enterprise gemini looking smes essential contribution generating polish gdp and the employment more than half the working population clearly show the sector real importance for the development the economy the last point the total number small firm operating the market poland there were small active enterprise medium and large enterprise numbered and respectively gemini polish sme represented all active enterprise and provides for almost million job for the last three year polish smes have experience negative factor due the general slowdown economy decrease number small firm and sme employment recorded however the sme sector turned out more resistant unfavorable condition than bigger enterprise comparing statistical data number company per ten thousand inhabitant polish economy and european union member can observe that there were company with employee poland company employee poland and company employee poland barrier development small and medium sized enterprise one the most important condition for the success the economic transformation the existence entrepreneurial talent the population and the influence the cultural and social environment cornwall some expert consider that the era central administration and economic planning considerably shaped the norm value judgment and social orientation the population and consequence negatively influenced their entrepreneurial spirit the opposite view concludes that cultural influence not have fundamental effect the entrepreneurial ability evident many type society difference are caused rather the framework condition for economic activity such the nature property right for poland instance relatively small step towards liberalization the led rapid increase private economic activity the population therefore reacting positively change the framework condition however many precondition which would allow entrepreneurial potential develop and grow freely are not met problem can identified lack human capital with marketing business management knowhow strategic planning experience enterprise culture employee motivation training system and lack qualified manager well the financing smes further serious obstacle development entrepreneurial potential the continued deformed market structure the industrial sector and the resulting lack competition other obstacle are state bureaucracy and administration and the difficulty applying new economic law the employee the state administration were unable deal with the new economic legislation the owner private firm and potential entrepreneur the essential problem still the rather stressed relationship between state employee and the commercial sector individual entrepreneur who often suffer mistreatment representative state institution have great difficulty recognizing their counterpart the supposed helping hand the state for private initiative during the era central planning private saving and capital achievement were permitted poland though they were limited range entrepreneur can not usually develop longterm stable financial basis from personal saving nor doe selffinancing tend provide sufficient capital for investment the access small and medium sized enterprise credit facility from bank and financial support programme still limited addition there remains general lack risk capital this situation not only slows down the creation firm but also negative impact business operation such financing working capital investment ribnikar there are number reason for the financial difficulty faced smes large part the problem rooted the role the banking system many the new bank were illiquid they had inadequate equity capital and unwilling unable service their loan the lack institutional infrastructure the regional level the absence branch office creates further difficulty for smes the still underdeveloped competitive structure the banking industry create further financial blockage the lack expertise the bank smallscale credit provision well the continued existence many bank centralized and inflexible decisionmaking mechanism are important factor the frequent negative credit decision against small and medium sized enterprise they are usually provide the demanded level security the bank are often cautious their negotiation with the firm and tend avoid risk the factor that spur polish smes improve innovativeness apposed table descending order seem concern mainly the easier access capital and

different group view this context the branch leasing undergone quite radical change mainly due new legal regulation until the second half the the leasing market poland dominated small contract especially leasing truck telecommunication and equipment finally december leasing fully regulated civil tax and accounting aspect the most popular form leasing poland are operating leasing finance leasing with automatic transfer ownership purchase option and sale and lease back polish accounting law own property attribution principle that differentiate between operating leasing and finance leasing these criterion closely follow the gaap according polish law operating lease structure ensure onbalance financing term accounting and tax deductibility lease payment including upfront payment result this financing instrument improve the lessee liquidity ensure tax benefit due accelerated lease payment and purchase option value lower than book value the other hand financial leasing ensure benefit from economical ownership lease object depreciation and interest lease payment tax deductible and asset from group asset classification under polish tax regulation possibility accelerated depreciation month hire purchase and leasing can provide considerable benefit business but they are not suitable for every business for every purchase there are number consideration made hire purchase leasing agreement medium term facility that can not withdrawn provided the payment are made the uncertainty that may associated with facility such overdraft which are repayable demand removed however long term both hire purchase and commitment and may not possible could prove costly terminate them early the other hand the regular nature the payment and their usually fixed amount help business forecast cash flow the business able compare the payment leasing agreement are with the expected revenue and profit generated the use the asset however the company wish alter the payment frequency amount this will have agreed advance with the finance company most case the payment are fixed throughout the hire purchase lease agreement business will know the beginning the agreement what their repayment will this can beneficial time low stable rising interest rate but may appear expensive interest rate are falling some agreement such those for longer term the finance company may offer the

finance company retains legal ownership the equipment least until the end the agreement this normally give the finance company better security than lender other type loan overdraft facility the finance company may therefore able offer better term the decision provide finance small medium sized business depends that business credit standing and potential because the finance company security the equipment could tip the balance favor positive credit decision hire purchase and leasing could provide finance for the entire cost the equipment there may however need put down deposit for hire purchase make one more payment advance under lease may possible for the business tradein other asset which they own mean raising the deposit small and medium sized business wish rely mix finance hire purchase and leasing can extend the range facility available and give them access medium term finance however important weigh the interest and other cost the different form finance available against the benefit provided hire purchase and leasing remove the need tie resource capital equipment spreading the cost and timing the expenditure coincide with the expected future revenue flow the business hire purchase and leasing give the business the choice how take advantage capital allowance the business profitable can claim own capital allowance through hire purchase outright purchase not tax
