speed and efficiency payment clearing and settlement reducing cost and changing the way people access financial service and conduct financial transaction technology can reduce the need for financial intermediary specialized financial firm bank and nonbanks alike that facilitate transaction between two more party push intermediary change their internal structure possibly leading partnership and acquisition iii induce the entry new intermediary while displacing older one technology can alter the market imperfection across the financial system which underpin the need for trusted intermediary can reduce asymmetric information limited knowledge one counterparties transaction facilitate the matching party transaction and reduce transaction cost technology can also affect the incentive for intermediary horizontally vertically integrated offer multiple service endusers doe universal bank acquire upstream supplier finally technology can alter barrier entry for new intermediary compete against incumbent this context look two technology artificial intelligence and blockchain distributed ledger technology and their impact financial inclusion india artificial intelligenceartificial intelligence been defined the theory and development computer system able perform task requiring human intelligence the origin back the when alan turing published paper possibility machine with true intelligence been defined the scientific understanding the mechanism underlying thought and intelligent behaviour and their embodiment machine association for the advancement artificial intelligence aaai the array technology includes audio processing knowledge representation speechtotext deep learning expert system natural language processing machinelearning robotics and symbolic logic general purpose technology many these have the potential applied the fintech sector and promotion financial inclusion their popularity picked after when ibm microsoft google and facebook started investing and

player who could successfully navigate the landscape and could cause oligopolistic market accenture hence there need strengthen research and development ensure ease entry and sharing technological breakthrough the financial stability board fsb point out that the black box aspect might also problematic there lack clarity with respect ethical consideration responsibility governance and regulation such application the rapid pace adoption the industry call for regulatory oversight and policy intervention the possibility open source platform that share framework and tool need explored accenture integration may also render httpsaitopicsorgtagartificial intelligence tech monitor janmar use blockchain and aritificial intelligence promote financial inclusion india many job obsolete but open new one this warrant skilling future workforce and retraining existing workforce most importantly regulatory practice have stepped ensure that development and innovation follow fair market practice range legal issue related privacy and data protection consumer protection antidiscrimination and liability issue and crossborder issue may arise with further development the industry fintech company are increasingly relying artificial intelligencebased technology expand the unsecured loan business and tap client who were previously unserviceable however too early the day ass how this working blockchainblockchain particular type data structure used some distributed ledger which store and transmits data package called block that are connected each other digital chain blockchains employ cryptographic and algorithmic method record and synchronize data across network immutable manner world bank distributed ledger technology dlt also known blockchain technology refers protocol that allows peertopeer transfer asset over the internet dlt novel way sharing data across multiple data store ledger world bank the shared database allows peertopeer transaction without requiring central authority this technology creates immutable ledger all activity across peertopeer transaction transaction through the dlt are cryptographically logged block data which when verified member the distributed network creates permanent record the transaction the network both medium transaction and mean recording since the blockchain file belongs all member botton the peertopeer system mean that information can only modified majority member thus making securethe technology characterized decentralized network absolute digitization and realtime transfer there are intermediary and trustless exchange maintenance high quality data with reliability longevity and immutability process integrity and transparency fast transaction enabling reduced cost required for settlement the promise tamperproof recordkeeping and data security make possible for bank transition from independent ledger universal and encrypted distributed ledger system and also improve upon their product offering distributed ledger technology can used execute transaction real time making irreversibleundeletable transaction entry into dlt copy which would available all participating entity there are five key component blockchain cryptography peertopeer network consensus mechanism distributed ledger and validity rule network participant can independently verify the state and integrity blockchain there are permissioned blockchain and permissionless blockchain the former only authorized member are part the network here possible customize access control structure and consensus algorithm that who can view what and who verifies what can controlled permissioned blockchain greater potential for adoption the near future than permissionless chainsspecific area with the potential for application include maintenance kyc record application the dlt blockchain cryptography and smart contract the technology can successfully applied payment process smart contract smart contract computer program would one the most immediate application financial service they would emulate regular contractual construct and could made partially fully selfexecuting self enforcing both such smart contract could replace standing instruction electronic clearing service etc httpsdigitalchamberorgassetsblockchainandfinancialinclusionpdfhttpsdigitalchamberorgassetsblockchainandfinancialinclusionpdf variety cryptographic technique including oneway hash function ensures near full proof security this achieved using publicprivate key combination generate the hash value that information visible and can processed only the person for whom intended equally privileged and capable participant the blockchain algorithm that determines the ordering transaction environment that ensures the party follow the protocol and prevent unethical practice this help maintain the single state the transaction list transaction asset grouped together cryptographically linked block smart contract can conceptualized computerized transaction protocol that executes the term contract the general objective are satisfy common contractual condition such payment term lien confidentiality and even enforcement minimize exception both malicious and accidental and minimize the need for trusted intermediary cong and smart contract are one the most anticipated application blockchain technology smart contract often emulate the logic regular contractual construct and therefore many kind contractual clause can made partially fully selfexecuting selfenforcing both payment smart contract can replace standing instruction electronic clearing service and bill payment common set rule the network for example what transaction are considered valid how the ledger get updated ripple and tangle are two other important dlts ripple consensus ledger confirm transaction and being used among bank worldwide payment system tangle created for model while ripple simplifies settlement tangle verification method remove transacting cost both are nonmineable see httpsstockhaxcomblogdistributedledgertech monitor janmar use blockchain and aritificial intelligence promote financial inclusion india authentication blockchain could also used authenticate identity and document through digital blockchain recorded version this would have application kyc authentication due diligence etc central kyc related use case which blockchain can have potential useblockchain can not implemented all use case for digitization all transaction related problem most useful when multiple party share data and need view common information blockchain can employed effective solution least three out following prerequisite are met pwc multiple party share data multiple party need common view the information hand multiple party update data when action undertaken multiple party need recorded and the data coming from multiple party need updated requirement for verification when necessary build trust amongst party and make them understand that their action that are being recorded are validintermediaries add complexity when transaction dependent multiple intermediary and their presence increase the cost and complexity the transactioninteractions are time sensitive when beneficial for the business reduce delay and expedite transaction transaction interact when transaction created multiple participant interact and depend each other the most important feature blockchain with respect payment process would reduced turnaround time more intermediary faster authentication increased transparency reduced cost and faster reconciliation also lead reduced risk data auditability and resilience transfer value via blockchain take approximately minute which might not work for retail payment developed economy but developing country might increase the speed transaction significantly reduction elimination operational and financial inefficiency and other friction including improved endtoend settlement speed use blockchain dlt finance dlt and blockchain technology are immense importance the financial service industry because which there much interest use among stakeholder the indian banking financial service and insurance bfsi industry

payment data from the unique identification authority india uidai database into the engine and come with the best possible product the customer can offered how can blockchain help financial inclusion opening account individual can open account deposit cash through their phone usability account transfer fund using blockchain take minute which faster compared such transfer through conventional mean developing country cost the financial institution payment via blockchain not need tech monitor janmar use blockchain and aritificial intelligence promote financial inclusion india through the national payment system and hence there need physical branch the cost transfer fund percentage the value the transferred and make payment more feasible currency risk individual and smes have the option adding fund the fiat currency this shift the volatility risk the financial intermediary fis are using bitcoin vehicle currency the dollar the dominant vehicle currency and used trade using boitcoin vehicle currency and blockchain platform mean that the recipient and the sender are not exposed the volatility the virtual currency conclusion this article examine how and blockchain technology can contribute financial inclusion while the potential blockchain technology general and smart contract particular make financial service more efficient cost effective and inclusive not disputed there concern with respect scalability interoperability cost impact and regulation lack understanding and expertise also create cultural barrier making movement away from legacy system more difficult blockchain technology can game changer widely adopted and there agreement the technology architecture that need put place for adoption far concerned nascent technology and there are challenge such transaction speed verification process and data limit regulatory status uncertain and there are integration concern within organization account the existing ecosystem scarcity talent and cost involved the potential both these technology achieving greater financial inclusion undoubtedly clear whether that will happen will depend many factor including those highlighted above well how quickly these
