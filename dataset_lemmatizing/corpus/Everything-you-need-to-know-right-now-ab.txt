specialist international trade publication well chairing and speaking international eventsthetsecuredtlendert marchttttttttt appears there some confusion what people mean supply chain finance how would you define taylor there confusion which led the international chamber commerce icc bringing together representative the various bank trade and invoice finance association and technology provider order come with uniform glossary termsi personally would define supply chain finance those eventdriven finance solution that are triggered the different need which occur throughout the purchase pay forecast fulfil and order cash trade cycle within this would also include solution such assetbased lending and receivables finance that are calculated and secured against the changing value receivables and inventoryhowever the market reference supply chain finance normally relates the provision buyercentric approved payable finance program such program are also commonly labelled supplier finance approved payable finance reverse factoring the majority such program are banksponsored and require buyer confirmation seller receivable against which the funder taking the risk the buyer and costing accordingly will settle the receivable with the seller buyer approval and collect the payment from the buyer the payment date most program were formed around the need the major corporate looking for offbalance sheet solution use financial dominance reduce cost across supply chain while maximizing own cash position nonbank finance company and some bank are now adapting the approved payable model support buyer the subinvestment grade and midmarket sector who wish take advantage the workingcapital benefit such program but not have the need for the balance sheet treatment that major corporate demandszax most commonly supply chain finance refers buyercentric datadriven financing based the buyer confirmation that invoice approved pay the structure itself used for long time under other name particularly spain and latin america but moved the mainstream with the advance technology allowing uploading data straight from the buyer erp system core advantage supply chain finance scf the ability separate credit risk something that bank are quite familiar with from performancecontractual risk something traditional bank have very limited understanding two possible extension from this definition would seller opposed buyercentric approach where seller can finance portfolio invoice confirmed buyer this capitalizes core advantage supply chain finance separation credit and performance risk while allowing expend with different salesmarketing channel seller buyer buyercentric datadriven financing where performance risk still remains such preexport financing but better understoodmanaged due improved information availability while these product are higher risk than traditional scf they are addressing vital customer need and also providing access higher revenue and margindespite recent growth the use approved payable finance often termed reverse factoring supplier finance still limited what you see the core barrier and challenge widespread usage and you see these being met taylor taken much longer for the solution become established than originally envisaged yet today early proponent quite proud the progress that been made and while there are still challenge doubt that they will overcome and the solution will continue evolvethe challenge have changed over time the early day the bank were slow embrace the need for the solution convoluted new product approval process competing investment case and fear cannibalization existing product became barrier innovation and remain today issue were also faced within the buyer organization where successful implementation the program relied upon the cooperation and collaboration treasury and procurement yet there little interaction previously between these two area and they often had conflicting agenda there were also some impediment obtaining the balance sheet treatment required the corporate structuring the program meet accountingregulatory provision had overcome and even today there are difference opinion within the accountancy professiona challenge that remains today supplier adoption from financial standpoint the program best suited major corporates purchasing from the developing world where local source funding are restricted and more expensive however onboard supplier these region more difficult most the program provider whether bank third party not have the onground footprint provide the supplier contact and coverage needed and are hampered increasing level kyc and compliancea consequence the growing popularity the solution that supplier may faced with having access multitude different platform more their customer put supplier finance program placea further consequence the stickiness the proposition for the lender the impact debt capacity the program grows combat this some bank are now taking position each other program and view extension this collaboration that will assist the bank and other provider meeting the challenge previously expressedttfortintegratedtsolutionstfortcommercialtfinancetprofessionalstdownloadtcf sttmediatkittattwwwcf acom bank traditionally were proprietary their approach they initially shunned collaboration with thirdparty platform provider and took exception when those company made direct approach their customer the corporates have forced the change choosing use thirdparty conduit that enables them arrange multiple funding choice and therefore lessen the dependency any one bankthere also reason for the bank not extend cooperation with each other would make sense for example for european bank needing onboard supplier india team with local bank carry out supplier adoption and kyc and possibly take risk share the program zax while paper scf great deal for supplier the major complexity that the people who need sign the agreement pay the cost and deal with variety legal accounting and technical issue such compliance with accounting requirement under and most importantly various restriction and covenant lending agreement are supplier not the buyer with whom the financial institution are discussion may difficult for buyer procurement team effectively perform the role sale force for the finance provider driving buyer adaptation especially selling highly complicated product that from the supplier point view requires multiple decisionmaking including that treasury finance director sale legal tax etc this often result large and supposedly attractive deal with close zero utilization the other important factor that while the biggest benefit and the highest political dividend fund real smes supplying major buyer high setup cost from kyc technical setup making onboarding the biggest challenge and reality mean that many provider ultimately focus largersize supplier where benefit are obvious the third issue would actual buyer for which the main benefit scf accounting treatment they have access funding the same cheaper rate can just pay quicker and get price advantage such accounting arbitrage not vital leading significant competition scf from dynamic discounting programssince there been explosion alternativefintech company entering the market you see their presence disruptive complementary the established supply chain finance practitioner taylor think the explosion alternative finance that followed the financial crash reflects changing world where the bank faced with liquidity capital and regulatory concern became inwardly focused and today many still struggle with who and what they wish remain slow embracing the new technology that typify the fintech erawhether the sector will seen disruptive complementary the bank remains seen bank need determine whether costeffective continue trying financial supermarket focus those service where they can make the required return some the alternative finance market believe their technologyled proposition will encourage the bank work through them rather than against themi not think will all plain sailing for the alternative finance provider the end the day matter how technologically advanced the business system and operating model money being advanced what effect are cashstrapped smes requiring working capital andor investment the history factoring show that even with strong ongoing riskmanagement framework bad debt and fraud can still happen think the jury still out whether the desktop and algorithmic risk model deployed the alternative finance sector will robust enough protect their investor community will only take few horror story destroy confidence attract the regulator take more interesti see the continued development network and the sharing rich data between the different trading party being more potential threat the bank and other supply chain finance practitioner others will find way harness this information develop more responsive eventdriven financethe growth dynamic discounting and corporate selfadministered and funded payment program evidence that with much liquidity currently the market will not take much disintermediate the banking sector however all this not necessarily good for the smes supplier servicing those major corporates who stand lose some their independence and ability resist the policy and direction the major corporate the recent bad publicity the procurement practice being employed some the food and grocery sector evidence this zax indeed large number company entered the market unlike the early platform focused mainly connectivity between company and bank facilitate scf and some the newer one providing solution dynamic discounting large number player are also trying disintermediate the banking system creating both alternative origination and distribution certain extent this similar what the securitization market achieved especially prior the crisis where large portion many product loan through clos mortgage through rmbs and cmb were originated and distributed outside the traditional banking sector similar trend seen trade receivables where abcp conduit were playing increasingly large role financing trade receivables particularly the where before the crisis assetbacked commercial paper abcp conduit accounted for around total receivable financing while europe only with factoring and invoice discounting accounting for the rest while both securitization and althetsecuredtlendert marchttttttttt ternative finance are aiming disintermediate the banking sector the principal difference that securitization aim package asset like trade receivables into rated standardised tradable security that can purchased institutional investor highly competitive price while most alternative finance platform are distributing individual raw asset have real competitiveness the alternative finance need have least one three advantage access lower cost funding better risk managementappetite process efficiency far have not come across case where alternative financier material fundingcost advantage within the mainstream market this unlikely major driving force some although few player claim have advantage quality risk management due better informationdecision process this can driving force providing bank will not catch and the main reason for them not catch that their risk management regulatory driven which doesn always correspond actual risk however this still leaf the question funding cost term risk appetite this the easiest area get the business bottom fishing the risk bank are not ready take and being major driver far but one need watch what will happen including regulatory response once serious default will start occuring particularly for unsophisticated investor process efficiency likely the core differentiator many the player have quicker and more efficient developing cycle utilizing supplier network capitalizing other process such einvoicing and can clearly provide differentiation however most achievement are either supporting dynamic discounting that view fintech but not alternative finance predominately rely bank for funding unlikely that process advantage itself can compensate for inefficient funding risk model having said the above believe alternative finance bright future the mainstream but still far from tipping point within the core banking supply chain finance market financing supply chain extends more than covering payable inventory and receivables finance are also working capital tool what you see the major opportunity and challenge the provision these solution taylor view that the use data support funding across the supply chain remains major opportunity for those willing embracelink with the technology and network that are already capturing the data flow the financial supply chain however capturing data not end itself the financier still need work out the risk framework and weighting prepared give the different stage the trade cycle for example providing finance against purchase order carry more performance risk than when the good are manufactured and ready for shipment yet the level financing required the purchase order stage lower only raw material and production cost need coveredalso the advent technology and globalization continues boost crossborder trade quite simple state that capturing data financier better equipped provide financing structure support the cashflow need the supply chain however financier are restrained credit and regulatory concern when operating outside their home market become true financier across supply chain requires much greater cooperation and collaboration between different financier the swift bank payment obligation bpo step towards facilitating this and will hopefully pave the way for further initiative the finance industry work out how best utilise this frameworkassetbased lending remains key financing tool with specialist provider better equipped evaluate and manage the performance risk associated with the financing inventory and debtor and integral part supply chain finance view the assetbased lender are more experienced and better equipped than the european providing such solution and have much better handle the different asset component which inventory key however there remains dependency receivables the primary asset and source repayment such structure and although the market changing developing inventorybased financing solution remains both opportunity and challenge further challenge abl and receivables finance the ability provide more selective approach rather than the all nothing which prominent today many company are attracted alternative finance provider because they will cater selected invoice discounting rather than the whole turnover approach that dominates the invoice finance industrymajor corporates are especially critical the bank for not having the system place scale both their receivables finance and trade finance structure here the bank are often restricted because dependency manual control with most resorting excel spreadsheet manage their portfolioszax the core principle supply chain finance separation credit and operational risk can equally applied receivable finance particularly where supply chain are highly integrated the best example would distribution finance the ability combine technological solution verify buyer confirmation and riskmanagement tool such credit insurance address both performance and credit risk single costefficient solution performance risk dilution contractual dispute fraud etc are far the major limiting factor for receivable finance making mainly domain for specialised player such factoring and abl using scf tool there can massively open the market and eventually cause sea change pricing and availability this may especially true some program that ttfortintegratedtsolutionstfortcommercialtfinancetprofessionalstdownloadtcf sttmediatkittattwwwcf acom viding appropriate module support scf program little marginal cost corporate the whole process fully justified regardless use scf then bank certify appropriate provider and therefore able offer product whole ecosystem based such collaborative systemsthis shift from dedicated system just facilitate supply chain financing supply chain collaboration system with link financing likely change the whole dynamic the industry and accelerate move industriesverticals where such collaboration well developed that would include lot distribution network well supplier network also give potential finance partner access variety performance information that would allow building over time various higherriskmargin product top purely creditrisk based traditional scf product based degree performance risk tslare traditionally structured inventory finance but are fact just receivable finance with added process and cost complication separately true inventory finance massively important area and the core challenge move beyond the area that have welldefined secondary market applicable illiquid inventory one need capitalise deep understanding industry structure and relationship this may involve multiple party with clear map who responsible for what and what risk involves and ability have clear snapshot both credit and performance risk any point for example there are component that are accepted the end user who will pay once service from creditworthy provider will added and the provider can replaced failed that possible get full scenario map risk and evaluateprice accordingly this may also involve various insurance product this requires true cooperation between various party supply chain multiple financial party etc this complicated work but may lead vastly significant repeatable resultsit often stated that what begin with the world major company eventually feed through the supply chain smaller business you agree with this and what you see happening the corporate world that will affect the landscape for supply chain finance taylor the development approved payable finance structure started through demand some the world largest company wanting solution that enabled them further exploit their supply chainsthere doubt that smaller supplier have benefitted from the cheaper funding cost and accelerated cash flow but doing pay price the major corporate exerts more controlas these program have become more widely accepted the demand now increasing from subinvestment grade and midcorporate buyer who recognise that program that accelerates payment their supplier will allow them improve their buying power and influence well improving their own workingcapital position they settle with the financier later date this represents opportunity for the supply chain finance provider but will require them work out the best credit structure and delivery process that will make this work costeffective wayzax the supply chain structure evolved from basic model company buying good manufacturing from them and selling end user platform company and supply chain orchestration this significantly shifting the whole concept working capital from distinct function the company overall supply chain structure supply chain management and collaboration major trend the century with significant development facilitating such cooperation einvoicing and procuretopay module becoming standard part wider system for buyersupplier cooperation that itself much wider area information sharing and process coordination however appears that many bank and software provider are currently ignoring these trend trying instead set singleuse link cover only supply chain financing the same time many the supply chain collaboration provider focusing the whole spectrum buyersupplier collaboration who have within their system all the information needed provide seamless financing often not specially develop such capability and link finance provider operating separate system just for scf purpose creates additional burden the company either term integration sometimes quasimanual reentry from separate system without delivering operational benefit and the overall benefit depends highly unpredictable supplier onboarding implementation supply chain integration serving multiple
