institution consulting firm big four accounting firm and some other house wang perscomm january blue ocean strategy definition blue ocean strategy this paper will use blue ocean strategy the theoretical background and introduce analytical tool and six key principle bos strategic approach distruptive innovation the goal bos create new market space blue ocean yet keep cost low but not outperform the competition the existing industry red ocean the main idea bos are all about value innovation promoting value for buyer while driving down cost for company dialing value for buyer mean raising and creating element the industry never offered reducing cost stand for elimating and reducing the factor current industry competition and achieving scale ecomomies via higher sale volume tell firm that the best way beat competition capture new demand make the competition irrelevant break the valuecost tradeoff and align the whole system firm activity pursuit differentiation and low cost kim page bos give key question entrepreneur why some company succeed creating new market space while others fail the book found first the great firm fail because they are shortsighted existing market and relustance change second the profit and growth consequence creating new market space are significantly higher and third market space can created all type company all type industry ibid blue ocean analytical tool strategic canvas diagnostic tool building bos drawing productive strategic canva need get three thing done firstly should show the strategic profile industry listing the factor very clearly including possible future factor that affect competition among industry player secondly based listed factor and strategic profile current and potential competitor manager should identify which factor they invest strategically finally drawing the value curve show detail how strategy canvas invest factor the current competition even the future kim page four action framework craft new value curve manager usually have anwser four question called here the four action framework eliminate which the factor that the industry take for granted should eliminated reduce which factor should reduced well below the industry standard raise which factor should raised well above the industry standard create which factor should created that the industry never offered the four action framewok key tool identify the action towards creating new value curve eliminate and reduce represent the factor that manager should reduce and eliminate strategically thus reducing cost create and raise are the factor that manager should invest ibid three characteristic finally good bos should consist three characteristic they are focus divergence and compelling tagline specifically company should not diffuse effort across all key factor competition but instead shaping value curve diverges from other player based looking across alternative until the compelling tagline clear and relevant ibid six principle create bos there are six principle formulating and executing bos that allow company break from the competition and unlock uncontested market blue ocean the six path are attempt redress six assuptions that keep company competing red ocean kim page specifically six assumption are showed following define their industry similarly and focus being the best within look their industry through the lens generally accepted strategic group and strive stand out the strategic group they play focus the same buyer group the purchaser the office equipment industry the user the clothing industry the influencer the pharmaceutical industry define the scope the product and service offered their industry similarly accept their industry functional emotional orientation focus the same point time and often current competitive threat formulating strategy the six principle will introduced separately detail correct above assumption ibid principle the six path reconstruct market boundary the first principle bos reconstruct market boundary which try solve search risk many firm struggle with based this issue the book found six path framework remarking market boundary instead looking within these boundary specifically break out the accepted boundary top management should look across alternative industry across strategic group across buyer the group across complementary product and service offering across functionalemotional orientation industry and even across time kim page path look across alternative industry mean that the company dosen only competes with other company same industry but also with those other company various industry that produce alternative product service but what alternative mean the one hand product service have various form but provide the same function which mean these product service are largely substites for each other the other hand alternative also mean product service that own different function and form but the same purpose path look across strategic group within industry just bos can often used looking across alternative industry they can unlocked looking across strategic group strategic group stand for group company within industry that persue similar strategy the determination same strategy group are mostly based dimension price and performance this respect the key look across existing strategic group break out narrow field vision understanding which factor determine customer decision trade down from one group another path redefines the industry buyer group reality for most industry hard find definition who the target buyer though there are chain buyer who directly indirectly involved the actual perchase decision these chain buyer are involved purchaser user and important influencers somehow these three group may overlapp but they often differ thus manager should redefine the industry buyer group but not only focus buyer path look across complementary product and service offering most case some other product service for company which not belong their core product servicies affect their customer purchasing behavior finding untapped value complementary product and service key define total solution that manager should think about what happens before during after the product service are used and offered most importantly they have find what are the pain point and how can they eliminate them through complementary offering path rethink the functionalemotional orientation the industry except for product service company industry also compete appeal the appeal usually divided rational appeal and emotional appeal specifically some industry compete strongly price and function other industry compete pricipally feeling order create blue ocean manager should redefine challenge functionalemotional orientation their industry which mean their company compete emotion industry the manager have find the element that perhaps can stripe out become more functional and vice versa path participates shaping external trend over time most industry company are subject external trend einrivoments based observable current insight proactively identifies how trend will change value customer over time key question can show manager how create blue ocean opportunity decisive business irrevesible and clear direction are three principle which are critical for company ass trend over time manager should know how will these external factor impact the industry and how can they leverage them principal focus big picture beyond number this principle trying mitigating the planning risk investing lot effort time capital and resource but achieving only tactical red ocean move tends reach common understanding current position and where head based drawing strategy canvas this approach will align the creativity wide range people within organization bring strategy the best practice communicated across business unit make the strategy easy for execution untill blue ocean created order unlock people creativity the process creating bos involves lot visual stimulation which four major step they are visual awakening asis analysis visual exploration path framework identify divergent factor strategy fair action framework tobe strategic and visual communication beforeandafter comparison focus specific corporate strategy manager can use the pioneermigatorsettler map viualization tool for mapping growth potential portfolio kim page principal reach beyond existing demand most case company used embracing customer preference through finer segmentation competitive enviroment they often face the risk creating too small target market this principal trying minimize the scale risk maximizing the demand for new offering accomplish this manager should challenge two convetional strategy practice focusing existing customer and finer segmentation instead accomodating buyer preference and thinking commonality over difference noncustomers before customer and desegmentation before persuing finer segmentation unlocking noncustomers offer big blue ocean opportunity there are three tier noncustomers that can transformed into customer based differ their relative distance from target market they are soon noncustomers tier refusing noncustomers tier and unexplored noncustomers tier all all manager should not focus specific tier but should look across tier instead the rule here focus the tier that represents the biggest catchment the time their industry but they should also explore whether there are overlapping commonality across all three tier noncustomers kim page principal get the strategic sequence right this principal trying put forward the strategic sequence and validate commercially viable blue ocean idea company should build bos the sequence buyer utility price cost and adoption kim page principal overcome key organizational hurdle compared with red ocean strategy bos represents big difference from the status quo the challenge execution exists which brings four hurdle the first hurdle from cognitive waking those employee whom feel uncomfortable shifting certain strategy the second hurdle limited resource the third motivational hurdle due unmotivated staff the final hurdle politics any reform will bring opposition from some powerful vested interest but tipping point leadership productive approach overcome these four hurdle fast executing break from statos kim page principal build execution into strategy successed execution bos not only top management but everyone from the top the front line the more removed people are from the top and the they have been involved the execution the strategy this principal can help manager minimize the management risk distrust noncooperation and even sabotage introduction fair process key part executing strategy there are three core element that define principle fair process engagement involving individual into strategy explanation everyone should explained and clarity expectation state clearly the new rule the game kim page bos and chinese online platform link the chinese online platform and the bos will focus big picture three step principle kim page iii define phase define competitive factor key player and their strategic profile the chinese service sector identify phase use six path framework redefine market boundary and identify divergent factor principle and principle establishment phase use four action framework construct the new value curve define phase the case the chinese service industry there are principal factor factor competition geography global reach and local the ground sector complete coverage relationship smes and large corporates transaction strategy and execution service buysellside execution coporate strategy advisory due diligence independent capital advisory legal advise online service information knowledge spreading online deal sourcing and matching technology cloudbased live deal marketplace price commision fee consulting fee subscribtion fee and membership fee research research report country sector and single company market activity salon and customized market activity these factor are viewed key the promotion their service more exclusive advisory service for the customer those client this case represent large corporates stateowned listed and multinational company and smes mostly private company china that the underlying structure the chinese consulting service industry from the market perspective vertical axis the strategy canvas capture the offering level that customer receive across all these key competing factor high score mean that company offer customer more and hence invests more that factor identify phase there were more than three hundred advisory participate the chinese service industry but can simply classify them big four accounting firm boutique advisor bulge bracket bank and large chinese security firm according their scale and scope service imaa big four are the four largest accounting firm

and government wall street journal chinese secrurities firm include firm whose principal line business are security brokerage financial advisory service investment banking andor security trading gao page fundamentally shift the strategy canvas chinese service and persue both value and cost and mwg resist the old logic competiting with local and gobal house and choosing between highquality service and low charged fee contrast and mwg reoriented their strategic focus from looking competitor service industry information sector look across alternative industry from serving large corporates smes look across strategic group within industry from helping nonfinancial enterprise all involved party including their main competitor such financial institution and house redefine industry buyer group from conventional corporate finance service information knowledge spreading and online deal matching service look across complementary service offering and from functional orientation emotional orientation furthermore they are participating shaping external trend over time thus they gain insight into how redefine the problem the industry focus and thereby reconstruct client value element that reside across industry boundary iii establishment phase driving and mwg fill four action framework with action eliminating reducing raising and creating which are displicted follows eliminate relationship with large corporates due diligence legal advice reduce execution corporte strategy advisory independent capital advisory price raise global reach sector coverage relationship with smes information knowledge spreading technology cloudbased live deal create online deal sourcing and matching figure show the extent which the application these four action led break from the competition the chinese service industry here can graphically compare and mwg bos with the more than three hundred key player competiting the industry imaa looking across complementary service offering and looking alternative industry and mwg created new factor the sector online deal sourcing and matching based the technology cloudbased live deal marketplace which offer the chinese enterprise the easy access the highquality overseas asset and project charging low subscribtion fee and raised the service information knowledge spreading through this service chinese enterprise got more redhot news and professional insight regarding overseas investment project from all over the world and all sector which shaped the great global reach and the extensive sector coverage therefore they eliminated and reduced the specific service related transaction strategy and execuion which lead low charged fee and competition looking across strategic group within industry and redefining industry buyer and mwg established and maintained friendly and productive relationship with smes since other advisor usually charge extreme high commision fee their customer generally from until based overall deal volume which caused significant burdle smes addition the both chinese emerge online platform reached beyond existing demand redefining the stratgic buyer goups mwg only offer preliminary investment banking service which leave big room for other advisor providing more specific and professional service enterprise this allows mwg transformed other competitor the market into the customer figure the strategy canvas and mwg own representation based chan kim and ren mauborgne blue ocean strategy and deutsche bank fintech development background information deutsche band fintech strategy and innovation
