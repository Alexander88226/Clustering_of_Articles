result the multiple linear the test and independent variable including anova regression analysis significance each affecting dependent variablesitem testing hypothesis oneanova test result reveal that fintech factor test result clear service epayment cause change implementation affect service availability significantly well clear that change service availability are affected fintech while more than change are affected other that service epayment and way payment have significant impact availability their sig while service epayment the bigger effect availability each one value change availability and each one value change way payment cause change availability bill epayment and bank account with egovernment don have don have any significant effect availability their sig therefore hypothesis one there significant effect fintech availability accepted term service epayment and way payment and refused term bill epayment and bank account with egovernmenttesting hypothesis twoanova test result reveal that there main significant effect fintech service accessibility well namely change service accessibility are affected fintech while more than are affected other factor test result clear that

efficiency are affected fintech model while change are affected other factor test result clear that service epayment bill epayment and way payment have significant impact efficiency while bill epayment the biggest effect efficiency each one value change bill epayment change efficiency following way payment then service epayment regarding bank account with egovernment result reflect that doesn any significant effect efficiency therefore hypothesis three there significant effect fintech efficiency accepted all term except bank account with egovernmenthas main significant testing hypothesis fourfrom anova test result clear that fintech model responsiveness well contributes change responsiveness while change are affected other factor test result reveal that service epayment and

they don have any significant effect responsiveness therefore hypothesis four significant effect fintech responsiveness accepted term service epayment and bill epayment and refused term way payment and bank account with egovernment there conclusionin order for organization financial technology recent technology and become crucial seamless and accelerates business process and transaction this research aim measuring implementation including service epayment bill epayment way payment and bank account with egovernment facilitating egovernment service term availability accessibility efficiency and responsivenessthe effect fintech egypt conclusion after reviewing related literature designing data collection method collecting data from sample unit and analyzing data test the research hypothesis found thatthe data analysis cleared that only respondent transacted with egovernment portal and were valid for analysis them were male and female well most them approximately the half valid respondent range from year old followed those whom age range from year old then those whom age range from year old then whom age are more than and the lowest number respondent range from year old the fintech analysis revealedfigure the structure model result esam gohary journal distribution science followed that most respondent posse bank account and bank card however than respondent posse account fintech firm the result also revealed that all respondent pay bank card andor fawry while negligible percent pay cryptocurrencies with regard obstacle cleared that about respondent faced obstacle and the most popular obstacle represented the internet speed responsiveness and difficulty then service shortage these result demonstrate the weakness internet network lack efficient employee egovernment portal well lack system effectiveness term such shortage service and the result about the most used egovernment service are conflicted with egovernment portal reported that the most train ticket reservation real estate office service traffic prosecution service and complains and inquiresimportant service are national transaction furthermore the website several using low the descriptive statistic illustrated the citizen perception all study item the degree each item come above which reflect the well perception all item the reliability value studied item indicated that all studied item are consistent and valid use another time the correlation demonstrated that all independent variable have poor positive relationship with dependent variable except accessibility poor negative relationship with bank account with egovernment availability moderate positive relationship with service epayment and way payment and responsiveness moderate positive relationship with service epayment and bill epayment while regarding independent variable bank account with egovernment poor positive relationship with all independent item however way payment moderate positive relationship with service epayment and bill epayment those have strong positive relationship with each otherfrom the hypothesis testing can concluded that bank account with egovernment doesn any relationship effect any the facilitating egovernment service dimension however service epayment direct effect availability efficiency and responsiveness but doesn affect accessibility similarly bill epayment direct effect efficiency responsiveness and accessibility but doesn affect availability also way payment direct effect availability and efficiency but doesn affect accessibility and responsiveness recommendationsbased the conclusion and finding the researcher suggests the following recommendation government government conduct awareness campaign raise citizen consciousness and trust egovernment transaction respondent didn use egovernment portal government improve internet network through developing ict infrastructure eliminate the internet low speed government recommended enhance the efficiency transaction term egovernment portal completion government recommended training program skill and customer service for employee qualify them able interact with egovernment portal which turn improve employee responsivenessto provide government recommended improve website more easy use from all population segment government provide more service website government and bank have collaborate and increase fintech implementation form egovernment and add more facilitates for citizen interact with egovernment limitation and future research recommendationthis research applied egovernment egypt finding can applied only any organization implement fintech system this paper used secondary data from various source develop the measurement scale fintech and focused determine the relationship between each fintech facilitation without consider any obstacle face using egovernment portal fintech methodsitem and each dimension service that may future study could examine the citizen consciousness about egovernment also they could study the obstacle fintech implementation and measure the employee ability interact with this new technology well studying the challenge facing
