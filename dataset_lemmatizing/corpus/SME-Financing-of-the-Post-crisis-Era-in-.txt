orientation forum lack method stock right bond problem face diverse different region besides level region also related formulation implementation relevant region challenge crisis cause nonstandard private mean simple operation abundant resource private play important role relieve current situation inadequate postcrisis era show insufficient cost threshold like increase gradually result maintain conduct private mediumsized pressure interest rate usually becomes root cause entrepreneur escape without pay debt nonstandard private prone cause crisis chain break increase thereby asset crisis cause china scale short survival time besides correspond system poor daily operation largely influence external environment factor increase possibility degree lead asset example entrepreneur wenzhou escape chain crisis private incident many index decline wenzhou among index nonperforming ratio nplr link relative first recent year july nplr wenzhou rise term nonperforming mainly concentrate medium nonperforming balance reach billion yuan billion yuan respectively nonperforming balance account total nonperforming balance nplr sharp increase cost postcrisis era china mainly implement prudent
