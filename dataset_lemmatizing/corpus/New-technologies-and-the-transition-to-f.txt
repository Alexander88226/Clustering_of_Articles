employment working paper introduction new technology are one the most forceful driver the future work technology transforming not only the way people work how but also the very nature work what and even purpose why technology come wave recent decade the world witnessed the appearance and evolution computer then the revolution information and communication technology icts then mobile and smart phone and then the surge automation technology there are course difference and especially lag the way different country region incorporate these innovation the literature point out that these technological development any technological international discussion technology and work centred the risk losing job the future labour relation more recently there been some discussion the potential change history have tremendous effect the labour market and much the recent technology support growth employment creation and labour market policy the relationship between new technology and informality been addressed from different perspective some study focus the appearance new form informality particular nonstandard form work ilo others focus the process and difficulty the informal sector unit incorporate new technology their business activity chen some others analyse the effect technology productivity and informality barrantes cere galli and others see the definition formal informal becoming increasingly indistinguishable smith technology likely have both positive and negative effect informality productivity and economic structure influence the income distribution and labour outcome including informality technology can increase informality via the probable increase the productivity gap among economic unit especially when access technology not equal via the spreading new form work especially those where informality higher but the question can also reduce informality this paper focus how technology can enhance the impact institutional public policy addressing informality today increasing number government are promoting the application new technology facilitate the transition from the informal the formal economy call these policy eformality policy some case they are related egovernment initiative order extract some crosscutting policy lesson analyse some emerging public policy publicsector practice tool where technology have already been hart the memory bank money unequal world london profile book see for example balliester and elsheikhi smith the future informal economy thesigers december httpthesigerscomanalysisthefutureofinformaleconomieshtml leave aside the discussion new technology and other labour market policy such active labour market policy for example that could also have link with the transition formality note that previous study the concept einformality lugo sampson informality venezuela the other path technology bulletin latin american research vol employment working paper implemented directly indirectly for the transition formality then ask these policy innovation will transform the way formalization policy will implemented the future the experience selected are based nonexhaustive web search trying show the spread these experience around the world especially middle lower income country and the diverse approach taken the paper aim serving basis for further discussion for policy maker around the world who are searching for innovative policy solution for facilitating the transition the formal economy and other actor who are concerned about this topic employment working paper policy approach for the transition formality after almost five decade focusing informality concept magnitude and characteristic the related international discussion currently turning attention the transition the formal economy important threshold this discussion been the transition from the informal the formal economy recommendation adopted the tripartite constituent the international labour conference the recommendation indicates the threefold objective the transition the formal economy which are facilitate the transition worker and economic unit from the informal the formal economy while respecting worker fundamental right and ensuring opportunity for income security livelihood and entrepreneurship promote the creation preservation and sustainability enterprise and decent job the formal economy and the coherence macroeconomic employment social protection and other social policy prevent the informalization formal economy job recommendation state that the effective way achieve these objective through applying the integrated approach that cover array policy area including strategy for inclusive growth formal job creation social protection regulatory framework enterprise development compliance and enforcement and policy pathway formality the last decade the international labour organization ilo seen increasing number country implementing deliberate policy for the transition formality around the world these policy together with economic growth and structural transformation process have contributed reduction informality some region country practice the experience show that country have explored different pathway formality mainly related the increase economic capacity productivity the improvement norm regulation the design and implementation incentive and the improvement enforcement system and measure figure for more detail this experience see for example the ilo forlac note formalization latin america region with several documented experience formalization see also berg bertranou and chacaltana for detailed country case analysis brazil argentina and peru respectively note that the link between productivity and informality can both way see for example kanbur employment working paper figure main strategy used for the transition formality source author productivity country have operated three main economic level the macroeconomic the meso economic and the microeconomic first the macroeconomic level reduction informality have occurred during period high growth and the presence enabling environment for sustainable enterprise create formal job second productivity also been stimulated specific sector what could described the meso economic level intervention are needed here even context strong economic growth the resulting formalization employment and economic unit will depend the labour intensity the sector that drive the existence productive chain that activate the labour demand public policy for developing certain sector region third action been taken the microeconomic level strengthening technology human capital way production organization tackling outofdate technology above all smaller business and addressing the issue training deficit worker and employer organization regulation there are initiative various complementary field the first aim improve quantity quality and access information and the knowledge right and obligation employer worker and the general public sometimes economic unit are not fully aware what mean have formal business formal worker the benefit being formal the registration procedure for that employment working paper second area the adaptation simplification regulation procedure there are various initiative this kind often combined with other tool sometimes incentive and support programme and sometimes sanction simplification generally concern tax declaration labour procedure affiliation and contribution social security registration enterprise unification procedure procedure are often optional and for specific segment such small and micro enterprise therefore not applicable generally third complementary approach identified this area dialogue negotiation and consultation process promote improvement the design and compliance with standard and regulation ensure that they provide adequate and effective protection all the use social dialogue all form key for change standard and regulation legitimate and sustainable incentive they vary type some are associated with taxation mainly for small and micro economic unit and sometimes including ownaccount worker some country such argentina brazil and uruguay have linked their tax incentive social security contribution integrating various payment single tax some unconventional mechanism have been used for these case such collective insurance scheme argentina and costa rica subsidized programme order increase social protection coverage the use unconventional affiliation method more common group that are hard reach although more evidence needed ass the scale final impact formalization level many case this due the fact that the experience are very recent the challenge ever that growing affiliation should accompanied improvement the service such health service pension both the health benefit may visible the short term but pension are longterm benefit this doe not only involve access but quality and coverage informal worker and business owner are not the system and clear and visible incentive must provided for them move into formality measure encourage formalization assigning benefit specific group must consider the timeframe and the process for gradual transition the general system and the scope regulation discrimination the law against one group citizen and weakening labour relation reducing standard should always avoided the appropriate timeframe for becoming formalized should ensure that improving working condition the natural result and the main objective formalization these system should not seen primarily vehicle for raising revenue but mechanism for the inclusion incorporation into transition formality broad sector worker and economic unit that carry out their economic activity the informal and even the subsistence economy some case access public service can incentive for example introducing target for public procurement through micro small and medium enterprise msmes allocating public space for informal worker and economic unit operate enforcement finally various government have taken action increase the state capacity deliver service all the population ensure that standard are met some case this requires improving the information about the population duty and right strengthening the structure quality transparency and accountability the responsible institution applying sanction promoting agreement and alliance between worker and employer employment working paper other case government have strengthened their inspection capacity increasing the number inspector modernizingadopting new technology and database for better supervision and monitoring and further case government have adopted specific inspection procedure facilitate the transition formality these approach have been used for the formalization employment and economic unit with more emphasis specific dimension depending regional country context experience also show that formalization policy require multiple intervention and policy coordination and integrated approach order facilitate the transition the formal economy the transition also requires innovative solution informality not homogenous and not all informal worker economic unit are that situation for the same reason for example for group that are hard reach such own account worker domestic worker contributing family worker some unconventional approach have been used either increase their registration extend social protection them egovernment applied formalization policy eformality with the advent new technology many country around the world have embarked egovernment process although there some discussion the definition egovernment usually defined the use icts improve the activity publicsector organization through advanced technological tool egovernment aim improving the relationship between people and their government making public service delivery more effective accessible and responsive people need increasing participation decision making and making public institution more transparent and accountable the united nation department economic and social affaire undesa monitor progress egovernment through periodical survey and constructing index measure the effectiveness egovernment member state egovernment development index egdi comprises three subindices each which ass key dimension egovernment status the development telecommunication infrastructure telecommunication infrastructure index scope and quality online service online service index inherent human capital human capital index according undesa egovernment grown rapidly around the world over the past year argues that the egdi value have improved for many country country united nation department economic and social affair undesa government survey egovernment support sustainable development new york discussion measuring digital government can found ubaldi

spread widely recent year figure world evolution egovernment index source undesa note the component the human capital index were updated see egovernment survey table for further detail also note that this assessment rate egovernment performance country relative one another opposed being absolute measurement more study and information would required ass this progress promoted more inclusion all dimension society for the labour market key indicator measure exclusion the proportion worker informal employment figure show the simple correlation between egovernment index and informality rate around which can affected many other variable undesa defines veryhigh where egovernment development index value are the range the index improved significantly especially among developed country see

high egovernment index show lower informality rate the average egovernment development index score for country with low informality rate more than double that country with high informality rate these difference increased absolute term during the period and country with high informality still have very low egovernment capacity figure annex all case observe some variation this relation but particularly high the online service index the online service index score country with more than per cent informality rate varies widely from the score value since both informality rate and the egovernment index score are influenced country level development income perform crosssection ordinary least square ols regression informality rate egovernment index not identify causality but verify these simple correlation still hold after controlling for per caput gdp table annex the calculation country with high formality include country with formality rate above per cent country and country with low formality include those with formality rate below per cent country see figure annex employment working paper the result confirm significant negative correlation all case except the online service index one possible policy implication that some country may not using all their already acquired online service potential capacity with specific target labour market issue informality this mean that much can improved this area many country eformality item that agenda employment working paper emerging experience the application new technology for the transition formality new technology not only can affect the way economic unit and worker interact the labour market but they can also drastically transform how public policy work this the main purpose egovernment initiative for example the case the transition formality technology are not only changing the way these type policy work but they can even affect the very definition formality often described registration economic unit worker even transaction the registration act for any the dimension formality change drastically complexity and time required depending whether done manually personally electronically virtually general with any the new technology including algorithm big data artificial intelligence technology can also affect any the policy pathway formality that country are implementing through the following channel increase productivity for those who have access help improving regulation they disseminate information simplify legal procedure help designing and administering incentive any the tax social security labour dimension that increase considerably the capacity enforcement and oversight policy emphasis will vary from case case and from one region another sometimes focus the formalization economic unit others focus the formalization employment some case combine both dimension others focus the registration transaction mean formality economic unit and employment this paper review some innovative experience mainly developing and emerging country that show that these government are embarking this new trend although there still much done focus mainly experience related public policy based review secondary source mainly english and spanish first explore experience related the formalization economics unit and then describe experience the formalization employment formalization economic unit formalization economic unit deal with economic capacity but also with registration procedure tax and which are usually set government many case different institution establish different set requirement and most case they not coordinate the application technology provides solution that can reduce the cost registration often with the case virtual onestop shop simplify timeconsuming procedure and increase compliance with tax obligation more importantly bridge the gap different institution coordination for translating formalization economic unit into formalization employment for instance registration worker and making social security contribution employment working paper electronic registration payment mechanism for enterprise since transaction cost were considered barrier for formalization economic unit soto onestop shop offer solution they simplify procedure many country had tried implement this type initiative unfortunately there can complication public institution need coordinate and align their system and procedure especially they have operate single physical location with one interface new technology have allowed the appearance electronic registration tool including these onestop shop the objective onestop shop are reduce the time and cost for business registration well improve access for smaller economic unit operating distance from the registrar office some country entrepreneur must still travel the capital city register business onestop shop generally include service such registration procedure local government sectorial government body there trend towards virtual onestop shop according the world bank eightytwo economy offered electronic registration service for business but while this possible more than per cent highincome country only about per cent lowincome one the report also mention interesting case canada cyprus ecuador new zealand and the former yugoslav republic macedonia some case all the country make registration record electronic others this tool eliminated some requirement for example the notarizing document the republic korea entrepreneur can register their business online staterun website long they attach the necessary document such the registration form and the lease agreement the mobile application also available check the current status the registration process which usually take three day the government colombia created the ventanilla nica empresarial vue onestop shop mechanism that includes web platform that expected progressively incorporate all procedure related the entrepreneurial activity time this web platform will mandatory for opening and closing business and for information flow the firm activity the evidence the use onestop shop formalization scarce however some study have shown that onestop shop indeed facilitate the registration new firm but not necessarily the formalization their worker deelen more evidence the use virtual onestop shop therefore needed sometimes

httpswwwsafaricomcokebusinesssmempesapaymentsolutionslipanampesapaybill employment working paper conclusion new technology are continuously transforming the world work most the recent discussion focused how currently new technology characterized impressive speed change are affecting the behaviour labour market actor worker and employer and the consequence term volume employment composition wage and working condition attention been paid however how new technology are affecting the public sector particular policymaking and yet many government are gradually adapting new technology this paper have been exploring what some country are already doing relation the use new technology the labour market particularly policy oriented facilitate the transition formality economic unit and employment have found that there indeed emerging trend towards the use technology for the transition formality employment and economic unit via increasing number innovative informationintensive and connectivitybased tool approach that call eformality policy which contrast sharply with the traditional manual physical presence timeconsuming practice course these development are sometimes concentrated specific policy area instrument but the diversity and innovative nature the experience show promising avenue for further study and research and while evidence show that business registration procedure are usually separated from employment formalization due among other thing the absence coordination between different institution new technology based information and intelligence could also help bridge this gap and link enterprise and employment formalization indeed these practice facilitate interministerial coordination through making easy share information and action among tax social security and employment institution however even this early stage the evolution this new generation formality related policy several issue arise for further discussion although for example these esolutions are not always directly explicitly linked the transition formality they bring more transparency information and new approach that can considered step this gradual transition but these policy goal necessarily imply translate into full formalization more evidence needed impact study are significantly scarce the transition formality would incomplete economic unit are registered but their productivity and working condition remain the same worker are registered the social security system and those system provide poor quality service other word although itself important registration economic unit and employment only one part the story formalization the story need completed with the most important part which the objective full and productive employment and decent work for all many remaining question and challenge will probably lead the discussion the future the one hand will these policy able deal with the fact that large proportion the population the world still doe not have access new technology some country the discussion about digital citizenship for example oriented grant citizen minimum access may gradually move the centre the inclusion agenda the near future also information systematic even algorithmsbased policy will hand for any government authority what would the limit their use especially this information private personal time and using new technology government will able identify individual any information system consumer worker economic employment working paper unit this capacity should used not only for registration but for labour and social inclusion purpose and social dialogue among social partner the labour market could play key role for assuring this finally technology evolving rapidly that new solution alternative are being developed currently with new wave based automation advanced robotics big data artificial intelligence blockchain technology etc and there are actually some task government that are being automatized some country for example the automatic issue fine for speeding doe this mean that further stage policy would adapt formality related policy automatic solution employment working
