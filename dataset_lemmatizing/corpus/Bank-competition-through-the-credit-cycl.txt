the private sector fell duringthe boom period and rose steadily since the onset the crisis this nding providesevidence increased market entry and expansion previously smaller lender during period ofprosperity and retrenchment all but the largest lender during downturn secondly lending tosmes signi cantly more concentrated than lending the private sector total this suggests thatthe lending

hypothesis mph predicts that the traditionalindustrial organization result should hold more concentrated market mean more market powerfor the largest bank which lead higher price tougher condition and

thishypothesis more competitive market will lead lending bank will not have the incentiveto make investment information and their relationship particularly with small borrowersthe paper proceeds follows section provides analysis trend concentration the irishprivate sector and sme lending market section highlight lesson from the literature that canprovide policy conclusion for ireland section concludes credit concentration data and analysiswe use the central bank ireland money and banking statistic these data are available thelendersectorquarter level with the sector which each institution

from the volume new lending ows smes from due the nature the data available focus our attention the her ndahlhirschman index hhi competition which measure based solely the concentration oflending market while the literature found that more concentrated market need not necessarilybe competitive the evidence suggests that ireland the trend generally been that marketsbecome concentrated they have also been more competitive and vice versa goggin evidence that lender the irish mortgage market have increased standard variable rate asconcentration level the market have increased since calculate hhi initially for eachquarter and then for each sectorquarter these are calculated the sum the square the marketshare each market participant higher share represents more concentrated competitivelending market also calculate the same frequency and disaggregation the share domesticbanks total lending concentration private sector lendingfigure plot the hhi for all private sector non nancial lending and for lending all core nonpropertyrelated non nancial sector for core sector the irish banking system became steadilyless concentrated from the year which the credit boom began accelerate generally consideredto witnessed noticeable decline the hhi from mid howeverthere clearly visible turning point the series with concentration increasing ever since thispresents clear pattern either increased entry increased expansion small market participantsduring boom period followed contraction competitive force once economic condition beganto deterioratethe minimum value that the hhi reached with the value for standing get sense for whether not hhi represents concentrated lending market table report hhis calculated previous study mccann that across europeancountries between and per cent the countryyear observation have hhi below these number and those table suggest that concentration the irish private sector lendingmarket heading towards the upper end international norm for developed countriesdata lending small and medium enterprise been required the central bank ofireland since our prior due the opaque nature smaller rms that this market shouldbe more concentrated than the private sector credit market figure plot the hhi for the stockof private sector and sme credit identical scale for the gure show aclear erence with the sme lending market having hhi ranging between and over thesample period signi cantly larger than any gure observed for the whole private sector numerousstudies have previously shown that smaller rms have more culty accessing nance the higherconcentration level found the lending market smaller rms potential channel through whichthis culty may arisewhile figure outlined the erence the hhi outstanding credit stock between private sectorand sme lending figure plot the hhi for new lending ows smes which give indicationof the likely path for concentration the market these data are likely more volatile thanconcentration measure for credit stock given the culties experienced the irish nancial sectorand the low volume new lending given quarter thus average the availabledata plotted here the gure show that the hhi new lending consistently higher than thehhi for outstanding stock this indicates that the irish sme lending market currently becomingmore concentratedfigures and exploit the sectoral dimension the lending data figure report the concentration outstanding credit stock each sector economic activity and the pictureshows heterogeneity concentration lending across sector and pattern increasing competition over the credit boom the only exception this pattern the construction sector which had ahhi and the general trend presented support the proposition made earlierin the paper that the period economic and credit boom ireland associated with increasein competition the lending market figure present average hhi for each sector comparing the hhi for lending all rms the left with the hhi for lending smes the rightwe observe higher concentration the lending market for smaller rms the majority sector asmentioned previously this higher concentration may driven the opaque nature smaller rmswhich increase barrier new entrant but may also itself contribute credit constraint forsmaller rmson new lending ows smes figure beyond the national number presented figure and shed light the likely path for concentration sectoral sme lending market with threesectors presenting hhis above and all sector reporting hhi greater than appears thatthe market for newly issued credit smes ireland highly concentrated one the logicalconclusion that lending will become more concentrated the short run the majority sector incentral bank money and banking statistic show that new lending smes averaged roughly per quarterin the economy with the knockon ect for credit condition and constraint that have been mentionedpreviously bank nationalityas outlined the introduction large literature exists the role that foreignowned bank can playin decreasing credit constraint for local rms particularly when high concentration pose the risk ofincreased constraint the share lending accounted for foreign and domestic bank outlinedin this section the previous section begin with the longest time series available usplotting the quarterly share private sector lending stock accounted for the domesticallyownedand foreignowned bank table report the bank that are ned domestic foreign ulsterbank although present the irish market for over century considered foreign bank for thepurposes this analysisfigure report the share domestic bank private sector lending with the red line representinglending core sector consistent with analysis the hhi clear pattern emerges whereby duringthe boom period the market penetration foreign bank increased signi cantlythis consistent with situation where attractive potential return booming economy attractnew entrant the lending market the post crisis had identical ect foreign bankpenetration that competition the market with steady increase the domestic share oflending from low per cent the end per cent this pattern matchesthe ndings presbitero who show that more distant bank italy are more likely toration credit since the onset the crisis with the ndings concentration previously the lessonsof the literature suggest that this trend will likely have detrimental ect credit condition thelocal economyfigure show degree heterogeneity foreign bank penetration across sector activity thedomestic share lending fell the majority sector between and although there arenotable anomaly such the construction sector where domestic bank share lending increasedfrom per cent over the boom periodfigure show that the sme lending market the domestic share both new lending andthe stock credit are very similar and per cent indicating the the outlook that thedomestic share will remain steady the sme market there are sector such transport storageconstruction and business administrative service which are dominated local bank but mostsectors where the share lie around per cent indicating that signi cant market share will continueto accounted for foreign lender lesson for ireland from the literaturefigures for new lending suggest that the likely path for the sme market towards further concentration from position where the market already highly concentrated international term thetrajectory for foreign bank penetration also appears downward the international academicliterature provides numerous lesson for the likely ect this access nance the irish realeconomythe con icting prediction the market power hypothesis mph and information hypothesis have been tested numerous occasion with wide range paper ering ambiguous resultsthe direction the ect can depend the sample country used the additional control variablesincluded and the proxy used for competition the banking sector paper that reconcile the twoviews have done number way guevara and maudos and patti and dell aricciapapers supporting the mph include beck chong agostino and trivieri black and strahan jayaratne and strahan and cetorelli and strahan petersen and rajan presented rst evidence that competitive banking system could lead more access nance other paperssupporting this hypothesis include giannetti and zarutskie explain that the relationship inverted ushape very high level concentrationthe mph hold but below these level the hold carbovalverde explain the ambiguity relating concentration and competition measure market contestability and informationattainment market concentrated and also not vigorously contested then the mph shownto holda separate but related literature the ect foreign bank penetration credit conditionsexists number study generally using data for emerging market country have found bene ciale ect foreign bank penetration access nance more recent literature however foundthat during the crisis period foreign bank penetration may pose additional risk local rms thatthese bank with information the local market generally retrench faster pace than localbanksthis literature number implication for the trend presented here for ireland the keymessage guevara and maudos that the mph hold the highest level concentrationbut not lower level outlined earlier appears that concentration ireland approachingthe highest range hhis seen europe recent decade the key lesson carbovalverde that concentration will lead tougher credit condition where there not high degree ofcontestability investment information the part lender evidence from goggin suggests that the irish mortgage market increased concentration not been accompanied byvigorous competitive behaviour since furthermore new lending gures reported the centralbank ireland have been low and lawless and mccann have shown that creditconditions ireland are the most cult the euro area currently all these fact suggest that interms the result carbovalverde ireland appears position where increasedconcentration likely exacerbate opposed ease sme credit constraintsbeck suggest that cient credit registry and foreign bank penetration can mitigatethe ect bank concentration obstacle nance the fact that credit register doe not exist although planned begin operating combined with trend towards foreign bank lending share falling ireland recent year suggests that these mitigating factor are not likely tobe place reverse the predicted ect the mph ireland the coming year similarly whilehigh gdp per caput and good insititutional quality are currently quality which ireland can boastthe likely growth rate gdp ireland given current economic concern across europe suggeststhat increase economic activity also unlikely reverse the mph ect conclusionthis paper present descriptive statistic competition lending rms the irish private sectorusing detailed banklevel lending data the aim the paper present picture competition levelsin the market and draw implication for irish rms credit access from policy perspective ourkey ndings are follows the lending market for all enterprise become more concentrated sincethe onset the crisis the lending market for smes signi cantly more concentrated and thetrend towards even higher concentration foreign bank penetration diminished ireland sincethe crisis having distilled the lesson from the literature the likely ect increased concentrationand lower foreign bank penetration the irish sme lending market appears most likely thatthe prediction the market power hypothesis will prevail leading tougher condition for smesseeking access nance policy measure such loan guarantee scheme micro nance fund andcredit register should help mitigate these adverse ect
