finding motif bank individually and contrast interview from the other bank fintech group each category represents one motivation either bank fintechs finally condensed similar category describing similar motif common category this nuanced analysis the motif enabled derive nine category motif from our interview this section present the five motif for bank and the four for fintechs and outline sys tematization thereof the motif are backed quotation from our interviewee italic with interviewee given bracket rapid innovation all nine case analyzed bank were keen partner with fintechs speed innovation process that would otherwise consume too much time and financial and managerial source since this applied the whole sample reveals that bank are not only interested advanced idea but also value wellthoughtout turnkey solution for their business our inter viewees stated that bank could innovate themselves but have become too large and too ponderous promote internal change process the interviewee were aware that this the result old traditional structure and the implementation idea would take time longer these change are tested more extensively until everything all regulatory requirement fit since regulator demand the implementation alteration various process multiple time per year company outside bank are able screen these new mands and become better and more efficient safer these topic thus from the viewpoint bank fintechs are specialist who mainly focus problem that impact most bank furthermore implementation for fintechs easy they have smaller setup and are faster bank only have dock the innovation their structure and then they can work with them competitive advantage second motivation five the nine case bank were motivated partner with fintechs achieve competitive advantage and increase customer value interestingly bank acknowl edged that fintechs might provide something different better higher more advanced something that just down well with customer for instance the german financial service industry becomes increasingly competitive between traditional bank every bank revenue based the classic interestbearing business model decrease every bank search for additional potential for revenuecreation can perhaps also offer real added value meet our customer demand using the data have anyway however fintechs usually offer their service variety bank which diminishes the unique selling proposition bank prefer exclusive partnership bled econference digital transformation meeting the challenge june bled slovenia conference proceeding holotiuk klus lohwasser moormann motif form alliance for digital innovation the case bank and fintechs outsourcing third bank try avoid using their own resource new and risky innovation with unknown result and attempt save cost smaller firm with only few employee can simply pro duce considerably cheaper and achieve more attractive price for the market bank use fintechs reduce their own workload that their employee can focus core activity thus bank not need tie additional manpower already have enough other issue the development new business area already scarce internal resource one bank interviewee mentioned that not need set these inter nal resource anyway can acquire them from the market just well fintechs are even with the api application programming interface development faster and better than when would use our own internal resource currently have stock bank also consider the extent which and for what purpose they outsource certain activity some bank consider outsourcing huge part their value chain such digital payment service while others aim establish wholly new business field banking service fintechs often remain unrecognized for customer the background socalled white label that are easier and faster implement and use than build the whole system our self further these partnership allow bank broadly diversify their activi tie there very active fintech scene conclusion bank prefer focus their core activity they are techcompany nor itfirm are bank are good financial consulting are good dressing behavioral finance topic are not good writing computer program learning the bank motivation partner with fintechs not only relate outsourcing noncore tivities also important them learn from the fintechs way thinking and break and adjust existing process which becomes harder the longer the process exists course easier for other company which can start from scratch and build blueprint how newly arrange whole process their different approach cause pinprick reconsider our traditional thinking thus fintechs are seen sparring partner that allow indepth discussion from different point view and start process our bank which probably would never have seen nor pursued hence fintechs use very stringent approach the processing information and provide impulse which very very exciting driver and always lead crossfertilization business model evolution information about bank becomes increasingly ubiquitous and barrier switching finan cial institution fall bank fear the increasing speed change they are also afraid that fintechs will advance point digital transformation where they are able replace current business model providing scalable digital and intelligent solution hence bank are searching for new business they are feeling very high pressure the one side high regulatory pressure and the other side lowinterest margin the terviews stated that bank see opportunity within digital bled econference digital transformation meeting the challenge june bled slovenia conference proceeding holotiuk klus lohwasser moormann motif form alliance for digital innovation the case bank and fintechs motif fintechs financial service extremely interesting and exciting business area but know that our technical possibility are far not advanced the fintechs that why entered this strategic partnership these partnership help identify and launch new business model and consider all the different possible approach however the interviewee mentioned that some bank not fol low any clear strategy can also assumed that bank fear missing opportunity establish sustainable business model for the future incredibly difficult know what happens where and since also want follow digital strategy everyone the management anxious follow this opportunity they also try convince the workforce catch speed and acknowledge the urgency for organizational change even more truly achieve mindset change hence bank see investment fintechs activity trust and credibility surprisingly the motivation the interviewed fintechs partner with bank are diverse six out seven respondent considered alliance valuable asset for obtaining trust and credibility the one hand gaining trust and credibility through alliance with established bank central attract end customer trust very very important and help the inves tor gain confidence the product particularly the payment sector the brand better said the trust very very important especially germany the other hand fintechs wish partner with more bank and get access their customer base since failure alliance with fintechs might harm bank reputation bank become cautious they are always bit afraid how long the fintech will still exist the process are reliable they are old traditional institution overcome this burden fintechs wish win partner for their product service order establish trust element and run flag ship project overcome reputational risk issue furthermore they use feedback dis cussions ask the bank ass out their own experience how the acceptance the product service among customer will thus fintechs use bank for entrance the market resource and synergy four out seven fintechs mentioned that they see their partner customer that also the financial endowment break new ground which turn help fintechs further benefit from the higher marketing budget bank and from other synergy marketing besides productrelated partnership there are bank which also invest startup which mean that some partnership the bank only want get know the fintech and vice versa investigate whether the partnership might expanded investment ipw soon fintechs provide service where there any type payment involved they need deep knowledge well asset ensure proper handling alongside license con form regulation these requirement can financial burden for fintechs sometimes impossible according european policy three out eight fintechs men tioned sharing cost conforming regulation bled econference digital

motif alliance motivation however alongside superior financial endowment fintechs often wish access bank data and infrastructure apply and test their product service realistic case customer acquisition incumbent bank can provide large customer base which might even more interest ing asset for fintechs than financial support three interviewee from fintechs described higher prominence which mean more customer and transaction key motivation for alliance database around one million existing customer incredibly tempting learning two fintechs mentioned intending acquire knowledge about the market and the industry bank already have long tradition alongside learning how bank think term partnership and investment fintechs want understand more and more how the customer think and how industry structure work how bank provide service for independent financial service provider most motif within the bank and fintech group are unique and distinct with only one overlap between both group however the picture becomes more complex when looking the side different motif figure compare the motif bank and fintechs the circle represent the motif while their size indicates comparatively how frequently they were mentioned the horizontal category show whether the motif can seen matching complementary neutral this categorization reflects the manifestation the motif relationship our case firstly neutral motif are predominantly beneficial only one side alliance prove their own competitive advantage some bank use fintechs for innovative often also highly customized application programming specialized task other bank use alliance with fintechs opportunity evolve their own business model some fintechs pursue the formation alliance primarily promote their product based the bank trust and cred ibility secondly complementary motif are considered beneficial for both side alliance and supportive for furthering digital innovation for example the motive bank rapid innovation through fintechs can well harmonize with providing them with needed resource banking license bank aim outsource certain activity such developing digital standard application peertopeer money transfer apps implementation new regula tory rule and servicing niche customer group these activity can covered fintechs and the same time fintechs can acquire more customer for themselves with the bank help this may lead coopetition bank and fintechs cooperate and compete simultaneously bengtsson kock bled econference digital transformation meeting the challenge june bled slovenia conference proceeding holotiuk klus lohwasser moormann motif form alliance for digital innovation the case bank and fintechs lastly matching motif are identical among the alliance partner and offer good fit form new alliance learning can improve both partner positioning through making for certain shortcoming such missing knowledge about digital technology the bank side missing knowledge regulatory and legal specification the fintechs side however learning requires time and trust create deep business knowledge figure overview the motif form alliance discussion and concluding remark the financial service industry considered relatively conservative and alliance with start ups are relatively new phenomenon this field the topic bank fintech alliance highly relevant for both practice and academic research recent study have examined fintechs such puschmann and the emergence global fintech market haddad hornuf however the motivation bank and fintechs partner not been analyzed depth building the literature fintechs digital innovation and alliancepartner selection this paper identifies several motif partner form bankfintech alliance the result show variety motif which are often heterogeneous both within the two group and across the comparison the clustering proposed figure first approach systemizing motivation this field the category within the framework are based the frequency with which similar motif were mentioned which take indicate their rele vance the finding show that bank tend pursue rapid innovation and competitive advantage while fintechs seek benefit from the bank reputation and expand their customer base trust seems key for fintechs finance sensitive issue for customer who bled econference digital transformation meeting the challenge june bled slovenia conference proceeding holotiuk klus lohwasser moormann motif form alliance for digital innovation the case bank and fintechs not want entrust their money unknown provider and regulatory authority however trust also play role for bank potential partner thus established bank have protect their own reputation which could damaged alliance partner misconduct the heterogeneity motif not necessarily negative the motif are not contradictory all case and thus not mutually exclusive for example bank strategic motivation come more digital aligns with fintechs motivation expand their customer base for example the alliance partner expanded customer base increase visibility the bank new orienta tion yielding common benefit comparison the motif show that only learning applies both fintechs are especially interested building functioning and stable company while bank want learn more about the dynamic and agility fintechs organizational learning more precisely interorgani zational learning oftendiscussed topic both academia and practice which also rel evant for bankfintech alliance bank can either develop innovative product themselves outsource fintechs for more rapid outcome they want become more innovative them self fintechs can serve companion throughout the learning process theoretically bank can then develop fintech product inhouse and longer depend alliance fintechs could also benefit from temporary alliance developing stable organizational structure expand ing their customer base and building their reputation they may also able eventually break away from the partnership establish themselves competitor however bank not strive for learning but rather want save cost and resource through outsourcing their partner consequently fintechs bargaining power may increase over time and the condition for further collaboration could renegotiated our finding show that bank value achieving competitive advantage slightly more than learning this pose question regarding the actual design the alliance and the associated objective bank and fintechs knight state that trust teamwork and commitment are prerequisite for learning interorganizational relationship corresponding factor require time and interface daily collaboration furthermore sobrero and robert identify the type problem solving activity being partitioned and their level interdependency with the rest the pro ject relevant regarding performance outcome partnership this stimulates tradeoff between shortterm efficiency increase and longterm learning process sobrero robert wellfunctioning learning process interest which seems the case for both bank and fintechs customerserviceprovider relationship which limited sharing the fintech product insufficient closer form alliance with tight collaboration efficient knowledge

special attention should paid existing form interaction identify opportunity for interorganizational learning this paper focus the motivation partner but not the design the alliance itself our study also limited the small number company interviewed which restricts the validity the result additionally only the german market considered thus larger study are necessary confirm the robustness the result furthermore the assessment whether certain motif are contradictory complementary depends context making general state ments difficult despite these limitation the study outline approach systematizing the various motif for bankfintech alliance believe that our result are generalizable due country specific argument our reasoning and transferable other context country mar kets with similar characteristic still this should tested further research addition the abovementioned implication for future research practical implication include the sug gestion that both bank and fintechs
