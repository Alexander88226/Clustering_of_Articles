cause the difficulty smes are currently facing regarding access funding the netherlands the exploratory research all the new alternative financing option discussed chapter research goal and question from the problem statement overall goal this research derived this result several research question rqs that construct the thesis the answer these research question lead achieving the overall goal analysis the current dutch financing market for smes and the alternative financing option will value and smes general however would then still have put lot time deciding which financing option can suitable for the financing need particular sme each financing option their own characteristic and specification therefore the second part this master thesis funding decision support tool from now also referred tool designed aid financial consultant proposing selected shortlist financing option for smes financing need this way the user doe not have market research his her own but can immediately contact and apply for the right financier which are likely finance the sme need the overall goal the master thesis formulated follows overall goal analyze the current dutch financing market for smes research the newly emerged alternative financing option and develop tool for proposing suitable financier the market for certain financing need sme chosen focus smes because mentioned before client are merely smes addition currently big corporation are not having trouble applying for traditional bank loan het financieele dagblad support the achievement the overall goal set research question been formulated research question what the current state the financing market for smes the netherlands sub question what are the financing need smes sub question how are smes currently financed sub question what the situation for smes applying for funding what difficulty they face and what are the reason for this research question which form suitable financing option exist for client and what are each one most important characteristic research question what are the most suitable financing option available for client choose from when having certain funding need first all the research divided into roughly two distinct part the first part describes the analysis the current financing market for smes the netherlands and the alternative financing option available for sme client first two rqs the second part the research focus the created finance decision support tool described previously for the first research question chosen not necessarily compare the current financing market with the financing market before the crisis doe not add extra value for the overall goal the research merely interest research the current situation the financing market for smes however cause the current situation can consequence the financial crisis and are evidently referred furthermore been decided only research the dutch financing market for smes from the literature review completed prior the thesis noticed that the financing market other country even close the germany substantially different for the second research question all possible financing option for smes are researched other than classic bank loan and current account assumed that reader this research already posse fair amount knowledge about the functioning bank only the alternative financing option the netherlands are discussed client are all based this country methodology the research conducted using the regulative cycle van strien the regulative cycle problemsolving cycle which consists the following step problem statement analysis and diagnosis plan action intervention and evaluation the cycle depicted the following figure figure regulative cycle van strien relation with the thesis with the help figure explained how the phase the cycle van strien are related answering the research question this point the first step problem statement been completed the second analysis and diagnosis step fulfilled the first and second research question the current dutch finance market for smes analyzed and the reason for sme funding problem are clarified furthermore the alternative financing option the netherlands are analyzed result the second step the problem statement paragraph clarified and sharpened therefore providing good basis for plan action step the plan action intervention and evaluation phase covered the third research question the created funding decision support tool the intervention step and the validation completed testing the tool with two completed anonymous client case where their aim fund these business the finance proposal that given for each the two company case compared with how the business financed practice theoretical and practical contribution theoretical contribution the literature review brought the fact that there limited academic literature alternative financing option for smes the netherlands the literature about traditional financing alternative for smes factoring leasing and informal investor however are plentiful option such crowdfunding and private equity firm are widely spread the literature however not focused the dutch market specific new alternative such individual invoice factoring credit union microfinancing regional development company institutional investment fund government guarantee sme stock exchange and emerging online credit supplier are more absent literature let alone described for the dutch market besides senior lecturer tiasnimbas business school tilburg poos mention that the development the alternative financing market are fast resulting academic literature lagging behind this thesis first all contributes the academic literature stating all financing option the netherlands meant for the sme segment also option not suitable for this research doe not end with stating the option available but also each one characteristic amount type finance financing period financing goal etc described this way academic will not have market research for the netherlands anymore and academic from other country can learn from the alternative financing option available the netherlands another addition the literature that result from the research that insight given into which financing option the netherlands are suitable for sme with certain financing need practical contribution this thesis provides finance decision support tool for that filter the appropriate financing option including the new alternative financier based the financing need the sme with this finance proposal the user can apply selected the financier for funding promptly without having research the market first this tool will save significant amount time when searching for relevant financier top that provides basis for combining financing option fulfill total funding need financier nowadays willing supply the total amount required funding their own higher risk multiple financier can combined supply the total amount required this new emerging trend called stacking financing option and boosted the declined willingness bank since the crisis finance complete funding need say sme requires funding and the funding need can split into multiple goal the tool proposes financing option for each the goal subsequently these option can combined arrange all funding required making each financier prone risk splitting the funding need over multiple financier the business make more attractive for each financier participate especially when the return firm are temporarily low huijgens this regularly the case for client above all will have knowledge about all financier the dutch financing market therefore can more adequately service their client also arranging funding from financier other than bank combining funding from new financier together with bank this will result higher funding success rate for client hence improving service thesis structure this introduction chapter stated the problem formulated discussed the overall goal the thesis and the research question answered order achieve the goal next that the methodology along which the thesis structured described and the contribution this thesis the academic literature and practice clarified the following chapter continues with exploration the current dutch financing market and the accompanying difficulty for smes chapter state all alternative financing option suitable for smes the netherlands and which one these are suitable for client chapter describes the functioning the finance decision support tool together with the choice and assumption used for the design two case study client are used validate the tool chapter and suggestion for future research and improvement the tool will discussed the last chapter current dutch financing market for smes this section analyzes the current dutch financing market for smes after the literature methodology described the definition sme reported smes require funding for various reason and therefore the funding need smes are described subsequently the dutch financing market analyzed and last the difficulty that smes are currently facing the funding market are discussed literature methodology increase the quality the literature used the inclusion and exclusion criterion are stated for this chapter only literature since used because literature before the financial crisis doe not adequately reflect the current situation the funding market also professional literature and government report from and onwards were used regarding academic literature paper from were only used they have above average number citation from onwards all relevant academic paper were used academic article have been critically assessed the information also applies smes the netherlands the nature the funding market varies quite significantly across country book and website were also used source the useful literature found during the process equal mix academic literature professional literature and research report funded the dutch government definition sme before the current dutch financing market analyzed important define sme because wide definition first defined what company belong the category sme the opinion differ across the world but chosen state the two most important definition since january the european commission defines smes the following the category micro small and mediumsized enterprise smes made enterprise which employ fewer than person and which have annual turnover not exceeding million euro andor annual balance sheet total not exceeding million euro table table definition sme the european commission category medium small micro employee turnover balance sheet total since january the dutch chamber commerce defines smes more the same the european commission except for the fact that the balance sheet total can not exceed kamer van koophandel see table table definition sme the dutch chamber commerce category medium small micro employee turnover balance sheet total the central bureau statistic cbs counted total company the netherlands these are company with over employee category big company and have one employee this implies that the company netherlands belong the sme class see figure this research however focused smes that have between and employee this group consists firm the netherlands the netherlands the most smes per caput the european union cbs company the netherlands freelance micro small medium big figure company the netherlands cbs sme client each financier focus segment smes when alternative financing option are researched important know which type smes are client sme client exclude micro company and starter the client base entirely formed out the category small and medium from table and table figure the company the netherlands all client are established for least three year have track record and are all dutch besloten vennootschappen the equivalent private limited company the limited liability company the funding need smes beck mac bhaird note that smes are important for the contribution employment the total contribution the gdp autoriteit consument markt this percentage not only high absolute term but also comparison with other european country where the contribution the gdp average autoriteit consument markt degryse goeij kappert write the following small unlisted firm make for more than all existing firm and are the engine growth most economy high importance the dutch economy that smes have good access funding they need funding for the execution activity the average amount sme orientates this varies between micro company small company and medium company panteia these need can come from investment goal housing machine vehicle improve working capital for shortterm financing smes mainly use current account autoriteit consument markt for longterm finance mostly loan with collateral are used external finance can the form corporate bond loan capital from shareholder panteia state that the period june until may the company approximately with two more people have orientated for funding around these company actually applied for funding totaling all company with more than two employee company that were profitable have orientated more than average for obtaining finance this also applies company with more than average solvency panteia plausible that financially wellperforming company focused investment and expansion company with low solvency often also orientate for obtaining financing for these company there greater need for working capital panteia fast grower orientate often for obtaining financing this obvious because without adequate funding growth jeopardized most smes not apply for external financing the main source for investing activity still firm internal resource benthem sociaaleconomische raad large proportion about the financing need smes come from working capital sociaaleconomische raad also hebbink kruidhof slingenberg mention that smes mainly require funding for working capital panteia mention that other important funding need are caused housing equipment other fixed asset refinancing existing loan and acquisition comparison with previous year refinancing loan and financing investment taken bigger share the total financing need than previous year this can seen comparing earlier yearly research panteia dating back until this can explained for large part the fact that and the interest rate were more favorable than prior year the dutch chamber commerce researched the funding need smes with employee and the result can viewed table table financing need smes with employee multiple answer were possible the research the chamber commerce type financing need micro and small smes employee purchase machinery asset incl ictsoftware working capital inventory account receivable wage refinancing debt marketing internet and social medium productservice innovation development prefinancing large order improvement change housing investment process optimization and efficiency partial takeover growth staff export the percentage not add because the survey smes could indicate having multiple financing need the research only surveyed micro and small smes the netherlands not possible find better and more reliable data funding need for all sme category the netherlands nevertheless table doe provide decent indication the funding need dutch smes and show again that most the funding required for working capital panteia researched the nature funding application and concluded that the actual application were for debt finance see figure nature funding application smes may jun figure nature funding application smes panteia equitydebtboth together with financial consultant and this researched section funding need the tool user input for funding need defined this list reported section and the user the tool able choose funding need from this list current financing market the netherlands number the largest part the funding dutch smes come from the three big bank namely abn amro ing and rabobank they have for year financed the smes autoriteit consument markt autoriteit consument markt claim there are other bank that fund smes large scale the smaller bank that are active however focus specific market segment triodos bank deutsche bank and svenska handelsbanken since number bank have been merged taken over for instance the takeover friesland bank the rabobank and fortis bank abn amro furthermore number bank decreased their lending activity smes deutsche bank even stopped bank deutsche bank mentioned that they abandoned part their sme lending activity because the service model customized loan approval not profitable anymore het financieele dagblad almost all smes with loan have one one the three major bank see figure figure survey among smes asking which bank smes have loan outstanding gfk figure survey among smes asking what type credit smes have their particular bank gfk despite the need for more capital smes use relatively few alternative bank financing the dutch association bank claim smes are financed bank loan and alternative way finance this last group mostly consists for more than out the traditional alternative informal investor business angel leasing and factoring new alternative way financing crowdfunding credit union microfinancing sme stock exchange institutional investment fund etc are responsible for than half percent total sme funding nederlandse vereniging van banken regarding other country the market for alternative financing the netherlands relatively young and undeveloped financieel dagblad wardrop however the market for alternative financing currently growing fast dutch bank had total billion loan issued smes nederlandse vereniging van banken can seen from figure that most the granted loan are smaller than however these loan make for only the volume all loan outstanding smes figure granted bank loan amount smes mln mln and mln mln figure bank loan amount nederlandsche bank volume granted loan bank smes mln mln and mln mln figure volume granted loan dutch bank smes nederlandsche bank panteia researched that smes that applied for funding received the full amount received part their request and application got rejected the rejection rate have improved with regard previous year for instance panteia found that bank loan application were rejected big corporation are more likely receive the funding than smes panteia for the class small and medium company table and table the success rate are higher than for micro company for micro company the success rate just the period june may panteia henk kamp the dutch minister economic affair claim that with micro and small company loan application got rejected and medium company nrc smes orientated for total billion from june may which only billion actually applied for panteia one can understand these number the way that after first orientation talk with bank other supplier capital these smes already feel their plan will not have big chance funded top that applying for funding requires much time this combination can make many smes decide not apply looking from broader perspective one can conclude that billion needed funding already rejected before actually applying the amount actually applied for got rejected fully totaling billion panteia one can therefore conclude that billion needed sme funding not received the period june may looking these number this way one could conclude that little more than half the required funding actually received according panteia general smes pay higher interest rate for loan than big company because funding smes riskier micro company pay the highest interest rate about more than the average sme furthermore panteia claim that the most common reason for rejecting funding application are too large risk too low solvency and too large debt comparing profit the rejected company claim that rejection for fund application had serious consequence for growth impediment including not being able invest for the rejected smes meant discontinuation the company panteia the average processing time application for funding seven week the average processing time application for funding higher than what business deem acceptable panteia figure composed nederlandsche bank indicates that the total amount credit supplied dutch monetary financial institution mfis all nonfinancial corporation the country decreasing since the minister economic affair henk kamp confirms this letter written december the dutch house representative the credit volume outstanding used average billion and average billion nederlandsche bank the biggest decrease are the loan hebbink kruidhof slingenberg credit supply dutch mfis dutch nonfinancial corporation monthlygrowth annualgrowth figure growthdecline credit supply dutch monetary financial institution nederlandsche bank since the demand for credit rising again after the demand dropped between and centraal plan bureau the sme loan are more than day late with repayment and are monitored special department bank for account that experience repayment problem elsevier the percentage problem loan currently declining suggesting recovery the economy nederlandse vereniging van banken the percentage problem loan compared total loan the netherlands relatively low when compared with other european country nederlandse vereniging van banken difficulty smes funding since the financial crisis the funding landscape for smes changed dramatically clear that before the crisis bank were critical towards loan application and much easier for smes get funding mckinsey company practically all the medium and academic article after relating sme funding mention that funding for smes became more difficult since the economic crisis holton lawless mccann proved that bank increase credit condition when the economy weak this section examines how these difficulty are caused many academic article mention smes the group who appears have great difficulty acquiring financial mean the postcrisis time through traditional bank lending artola and genre casey and toole mac bhaird paulet parnaudeau and abdessemed this cause measured negative effect firm investing activity artola and genre behr norden and noth mamica and tridico wehinger mention that european smes have been affected more the crisis than american one also claim smes suffered double blow since the crisis the one hand important decrease demand good and service and the other hand tightening credit condition also mckinsey company confirms this wehinger claim smes are general more vulnerable time crisis than big corporation for the following reason they are diversified have difficulty downsizing activity they are already small have weaker financial structure little credit rating and have fewer financing option mill confirms this smes have buffer capacity lower profit and reduced value collateral since the crisis hebbink kruidhof slingenberg last smes are often dependent one main shareholder which the engine the organization making more risky definition large corporation are average risky have lower operational cost and have better negotiation position they therefore pay lower interest than smes autoriteit consument markt according commissie hoek the reduction outstanding loan can one hand explained decline demand for funding smes since the crisis situation economic stagnation the demand for working capital asset housing and investment decrease according nederlandse vereniging van banken the decreased domestic consumption and lower growth expectation reduced demand for financing combined with the reduced risk appetite bank this translated into decrease loan volume outstanding since can seen figure the demand for credit however after long time decreasing demand rising since while the acceptation criterion have not become milder not more strict centraal plan bureau according mckinsey company the number problem loan increased the period least four time currently the number problem loan the total loan issued elsevier money which lent out can not reinvested nrc this forced bank tighten lending condition according mckinsey and company bank admit they have too easily issued loan before the crisis furthermore they claim that lending smes itself become lowprofit business monitoring and information cost are high and for relatively small loan lot costly time spent the credit approval phase the cost for risk judgment and other handling cost are independent the size the loan kamp top that smes are frequently nontransparent making them more costly judge baalhuis kamp state his letter the dutch house representative that the most important reason for the decrease the supply funding the stricter acceptation criterion bank according him mainly earning capacity the size the firm healthy cash flow and solvency figure are key for successfully attracting funding addition mckinsey and company note that increased capital requirement basel and iii made even attractive for bank general provide loan the relatively risky smes for loan small company bank need reserve capital mckinsey company relation the high cost administration the loan the yield are relatively low goverde explains basel and iii international framework for liquidity risk measurement standard and monitoring for the banking sector the objective the reform improve the banking sector ability absorb shock arising from financial and economic stress whatever the source thus reducing the risk spillover from the financial sector the real economy during the economic crisis many bank were holding insufficient liquidity buffer and were not able cope with credit loss the weakness the banking sector were exposed the financial system and real economy and resulted massive contraction liquidity and credit availability because basel and iii bank have finance every loan with minimum required amount equity this mean that bank are limited their capacity supply loan because the equity restriction for riskier type lending such sme lending basel iii now requires bank hold additional capital dutch bank are forced improve their capital ratio and there are three way doing that retain earnings raise new equity reducing the balance sheet total het financieele dagblad raising new equity extremely costly and even impossible for the major bank rabobank due their cooperative structure bank therefore decide shorten their balance sheet total which implies cut credit supply sociaaleconomische raad nederlandsche bank and centraal plan bureau state that basel iii will have severe implication for sme lending especially because dutch bank decide process these standard even earlier than sociaaleconomische raad basel iii also requires bank hold additional capital for unused overdraft limit and working capital financing healthy smes which deserve lot lower risk weight are automatically disadvantage these higher risk weight will soon lead reduction lending either volume the price credit all all the new regulation basel iii will provide room for sme lending and plan for basel imply even more stringent capital requirement icaew mainly smes with funding need smaller than will experience trouble the future because profit for bank will too low negative sociaaleconomische raad report bnp paribas showing that economic growth already and will even more limited due the shortage sme credit supply bank nrc koelewijn professor corporate finance nyenrode business school state het financieele dagblad that smes are suffering from the tightening credit condition bank bank are filling their balance sheet with safe mortgage resulting money being available finance company especially smes also mention that lot smes the netherlands have too low solvency which cause bank restrain from financing the demand for risk capital therefore emerging but bank generally not supply this alternative financier will have fill this gap minister kamp economic affair make also clear that there growing need risk capital for smes and that currently hard for smes get access alternative financing option the reason for this that the knowledge about these financier lacking among business also the distribution function these new alternative form bottleneck generally there capital from alternative financier available and there plenty demand from smes well however difficult for the supplier and customer find each other furthermore benthem state that the cost capital alternative finance perceived high contrast traditional financing whether this true not and perceived rather option for constrained company concludes that alternative finance organization are troubled with image and trust complication resulting them being overlooked smes ecorys mention that entrepreneur are having difficulty finding the right funding party because the abundance new alternative benthem state that alternative finance can solution for the current sme financing complication concluding this section described the difficulty the financial market for smes the netherlands and reason the need for other financing option evident the main problem that these alternative are relatively unknown smes this problem described previous reference and reported frequently recent newspaper article het financieele dagblad therefore the following chapter the alternative financing option are researched and described alternative financing option this chapter the alternative financing option which are available dutch smes are discussed assumed that the traditional financing activity bank are well known reader this thesis and are only shortly elaborated chosen elaborate first traditional alternative financing option and subsequently new alternative since the financial crisis which are suitable for sme client new financing option which are suitable for smes general but not for client are listed section discussed why these are not suitable for client because these argument are also regarded added value the research mentioned section starting sme client year lifetime all client are established enterprise with long track record provides mainly funding for their sme client starting until most financing option which are mentioned are one that supply funding this range however some financing option available fund significantly smaller amount the one which finance until are still chosen included the list because they can form part total funding solution consisting multiple financier literature methodology preferable use most recent academic and professional literature because rapid development alternative financing option make literature about this topic fairly quickly outdated several financing alternative exist since long before the crisis prefinancial crisis academic paper professional literature and government report have also been used website and book were used well only academic paper until with above average number citation were used and all relevant academic paper from the topic alternative financing were used practice mainly recent professional literature and research commissioned the dutch government were used discovered that academic literature lagging behind regarding the current development the dutch financing market visit alternative finance seminar and fair the literature about alternative financing that used did provide useful information but did not supply enough detail and exact information about how these alternative financier operate and what their condition are therefore decided visit four event which all had plenary session and fair with alternative financier present these visit made possible properly investigate these financier consulting representative these institution great deal the information about these new financier the following section and how they operate come from noted conversation with these representative statement these representative were far possible verified with literature and discussed with experienced financial expert also professional literature could verified with practice this way the following event translated from dutch english were visited and described the following order date event title organizer and location day the new funding rabobank tilburg alternative finance municipality almere almere new funding event kroesewevers accountant enschede special financing synpact and mkb nederland utrecht suitable traditional and alternative financing option for and their

shared among member borrowing money via credit union often cheaper than bank and smes have better access specialized knowledge both borrower and lender are coowners the credit union although credit union finance project until and could part funding combination the reason for not including credit union suitable financier for client because the decision process within credit union too slow representative credit union mention that often the case that there not central amount deposited and being managed one credit committee instead every member investor who willing invest part the amount will decide for themselves this result lengthy decision process furthermore the dutch minister economic affair kamp state that financing capacity credit union limited although there abundant interest developing credit union only been used ten credit union finance smes the netherlands kamp must noted that unclear from this source exactly which time period referred other source were found with more

the statement cash flow deal with the cash movement that took place over particular period atrill mclaney show the source and cash for period and reveals the amount cash the company hand each statement itself provides only part the information company financial status together they provide complete picture investopedia the user asked first fill the profit and loss account and the balance

firm financial position and larger extent financial performance often predictor the future prognosis can made fairly well for the current year and the one after after this time prognosis tend become unreliable according the balance sheet the tool contains separate revaluation column adjust the balance sheet the previous year note that when financing business financier compare the market value with the book value asset the most recent auditor annual account this done order for financier more accurately judge the collateral capacity business which further elaborated section suppose the inventory business valued the balance sheet the auditor however the inventory actually worth because part the inventory appears damaged and therefore can not resold case company default the user the tool then able mutate the value the balance sheet conveniently resulting adjusted balance sheet after revaluation the adjusted balance sheet after revaluation also take into account deferred tax the

the performance and strength and weakness there generally accepted list ratio that can applied financial statement decided automatically calculate the ratio that considers relevant when come decisionmaking funding collaboration with consultant decided that the tool incorporates the following ratio which are important for making credit decision current ratio quick ratio working capital solvency account receivable day account payable day earning capacity ebitda net debtebitda debt service coverage ratio interest coverage ratio free cash flow the definition meaning and interpretation these ratio can found appendix iii particular the solvency earning capacity ebitda and free cash flow are important ratio when financing business this explained section funding guideline the only ratio that can only partly derived from the financial statement the free cash flow fcf measure the cash flow available for distribution all company stockholder investopedia can regarded cash available after the financing project maintain expand the asset base company with higher operating and free cash flow tend have higher share value investopedia the fcf surplusdeficit the net profit after tax plus depreciation minus the change working capital minus capital expenditure the operating cash flow calculated likewise but without the capital expenditure investopedia the calculation the operational cash flow automatically derived from the profit and loss account and balance sheet the fcf partly automatically derived from the profit and loss account net profit after tax depreciation and balance sheet mutation provision working capital and longterm debt the user will still need manually fill the cash movement dividend payment capital contribution shareholder investment expense other expense each year resulting the fcf surplus deficit the reason for this that dividend payment and capital contribution reflect the equity account but can not necessarily derived directly investment expense reflect mutation asset value but can not derived directly either question step the second input sheet requires the user first fill question about the firm name number employee industry and the region the netherlands the firm operating the industry and the number employee need known order compare the company with other company the same industry and employee amount category decided let the user choose the industry from the standard industrial classification list sbi which composed the central bureau statistic cbs this list itself based the industry activity classification the european union nace this information compared the black box data mainly from the central bureau statistic cbs which described section and subsequently displayed the output step section the region the firm based demanded that regional development company rdc listed suitable financing option automatically generates the name and other information the rdc which active that region see section funding goal seventeen different funding goal have been defined chosen first all order the funding goal four general category namely investment innovation expansion replacement and refinancing there exists significant difference between applying for expansion capital replacement investment for instance equity financier are only willing finance business that have high growth potential furthermore larger working capital need originates when firm expanding from experience the choice order the funding goal four category force the user think about the type investment the firm want make cooperation with consultant exbanker and the literature section funding need smes the four general category have been extended with specific funding goal which are listed table table funding

been listed the sequence they appear the balance sheet the first goal includes productservice innovation and development the second goal project shorter than five year etc added the list because the government initiative innovation fund mkb can financing option section the goal expansion investment for transportation vehicle mainly meant for transportation firm firm with insourced transportation department for financing invoice the complete debtor portfolio can factored one can choose factor individual invoice therefore distinction between goal and made refinancing debt common practice accordance with exbanker decided also include goal refinancing equity refinancing equity happens when wellperforming company lack cash pay out dividend shareholder this case company requires loan pay out shareholder suppose firm solvency implying equity debt the firm can then refinance for instance equity with loan which used pay out dividend the solvency will afterwards decrease investment marketing and advertising have been chosen not include because from experience happens rarely that client need funding for specifically for this goal the latter purpose mostly financed internal resource informal investor total the user can define four separate funding goal need the tool and can for each chose funding amount and expected financing period this force the user split the total funding need and define precisely this result that for each funding goal suitable financier will listed the funding proposal output this way financing option can combined form one total funding solution this choice made accordance with the newly emerging tendency toward stacking finance form discussed section when choosing expected finance period for debt finance advised not take loan longer than the depreciation period the asset kers partner for financing individual invoice maximum three month can chosen this will displayed pop the tool when the user selects either these goal furthermore display maximum minimum amount that can factored based the account receivable item the adjusted balance sheet furthermore the user need state separately the owner tolerates making the business idea public online not crowdfunding financing option will excluded from the funding proposal the toleration power and influence financier combined with dilution existing share also asked not financing option which only supply equity finance will excluded from the funding proposal well last asked pawning restriction creditor are active invoice indicating factoring invoice will possible not collateral the user asked fill the current existing credit facility the business loan current account loan subordinated loan vendor loan vendor loan subordinated and for each facility the amount repaid along with the collateral amount issued been provided this facility turn out that the collateral provided for credit facility excess the amount due repaid this value will automatically calculated and displayed this give signal contact the credit supplier order renegotiate the collateral term down approximately the amount that need repaid this can result being able offer more collateral new financier increasing the likelihood they will included the financing proposal the company asset can serve collateral for financial institution that require them however from experience and huijgens financier view only percentage the book value the asset collateral intangible asset such goodwill software and intellectual property are often not used collateral from experience this confirmed kers partner and borsboom dekker huls huijgens provides his book indication the minimum and maximum percentage bank utilize guideline for estimating the collateral capacity firm next that former banker asked give input from his experience these percentage the result are listed table table minimum and maximum collateral percentage utilized bank for estimating collateral capacity firm from asset two source are used huijgens and the experience former banker asset collateral min huijgens max huijgens min exbanker max exbanker property and plant machine and equipment mean transport inventory incl finished good work progress account receivable trade cash the biggest difference the two source their view the asset property and plant and machine and equipment the reason for this stated the former banker that some business premise are specific for industry and are difficult sold steel factory therefore much lower minimum indicated furthermore the former banker mention that machine are general fairly easy sell for decent price resulting higher maximum percentage the user the tool can manually decide dropdown list which percentage the business asset can serve collateral the user can choose percentage the range provided the former banker because first analyzed the value huijgens and subsequently gave his comment from experience note that the user must always insert the percentage which resembles the execution value the asset case default that the value most financier work with when determining collateral capacity the total collateral amount available resulting from the user input percentage will then corrected for the collateral that already been issued this result the total collateral available for issuing new financier note that the original asset value are collected from the adjusted balance sheet after revaluation asset done step credit rating step optional the tool considered expert decision support tool and therefore requires give the user idea the creditworthiness firm optional credit rating model can filled the basis the credit rating taken from huijgens supplemented small firm premium factor the research conducted van sande and remaining criterion which consultant consider important factor when grading the creditworthiness firm the credit rating model from huijgens consists three main component table the three main component the credit rating model and each element weight the overall score weight component financial ratio entrepreneur company quality rating the firm industry every criterion all main component need rated from very bad very good most the financial ratio are rated automatically from the ratio calculated step each criterion carry different weight also which judged expert panel the rating criterion the model can found appendix for each the three main element score will generated subsequently the overall credit rating consists the weighted average the main component form overall credit score the original weight mentioned table were originally valued and respectively huijgens however when consulting former banker became clear that more emphasis needed the entrepreneur and company quality regard the ownermain shareholder the main drive behind the enterprise especially when come smes this resulted the weight displayed table mentioned earlier the credit rating model huijgens been supplemented with small firm premium criterion from the research van sande van sande show there more risk involved the valuation sme compared the valuation big corporation account for this risk small firm premium factor were added his valuation model for smes his valuation model asked first all score these small firm premium factor which would then incorporated his valuation model these small firm premium factor are also asked scored this credit rating model the factor include dependence customer dependence supplier dependence management spread activity barrier entry and flexibility deal with changing market demand condition these factor have been added criterion the element entrepreneur company quality furthermore consultation with the criterion debt service ratio the topicality financial statement and expert judgement score the company were added the credit rating the topicality financial statement considered important because not uptodate financial statement could suggest disorganized financial administration the user the ability add expert judgement score the firm score which relatively big impact the total score the reason for adding this criterion with large corresponding weight because truthful credit rating sme firm can not only formed systematically modeled credit rating method the entrepreneur often the main engine and determining factor the firm success especially the case smes important judge this aspect well judgement trust leadership transparency and capability the entrepreneur can incorporated mean this expert judgement score the overall credit rating thus also score between and huijgens interprets the meaning score the way described table table interpretation the credit rating score huijgens score meaning extremely low rating lending money irrational very low rating lending money unwise unless collateral can provided lending considered condition that prospect and forecast are well argued for and collateral provided preferably loan shorter than year lending appropriate for fair price possible compare this score with standard poor credit rating definition major rating agency such not publicize how they rate firm but the meaning their credit rating known standard poor give the user indication how these score compare the model display the estimated corresponding credit rating the result are displayed table table indication the relation between the credit rating the tool and standard poor rating credit rating tool comparable ccc bbb aaa decided not make the credit rating mandatory requirement because doe not have direct influence the funding proposal the credit rating give the expert user indication the creditworthiness the firm and therefore also indication the interest rate expect when applying for debt finance firm with lower credit rating can expected pay for higher interest rate possibly causing liquidity problem longer repayment period and for these firm suggested the output also consider subordinated

financing option from the previous section and the user input step used for automatically selecting financing option resulting generated funding proposal the question tab step the user required fill four financing goal along with the required amount and expected financing period for each these funding goal suitable list financing option will presented the output sheet step selection process undergone per funding goal achieve the list this described figure figure flow diagram the selection process financing option for funding goal can seen from figure the selection decision process based the following input information funding goal whether equity finance tolerable for the owner power and influence business whether making business idea public tolerable for the owner required funding amount expected financing period collateral available depends the funding goal the financier and the type finance collateral required when funding equity finance definition doe not require collateral supplier subordinated loan receive higher interest because they have either collateral priority after the bank pledge huijgens mention that collateral form minor role for vendor loan and supplier credit for crowdfunding the role larger but still limited huijgens with crowdfunding often the case that business owner are held personally liable collateral crucial for bank lease and factoring however suppose firm decides buy new housing property lease new truck factor invoice these same asset will serve collateral the financier will then only have determine the firm enough cash flow repay the loan well the interest decided that debt financier excl subordinated debt financier require collateral for the funding goal which not directly fund asset that could serve collateral accordance with chosen that the tool requires collateral mean the firm asset when the user chooses funding goal from table section when selecting financing option for one these funding goal the debt financing option excl subordinated debt will filtered based the firm collateral capacity for instance firm requires for project bank will only listed option the firm can provide least collateral decided not filter goal and based the collateral capacity the firm because difficult determine the amount collateral which required for these funding goal when funding acquisition part the takeover amount paid for the intrinsic value and part for goodwill for the goodwill part collateral demanded bank however the tool can not filter financing option based collateral requirement only for the goodwill part

collateral availableselection optionscrowdfunding inexcluded when refinancing debt multiple type debt can refinanced the case mortgage refinanced the property serf collateral however when for instance subordinate vendor loan refinanced the new financier might partly demand collateral decided that when funding goal collateral also required for debt financier because the inventory itself only marginal value collateral from experience inventory are worth little when execution sale take place the data attribute from the list section which were decided not use selection criterion for funding proposal are number and evidently and these characteristic not form crucial decision criterion for the initial proposal instead these characteristic are mentioned alongside the list suitable financing option the output that the user can subsequently view these characteristic per financing option make profound decision when selecting decided not filter attribute because the proposed list consists mostly financing option not specific name financing institution evidently would too timeconsuming research every institution excluded industry for the specific financial institution the list government supported rdcs neos fundiq however the favored and excluded industry are displayed together with the other nondecision characteristic mentioned above give the user adequate information for selection step industry data the tool considered expert decision support tool the user provided with useful information about the company industry and comparable firm therefore several sheet industry data from the central bureau statistic cbs have been added the tool number company per industry categorized per employee class from number bankrupted company per industry from financial performance indicator solvency and current ratio company per industry categorized per employee class excl financial service industry all three sheet exclude data freelancer single employee firm and company with more employee they are not client the industry cbs data have been ordered according the standard industrial classification list sbi which make convenient for the tool compare the company industry input step with these data sheet the cbs contacted more recent data available for the latter data sheet the cbs pointed out that their supplier this data the dutch ministry economic affair stopped measuring these financial performance indicator since been tried retrieve more recent data from other source such ing bank the chamber commerce but this data not exportable software and only available against high cost respectively the cbs defines current ratio and the solvency this data sheet current ratio solvency way cbs calculates the solvency the following way solvency way the reason for calculating the solvency accordingly because intangible asset posse book value but are highly unlikely sold for this value case company default for the purpose comparing also chosen also calculate the solvency the way cbs for the output step furthermore data sheet from huijgens solvency benchmark per industry sbi detailed classification been added the black box appendix this will provide the user indication for what good and bad solvency for company specific industry the definition solvency used huijgens again different solvency way huijgens for the purpose comparing the solvency inserted firm the tool also calculated the way huijgens the output step relevant industry data for the user firm the number company active bankruptcy rate solvency current ratio and solvency benchmark will displayed along with the funding proposal output before the funding proposal the output sheet first display the credit rating filled step and the altman zscore together with their interpretation subsequently the number company the firm industry and employee class shown together with the number bankruptcy the industry from supply the user with more relevant meaning the number bankruptcy the firm industry also bankruptcy rate from calculated besides the average solvency and current ratio the firm industry and employee class are given cbs data together with the firm actual solvency and current ratio last the solvency benchmark critical low sufficient optimal strong surplus from huijgens the firm industry are displayed funding proposal step for each the funding goal selected list suitable financing option will appear all available financing option have been selected the basis criterion the input mentioned section for each these option the user supplemented with additional information from section the cost class type finance supplied which industry are and which are particularly not financed network and advice function availability the market average application time maximum grace period extra useful information and list actual financial institution the user sme could apply furthermore factoring individual invoice displayed suitable financing option there will warning for these option the case pawning restriction have been indicated active the input sheet step the format the funding proposal list suitable financing option per funding goal deliberately chosen stimulate idea about combining different type financing option form one total funding solution discussed section the new way financing recognized conscious choice different financing option business which consciously choose financier are seen more professional and are more likely raise funding huijgens this point the user can decide end the process because the tool provided the necessary information suitable financing option for the specified funding goal however the user want view the effect the balance sheet funding option the user will have manually select financing option subsequently asked choose the type finance that the selected financier supply the user can use the guideline the following section select the best option and type from the shortlist funding guideline this section funding guideline will mentioned which the user can use select the most optimal financing option for the funding goal huijgens note that the three most important selection criterion for the first filtering round financing option are the duration the funding the amount funding and the risk perception because the tool already selects financing option based the funding duration and amount only the risk perception the firm discussed this section firm can not only funded debt but also requires equity finance the main function equity risk absorption huijgens the firm temporarily realizes insufficient return there are obligation towards supplier equity finance contrast with debt financier the more equity firm posse higher solvency the lower the financial risk the firm because the firm more resistant misfortune huijgens the riskier the firm perceived low credit rating the greater the amount risk capital that demanded kers partner the current financing market there exists great attention from financier for sufficient equity sharp contrast with the precrisis era where bank used fund smes royally these time made enterprise get used high proportion debt relation equity huijgens according huijgens important for the expert user first analyze the proportion equitydebt solvency firm sufficient not the firm should not only acquire new debt but also portion equity subordinated debt often required have sufficient equity order receive debt finance kers partner mention that capitalintensive industrialproduction firm have higher solvency requirement than service company the tool advises the user the output apply for risk capital the case the solvency the company calculated huijgens way below the critical level solvency benchmark huijgens appendix the tool advises the user apply for cheaper debt finance the solvency level least sufficient decided not automate funding guideline which would result most optimal proposal the reason for this the time scope the thesis the complexity the then resulting inflexibility choosing other financing option and because the user the tool consultant considered experienced financing business the user can furthermore use the most important additional funding guideline below select the best financing option the additional guideline are based borsboom dekker huls kers partner huijgens and debt and interest payment must able paid from the earning capacity ebitda the ebitda the firm too low just enough cover these expense advised attract more equity finance the ebitda high and the firm posse stability there room for debt finance the firm expected grow very rapidly the near future year and prefers omit the repayment burden supplier equity finance are suitable option the generated cash flow firm roughly what left when existing capital and interest repayment are subtracted from the ebitda this cash flow combined with future generated cash flow the resource that can used make replacement investment and expansion investment the investment can not paid back time from current and future cash flow the investment will start generating return only after few year equity finance required the amount left over from the ebitda after subtracting repayment interest and necessary replacement investment the buffer capacity the firm against time with lower return the ebitda generally more important for financier than the collateral capacity the case collateral capacity problem but the firm generates enough cash advised try debt financing option with government guarantee scheme instead because remains cheaper than equity finance advised finance fixed asset with longterm debt equity and shortterm asset with shortterm debt finance the fixed core the current asset with longterm debt equity temporary fluctuation current asset should financed with current account this make possible finance fluctuation working capital flexible manner balance sheet after funding step the top this output sheet the tool each funding goal together with chosen financing option type finance and required amount summarized furthermore the adjusted balance sheet displayed too view the effect the balance sheet after funding the user can enter the mutation the mutation column the asset and liability side the balance sheet this will result balance sheet after funding which can for instance used present financier when applying for funding furthermore the financial ratio mentioned section will also updated according the balance sheet after funding one can notice for instance the effect solvency after funding the reason why the balance sheet after funding not generated automatically because number reason which make difficult generate correctly the main problem lie the fact that you decide use funding invest asset will not necessarily mean that the funding amount represents the same increase asset value renovation investment firm plant doe not necessarily mean the plant actually gained market value when choosing current account financing option unknown how much this credit will actually used when leasing can chosen lease financially operational the first case the asset appears the balance sheet and the second case doe not even more difficult estimate the value mutation investment intangible asset such software the case acquisition where the takeover amount split into intrinsic value and goodwill the user considered experienced when come financing smes decided let the user manually enter the mutation obtain the balance sheet after funding added value the tool for with the finance proposal produced the decision support tool the user can apply selected financier for funding therefore saving significant time not having research the market every time client need funding this way can more quickly approach suitable financier therefore improving service client top that this tool provides basis for combining financing option for different funding goal fulfill total funding need must noted that highmaintenance tool which requires regularly update the tool with possible new financing option that emerge the future modified specification finance period amount financed type finance the existing financing institution inserted the tool furthermore the tool supply with automatically calculated relevant financial ratio and developed credit rating model for decisionmaking purpose been made accessible compare client firm with industry data and quickly generate balance sheet after funding for chosen financing option besides instead having make new layout financial statement manually calculate financial ratio and develop credit rating each time client requires funding this tool incorporates these facet allowing the user produce these item relatively short time case study validation the finance decision support tool order validate the tool two completed client case were used both client case deal with sme need funding first the two smes and their corresponding funding need will shortly described for confidentiality reason the client case are anonymized both client case were supplied with complete financial statement with the description the firm and the financial statement the tool used find out which optimal financing option and type finance are suggested for each the sme funding need the outcome the tool will compared with the financing option and type finance that used fund the sme one hand analyzed the tool suggesting the financing option that were actually used the other hand analyzed the tool suggests other andor better financing option that could have been used chosen focus the validation section this thesis the financing proposal generated the tool this the main function the tool the tool however already been verified with multiple small fictive case during the design the tool this happened the way that fictive company case created with the idea that the tool needed give accompanying predefined outcome when filling the data and information the fictive case checked the projected accompanying funding proposal actually displayed not the problem found and the tool adapted the following section the two client case will described and subsequently used for validating the tool case study graphic printing company gpc table fact gpc number employee establishment time period case ebitdal ebitda turnover and profit solvency before funding september march description graphic printing company gpc specialized customized printing solution for packaging and pointofsale print gpc posse modern production facility which suitable for the processing plastic cardboard and paper the firm well organized and communicating with client one gpc usps gpc innovative and help every client personally with finding the best solution the company premise located environment good logistical infrastructure and the process are supported integrated workflow management system gpc experienced difficult time since and during the crisis but from the financial result show clear recovery pattern and meanwhile profit are being made again management mean management buyout mbo just prior the financial crisis the firm taken over from the former owner the current owner for approximately the mbo financed the bank normal loan and the vendor subordinated collateral vendor loan current account the current owner been active the graphical industry his complete working life and the main engine the firm his management team consists four member each least five year active gpc role the instigation gpc main bank due financial problem the financial crisis been involved external consultant since led large reorganization since the crisis and since then always been actively involved gpc also involved the following funding problem which described below funding goal the goal make gpc autonomously fundable improvement return and solvency after long period high debt obligation repaid from the funding problem took place mid realize financial independence and improvement return the following funding goal totaling were defined refinance subordinated vendor loan debt from the former owner the outstanding amount the vendor loan remained since the mbo because gpc had difficulty repaying the vendor due financial trouble relating the crisis soon the vendor loan been refinanced the former owner prepared write off the other and thus take loss this implies that gpc would have debt repay the financier the refinance expected paid back year funding for three year for the final installment payment the financial lease contract for the printing press the original lease contract ending for and until repaid with per year funding for five year for extra punch press because the capacity the current single punch press form bottleneck the production process input tool first all step the financial statement have been filled which result automatically generated financial ratio step the general question were answered along with existing credit facility and the percentage the firm asset which can used for collateral the result that the firm can not supply collateral new financier because all collateral been issued existing credit supplier the first funding goal refinancing debt corresponds goal number table section and expected repaid year the second and third funding goal are both considered replacement investment machine matching with goal number the firm turnover expected steadily grow the future but there are steep growth plan expectation therefore the investment are considered replacement investment the second funding goal expected repaid three year and the third one five year the manager not want financed equity step the credit rating been filled output tool step the output displayed that the firm credit rating result bbb and solvency furthermore the altman zscore make clear that the firm chance bankruptcy the grey zone defined altman section the basis these outcome the tool suggests the firm apply for subordinate loan furthermore gpc considerably lower solvency compared with and current ratio compared with than similar sized firm gpc industry the funding proposal described below for the first goal suggested refinance debt mean the bank the local regional development company rdc innovation quarter zuidholland subordinated loan the institutional investment fund neos and fundiq the sme stock exchange bond for the second goal the tool suggests finance the final installment payment the printing press with bank loan leasing vendor loan all three institutional investment fund bank loan with bmkb guarantee scheme for the third goal the tool suggest finance the new punch press the same mean stated goal but with rdc innovation quarter zuidholland subordinated loan extra option because the firm low solvency low credit rating and collateral issue there are practically other option than apply for subordinated debt for the first goal for the second and third goal however the machine can serve collateral making possible also financed normal longterm debt chosen not refinance the debt with bond the sme stock exchange the reason for this that listing too costly regarding the amount refinanced and the process would too timeconsuming explained section the bank can not chosen refinance either because this vendor loan debt can not backed collateral this leaf three suitable option left subordinated loan from the government supported rdc innovation quarter zuidholland subordinated loan from neos fundiq the second goal consists financing final installment payment lease contract leasing evidently not option anymore furthermore the institutional investment fund are not advised for goal because these supply more expensive subordinate debt therefore the following option remain for goal traditional bank loan with without bmkb government guarantee scheme vendor loan for the third goal the rdc and institutional investment fund are not advised because the highcost class therefore the following option remain for goal traditional bank loan with without bmkb government guarantee scheme leasing vendor loan actual result goal financed for the institutional investment fund neos neos issued loan subordinated the bank priority pledge agreed interest rate and repayment within seven year the remaining part the amount refinanced supplied once again the former owner mean subordinated loan with this construction the former owner immediately received for the subordinated vendor loan and for the current account wrote off and once more issued subordinated loan for gpc because neos refused refinance the complete vendor loan goal financed mean vendor loan from the lease institution this case the lease company which previously the lessor the printing press now issued loan gpc for the final installment payment the lease contract gpc will have repay per year over three year time period with interest rate goal funded mean operational lease from lease department another bank will repaid per year over year with final installment payment order not lower gpc solvency even more wiser make use operational lease instead financial lease because the press will not stated the balance sheet this way comparison result tool and result for each goal arranged funding from financial institution that were also proposed the tool for the first goal the tool show that could have also approached the new alternative rdc innovation quarter zuidholland the institutional investment fund fundiq pricewise the option would not have differed much both neos fundiq and the rdc are categorized the highcost class however fundiq finance for maximum six year and gpc repayment capacity could possibly form problem for the second goal the tool show that the final installment payment could have also been financed traditional bank loan however the financial lease institution that supplied the vendor loan owned gpc main bank decided the bank fund the press mean their lease institution for the third goal gpc could have also been financed traditional bank loan vendor loan instead operational leasing pricewise this would not have been big difference but gpc used bank loan vendor loan however the machine would have stated the balance sheet which would further reduce the firm solvency therefore operational lease the best option for this case the tool suggests the most suitable financing option that have actually been used fund gpc the most significant result the comparison that could have also approached the rdc fundiq fund the first funding goal case study fencing protection company fpc table fact fpc number employee establishment time period case ebitda turnover and profit solvency before funding october april description fencing protection company fpc focus the production sale installation and maintenance highquality fence protection facility their selfdeveloped brand the company developed quickly since the start and also made stable return during the recent financial crisis the company turnover expected grow per year with accompanying ebitda fpc doe not make use bank loan management the current management fpc consists three manager director director technology and director business development marketing which each posse year experience the fencing industry the first director posse the share fpc role been asked the manager the firm assist with the funding goal described the following section the first time and fpc are cooperating funding goal the manager the firm have plan for growth the firm strengthening the management team and are determined gaining extra knowledge therefore the second director want buyout silent fpc shareholder the second director will then posse the other fpc share the silent shareholder are united financial holding which are barely involved managing fpc the first director prepared guarantee the repayment the loan the second director with the takeover share the passive shareholder will replaced new active owner which will enable the firm realize growth plan first asked give independent second opinion the valuation fpc after the already made valuation fpc another financial consultancy firm second asked assist negotiation about the buyout amount and the funding related after negotiation with the vendor determined that the sold share are worth euro the buyout amount consists intrinsic value owner equity and goodwill the funding goal can therefore defined fund the buyout share from silent shareholder totaling split into intrinsic value and goodwill the expected financing period five year input tool first all step the financial statement have been filled which result automatically generated financial ratio step the general question were answered along with the percentage the firm asset which can used for collateral the result that the firm can supply worth collateral the goal the funding expansion investment mean buying out share the funding goal considered number table section because the takeover amount consists intrinsic value and goodwill and the collateral amount can wise split the funding goal two one for and one for the expected financing period for both funding goal five year note that evidently one funding goal can also filled the manager have indicated not wanted financed equity step the credit rating been filled output tool step the output displayed that the firm credit rating result and solvency furthermore the altman zscore make clear that the firm little chance bankruptcy within two year the basis these outcome the tool suggests the firm apply for lowcost debt finance the firm low risk and high solvency furthermore fpc considerably higher solvency compared with and current ratio compared with than similar sized firm fpc industry the funding proposal described shortly below for the first the funding the tool suggests finance mean bank loan vendor loan from the silent shareholder regional development company subordinated loan the three institutional investment fund sme stock exchange bond bank loan with bmkb guarantee scheme for the second the tool suggests the same note that only one funding goal inserted the suggestion are the same mentioned earlier because the high solvency and credit rating the firm doe not need use expensive equity finance subordinated debt therefore rdc the institutional investment fund and the sme stock exchange are out scope for fpc funding proposal the normal bank loan still suggested the funding proposal for funding goal even though not enough collateral can provided fpc the reason for this described section can now chosen fund the intrinsic value the share either vendor loan traditional bank loan with bmkb guarantee scheme because the firm collateral shortage the firm can not utilize bank loan without the bmkb guarantee scheme the goodwill can financed the same way the total can not financed the bank and bmkb guarantee scheme alone because collateral shortage for the bank shortage with the help this funding proposal option can finance the intrinsic value the share bank loan with bmkb guarantee scheme mediumcost class and the goodwill vendor loan lowcost class evident that order for the vendor loan realized the current silent shareholder must first agree with this proposal the current ebitda the firm and expected grow the future the firm will therefore have enough capacity repay five year per year together with expected lowinterest payment actual result arranged that the takeover amount financed bank loan with bmkb guarantee scheme the remaining financed the selling party the form vendor loan this vendor loan subordinate regard the bank loan directly transferred from the bank the vendor the moment the share were handed over this amount chosen because reflects approximately the intrinsic value the share all three major bank were willing fund fpc against lowinterest rate because the deal not perceived risky the cheapest offer with approximately interest rate chosen the bank provided security with the following pledge account receivable and inventory including machine software office equipment etc this totaled worth collateral because the collateral shortage for the bank loan the bank loan made use the bmkb guarantee scheme described section the unsecured part the loan now covered the government case fpc default the subordinated loan will need repaid five year with interest rate the silent shareholder posse second priority pledge the account receivable and inventory comparison result tool and result the tool doe suggest other financing option such the new alternative sme stock exchange institutional investment fund and the local rdc however these were not optimal option for fpc the remaining optimal option resulting from the tool are the one also used fund fpc this way can concluded that chose the most optimal financing option which the tool suggested notable aspect this case that the percentage asset that fpc bank utilized calculate the collateral capacity were low for all asset fpc bank chose the minimum percentage which can chosen the tool percentage stated table section the low percentage chosen for the asset property can explained past capitalized renovation cost which can not serve collateral for the other asset unclear why the collateral percentage have been chosen this low this result suggests that the minimum and maximum percentage asset which can used collateral could possibly reevaluated again the future experienced banker conclusion case study the validation the tool done mean two completed client case all all can said that validation prof the tool basically function intended for both case the tool suggests the financing option that also used fund their client furthermore for several funding goal the tool suggests other suitable financing option which could have been used well the tool performs well giving clear suggestion about which type finance best interest the firm regarding solvency and credit rating top that the credit rating and the comparison with industry data from similar firm function projected nevertheless during the use the tool several suggestion for improvement the tool came mind make even more useful for the user these are discussed chapter due the time limit the thesis only two case were used validate the tool the future the validation can made more rigorous the tool validated using more case reflection research goal and research question looking back the research question defined section can concluded that the all three question have been answered resulting the achievement the overall goal the research analysis made the current dutch financing market for smes and the difficulty facing smes have been studied subsequently this research investigated all the traditional and new alternative financing option the market specified and assessed these and judged them the appropriateness for client range the last section the thesis describes the customized tool made for which proposes the most suitable financing option the market for certain sme financing need the tool support the new trend combine financing option form total funding solution suggestion for improvement the tool the finance decision support tool been mainly designed give funding proposal for sme with certain funding need fundamentally the tool succeeds accomplishing this goal this demonstrated the validation phase this thesis however the tool can further optimized display more relevant information make the displayed information more meaningful the user and create more accurate funding proposal suggestion for further improvement the tool are mentioned section the tool highmaintenance tool which requires regularly update the tool with future emerging financing option modified specification finance period amount financed funding goal type finance the existing financing option the tool the scoring criterion the credit rating each have each been assigned weight which contributes the total score currently the credit rating give fairly accurate idea the creditworthiness firm however the credit rating still leaf room for improvement make even more accurate although the criterion have been allocated weight expert still advised regularly reassess these weight the future one way this checking which criterion bank other financier use rate client and how important they value these criterion funding application possibly some financier develop credit score well for client the funding application process which can used finetune the tool credit rating model the tool currently automatically calculates the altman zscore for firm however the score could inform the user even more can compared with average zscores similar firm the same industry the suggestion find data zscores firm for each type industry and insert these the tool order make comparison zscores possible almost all financing option choose not finance certain industry some specific financing option such rdc and the three institutional investment fund explicitly state the industry they not finance this information currently stated the funding proposal whenever one these financing option suggested however the tool doe not filter financing option based industry they not finance suggestion for the tool further improvement first research which industry each financing option doe not fund and subsequently let the tool filter financing option based this information must noted that this can timeconsuming practice mentioned section due the time limit the thesis only two case were used validate the tool the future the validation can made more rigorous the tool validated using more case the tool can also improved order suggest optimal funding option combination the basis price and financing period this can done with the following improvement currently the cost class financing option displayed which aid the user selecting financing option and combination the basis price suggestion for further improvement the tool research the cost funding exact range for each financing option the cost each proposed financing option over expected financing period can estimated making possible for the user subsequently chose the optimal option combination mentioned section debt repayment and interest must able paid from the earning capacity ebitda the tool can further improved using the current and future statement automatically calculate what time span debt and interest can paid subsequently the tool can suggest optimal financing period for debt financing option within the range the finance option whereby the sme pay little cost possible furthermore the statement can used detect strong growth pattern turnover can then used suggest financing mean equity may decide further professionally develop this tool order make available online and therefore create solution the distribution problem alternative financing
