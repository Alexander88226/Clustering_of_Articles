development the finance gap continues major problem sme development ghana literature small business financing the extant literature clear the fact that small business mostly have problem accessing fund from finance provider finance fixed asset and working capital for their operation tucker and lean the presence and nature finance gap for small firm been debated for decade ever since the macmillan report macmillan according blanton and dorman small firm are frequently undercapitalized that the term structure loan granted smes doe not suit their need blanton and dorman argue that even when smes are given credit they are often granted shortterm loan and therefore they have option but depend shortterm and informal credit financing their longterm need such acquiring new equipment riding and short the presence the finance gap mainly result the existence information asymmetry between finance provider and borrower information asymmetry refer the disparity between the information available business seeking capital and supplier capital who are typically assumed informational disadvantage with respect insider the business stiglitz and wei bester privately held firm not publish the same quantity quality financial information that publicly held firm are required produce result information their financial condition earnings and earnings prospect may incomplete inaccurate faced with this type uncertainty lender may deny credit sometimes firm that are creditworthy but unable document coleman perfect market setting with perfect and costless information available both the small firm the agent and the finance provider the principal and uncertainty regarding present and future trading condition the principalagent relationship doe not suffer from the market failure information asymmetry however information the real world neither perfect nor costless and additionally the small business finance market characterized risk and uncertainty regarding future condition information distributed asymmetrically between the bank finance provider and the firm tucker and lean important issue identified within the context informational asymmetry are adverse selection and moral hazard under adverse selection theoretical model often assume that entrepreneur private knowledge about the success probability project expected profit that are not shared with the financier consequently supplier capital can not differentiate between highquality business and lowquality business and adverse selection can result moral hazard refers the inability the finance provider control fully how the entrepreneur fund provided owner can conceivably benefit economically for example redirecting borrowed fund invest higher risk project than those approved the lender stiglitz and wei bester bester and hellwig binks and ennew avoid this situation financier can implement contract provision that discourage borrower from acting against the interest investor lender and these precautionary action can lead credit rationing certain type moral hazard play role the costly monitoring problem but these moral hazard problem not affect the outcome the entrepreneur project instead moral hazard affect costly monitoring problem adding the risk that entrepreneur will lie about their return and profit the expense the finance provider stiglitz and wei binks and ennew the provision collateral and reputation track record can lessen the problem adverse selection and moral hazard low risk borrower who would otherwise leave the market due high interest rate can signal their status through the provision adequate collateral and good reputation with their asset stake collateral firm will motivated perform the best their ability this context lack collateral and reputation may lead firm being denied credit the extent that small firm posse collateral and reputation than large firm they may face yet greater difficulty raising capital than large firm worse still since there considerable uncertainty surrounding the survival and growth smes their assetbacked collateral are usually problem and perspective management volume issue valued carcass value ensure that the loan realistically covered case default and immediate realization binks this implies that the already disadvantaged small firm may even need proportionately more collateral than large firm also important note that the motif and objective the ownermanager can greatly influence sme ability secure external finance ownermanagers are often unwilling provide their personal asset collateral besides many smes have objective other than growth priority tucker and lean binks and ennew however argue that many small firm will forced provide yield expansion protect their limited liability status which would otherwise eroded the provision personal asset loan collateral one main motive for starting small business maintain greater control over the operation the business and internalize the benefit personal effort and risktaking this regard then understandable that many sme manager would not tolerate any dilution this control through the introduction outside equity thus the motif ownermanagers smes may constitute major constraint the range external financing source available the firm tucker and lean research methodology order ascertain the potential role government policy support other financing initiative

since most these firm have been business for over five year one would have expected that they would reasonably aware other financing scheme available the sme sector aside from bank financing the low

growth often hampered the limited access finance this paper set out investigate the awareness and use the various financing scheme quasicommercial credit available the ghanaian sme sector the result this study reveal low awareness and usage level the various financing initiative among smes most the scheme are perceived difficult access the difficulty smes often face accessing these fund include lack securable asset lack knowledge finance provider about the nature respondent business stringent eligibility criterion lack knowledge about lending criterion difficulty finding out about available finance and bureaucracy these really limit smes ability access fund from these initiative the light the key finding policy action should include better information provision regarding the various source finance this could involve the financing initiative pursuing more aggressive and continuous marketing communication campaign inform smes the various financing scheme available the sector eligibility criterion should made bit more flexible enable more smes qualify for access these fund routing these facility through the commercial bank should reconsidered evaluation applicant proposal could done qualified consultant affiliated these scheme and the bank should rather appointed manager the loan facility for fee that case government bear the credit risk this could further expedite processing and give applicant better chance accessing these facility policy maker would have place greater emphasis facilitating equity capital equity capital provides base for further borrowing reduces business sensitivity economic cycle and provides smes with access syndicate private and institutional venture capital supplier there could also policy aimed encouraging smes access public equity capital through the reduction listing requirement and subsidizing flotation cost these policy prescription could long way improve ghanaian smes access longterm financing spur growth reference
