apprehension disclose information due their desire maintain control disclosure requirement that vary according the type nance differing accounting standard and taxation strategy and the limited

economic opportunity stunt national economic growth reducing information asymmetry would have substantial multiplier effect bank would lower default worthy entrepreneur would access nance more easily and business growth would provide macroeconomic stability moro heavy dependence collateralcollateral asset that serf security against counterparty risk anderson joeveer the context asymmetric information and moral hazard collateral requirement bring the interest the borrower line with those bank godlewski weill collateral also viewed sorting device wherein lowrisk borrower are more likely take loan against collateral while highrisk borrower knowing they are more likely default are reluctant offer collateral against borrowing cowling concern have been raised several theoretical paper that highlight unfair credit allocation coco pignataro related the use collateral determinant for accessing secured loan anderson joeveer coco coco pignataro besanko thakor for example collateral requirement are inversely related interest rate lowrisk borrower are led select contract with low interest rate and high collateral requirement and highrisk borrower opt for the inverse besanko thakor result lowrisk borrower who not have suf cient collateral become creditrationed and are unable access secured loan this result inequitable distribution credit which poor goodquality entrepreneur are excluded from the market the structural inef ciency present the collateral system inhibits smes from accessing the necessary resource catalyse their growth another body work critically examines the relationship between wealth and entrepreneurial ability entrepreneurial ability are not dependent wealth but rather academic and jobrelated aspect human capital cowling thus capable entrepreneur who have inadequate asset struggle ful their potential while nancial institution lose the opportunity grow their customer base excluding viable borrower who otherwise may have even become lifelong client evident that the present dependence collateral poor crutch the absence robust alternative system this market failure particularly detrimental effect emerging economy and must tackled economic growth the caribbean accelerate woman entrepreneur face greater dif culties accessing nance than men addition the challenge described above ghosh gpfi ifc ahmad arif richardson access nance notably been

substantial barrier nance veena richardson alternatively some female entrepreneur are likely seek loan than their male counterpart bardasi unfortunately even when they are able receive loan the amount can insuf cient ghosh these institutionalised inequality the macro and household level encumber woman entrepreneur ability gain access nance mayoux this another market failure that largely impeding the pathway success for the caribbean emerging economy the regulatory framework the caribbean for private property pose major challenge for the use collateral compared most industrial country holden howell particular besides the use xed property for collateral the use moveable property collateral most case impossible similar note the legal body that can pledge collateral are also limited additionally the company act which operates across many caribbean country requires that company pledge their entire asset base one lender making costly for borrower switch lender ibid thus disincentivising bank competition such regulation represent additional obstacle the general problem associated with collateral lack credit reporting systemscredit reporting play essential role reducing information asymmetry and circumventing collateral requirement cras can public credit registry private but publicly regulated credit bureau they collect and distribute information voluntarily

constraint obtaining nance declined from after credit bureau began operation their region world bank group cient and inclusive credit reporting system instead relying exclusively pledged physical collateral would allow lender base credit decision reputational collateral the advantage people with strong borrowing history but few physical asset who would otherwise unable access loan from tib

support such system while regional cooperation could leverage economy scale the heterogeneity legal framework impedes sharing across border order establish cient credit reporting system throughout the

credit system necessary expand the network trust and facilitate greater data sharing the right type data lending institution must overcome their absolute risk aversion observing the value broader wealth data that informs borrower ability repay which turn mitigates risk therefore the blockchainbased ssi system new information sharing platform that accessible and highly secure suggested for the region this credit risk management system will able the void credit bureau the region and address the shortcoming current practice assessing narrow data point building this system blockchain give the possibility being interoperable and portable throughout the region well having the function adapt over time for other use case based our ndings the following data should considered for the new credential management system utility payment have promising potential source alternative data since the majority business owner will have history electricity phone and internet bill payment both online and physical payment can recorded and veri given the high market concentration each country where one electricity retailer telecommunication company and internet provider serve the majority the population this minimises the number stakeholder that need incentivised participate data sharing mobile and social data can provide great bene developing market with high unbanked population with credit bureau presence their use particularly feasible given the high mobile and internet penetration rate throughout the caribbean most caribbean country since there are often fewer than three mobile phone provider and some regional giant like digicel this simpli coordination and sharing data that likely already being collected psychometric testing well suited market with many underbanked credit seeker with widespread internet access such the caribbean collate such data three group stakeholder must incentivised participate the user borrower smes that hope access nance through this type

the incentive would obviously the opportunity obtaining credit line any data released pertaining the user will approved encrypted owned and controlled the user share with lender their own discretion the optin nature this arrangement mean that data provider can not share customer information without their consent user will fully knowledgeable what information being recorded shared and assessed user can overcome their transparency aversion knowing that their data highly encrypted and secured decentralised database data provider cras have traditionally been able collect data brokering mutually bene cial information sharing relationship either based reciprocity nancial gain the current keeper the proposed alternative data point can paid release the information valuable for their own operation have this new credential management system place furthermore appropriate legal and regulatory framework that allows for the release information upon request the customer trusted third party well adequate but not restricted data protection mechanism recommended lending institution lender will inevitably through trial period extending credit previously thin customer that can now provide veri alternative data once convinced the success such practice other lending institution but also from their own initial experience lender including tib are likely become active participant seeing value the alternative data helping expand customer base and reduce risk the success such innovative system will require horizontal initiative that foster environment awareness and active participation
