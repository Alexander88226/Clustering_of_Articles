herein fileinternational journal humanity and social science vol august analysis financing difficulty small and mediumsized enterprise china and corresponding countermeasure ping han undergraduate department economics university michigan ann arbor usa abstract this paper aim explore the cause financing difficulty chinese small and mediumsized enterprise and give out corresponding solution for handling the problem through building the theoretical analytical framework smes financing difficulty and discussing the development chinese real economy recent year and the characteristic smes china this paper will analyze the cause smes financing difficulty and put forward some possible solution mitigate the current problem key word sme lending financial development financing introduction recent year along with the development small and mediumsized enterprise smes are playing animportant role the development china and become significant part propelling economic and social development present there are over million small and mediumsized enterprise china and enterprise china are smes which have created china total economic output and tax revenue and offered more than job moreover smes represent indispensable force for achieving the technological innovation and adjusting industrial structure china accelerating the development smes been widely recognized chinese society consequentially people begin pay more attention financing difficulty which restrict the development smes order resolve the problem the chinese government and some financial institution have made great effort reducing the pressure faced smes however the problem and hurdle still exist getting fund from bank the first choice for many smes the survey conducted shusong smes have chosen rely loan borrowed from bank very few smes chose other financing channel including borrowing from their friend and usurious loan lacking appropriate financing channel one the hurdle addition chinese bank are short incentive help smes because the smes financing scale are not large enough the financing difficulty smes worldwide issue the adverse selection problem and moral hazard caused asymmetric information usually happen formal financial institution because smes can not provide complete financial information and effective mortgage and the survey conducted shusong there are about smes had problem getting loan from bank due the absence effective mortgage moreover during the process economic and political reform chinese smes are restricted several factor including the government intervention weak legal system and the incompleteness financial system facing the difficulty receiving formal financing smes have pay attention the informal financial market however not only increased smes financial cost which will have negative effect the development smes but also will raise the potential risk the whole financial system therefore this paper significant meaning exploring the cause financing difficulty chinese smes literature review and theoretical analytical framework the major obstacle the effective operation credit market that there exists asymmetric information between lender and borrower asymmetric information will lead adverse selection and moral hazard problem thus with the increase credit risk and the failure interest rate tool credit rationing phenomenon take place because financial institution aim increase profitability and reduce risk stiglitz and wei compared with large firm smes lack valuable mortgage and have asymmetric information problem therefore smes are relatively easily controlled bank and their credit rationing policy center for promoting idea usa wwwijhssnetcom the development financial sector could help improve financial system allocation efficiency decrease the level information asymmetry between lender and borrower help investor evaluate project and finally facilitate smes financing cetorelli and strahan analyzed the effect brought the local banking market structure the development real economy they found that highlevel competition market structure will lead rapid growth smes beck proved that the development financial sector play significant role promoting the development smes the research show that though smes utilize external financing the development financial and political system would alleviate the influence the development smes and help smes get external financing much easier the country with highlevel financial development smes have relatively more access credit fund and thereby enhancing proportion the total economy the effect still significant even asymmetric information industrial concentration and development opportunity are controlled based the analysis above clear that the scale enterprise and financial development are two main factor about financing difficulty smes establishing model will helpful reveal the inherent logic financing difficulty for the chinese smes the credit market suppose that there are several capital supplier and capital demander the credit market order project with expected profit funddemanders would need receive dollar from fundsuppliers start operating the project and the interest rate the loan which smaller than when the bank refuse provide demander with fund the expected profit both side are zero when bank choose offer fund enterprise bank and enterprise will form principalagent relationship however since there are asymmetric information problem the principalagent relationship the moral hazard issue will more likely tohappen enterprise other word the owner will deliberately evade returning their debt when enterprise return money bank enterprise will have expected profit while the expected profit bank are however when enterprise are unable return the loan time enterprise will have expected profit while the expected profit bank are hence have the payoff matrix below table the payoff matrix for bank choice and enterprise choice enterprise enterprise return default bank bank offer loan refuse based the analysis above bank should pay special attention the credit factor enterprise before offering and then the loan suppose that the probability returning loan described the function fprobability dodging bank will only choose offer loan their expected profit are greater than equal zero that which can also seen asp otherwise bank will not provide enterprise with fund know that compared with smes large firm are from the definition and property the function able get enough fund from financial institution because they have larger probability returning loan along with the development financial system the level asymmetric information between smes and financial institution will lowered and the probability returning loan will increase lot hence the financing difficulty will relieved the independent variable represents the type enterprise will equal the enterprise large and equal sme compared with the large enterprise smes are harder offer valid mortgage complete information hence the probability for large enterprise return loan time higher thatis the independent variable represents the level financial development since the financial system the ability sharing risk and the function information searching then could solve asymmetric information problem for debtor and lender along with the development financial system the probability for returning loan will higher and higher and tend approach that cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid pfpf international journal humanity and social science vol august ffthe information and supervising analysis the cause current smes financing difficultiesin china smes own problem firstly the scale smes limit their borrowing capacity the financial market generally the production scale and owning capital smes are relatively small thus smes can not get enough fund due lacking effective mortgage addition most smes are still influenced the traditional familyown management mode some smes are short necessary financial management information openness and highlevel credit which cause bank have huge cost supervising smes besides during the process expanding smes often face problem such lacking management experience and uncertainty technology and market therefore smes usually have characteristic high birth rate and high mortality and the loan offered bank will face high risk comparatively large enterprise have obvious advantage several aspect including financial information credit rating and accessible mortgage hence bank will have relatively low cost forsearching the fundreceivers theoretical analysisabove large firm probability returning loan obviously greater than the probability smes other word bank will face relatively low risk they choose provide large firm with fund order lower the risk offering fund bank will choose reduce the amount fund smes request the risk raised from asymmetric information due the existence asymmetric information adverse selection will appear the financial market once the adverse selection appears order eliminate negative effect bank will refuse determine interest rate according the level risk rather bank will establish lending condition according the information they have for enterprise clear that under the formal financial system arrangement the relationship between bank and enterprise change into the situation that bank will prefer provide large firm with fund and refuse offer loan smes quitting from the smes credit market becomes rational choice for bank because this way bank are able avoid risk and achieve profit maximization the situation china financial development moral hazard and adverse selection caused asymmetric information are considered the primary cause chinese smes financing difficulty lin and and financial development could improve the efficiency financial system reduce significantly the level asymmetric information that exists between bank and smes help financial institution process credit evaluation and identify potential investment opportunity from the definition function above clear that cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid cid however the laggard financial large enterprise based development cause the probability returning loan become lower and lower while the risk providing enterprise with capital becomes larger and larger hence the credit constraint phenomenon obvious the smes credit market the reform chinese financial institution still the characteristic financial restraint confined strengthen internal management and pay attention the institutional transformation nowadays chinese financial reform mainly focus the extension such establishing new branch introducing new financial instrument and opening new market however facing with more serious problem that may impact the existing institutional framework and financial order such the admittance and development small and mediumsized private financial institution the government unhelpful and avoids giving out specific plan this area although there are some new financial arrangement already released there are meaningful and substantial change happened the content these arrangement present the monopoly situation among stateowned bank still exists the control interest rate and the business pattern financial institution have not changed radically first all the four major stateowned bank have comparative advantage the share percentage deposit and lending market small and mediumsized commercial bank which can provide smes with financial service only make small portion and still difficult for these bank make difference the deposit and lending market see table the financial system which dominated major stateowned bank the responsibility managing the national macroeconomy the ownership discrimination and credit preference problem still exist and bank have preference providing large enterprise and project with financial aid meanwhile due the inherent shortage smes lack viable financial channel even though they have plenty investment opportunity center for promoting idea usa wwwijhssnetcom according statistic the loan borrowed chinese smes only account for financial institution loan scale present and the financing difficulty smes not yet been alleviated table the financial condition stateowned bank unit billion rmb year total capital proportion year total capital proportion source original data from almanac china finance and banking and china banking regulatory commission secondly chinese government controlled the setting loan interest rate bottom limit and deposit interest rate cap limitfor long time which can maintain necessary loantodeposit spread help limit price malignant competition among bank give reasonable protection bank profit and leave more time improve financial industry competitiveness and the efficiency overall economy and finance however due the control interest rate bank make considerable profit because the large interest rate spread between loan interest rate and deposit interest rate hence bank will satisfied with their situation and pay attention improve their own competitiveness due the existence large interest rate spread although china economic growth slow and smes faced credit squeeze the net profit chinese banking industry were trillion rmb which increased billion than last year the growth rate reach the average profit per daywere billion rmb furthermore statistic show that the interest rate spread the most important source profit for the banking industry profit commercial bank came from interest revenue and net interest rate spreadswas which increased bank are more willing support large firm and construction project that make significant contribution the economic growth china the last period however bank are hesitant help smes which will become large part force that make contribution the chinese economic growth the next period addition regional small and mediumsized financial institution which should devote the development smes also begin have preference serve large firm rather than smes because with the attraction large interest rate spread between loan interest rate and deposit interest rate these small and mediumsized financial institution not want spend time and money searching the internal information smes and smes have turn informal financing because they can not get enough fund from formal financial institution however the lending rate informal financing over and some private financing even high usurious loan suddenly become popular certain area smes face with more serious situation financing many smes owner can not afford such expensive operating cost and they run away with borrowed fund although the chinese government already canceled the loan interest rate bottom limit july only helpful for large stateowned enterprise bargain with commercial bank there will not any substantial positive influence smes financing short run overall the competition among bank not enough and credit market dominated bank the relationship among financial institution perfect competition then enterprise will have more choice choosing financial institution get capital for the current financial institution china the competition among financial institution imperfect under the absence effective competition bank can ignore the need smes and maintain the monopoly situation and financing difficulty smes still exist meanwhile credit rationing lead difficult situation for smes financing facing with the financial requirement from smes bank are reluctant raise interest rate they would rather reduce the amount offered loan and this way part financing demander quit from the lending market the government attache great importance improve financial intermediary and pay attention financial market and the government prudent develop capital market hence the multilevel capital market can not established the direct consequence this type industrial structure that chinese financial service function and risk management function are both weak meanwhile social financing structure becomes single and relies more bank loan consequently enterprise have raise fund mainly indirect financing channel international journal humanity and social science vol august the development capital market series argument which are related the topic give service stateowned enterprise all kind enterprise have profound impact the direction relevant policy and the formation relevant law and regulation present chinese capital market still unenlightened financial transaction simple and hard satisfy need different scale enterprise additionally pretty hard for smes get the right issuing public stock and enterprise bond though china experience western developed country for reference and established smes board market that provide smes with financial service especially for smes financing the market listing requirement are too rigorous for smes enter the market hence for most smes they are unable enter the market because they can not meet the requirement for operation scale information transparency and operating capability from the enterprise bond market can see that smes are hard get opportunity issue enterprise bond because issuing enterprise bond strictly controlled the government lacking multilevel capital market cause smes rely indirect financing channel such bank loan the problem the financial system external environment for long time china economic marketization reform mainly controlled the chinese government after implementing the tax reform the local government ability controlling resource show increasing trend local government official not only pay attention the increase fiscal revenue but also focus the gdp growth get promotion zhou order get enough fiscal revenue and get advantage political promotion government official only care about the shortterm economic growth during their tenure hence large enterprise and project become preference the local government the local government often chooses offer land mortgage and provide enterprise with implicit guarantee control the allocation financial resource and support their preference which make smes face more difficult financing situation besides the local government will put large number resource economic construction field under the drive fiscal revenue and performance examination but put fewer resource credit construction and legal environment which help maintain healthy environment for economic development therefore doubt that smes face difficult situation financing countermeasure and suggestion the government should regard helping smes and employment the main objective instead caring about the gdp growth only moreover the government ought establish better financial environment for smes financing smes credit guaranty system and policybased financial institution support smes development many developed country have successful experience solving smes financing difficulty which worth for our reference for example there small business administration called sba the united state sba provides smes with financial support through various method such direct loan coordinate loan and loan guarantee germany there kfw bankengruppe which the biggest government financial institution that provides smes with loan germany britain the government small business security plan help those smes that have potential ability but can not get enough loan france established credit guarantee group which similar with mutual fund chinese government should promote the development guarantee industry according shusong due the absence efficient precautionary measure credit risk and antirisk system immoral behavior many credit guarantee corporation face unstable environment and thus have restriction the development clear that the market failure could remedied the government establishes guarantee institution china should continue deepening marketization reform commercial bank and establish various financial institution coexisting commercial banking system promote competition and improve operation efficiency financial institution first all the government should formulate relevant policy encourage commercial bank help smes and set new financial institution that aim help smes financing only for example according the law the united state the local commercial bank must put least the total financing amount help smes meanwhile there are many small and mediumsized financial institution that are controlled the government serve smes financing such bank and nationalbank agin germany and bdpme france secondly the government should set standard for informal financing soon possible remove obstacle that prevent private capital from involving setting financial institution center for promoting idea usa wwwijhssnetcom addition the government should develop private commercial bank which have flexible operation strong adaptability low transaction cost and informational advantage this way china can realize the diversification china commercial bank and institution thirdly the government should gradually improve interest rate formation mechanism which determined supplydemand relation the operation interest rate marketization will help correct and eliminate distortion credit fund price optimize financial resource allocation efficiency and force stateowned bank enhance competitiveness the government should set standard and develop the multilevel financial market the current chinese security market the government need transform the financing function into capital allocation function soon possible and regard capital allocation optimization and enterprise institutional innovation stock market primary function meanwhile developing the multilevel financial market and continuing the construction growth enterprise market the government able provide smes which have high growth small scale and weak ability for resisting risk with more financing opportunity the government should prepare and improve positively regional and local security trading center allowing some normative private company with good profit trade the counter and establishing overthecounter market provide smes with plenty financing opportunity the government should strive develop corporate bond market and allow some smes which have good operating condition enter the bond market for financing venture investment also choice for smes financing the united state the most developed venture investment company which aim help those smes with innovation ability get rid financing difficulty smes should strength themselves and improve their overall quality present common that chinese smes have several universal problem such having unsound corporate financial system and inaccuracy financial report smes should build modern enterprise institution and improve the standardization the enterprise financial system and enterprise information transparency moreover smes should offer effective financial report with high authenticity help commercial bank make judgment besides smes should pay more attention the credit consciousness and set good credit image financial institution when the credit level enterprise risen financial institution will change their impression toward smes and bank will change their credit orientation hence the financing difficulty issue will handled completely there are some other issue that chinese government should consider chinese government should consider reducing the tax imposed smes according another survey conducted shusong there are more than smes owner regard the tax reduction the most helpful policy that the government should employ with tax reduction owner believe that the development their enterprise will promoted reference beck demirg kuntalaevenl leviner finance firm size and
