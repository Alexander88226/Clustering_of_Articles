research and development ijfmrd issn xxxx xxxx print issn xxxx xxxx online volume number january april issue financing sme sector there are number issue lending the sme sector which bank generally face the key issue among them are outlined below information asymmetry accurate information about the borrower critical input for decisionmaking bank the lending process where information asymmetry situation where business owner manager know more about the prospect for and risk facing their business than their lender exists lender may respond increasing lending margin level excess that which the inherent risk would require however the sheer ticket size sme lending make viable for bank invest development information system about sme borrower such situation bank may also curtail the extent lending even when smes are willing pay fair risk adjusted cost capital the implication raising interest rate andor curtailing lending that bank will not able finance many project otherwise would have been the case granularity this refers situation where the risk grading system bank doe not have the requisite capability discriminate between good and bad risk the consequence tightening credit term increase price both from the borrower perspective this lead outcome where the bank overpricing good risk and underpricing bad risk the fact that most bank india have not developed adequate expertise sme lending risk assessment exercise lead the problem granularity when come sme lending pecking order theory pecking order theory flow from the above two issue which make sme lending highly difficult for bank under this hypothesis smes which face cost lending that above the true riskadjusted cost will have incentive seek out alternative source funding evidence suggests that such situation smes prefer utilize retained earnings instead raising loan from bank moral hazard even when loan are made smes may happen that the owner these smes take higher risk than they otherwise would without lending support from the bank one reason for this situation that the owner the firm benefit fully from any additional return but doe not suffer disproportionately the firm liquidated this referred the moral hazard problem which can viewed creating situation overinvestment the moral hazard problem may thus result sme lending turning bad short period time situation that all bank would like avoid switching cost smes may find harder switch bank when countered with any issue known fact that the smaller the business the more significant the switching cost are likely and therefore likely that the benefit switching outweigh the cost involved this situation result sme lending becoming seller market which may not attractive sme borrower international journal financial management research and development ijfmrd issn xxxx xxxx print issn xxxx xxxx online volume number january april step for smooth sme lending order ensure that the above issue not stand between smes and bank finance the following step could taken remedial measure collateral existence collateral that can offered bank smes could one effective way mitigating risk bank could therefore look collateral when pursuing the question sme lending can also stated that borrower willingness accept collateralized loan contract offering lower interest relative unsecured loan will inversely related default risk however not all smes would able offer collateral bank hence reserve bank india rbi allows bank with good track record and financial position ssi unit dispense with collateral requirement for loan lakh relationship the length the relationship between bank and sme customer also important factor reducing information asymmetry established relationship help create economy scale information production relationship between sme and bank considerable duration allows the bank build good picture the sme the industry within which operates and the caliber the people running the business the closer the relationship the better are the signal received the bank regarding managerial attribute and business prospect quality information smes are required provide accurate and qualitative information the bank for them undertake reliable risk assessment accurate risk assessment obviously rely upon good information regarding the sme and prospect hence suggested that bank should make effort encourage smes improve the quality information provided customer consideration the sme market somewhat different the corporate market that corporate customer generally have wide range financing option choose from and are not dependent bank financing the case with smes the extent which smes can take necessary step with the aid public initiative easily switch another bank another factor that can influence the level competitive pressure bank the case sme lending role government and banking regulator sme lending apparent the above factor are only idealistic solution and may not practical for smes follow because they are faced with several problem such weak financial strength inability provide adequate collateral and other factor hence the government and banking supervisor should take holistic view the sme sector while considering sme financing taking into account the risk faced bank and the problem faced smes this regard the initiative taken the government and banking regulator across various country

under multiple banking arrangement covered under the revised cdr mechanism appropriate authority are currently examining the above recommendation the internal group issue sme financing the development literature focus good deal attention issue faced sme accessing finance traditionally the focus obstacle created commercial bank equity fund imperfection the broader institutional environment however sme also make decision about financing and display attitude that have important bearing financing decision therefore constraint may also appear the demand side the financing marketplace obstacle sme financing the economics literature enterprise financing identified three main obstacle that may prevent sme from obtaining adequate financing which are follows the existence marked informational asymmetry between small business and lender outside investor the intrinsic higher risk associated with small scale activity the existence sizeable transaction cost handling sme financing developing country these problem are often exacerbated institutional factor these aspect are briefly dealt with below informational asymmetry informational asymmetry are always present enterprise financing transaction entrepreneur typically posse privileged information their business that can not easily accessed can not accessed all prospective lender outside investor this lead two international journal financial management research and development ijfmrd issn xxxx xxxx print issn xxxx xxxx online volume number january april problem first the lenderinvestor may not able differentiate adequately between high quality and low quality company and project that case price variable interest rate may not work well screening device because high interest may lead excessively risky portfolio the adverse selection problem second once the lendersinvestors have supplied the funding they may not able ass whether the enterprise utilizing the fund appropriate way the moral hazard problem mitigate these problem banker and outside investor may adopt precautionary measure such requiring that financing collateralized ultimately they may simply turn down the request financing credit rationing informational asymmetry tend pose more severe problem for sme than for larger business the information that sme can realistically provide external financier the form financial account business plan feasibility study etc often lack detail and rigor this problem often aggravated the low level education small entrepreneur who may not the position adequately articulate their case this problem particularly acute developing country the information supplied banker and outside investor familyowned sme often not fully accurate and realistic and opaque behavior may prevail under these condition outside financier tend adopt very cautious attitude towards sme and either reduce the amount financing sought refuse altogether risk profile another approach ascribes the difficulty faced sme accessing finance their higher risk profile supplier external fund regard sme riskier enterprise for number reason firstly sme face more uncertain competitive environment than larger company they experience more variable rate return and higher rate failure secondly sme are comparatively equipped term both human and capital resource withstand economic adversity thirdlyss there the problem inadequate accounting system which undermines the accessibility and reliability information concerning profitability and repayment capacity developing country there the added problem more volatile operating environment which negative impact the security transaction there greater risk that lendersinvestors will not get paid that asset will not properly registered transaction cost irrespective risk profile consideration the handling sme financing expensive business the cost appraising loan application conducting due diligence exercise view possible equity investment largely independent from the size the financing under consideration for all practical purpose the following cost are fixed administrative cost legal fee and cost related the acquisition information such the purchase credit profile from specialized agency the case smaller loan investment more difficult recoup these cost similar consideration apply the cost that outside financier must incur after disbursement when conducting field inspection attending board meeting again the problem more severe developing country for the following reason iii the lack adequate management information system financial institution the undeveloped state the economic information industry and the poor state certain public service such the registration property title and collateral some extent the problem can solved raising the cost financing through higher interest rate closing fee this indeed the approach adopted many micro lending scheme but possible only certain point international journal financial management research and development ijfmrd issn xxxx xxxx print issn xxxx xxxx online volume number january april lack collateral the case debt financing lender typically request collateral order mitigate the risk associated with the moral hazard the lack collateral probably the most widely cited obstacle encountered sme accessing finance the amount collateral required relation the loan size measure frequently adapted empirically ass the severity the financing gap some case the enterprise may unable provide sufficient collateral because too new and not firmly enough established that problem closely related the higher risk some case the lender may deem the collateral insufficient view the size the loan requested other word the proposed expansion project may too large comparison with the current size the firm again this issue related the higher risk other case the collateral may insufficient simply because the managersowners tend siphon off resource from the company for personal other purpose again this closely related the risk profile and the moral hazard issue lack collateral can viewed more symptom than direct cause the difficult relation between sme and provider finance whatever the sequence cause and effect widely acknowledged that developing country the issue collateral comparatively much more severe the following section examines how the undeveloped state institutional and legal framework prevents the possibility pledging the owned asset collateral institutional and legal factor the case many developing country the above mentioned obstacle sme financing are exacerbated institutional and legal factor firstly many developing country still have highly concentrated and uncompetitive banking sector this often the result restrictive government regulation this reinforces the tendency adopt very conservative lending policy charge high interest rate bank can thrive with stable pool wellestablished client they have real incentive improve the range financial product and particular incentive down market meet the need small business the same true bank can make hefty profit simply buying government debt often the case latin american country which result the crowding out smallscale lending secondly insufficiently developed legal system effectively prevent the development certain financing instrument including the use collateral riskmitigating element for instance legal provision regarding security interest how the collateral protected how the collateral priority determined etc are crucial importance determining the efficacy collateral likewise company law offer only limited protection minority shareholder the development venture capital and angel financing inevitably negatively affected these problem were particularly severe the beginning the transition period former socialist country when even the memory certain fundamental market institution had disappeared thirdly even when adequate legislation available there are often problem with enforcement today transitional and developing economy often have cadastre and register movable asset nevertheless their functioning often than ideal record are frequently missing misplaced there are lengthy procedure for filing mortgage and pledge and for ascertaining the status certain asset there are often case corruption among personnel international journal financial management research and development ijfmrd issn xxxx xxxx print issn xxxx xxxx online volume number january april fourthly the information infrastructure still largely undeveloped there lack credit bureau and other mechanism for collecting and exchanging information payment performance this inevitably exacerbates the informational asymmetry between enterprise and lender investor while some the above institutional constraint apply all enterprise clear that small business are likely suffer disproportionately from their presence the critical challenge funding flexibility well low startup and operating cost have enabled smes spring reposition and adjust themselves quickly response market and economic change moreover they easily expand contract short time smes have not only survived the impact big enterprise and the law economy scale but have carved out niche for themselves which enable them coexist with big enterprise however the most common problem for smes are the lack access market information and technology the low quality human resource and the lack access capital despite effort financial institution and publicsector body close funding gap smes continue experience difficulty obtaining risk capital these funding gap relate firm size risk knowledge and flexibility sme borrowing requirement are small and frequently not appeal financial institution more collateral may required than smes can pledge financial institution may lack expertise understanding small and medium knowledgebased business the flexibility term and condition financing that smes require may not available sme funding from capital market statement have demanded much detailed information and forecasting the increasing pressure for continuous disclosure place great pressure small management team small business market have not attracted investor the cost listing and ongoing compliance cost combined with requirement for continuing disclosure have been disincentive small growing company with limited management skill the highrisk nature these small business and the limited information they can provide not attracted support from the broking community disclosure essential for confidence public security market best business practice crucial underpin disclosure track record important when investor are comparing option the startup stage growth and the revenue are important the demand listing too soon may inhibit growth the role government government can affect the supply funding for smes can introducing rule and regulation encourage bank venture capitalist and capital market create uniquely tailored program for example directing venture capital seed firm growth sector and supporting pension fund participation venture capital fund and tax incentive impact globalization such global competition rapid change technology and the evolving market condition add the high risk funding fastgrowing small business cost are rising strategic alliance are increasing particularly crossborder alliance merger and acquisition cross border information network are becoming more sophisticated for example through development cluster international journal financial management research and development ijfmrd issn xxxx xxxx print issn xxxx xxxx online volume number january april policy recommendation the following recommendation have emerged from the finance forum discussion the issue how finance the growth smes the region promote flexible environment for the venture capital specific smes flourish tailor credit bank and other similar institution the need small firm give greater emphasis training program help bank staff understand the unique requirement smes better harmonization the financial policy framework across economy will promote cross border strategic alliance including smes and facilitate transfer experience between the regional economy conclusion without adequate bank finance smes can not acquire absorb new technology nor can they expand compete global market even strike business linkage with larger firm similarly bank can not consider the financing smes viable option unless their priority are addressed smes this regard smes should assisted largely public initiative involving participation the banking industry india however the various public initiative for promoting finance smes have not been successful envisaged because there been some overlapping regional and national initiative effort harmonize the standard and practice therefore need properly coordinated facilitate sme finance further reference financing challenge smes from the policy perspective the experience
