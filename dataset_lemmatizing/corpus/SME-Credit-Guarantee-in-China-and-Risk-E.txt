overview sme credit guarantee definition sme credit guarantee special kind intermediary service credit guarantee institutionalized assurance provided specialized agency for the community product from the development the market economy credit guarantee prof the credibility and asset combined responsibility the market economy the objective requirement various trading activity credit and social risk management distinguished from insurance guarantee institution are responsible pay back the loan after the date maturity while insurance company bear limited responsibility should with the improvement the financial market sme small and medium enterprise credit guarantee becoming more common sme credit guarantee specialized guarantee for smes get loan from financial institution mainly the government funding variety mean and measure realize and protect the creditor right ensure the payment the debt the basis the property capital the fundamental function credit guarantee institution bridge between smes and financial institution solve the financing difficulty for smes and resolve the worry from the financial institution side significance sme credit guarantee effectively solve the problem high financing cost for smes once credit guarantee system established the cost financing for smes only loan bank interest plus certain amount the fee much lower than the cost private funding thereby reducing the cost financing for smes result yibin suggested that credit guarantee influenced significantly firm ability maintain their size and increase their survival rate reduce the bank management cost and operational risk develop new business the credit guarantee agency can simplify the procedure lending from bank smes also the institution deal effectively with the bank solvency crisis which reduces the bank nonperforming loan and hence stimulates the bank open new credit business serve economic lever compared nonprofessional guarantee and general corporate institution credit guarantee system overcomes the shortcoming spontaneity fragmentation the credit guarantee system magnification function make credit guarantee work economic leverage the process social resource allocation which help with government regulation the development smes general the higher magnification ratio the greater contributes society balanced credit guarantee system mean that guarantee institution undertake risk systematically accordance with the specific goal smes own strength and reputation benefit the construction social credit system finance the core modern economy while credit the core the financial sector the guarantee industry extension the financial industry credit guarantee starting point the economic life the most sensitive area directly urge business individual increase credit awareness concern and attention their own credit building promote the development the credit rating agency credit rating part and parcel the social credit system financial institution and guarantee agency take full account the evaluation from the rating agency selecting customer and guarantee for financial institution and guarantee agency the rating process save the cost collecting information for smes they prove their creditability obtain qualification for rating agency although they not have responsible for the legal consequence caused the evaluation report they must bear the survival risk for their own evaluation quality therefore the potential risk propels them improve the scientific evaluation system and evaluation quality above all significant analyze the credit guarantee market thoroughly both for the smes and the entire market system the study designed solve the dilemma sme credit guarantee and provide valuable theoretical reference and suggestion for policymaking department domestic and international situation sme credit guarantee the first professional credit guarantee institution november establishedchinese economic and technological investment guarantee ltd during the short history fewer than twenty year sme credit guarantee industry rapid development the end according statistic the ministry industry and information technology the national sme credit guarantee institution reached the guarantee fund billion yuan the cumulative amount guarantee sme loan reached trillion yuan and the cumulative number guaranteed enterprise million late the total institutional national financing guarantee corporation reached increase compared the end ensure the balance total trillion yuan increase compared early the end june total national financing guarantee industry institutional representing increase from the beginning the year financing guarantee loan balance trillion yuan increase compared with the beginning the year figure quantity chinese guarantee agency sourcetresearchtintchina with the fast expansion funding and volume business credit guarantee institution still adhere smes nearly deal were among the total deal the total amount guarantee fund reached million accounting for besides the scale still accelerating expansion what should aware the risk the boom disorderly growth according the survey the end the small and mediumsized enterprise the industrial and commercial bank china for credit rating credit rating more accounted for only the bbb and below accounted for over the same period small and medium enterprise obtain credit from stateowned commercial bank account for only than only the incremental credit credit transaction paradox objective interpretation the source financing difficulty smes show that the same time the credit market urgently need professional intermediary build the bridge between smes and bank credit another problem arose there were few credit rating assessment for smes china and consequently bank had little information about the sme credit record the other hand smes not have incentive establish their own credit reputation one evaluates their credit situation and whether they honor loan contract did not make much difference their future borrowing this caused poor quality the loan smes and made bank reluctant extend loan smes get rid the vicious cycle due low credit rating lack credit report smes china established nationwide credit assessment system for smes april this system designed collect ass and report the credit situation with the international situation levitsky jacob provided information variety credit guarantee scheme developed and developing country together with other reference sme study the following characteristic relatively developed scheme are noted standard management many developed country not only established strict access system but also formulated specialized legal safeguard and norm regulate agency for example american sme law and sme investment law have clearly defined the guaranteed object purpose amount the guarantee and the premium standard japan sme credit guarantee association act explicitly stipulated the function and role the guarantee association well the rule for the guarantee process canada sme financing bill build sme policyoriented guarantee system contrast china guarantee market lack regulation specification the object supported sme guarantee institution and policy objective they stipulate criterion the size and quality the guaranteed smes the supported enterprise comply with national local industrial policy which are generally focused smes that earn foreign exchange through export expand employment besides given the different stage development and management system the smes different nation provide some special support the usa for example there are smes guarantee institution especially for woman the disabled veteran minority and poor area contrast the standard the smes guaranteed and policy china are vague institution regular support and supervision policyoriented government have formulated series preferential policy support the guarantee institution such tax policy macromanagement and regular monitoring and inspection guarantee institution for smes the smes guarantee different structure guarantee system according domestic condition for instance the united state implement onelevel guarantee system setting local branch while japan sublevel guarantee system adopted with guarantee from the public treasury the central credit insurance and local credit association the public treasury provides reguarantee for the local credit association the ratio cooperation between guarantee institution and bank other country the bank share the risk with guarantee agency based the size and duration the loan generally the amount the guarantee the sme credit guarantee institution more than the loan the japan association more than economically developed country there more developed financial system establish longterm stable relationship with bank there are number specialized regional financial institution provide financing for smes which are actively involved the sme credit guarantee scheme literature review credit guarantee industry internationally recognized highrisk industry addition risk stem from the feature the guarantee itself but also closely relates guaranteed object and external condition china many scholar analyzed the major impediment for smes access finance and provided some suggestion how make china cgs credit guarantee scheme sustainable for example yibin analyzed examined the evolution category legal basis operating characteristic and key concern cgs china the author argued that the lack collateral credit information and economy scale sme loan coupled with high political risk associated with sme loan are the four major impediment for china sme finance xiong used comparative analysis and empirical analysis from the microlevel analysisthe system commercial bank credit middlelevel analysisthe game under asymmetric information between bank and enterprise macrolevel analysisinstitutional arrangement and sme credit demand dilemma levitsky jacob and ranga prasad provided information variety credit guarantee scheme developed and developing country their study enabled understand the essential element scope and variety such scheme and the problem they face their operation the paper organized follows stressing the issue both the micro and macro level section the paper provides macrolevel analysis term two major impediment government invention lack proper supervision and interest rate control from the micro perspective section the paper investigates the credit need financing environment the sme own weakness and credit guarantee system defect further with aim provide solution the problem concerning the credit pricing section provides pricing method based var model the paper considers two stage credit guarantee and extends the model into multistage besides the paper discus the credit rating system extracting credit factor and introducing model finally the paper provides suggestion conducive sme credit financing system design macrolevel analysis sme credit guarantee the structural deficiency and functional defect sme credit guarantee epitomized the macro level yibin argued that cgs credit guarantee scheme china have become important tool for local government ensure credit smes however government intervention lack proper supervision and regulation well interest rate control may impede the development cgs government intervention according inha the belief that capital market not provide adequate fund for new business one the rationale for government loan assistance program smes the past china lmes can directly use the national credit bank loan endogenous financing with the establishment and development the market economy system this error been corrected linking the credit lmes financing asset however the other extreme putting too much government credit smes could result the burden government finance amplification government risk the weakening the market function risk management know the market itself superior management and risk diversification but when the government excessively undertakes the risk that could originally managed and decentralized the market will inevitably weaken the market function china multiplication time for the credit guarantee far away from the international standard time meanwhile too much government guarantee will induce speculative behavior smes increasing the risk moral hazard and smes dependence government due the large quantity smes and the extensive aspect covered demand for loan smes been personalized macrocontroller and social manager the market economy system the government regulates the market and make the market rule but hard for the government offer sufficient financial resource dominate the guarantee system for smes all all the dominant role government guarantee institution the whole system negatively affect the function and efficiency the credit guarantee system lack proper supervision and interest rate control some credit guarantee scheme cgs may cause the moral hazard issue they weaken the will and commitment the borrower repay the loan when they know that guarantee fund will reimburse the lending institution there also danger moral hazard the part the lending bank which incentive supervise the loan properly pursue vigorously the collection repayment proper supervision benefit the smes reducing unnecessary transaction cost currently the commercial bank are allowed charge maximum mark over base rate which insufficient encourage the bank lend smes and reward for the transaction cost and the credit risk domestically most guarantee institution charge half the bank interest rate becomes comparative advantage for guarantee institution attract sme however this may introduce the problem overlending the institution fails recognize the credit risk optimize the interest rate spread the form line with the credit risk but should commensurate with the risk for company that are faced with the situation credit allocation interest payment make smes get access external fund more easily microlevel analysis sme credit guarantee some extent guarantee fee can considered kind risk compensation for credit guarantee institution especially for smes smaller business enterprise both industrialized and developing country have difficulty obtaining financial assistance from bank and financial institution the reason are concluded follows the uncertainty facing the small industry the high mortality rate such enterprise and their vulnerability market and economic change make bank reluctant deal with them and there parallel reluctance the part smes borrow from bank bank and financial institution are biased favor lending large corporate borrower there are link between bank and corporate borrower that take the form joint directorship joint ownership and various other joint financial dealing the administrative cost lending small enterprise are high and cut deep into the profitability such loan smes seeking loan are unable unwilling provide accounting record and other documentation required bank provide security collateral for the loan attempt overcome some these problem particularly the perceived high risk lending small enterprise and their inability provide collateral credit guarantee scheme cgs have been introduced except for these reason stem from the nature smes operational defect and standard credit pricing the institution side are worth noting sme credit guarantee system operating defect are mainly concluded four way lack financial compensation and risk diversification mechanism the main income source for guarantee institution come from local government fund the guarantee fee supplement resource governmental guarantee institution run not for profit intention and hence they are more competitive charging low for smes most commercial guarantee institution regard guarantee fee source financial compensation part the guarantee institution charge half the rate bank loan the same period for most the international country the guarantee fee around france and only taiwan and hong kong special administrative region sar china due the lack clear specification responsibility with the side guarantee agency the guarantee institution are weak position negotiation with bank the consequence that they should take more risk sme loan some even forced undertake the full credit risk international guarantee agency generally bear only the loan obligation the united state france germany and japan guarantee institution are also lack risk diversification mechanism the majority agency especially institution seek counterguarantee contract diversify risk charge more the guarantee fee transfer the risk the commercial guarantee information asymmetry information asymmetry between smes guarantee institution and bank considered another defect busetta giovanni and alberto zazzaro argued about the adverse selection during the guarantee process xiong theoretically and empirically justified that the credit market incentive and restraint mechanism asymmetry important cause formation sme credit financing difficulty low rating lack specific credit reporting system for smes impedes financing for smes also there are few credit rating assessment for smes china and consequently bank have little information about sme credit record take the example guarantee company jiujiang developing district cooperated bank would double check the guaranteed smes ensure their credibility another word both the guarantee agency and the bank inspect the smes management investigate their financial statement and analyze their prospect etc however guarantee institution for smes china almost bear the loan risk many cooperate bank couldnt get full from smes guarantee institution according the survey the end among the smes guaranteed credit rating only accounted for the bbb and below accounted for the credit rating provided the industrial and commercial bank china the credit transaction paradox objectively explained the source financing difficulty smes which also implied the urgent need for professional intermediary build the bridge between smes and bank credit the credit market lack collateral variety smes lack eligible collateral for loan bank have the duty protect depositor fund and are naturally risk adverse china the main category the collateral are property owned the borrowed whoever else pledge the right the use stateowned land equipment transportation vehicle which are the disposal the borrower stateowned etc other country however their guarantee variety includes business loan bill discounting scientific and technological development loan equipment loan and technological innovation loan variety collateral facilitate the process for smes get adequate loan lack professional some official local governmentfinanced guarantee institution are not familiar with the guarantee business but achieve capital preservation gain profit guarantee institution need expert manage and implement the marketoriented operation meanwhile there still guarantee qualification system and penalizing mechanism which lead the lack ability and quality supporting system pricing and credit rating from the above analysis make sense evaluate the risk credit guarantee the supporting system pricing and credit rating naturally become indispensable guarantee agency charge too low they will assume excessive risk compensating for the agency while high fee will resist large number enterprise guaranteed therefore the reasonable price the guarantee the basis the existence and development the guarantee industry the creditrelated investment guarantee security consultant fund institution operate through the credit rating the company and the rating result directly affect the market requirement guaranteed while china still the elementary period pricing credit guarantee comparison different pricing model domestic credit guarantee industry still startup phase there are few study about the pricing credit guarantee mei qiang tan zhongming analyzed compensatory rate and recovery rate under the case different guarantee rate and margin rate assumed that the margin rate compensatory rate recovery rate and interest rate can used determine the guarantee rate but the method can only determine the interval guarantee rate rather than the exact rate recent year have witnessed unprecedented surge the usage risk management practice the main pricing method credit guarantee are the option pricing model based experience var value risk blackscholes model scholar considered guarantee the put option and hence relative pricing model could utilized however the blacksholes model relies two main point firstly the price underlying asset obeys logarithmic normal distribution secondly continuous adjustment for asset infinite short period case riskfree arbitrage for the guarantee institution aiming serve smes the asset income one period can much higher than another period due the growth enterprise also impossible adjust copy asset continuously therefore the blacksholes can not fit any more experiencebased pricing domestic credit guarantee industry pricing based primarily the guidance establish sme credit guarantee system generally charging sme credit guarantee institution guarantee fee should controlled within the interest rate bank loan over the same period according the national guarantee institution charging standard survey guarantee rate typically national average about the pricing based the experience judgment multiply the total guarantee amount certain percentage and then make adjustment the base price this method practical some sense but only set the price without any explanation why just lacking convincing reason with the development the guarantee industry and fierce competition the market this method limited because arbitrariness and high cost negotiation varbased pricing dennis weatherstone clearly stated the basic question how much can lose our trading portfolio tomorrow close var describes the loss that can occur over given period given confidence level due exposure market risk dietsch petey computed the probability density function future loss and var measure portfolio french smes and proposed specific solution dealing with the most important peculiarity these portfolio while china xiaohong chen pioneer var pricing model credit guarantee which provided the absolute var method later twostage model the relative var method approved more accurate compared with absolute var pricing model the comparative var method also take into account the deferred liability risk the risk during the guarantee period the deviation from the average yield rate the asset which similar consider the budget the time value the asset the average yield rate positive value the method would more accurate and closer the reality mathematical introduction var model list the basic definition and assumption follows referred stationarity related assumption the random walk assumption intertemporal unpredictability equivalently this can represented the assumption zero expected rate nonnegativity this stipulates that financial asset with limited liability can not attain negative value risk limit assume that guarantee institution constrained maintain the var horizon wealth prespecified level prob cvar athe formula where the variance value asset given period that roa return asset illustrates that the probability that the loss exceeds var the prob level the maximum loss asset var suppose the initial value asset the expected return rate the volatility rate and the minimum return rate under the significance level then can get the probability density function the return the asset typically suppose that deviation rate and distribution can expressed obeys normal distribution then then the under the assumption normal distribution and significance level suppose the initial net guaranteed loan other debt total every deviation rate corresponds return rate rasset the guaranteed enterprise value the discount rate liquidation liqudation value have book value var the future return iid then var different time period related each other and satisfying the relationship tvartvar twostage varbased pricing model the existing absolute var method only considered the original debt risk this section present twostage pricing model credit guarantee which considers both the original debt risk and the extended debt risk referred when the enterprise debt fails pay back debt the financial institution the guarantee institution should pay for the guaranteed enterprise after that the institution can get the recovery right ask the enterprise for bankruptcy liquidation extend the period pay back therefore for the institution under the condition ask for bankruptcy liquidation the risk for the guarantee only the risk bank loan default the original debt under the situation extend the payback period the risk will also include deferred liability risk and suppose are respectively the contract date the due date the are respectively the are the promised payback amount when compensatory occurs the guarantee institution get corporate debt right original maturity and the evolving maturity the debt value the enterprise value and under the significance level the potential loss guarantee institution lossx xxwe can calculate the minimum net asset the enterprise var net asset yield enterprise the maximum loss where the guarantee institution larx the potential loss guarantee institution xif the minimum net asset the enterprise loss the enterprise still can not pay back the debt will announce liquidation and value remains the same and calculate the total debt the assume that after the interest rate then the maximum loss the guarantee enterprise institution larc suppose that the probability default the first year lar larthe expected maximum then loss zcp the second year institution

empirically this method adopted and tested close the current guarantee rate china multistage varbased pricing model china with the growth and maturity the industry the compensatory fee becomes the recurrent expenditure gradually consequently make sense consider deferred liability risk the multistage situation time suppose the guarantee institution could responsible for guarantee period the potential loss guarantee institution lossiix siif sii xxii the minimum net asset the enterprise the enterprise still can not pay back the debt will announce liquidation and value then the maximum loss

guarantee periodm the intuition similar longterm loan portfolio the time period could regarded kind risk the above model provides standard approach for the risk valuation credit guarantee the extension multistage pricing reflects more flexible credit guarantee market however the twostage model enough sufficient for the current credit guarantee market which barely provides guarantee for sme for more than two period the accuracy the multistage need further investigation credit rating actuality credit rating system directly affect the length the period the guarantee loan one the reason that the guarantee institution hesitate provide longterm guarantee that they lack credible record the sme most other country provide longterm guarantee bank loan smes generally more than year the longest warranty period year contrast china most guarantee loan are within the period six month one year the guarantee institution are unwilling provide guarantee sometimes especially the enterprise default the first time which will turn down some potentially successful enterprise building rational credit rating system will helpful the one hand rating assessment according historical record provides guarantee institution reliable reference towards financing for the enterprise the other hand sme borrower will fear being denied further loan they fail repay and hence try their best enhance their performance the following diagram concludes the credit factor externaltfactorinternaltfactorcredittfactoreconomictsituationt tfinancialtfactorcoveragetinsurancemanagementtfactorcredittperformance charactercapacitycapitalcalleteralfigure illustration credit factor all these factor decide the assessment the guaranteed sme historical credit data are recorded evaluate the sme which related the level credit risk this section will introduce simple credit rating system where historical credit data are used select variable and weighting scheme michel dietsch built two alternative model the ordered probit model and model which assumes gamma distribution the systematic factor firstly classify sme credit guarantee their credit quality the credit evaluation obtained internal risk rating system the bank ass the probability that the borrower will move the default class over given planning horizon secondly measure the likely exposure each loan and calculate the proportion the exposure that would lost the borrower default capture the behavior the portfolio whole necessary measure the correlation between loss assume that exposure and default are independent concern the correlation between default measuring the volatility probability default each risk class around longrun stationary value finally according the credit record each sme the guarantee institution the bank should adjust their plan towards providing financing for the enterprise this section provides outline the first model with the assumption normal distribution the risk factor and correlation between default each enterprise default not determined systematic risk factor and idiosyncratic risk factor define unobserved latent random variable linear function the two factor where and stand for systematic risk factor and idiosyncratic risk the standard normal cdf the unconditional factor respectively suppose for borrower belonging given risk class therefore borrower make default when exbb then can compute the individual asp pnx bfthe typical process and case analysis are discussed detail michel dietsch worth stressing the method measure the volatility and correlation between loss for couple corporation comparative approach could used chi guotai yong cao and libin zhou shed light upon the calculation the correlation coefficient matrix utilizing the default distance and gaussian copula function let the standardized latent variable loaner for two enterprise and with the same rating grade the covariance given cov zij jbb the aggregate shock result the correlation and the shape the value distribution skewed the right which directly determined the weight the systematic risk factor conclusion and policy suggestion from the macro point view the government financial guarantee institution dominate the sme credit guarantee system china which cause the low proportion private capital guarantee institution additionally lack proper supervision and interest rate control handicap the development the system the existing operating system defect also limit the demand the credit guarantee market exacerbate moral hazard and adverse selection and hence affect the performance the sme guarantee system and sustainable development the proposed pricing model based var and the corresponding credit rating system section conducive establish standard method charge smes for credit guarantee particularly with the development credit guarantee system and increasing demand for credit guarantee from sme the extended multistage model would applicable accurately reflect the value the credit guarantee the paper proposed several policy follows institution management reasonable incentive and clear definition the relationship between the guarantee agency the government bank and enterprise this includes element such the ratio government funding for guarantee agency guarantee agency management operating mode the reasonable sharing risk between the lending bank and credit guarantee institution the proportion credit guarantee magnification and guaranteed rate good collaboration between guarantee institution and bank one the prerequisite for the successful operation the guarantee system this suggestion reduce the moral hazard and adverse selection mainly due information asymmetry and distrust bank need opportunity learn
