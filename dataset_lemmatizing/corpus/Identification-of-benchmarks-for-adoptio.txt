say that there are numerous challenge involved related cold storage facility like ownership smes huge investment institutional issue high energy cost and temperature variability adding the corrosion the fresh produce due insufficient cold chain facility logistical infrastructure and postharvest handling activity indian cold chain industry still developing stage still there are opportunity develop the cold chain sector india the paper will explore the future cold chain tell about the current scenario cold chain india that that current perspective should kept mind while designing future cold chain improvement can done methodology have conducted survey based questionnaire this because survey based questionnaire our case address the specific research issue related cold storage facility this research have selected primary data because the opinion the question posed the survey are filled the msmes cold chain sector had addressed the specific research issue which msmes are facing specific their own situation also can rely the data been directly collected from the msmes involved cold chain sector the data collection done through primary and secondary resource the primary data the data which collected through interview and questionnaire etc the secondary data the existing data which collected some other researcher questionnaire include both openended aswellas closedended question while the openended question provided general information the closedended question shall restrict the answer the requirement this research ranjit kumar all data shall collected during the month october according saunders lewis thorn hill convenience sampling been used one the method for collection data this done because limited number smes into cold storage and limited time list identified smes cold storage obtained data from accord fintech convenience sampling also known availability sampling specific type nonprobability sampling method that relies data collection from population member who are conveniently available participate study convenience sampling type sampling where the first available primary data source will used for the research without additional requirement the sampling method which involves getting participant wherever can find them and typically wherever convenient convenience sampling inclusion criterion identified prior the selection subject saunders some convenience sampling are sampling are ease availability data time saving money saving and also useful pilot study these finding can serve pointer and deciding further line action also limitation data can biased some group are overrepresented and some group are underrepresented there can high possibility sampling error and result also can generalized the respondent are not representative entire population deepa karnadikar the analysis the data collected through the survey questionnaire helped knowing the wastage that happened because inadequate cold chain facility and helped identifying gap and finally suggest benchmarking parameter such renewable energy innovative technology etc for development coldchain infrastructure result and discussion india there are around cold storage facility which are unequally present across the whole country most the cold storage are used for storing potato around but today can see that the market progressively getting organized also more than cold storage are currently situated uttar pradesh and west bengal some fact about indian cold chain industry are only percent cold storage are the organized sector capacity most cold storage around have capacity below according current capacity cold storage around produce can stored fifteenth aim international conference management from the survey were able identify company smes category which are into cold storage response collected from cold storage smes and msmes which are border line smes and msmes the response came across the ownership factor each company owns cold storage possible because the subsidy factor investment ministry food processing national horticulture board etc also major question asked regarding capacity utilization cold storage majority them answered with full and after telephonic conversation with these identified smes noticed that they utilize their capacity more than full around there lack cold storage some area today government have taken various step for reduction waste that happen due lack cold storage facility for this government started encouraging private sector develop the cold chain industry implementation the latest and most efficient refrigeration equipment solution available today for the construction cold storage initial investment requirement high which the biggest challenge today now government trying solve this problem giving various subsidy scheme construction cold storage some the initiative are easy funding option establishing national center for cold chain development also many tax incentive and tax holiday are being favored cold storage company fdi through government route subsidy project cost developing economy such india more difficult operate there back support healthy infrastructure and there are limited uncertainty the logistical chain developed country logistical chain face number challenge emerging economy due uncertain environment poor infrastructure and ambiguity accessibility some basic requirement like water power etc well applied strategy and policy can not applied developing economy they have modified accordingly this also the reason why strategy fail when they are applied emerging economy the same way mcdonald can good example for cold chain efficient and developed cold chain facility the usa but after entering india took around year and set cold chain network conclusion this empirical study made attempt identify the crucial factor that are hindrance the development the cold chain sector india were watched that the absence satisfactory framework alongside high cost for establishment and operation are the greatest disadvantage for strong and efficient cold chain india logistics cost evaluated around percent compared logistics cost usa and which around percent swami nathan the main reason lack the absence required infrastructure india operating expense for cold storage twofold when contrasted with cost cold storage usa and additionally high import duty and excise duty make setting cold storage troublesome unviable and uneconomical the government need support cold chain player their initiative and provide for more encouraging environment continuing upgrade infrastructure and other facility needed development cold storage some tax incentive like tax holiday for investing cold chain infrastructure sector should given there should percent depreciation freezer cabinet and other cold chain equipment also import duty all capital equipment cold chain sector should reduced khan the research conducted for smes cold chain sector the study mainly concentrated the initial investment various government subsidy capacity cold storage and other constraint involved cold storage operation only smes who are into cold chain have been taken into consideration the study throw light different problem faced the cold storage unit maintenance and farmerstraders stocking their produce the cold storage unit the study limitation data available there were only smes who were into cold storage also the owner the cold storage were generally suspicious the motif any investigation because fear taxation the research had face some drawback getting
