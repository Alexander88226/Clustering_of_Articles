characteristic indonesia sme play major role economic and social development country world both developing and developed country explained earlier smes indonesia representing one model sme developing country according tambunan smes indonesia have historically been the main player domestic economic activity and engine for economic development although the growth the indonesian economy been slowing since due the result the global financial crisis the growth smes indonesia remain increased from time time appears that the smes operation not severely damaged from such crisis and could survive from

national economy constantly increasing the contribution the gdp indonesia according report deloitte smes contributes the total gdp the country the highest among others three developing country such thailand philippine and malaysia smes indonesia also noted have important role source employment which stand contribute the highest followed thailand philippine and malaysia figure sme contribution gdp and employment four developing country source asia sme finance monitor sme corporation malaysia department statistic malaysia indonesia ministry cooperative and smes thailand office sme promotion sme white paper apec policy support unit information group cited deloitte reflected figure from the total million smes employee the total worker the country worked primary industry while work trade sector wholesale and retail work manufacturing and sector work service sector this composition claim not been changed for long time asian development bank figure employment smes indonesia source indonesian ministry cooperative and smes cited asian development bank most the smes indonesia familyowned selfemployed microenterprises with smallscale routine operation within limited area some business especially traditional handicraft and wooden furniture industry traditional fashion industry and food industry have developed their business model toward global marketplace provided figure indonesian smes accounted for total export value trillion with annual growth however the smes export industry remains volatile affected demand from foreign country smes exporter experienced sharply negative growth and and respectively caused the global financial crisis and the slow recovery demand from trade partner such the people republic china japan and europe asian development bank figure smes export activity source indonesian ministry cooperative and smes cited asian development bank section major challenge for smes indonesia smes indonesia face numerous issue order for them grow and expand indrayani stated their research that the common problem among others lack good quality human resource high price raw material cost cash flow problem lack technical skill promote the product market insufficient government support still using traditional technology and difficulty accessing bank facility especially rural area brief the smes problem indonesia can divided into two major category the nonfinancial issue and financial issue smes nonfinancial issue figure non financing challenge smes source machmud and huda according research machmud and huda both smes with and without sufficient access finance surprisingly have similar main issue their obstacle growth more than express that the rising business cost their biggest problem growth the remaining obstacle reflected figure are similar varying only sequence between the smes with and without access finance the instability consumer demand the increasing competition and difficulty finding qualified labor due high competition market smes should able promote their product well market however smes general not have the resource explore their own market instead they depend heavily their trading partner for marketing their product either within the framework local production network and subcontracting relationship order from customer tambunan although the indonesian workforce employed smes the labor productivity still time lower than that large enterprise further context regulation complicated and costly licensing process and excessive tax compliance cost are the main challenge faced smes these cumbersome and onerous business regulation and restriction hamper sme business activity deloitte this context smes are looking for regulated business environment and are high concerned lowering business cost and improving overall their labor productivity smes financial issue term financial source reported that the majority sme investment were financed internal fund and only smes using bank loan source financing deloitte since smes indonesia are mostly microenterprises that located ruralbackward area they had little knowledge financial issue shinozaki they depend their own saving money from relative and credit from informal lender for financing their daily business operation tambunan since they relying their internal fund smes are better positioned avoid the serious shock from the financial and banking crisis than large firm however low access finance negatively affected sme survival and growth rate general shinozaki one the challenge sme financing that their financial requirement are too large for microfinance but are too small effectively served corporate banking model according survey conducted with microenterprises indonesia shinozaki more than respondent implied that the collateral guarantee requirement and the high lending rate are the biggest barrier for smes access the financing smes still considered commercial bank and financial institution risky and costly serve result smes are largely underserved when come basic financial service smes therefore require some form external financing cover financing need figure barrier financial access source shinozaki information asymmetry often quoted critical factor smes funding difficulty due high cost for transaction and information collection well immeasurable risk financial institution generally hesitate finance smes mitigate such risk and reduce the cost burden financial institution oblige smes fulfill steep collateral and guarantee requirement and apply high interest rate not surprisingly smes tend regard these measure serious supplyside barrier shinozaki further emphasized that smes comprise variety firm term sector scale and management style therefore onesizefitsall approach sme financing would useless the appropriate financing scheme differs growth stage the sme and level economic development the host country since smes are critical component economic and social stability country improving financial access for smes expected bring many benefit including enhancing production quality increasing new business opportunity stimulating investment and consumption the national level and mobilizing excess corporate saving section indonesian smes financial support scheme from government order address problem accessing the financial support indonesian government created some credit program which mainly focus loan smes which namely the small enterprise development program kikkredit investasi kecil kmkpkredit modal kerja permanen the small enterprise credit program kukkredit usaha kecil and the micro credit loan program kur kredit usaha rakyat the small enterprise development program kikkmkp this program established where government provide the loan interest subsidy for small enterprise owned the local indonesian people called pribumi including the cottage enterprise the loan mainly purpose for the investment and working capital the program managed five stateowned commercial bank the indonesian development bank bapindo bank pembangunan indonesia all regional development bank bpd bank pembangunan daerah and other private bank however due high default rate reaching more than this credit program were stopped the small enterprise credit program kuk after failure the first program kikkmkp the government initiated new credit program called kuk this program require all commercial bank indonesia allocate their loan smes for helping their investment and working capital unlike the kikkmkp program previously the kuk created assign interest market rate rather than subsidized rate however repeating experience kikkmkp program kuk also did not perform successfully the bank were having difficulty satisfy the requirement loan sme appeared that the bank tend allocate more their loan consumption rather than the business purpose the micro credit loan program kur under the presidential instruction number the government then introduce the government guaranteed loan for micro and small enterprise called kur this program established mitigate risk associated with sme finance and enhance the bankability smes that lack collateral this scheme requires project business activity the principal collateral for the loan and intended provide working capital and investment credit million the loan provider are commercial bank appointed the government and there interest subsidy this scheme based report from the coordinating ministry for economic affair cmea claimed that during the period januarydecember six indonesian bank bri bni btn bank mandiri bank syariah mandiri and bank bukopin and regional development bank bpd disbursed approximately rptrillion debtor appears that the kur program sharply boosted microenterprises access bank however some bank are still facing several constraint distributing the loan under the kur scheme for instance the first and second screening guaranteed credit for smes may not well organized due the bank expectation credit risk mitigation through the guarantee and the guarantee institution insufficient human resource for screening loan other than that the bank are often still demand additional collateral from prospective customer total loan some applicant also found out request loan for consumption purpose instead financing their business therefore general credit guarantee are considered difficult business operate profitably chapter invasion fintech section fintech evolution this present world century technology reached each and every segment people life technology integration advance the various working industry also been revolutionized and financial industry exception the technology which enable financial solution known fintech short for financial technology fintech according the global report pwc dynamic intersection the financial service and technology sector where technologyfocused startup and new market entrant innovate the product and service currently provided the traditional financial service industry recent year fintech gaining momentum all over the world considered year fintech entered the mainstream when venture capital firm making enormous number investment fintech although most people just recently heard and get into deep discussion about fintech fact fintech not new story financial industry since financial and technology have been connected one another over long time ago there are three main era fintech according the study fintech douglas janos and ross firstly started with period which characterize the fintech during year then followed the fintech which started around year until and lastly counted since the fintech fintech this period time the development digital technology for communication and processing transaction increasingly transformed finance from analogue digital industry the concrete historical example for such correlation are divided further below before century the earliest example the context mesopotamia where written record evidence for financial transaction followed double entry accounting which also another technology basis modern economy emerged from the intertwined evolution finance and trade the late middle age and the renaissance late century the first age financial globalization started until the first world war where the telegraph railroad canal and steamship underpinned financial interlinkages across border allowing rapid transmission financial information transaction and payment around the world early postwar period the innovation the codebreaking tool were developed commercially into early computer firm such international business machine ibm and the handheld financial calculator first produced texas instrument one important development financial industry occurred during this time known credit card which initiated the american fintech the beginning fintech marked the launch the first atm barclays followed the establishment nasdaq which transform the physical trading fully electronic trading security consumer area online banking firstly introduced the the bank scotland which connecting between the television set and telephone send transfer and pay billsii the end financial service had become largely digital industry based electronic transaction between financial institution financial market participant and customer around the world another important momentum fintech the application for the internet thing iot iii the emergence the internet financial industry started the beginning when well fargo used the world wide web www provide the online account checking and then followed another decade later the first direct bank without physical branch begin offer their online service ing direct hsbc direct financial etrade bank yodlee can seen from the historical event mentioned earlier financial institution have increased their usage technology their operation significantly from time time another example which evidence the urge utilizing technology financial institution fact that huge number people hired technology specialist mega bank workforce such goldmann sachs morgan stanley morgan citigroup and bank america even reported business insideriv that around worker goldmann sachs are engineer and programmer which number counted more than programmer and engineer working facebook twitter linkedin bank apparently made numerous investment technology and financial service the post crisis year short appears that the era fintech limited the usage technology innovation the licensed financial institution fintech present the transition fintech fintech happen during when new startup and established technology firm categorized nonbanking firm start deliver financial product and service directly consumer public there are different background what trigger the fintech born economic category wise developed country where country are more industrialized and have higher per caput income level the fintech driven public expectation and demand the movement technology firm into the financial industry and also political demand for more diversified banking system however developing country particularly asia fintech been driven the need development and the inefficiency the existing financial system combined with the rapid introduction and reach new technology particularly mobile communication innovation banking took center stage the fintech space across the world investor were drawn the potential fintech firm not only disruptor big bank but enabler for big bank kickstart their own innovation instead kpmg the funding fintech startup according pwc reached section product fintech the term fintech that referred and elaborated further this research limited for the fintech which innovated non traditional financial institution many financial expert predict that the explosion the number fintech company might affect some part existing traditional financial sector mainly consumer banking fund transfer and payment remains under debate whether not the fintech will disrupt most sector traditional financial service order see the potential disruptor the fintechs firstly important have understanding what kind financial service mainly offered the the fintechs based the surveyv conducted gulamhuseinwala thomas and steven discovered that there are approximately most used fintechs service currently available the industry which can categorized further into four major category set out below table fintech product saving and investment money transfer and payment borrowing insurance online foreign borrowing using health premium peertopeer marketplace platform for investment equity reward exchange overseas remittance nonbanks peertopeer platform aggregator car insurance using telematics intended lower premium crowdfunding transfer money online investment advice and investment online budgeting and financial planning online stockbroking spread betting source journal financial perspective fintech the online platformbased alternative financing activity crowdfunding crowdfunding one new model investment which potentially the most disruptive for traditional financial industry terry debra and tina according gaskell from forbes crowdfunding generated estimated billion investment for startup and that expected grow considerably crowdfunding emerging trend where entrepreneur raise capital from the community contribute completing their project there are mainly two type crowdfunding known rewardsbased crowdfunding and equitybased crowdfunding rewardsbased crowdfunding platform allow entrepreneur raise fund from the community investor exchange for their tangible product service without incurring debt sacrificing equity johnston therefore any investment rewardsbased crowdfunding project even the project turn into huge financial success the investor will not receive any the profit two the most popular rewardsbased crowdfunding site are kickstarter and indiegogo crowdability meanwhile equitybased crowdfunding the company issue equity share company stock participating investor proportional basis therefore when successful company sold another firm launch ipo the investor may receive substantial return their investment the other hand unsuccessful case the investor may stand lose part all their investment angelist one example the most established equitybased crowdfunding platform brian ppp lending platform according world economic forum since the first platform launched the lending become global market with multitude different business model and high projected future growth rate the peertopeer platform generate revenue from interest management addition the loan management however the loan management considered most attractive service and therefore generate revenue the most from this financing business model generally marketplace lending refers the practice lending money borrower without going through traditional financial intermediary such bank these marketplace have benefitted from low interest rate and low default rate during the economic recovery along with the relatively availability consumer credit their efficient cost structure and regulatory advantage allow for interest rate arbitrage while they have also improved the friction the existing lending process terry debra and tina addition terry debra and tina also point out some factor which have enabled the growth lending fintech industry among others favorable macro environment the marketplace lending model born direct result tightened regulation stemming from the financial crisis since then low interest rate environment and historically low delinquency for consumer loan have attracted inventor searching for yield therefore amassing year data supporting credit model however this environment also avoided any real stress testing the model changing demographic and consumer behavior millennials are reaching the age financial independence and are increasingly need financial service such lending millennial small business owner are already using alternative nonbank financing according bank america survey data technology and automation driving cost advantage and ease use the availability data individual loan basis and the technology platform many these lender give them the ability create robust credit model offer quick loan application and relative traditional lending approve reject application nearly instantaneously the data advantage the marketplace lender stem from three source the onlineonly data such address and current and historical browsing pattern the website real time credit monitoring through the use social platform and ten thousand loan performance data the individual loan level instead tranche individual loanlevel performance data allows the marketplace lender build credit model across much greater variety factor that can not done with tranchelevel performance data alone strong network effect and cost advantage drive attractive unit economics result the strong network effect and technologyenabled cost advantage these online lender can target smaller loan economically favorable way enabling them serve generally underbanked segment the market regulatory advantage because the majority these lender operate marketplace model and not take traditional credit risk they can operate with capital efficiency with capital requirement automatically matched asset and liability and lower regulatory overhead cost further they are not currently directly regulated the financial bureau allowing greater flexibility offering different rate different type borrower thereby creating additional efficiency the marketplace due the above reason lending industry attracted investment from various capital operator including microfinance guarantee venture capital and publicly listed company bank and even local government could provide real finance solution for some sector which underserviced the bank the unsecured lending the most common form marketplace lending date such collateral required thus reported the world economic forum small business benefit the most from this particularly the service sector mainly because often such business have rather stable cash flow but tangible collateral that bank could lend against the lending also applies innovative credit assessment model which semiautomated and leverage nontraditional data point which allows for assessing credit risk where bank have traditionally not been able especially market with limited credit bureau information however this situation also trigger potential risk accumulated industry due such deficient internal management and loophole existing law and regulation lufax there are two type lending namely consumer lending and business lending main factor which distinguish between two the funding mechanism and the financing purpose zhang consumer lending this model individual borrower acquire mostly unsecured personal loan from number other individual lender often lending small amount each through online marketplace this model alternative finance offer access comparatively lowcost consumer credit for borrower often with prime credit rating and competitive interest rate contrast bank saving lender and often the benefit combining efficiency speed and relatively lowrisk problem business lending this model relatively new alternative finance model europe but developing rapidly numbertof key market allows predominately small and mediumsized enterprise smes obtain growth and working capital directly from pool online investor both individual and institutional bypassing sometimes prolonged and uncertain banklending process for many smes the speed with which they are able obtain business loan the often more flexible and attractive term financing penalty for early repayment many platform well transparency and ease use are determining factor that make business lending viable business funding alternative some example success deal lending the ipo lendingclub and notable sme financing partnership with google alibaba and growing trend institutional lending crowdfunding and lending exist wellknown financial alternative model that could help entrepreneur small business company boost and expand the business practice some people are not really able identify the basic difference between crowdfunding model and lending platform this very important especially for entrepreneur understand which financing model fit better for the business both model are having similarity but also different implication term cash flow and profitability concern usually the brand new start business will look for crowdfunding because they not need current business cash flow profitability order raise the fund the fund raising will purely depends the idea and business model long the investor believe the fund can obtained the other hand lending investor really concern see the detailed plan business history financial statement average within the past year profitability and any information related the business however when the money been invested crowdfunding model the regular reporting might require the investor since they want keep track how the business being run meanwhile lending the investor will not get involvement long the loan repaid time lee mentioned section above the investor crowdfunding offered with share position the firm that the reason why the investor will remain involve day day business section role fintech support the growth smes developing country case study fintech industry china history financial market china before the chinese financial industry lagging behind those many other country and the financial infrastructure insufficient and commercerelated fraud commonplace addition china technical capability with regard information technology low and the key hardware and software used major banking system and ecommerce application came mostly from foreign company yongowoon donghee local internet company just launched various ecommercerelated business the end alibaba now the biggest ecommerce company china established others were buy online retailer now jindong mall dangdang online book store and eachnet online auction platform however china ecommerce had been involving only information flow and small and mediumsized enterprise smes could get hardly access the bank transaction system alibaba then started turn focus the business area small and mediumsized enterprise smes china yongowoon donghee alibaba decided start customertocustomer marketplace called taobao operated under the same business model ebay providing online marketplace payment solution and technological infrastructure match buyer and seller however unlike ebay alibaba merely ecommerce site for smes conducting business online moreover alibaba introduced online escrow payment system alipay that allowed buyer wire money from their bank account alibaba this method perceived many chinese customer reduce the settlement risk ensured that good were delivered and payment were made between seller and buyer acting like temporary bank between buyer and seller alipay key driver for taobao exponential growth since the barrier entry into china financial system have been bypassed private individual and internet finance company delivering directly the public and smes more than rmbbillion credit with total number platform the same year figure volume lending china rmb billion figure number platform china end source journal financial perspective fintech according report from accenture alibaba then entered into partnership with the industrial and commercial bank china and the china construction bank help facilitate loan domestic small business customer china given that all loan went other stateowned enterprise soes leaving little for private company and particularly smes alibaba strategy represented potentially effective way forming actor network with smes smes became interested the solution proposed alibaba because alibaba interest not different from those them alibaba launched specialized company serving the smes lending segment alibaba alibaba extended finance business through alliance with bank insurance company fund security company and forth through these alliance created multiple new agreement that have yielded huge market impact alibaba which started ecommerce company now one the biggest fintech company the world alibaba created million direct and indirect job opportunity and providing over smes with loan ranging from arner janos and ross other than alibaba actually there are some company which also focus lending small business china ppdai the first online platform china established former microsoft corp engineer ppdai primary focus lend online small business that sell through alibaba with over all loan going small business ppdai online data about the small business like seller rating user rating and social networking presence determine the credit quality their borrower jason ppdai facing increased competition from alibaba which created own sme financing arm there also renrendai which one the largest and fastest growing lending platform china similar ppdai renrendai offer loan consumer and small business well the growth the company huge they grew over and grew pbc began issuing license qualified thirdparty online payment platform conduct electronic payment after announcing the program the license covered internet payment mobile phone payment and bank card acquiring service due course tpp service shifted from singleplatform cross platform service partnership with variety player such mobile platform and prepaid card both online and offline tpp company were well qualified develop various type innovative business model and service with other industry player following the government approval total company china received payment license including for online payment and for mobile phone payment with alibaba the frontrunner during this time more and more chinese company inspired alibaba success established the investment platform and the pace fintech innovation been wildly increasing july china peertopeer lending platform counted with settlement about rmb billion transaction that single month making the country with the most platform the world the sector went from one platform more than estimated platform currently also reported the platform delivered directly the public and smes more than rmb billion credit douglas and janos growth factor china lending industry the high usage lending service china driven the rapid chinese adoption new technology which already reaching through the rural area cited emarketer china internet network information center cnnic reported that internet penetration china rural area nearly quadrupled between and also rose dramatically urban area during the same time period though the rate penetration city than tripled table internet user penetration china geographic locale population source china internet network information center cited emarketer stated shrader and eric there are more than billion mobile phone china which also become the largest global market for smartphones estimated that china biggest city smartphone penetration approaching percent and nearly half china mobile subscriber live rural area there are million internet user the total population and china population had and connection however despite enormous number population who acquire mobile technology china there are million population china who not have any bank account which represent population douglas etal the total physical bank also relatively low compare the number population china itself unlike the western country such usa and chinese unbanked population may have comparative advantage over many unbanked the world ease access and rapid adoption technology this mismatch situation between the technology readiness and the number physical bank china provides the high opportunity penetration fintech industry china china credit market also suffered from allocation inefficiency that affect smes meanwhile smes represent the economic output china douglas and janos the penetration lending platform china therefore considered one perfect solution address the issue credit facility china according white paper issued lufaxvi the platform china generate most revenue through loan management interest management and other valueadded service however the loan management charge account for the largest proportion total platform revenue over not factoring expense they incurred compensating bad debt gross margin the lending business pretty high and may even exceed some case this also why the industry attracted investment from various capital operator including microfinance guarantee venture capital and publicly listed company bank and even local government and why the number platform china gone through explosive increase recent year characteristic lending platform user china october the association chartered certified accountant acca conducting survey the china lending market which surveyed over borrower and lender user one leading platform china ppdaivii the finding are divided into four category user the individual borrower respondent the individual borrower reported lowincome range and worked private business but doe not reveal how many these respondent were employee business owner purpose the loan made the individual borrower accumulate their credit worthinessviii and only utilize the loan for working capital the individual lender respondent lender reported more highly educated than borrower having completed the universitylevel degree most lender stated that they were carrying out investment their own behalf for the reason for investing through ppdai claim they want get higher return investment compare the bank interest rate about lender make investment support the sme financing the business borrower respondent the finding showed that business borrower tend have higher income than the individual borrower and have previous experience borrowing from other financial institution but they had some trade credit lineix with for instance alifinancex the largest proportion the business borrower are small and micro business the business borrower are tertiary educated these had completed college and had universitylevel qualification their loan purpose mainly for daily shortterm cash flow and for the common reason choosing the platform for financing responded because the low threshold and simple borrower audit process most them also had formal written business plan and most had financially trained qualified person charge business finance the dual borrower and lender respondent most dual borrower and lender had their own business enterprise reported that their business had been operating for between and year most reported very low business sale revenue the main reason for borrowing similar individual borrower responded accumulated credit worthiness and followed meeting daily shortterm cash flow need they pick platform because bank loan usually strict loan qualification and shallow relationship with the bank fintech regulatory framework china for lending platform regulator face dilemma since smes are the main engine economic growth china today and seems that lender are almost the only financial institution still willing make loan smes china the current economic climate therefore the growth rate lending industry china unavoidably overwhelming however these recent year there are also numerous case illegal financing illegal fundraising and fake investment occurred through lending platform china since the existence first lending platform until reached more than platform there regulation directly govern this industry china the absence formal regulation lending industry china had the effect removing any barrier entry which allowed that platform operator lender borrower quickly enter the market and result the lending industry grown significantly china however lead increase the number fraud and default lending firm operated china the negative implication the absence regulation figure lending platform with reported problem percentage total platform source journal financial perspective fintech starting mid chinese regulator increased the consultation activity gradually consider the imposition rule for platform china which will cover regulatory capital licensing obligation well better loan origination and credit scoring mechanism avoid excessive problem platform industry china douglas and janos the china banking regulatory commission cbrc finally released the lending regulation however whether not the regulation actually effective address the issue platform essential know the problem related the platform before the issuance the regulation based report lufax risk related lending platform china are mainly among others risk related the fund management there escrow account set most platform business basically fund lender and borrower are directly credited from the account platform company which trigger higher risk fund being abused well risk selffinancing and false financing only some platform engage certain bank open the escrow account risk related credit check many platform not have specialized risk control and credit check team therefore there potential risk bad debt prevention failure the majority them still have not set standard for regularly assessing tracking and disclosing the source fund for loan repayment the part fundraiser borrower hence the investor not have direct access tool judge and track the reliability loan repayment they receive operational risk bid increase liquidity for lender matching yield with loan maturity many platform develop capital pooling impossible track capital movement information safety risk some platform particularly those missing platform bought semifinished website directly from thirdparty company developed with open source code and even outsourced website backend operation third party resulting exposure company and user information the case website access technical issue the resulting psychological impact investor may spark run the platform due information asymmetry china government introduced the nonbank provider online payment service regulation address problem occurred lending industry china december the regulation will become effective july jingui however china government previously released the first regulation july regarding the guideline the promotion the healthy development internet finance internet finance guideline which also govern the lending therein reported acca some important highlight the regulation are among others minimum registered capital requirement will imposed for internet finance company

muchneeded ground rule limit the prevalence unsound practice and illegal activity which keep happening recently the industry china regulator are more interested controlling undesired activity rather than setting legal barrier entry any violation the platform activity will likely result complete shutdown operation and possible prosecution law enforcement spencer chapter fintech for smes indonesia

business and expanding alternative payment system will increase the volume digital transaction expanding egovernment service government service delivered through online platform are more cost effective and efficient more online government service would build consumer confidence online activity and service over time section fintech industry indonesia considering financial sector undeniably important role for the country economic growth the indonesian government taking particular interest driving the fintech industry responsible manner revealed current indonesian president joko widodo during the indonesia ecommerce summit expo the government would give more attention and support stimulate the development fintech startup ecosystem indonesia moreover also predicted that the market fintech indonesia huge and will grow significantly during febriana the fintech business that referred hereinafter the fintech which business established technology firm nonbanking financial

are deemed too small commercially viable given that bank current commercial standard the indonesian commercial bank have quite wide regional reach but they not reach deeply into the poorer stratum indonesian society ifc the high unbanked population indonesia with minimum access financial service such population will require the alternative financial service fulfil their financial need moreover explained chapter about the smes financial issue indonesia the loan market have suffered from allocation credit inefficiency the smes indonesia which mostly consist microenterprises that located ruralbackward deloitte reported that only smes using bank loan source financing this misallocation capital important implication since smes contributes the total gdp indonesia while bank loan only make sme funding source the integration fintech ecosystem indonesian smes may become one the most powerful tool stimulate the sustainable economic growth the future indonesia considering the above fact fintech industry will gain traction indonesian mainly due the fact that the current financial institution indonesia have not been able solve the existing financial problem through the traditional banking solution particularly for smes that been underserviced the large bank other than that the high penetration mobile user and large unbanked population indonesia seems interest the indonesian entrepreneur they believe indonesia could potential fintech market where they could offer alternative financial service beyond traditional bank such marketplace current situation the fintech industry

which govern under the supervision the minister communication and information menteri komunikasi dan informasi kominfo and financial service which govern the financial service agency otoritas jasa keuangan ojk therefore fintech business doe not clearly fall under purview any single authority and thus need new regulation that work out between those two authority both kominfo and ojk are still working draft regulation for fintech firm and the new regulation are expected issued end the latest for such preparation they start actively consult with authority from other country china australia singapore and malaysia get idea the industry ecosystem regional level cnn indonesia today the fintech company should get endorsement from bank indonesia and get license enter into settlement service according deumoly pardede deputy commissioner nonbank financial institution ojk the fintech firm still able run their business indonesia and they could later adjust the business after the new regulation been enacted dealstreetasia active support from the regulator and government critically important for the growth the fintech industry indonesia regulating body can create positive and cooperative environment that promotes innovative solution however the same time they should ensure the protection individual and systemic viability installing appropriate regulatory framework the existing financial system also important necessity have point contact regulatory body every fintech player know they have person talk and align with especially after the fintech regulatory framework been issued and require adjustment their business model about the organization the indonesian fintech firm other than supportive action from regulator and government fintech firm must also contribute

arguably right step establish fti credible fintech industry organization indonesia section fintech solution indonesian smes alternative lending learning from china lending market environment the need alternative financing for smes china and indonesia undeniable that finance major component every firm business activity study from world economic forum reveals that limited access finance one the most cited issue for business developing country including indonesia already described indonesian market extremely high number microenterprises accounted total smes indonesia located ruralbackward area which also have high limitation financial access from survey towards smes indonesia shinozaki found out that the collateral requirement and the high lending rate are the biggest barrier for smes indonesia obtain financing result smes indonesia largely underserved when come financial service deloitte also emphasize from report that majority indonesian smes require financing from combination formal and informal channel credit market china also have suffered from allocation inefficiency that particularly affect smes number structural imbalance created huge gap smes credit estimated more than billion and surplus demand for returnseeking investable asset estimated more than trillion ekberg etal the misallocation capital for smes appears serious implication china economic growth considering the smes represent economic output the country arner and janos which this situation similarly experienced smes indonesia however since the first appearance lending platform year until lending platform performed important allocation role especially for smes that facing constrain credit access china douglas and janos considering there are about million microentrepreneurs china with million rural poor and remains unbanked renton douglas etal indeed huge market opportunity for lending business alibaba group one famous private chinese internet company starting this business model focus serving smes china alternative financing through the lending platform and another platform company china such lufax dianrong renrendai also similarly focus lending smes china and reported have huge growth lending model attracted smes since collateral required order for them obtain required amount working capital smes benefit the most from this unsecured lending model since collateral mainly implied smes one the biggest barrier access the financing from the traditional bank moreover another attractive point for smes are the simplicity lending process through the lending platform unlike lending process with bank which require lot paperwork documentation and long screening process resulting high interest rate lending platform offer easier application process paperless basis faster approval and cash disbursement this due innovating credit scoring model used the lending which model are easily datadriven employ semiautomated risk assessment method and leverage nontraditional data point world economic forum lastly lending could provide more competitive rate and give penalty for early repayment the fintech industry indonesia indeed still early stage and although there particular report the total current lending platform indonesia there are some lending already exist such modalku amartha crowdo investree mekar and koinworks which aiming serve the smes indonesia the number firm are predicted keep growing since there huge potential market opportunity demand indonesian smes alternative lending through fintech company amounted billion ekberg etal digital technology adaption smes china indonesia considering both china and indonesia are highly populated country china listed and indonesia listed most populous country the world the mobile phone are expectedly also high demand both market however although mobile phone penetration both country reaching more than the internet penetration rate not occurring the same manner the internet penetration indonesia still way below the global average only total population and also concentrated mainly urban area meanwhile china the internet penetration reaching nearly half population and the penetration the rural area rose dramatically the adoption level digital technology highly related the success rate making fintech service lending platform solution for alternative financing smes current issue deal with limited access internet rural area indonesia should immediately address order for smes could having benefit fintech service for their business government should also provide support enable smes digital providing sufficient technology infrastructure for example increasing the broadband access and quality service particularly rural area indonesia knowledge smes financial literacy and fintech industry china indonesia research study conducted acca the borrower china lending market reveals that most them consist small and micro business company highly educated these had completed college and had universitylevel qualification and had formal written business plan financially trained qualified person charge business finance and reported that the produced regular management account appears that the smes borrower group that using lending china have sufficient financial literacy general and able basic accounting one important characteristic indonesian smes the owner also the manager and the employee anton etal therefore other word develop sme human resource skill mean also develop the owner educational skill financial technological and management skill most microenterprises indonesia this stage still having troubled understanding basic finance literacy shinozaki meanwhile order able use the lending service from fintech basic financial skill would necessary since the application process for obtaining the loan would require the applicant financial track record the very least order increase human resource competence training development smes should enhanced all private and public sector not only government support necessary but the educational institution financial institution bank nonbank including the fintech firm itself may need align and work together support the financial literacy smes indonesia regular workshop and training certain area where smes still lack financial education can maximize the potential indonesian smes help them understand the benefit using the fintech service regulatory framework for fintech china indonesia china considered the country with the most platform the world with the settlement about rmb billion transaction single month july douglas and janos such high growth lending industry mainly caused due the absence regulation the industry for several year which removing the entry barrier and attracting more player the market the fintech company including provider are refused claimed financial company and such they did not fall under the financial regulation china chinese government put intervention the fintech industry the early stage because while they observe how the business going they realize the benefit from which improved the life many china the chinese economy grew the gap the rich and poor also get widened which encourage the financial inclusion chen and ernie the innovative business model offered through fintech industry provide many good and service available the rural region china and therefore light regulation important success the industry market however the industry mature the government start impose heavier regulation and more strictly regulate the industry considering more and more problematic case arise from the fintech industry china can seen section earlier the lending platform china with reported problem are significantly increase through the year after observing the market industry for several year and intervene the industry chinese government then issued the regulation directly for lending platform the content the regulation appear highly promote risk management and establish muchneeded ground rule limit the illegal activity lending industry which exactly address the problem that face china lending industry see section the regulator are more interested controlling undesired activity rather than setting legal barrier entry unlike china where government impose the regulation after long market observation and the platform industry more mature the indonesian regulator already started prepare the regulation although the fintech industry indonesia still early stage reported cnn indonesia the financial authority will issue new regulation fintech end meanwhile the fintech business especially the lending platform industry just started available indonesia around the issuance regulation eventually happens arguably the lending industry indonesia still way far from mature stage any high barrier entry the market due regulatory issue and heavy intervention form the government may kill the grow potential the industry one suitable approach have lending industry indonesia potentially grow and help the economy using approach been done chinese government the light government regulation the initial stage the lending industry indonesia and observing the market indonesia would important element for the industry success chapter conclusion and recommendation section conclusion the study set out explore the potential fintech industry indonesia and also understand the main factor order for the fintech service could give utmost support for the growth smes business indonesia case comparison study china fintech industry carried this study examine how the fintech industry successfully gain high traction china market and satisfy the financial need smes china important highlight that the fintech service the object study limited the fintech which business derived from technology firm nonbanking financial institution who deliver financial service public particularly alternative lending service through peer peer lending platform both china and indonesia developing country have some common environment term population density number unbanked population the importance the smes economic growth and the financial constraint smes each country common environment population density unbanked population sme important role economic growth smes constraint financial china indonesia china first position the most populated country the world around total population china did not have bank account china smes contributed gdp employment opportunity and export activity smes china only receive the credit originated the bank indonesia the most populated country south east asia and ranked four the world million people around the bankable population did not have the bank account indonesia smes contributed gdp employment opportunity and export activity only smes indonesia using bank loan source financing the fintech service providing alternative lending platform called peertopeer lending platform creates important allocation role and become solution especially for smes china that have constrained the credit access since firstly available chinese market until the platform have delivered directly the public and smes more than rmb billion credit douglas and janos gained traction and market acceptance from smes seeking credit mainly due the following reason collateral required obtain required amount working capital the simplicity application lending process paperless basis faster lending approval and cash disbursement competitive lending rate and penalty given general from early repayment previous study conducted shinozaki from asia development bank showed the biggest barrier indonesian smes obtain financing from the financial institution due the collateral requirement and high lending rate and further reveals that the lack access finance negatively affected sme survival and growth rate general therefore the smes indonesia require some form alternative financing cover their financing need the indonesian government currently foresee the potential fintech market indonesia support the smes that been underserviced the large bank particularly for the microenterprises which accounted for more than the total smes indonesia learning from china fintech industry there are three condition are observed important key success factor for the fintech industry support the growth the smes the digital technology adoption level the smes the financial literacy skill and the regulatory framework key indicator china indonesia the country with the most the total population use the mobile phone and predicted reach population the internet user only reached population which still half below average asean country most microenterprises indonesia this stage still having troubled understanding basic finance literacy the government will issue the regulation although the fintech industry indonesia still early growth stage digital technology adoption level mobile phone penetration internet user penetration financial literacy skill regulatory framework mobile phone user worldwide with population using mobile phone the internet user china reached total population and the penetration rural area nearly quadrupled past year the fintech service user are highly educated with had completed college and had universitylevel qualification and trained qualified financial person charge business finance the government put intervention the early stage growth the fintech market china and start impose heavier regulation the industry mature several year since the first establish china market the regulation remains absence the content regulation recently issued after the market mature mostly promote risk management control and limit the illegal activity industry rather than giving legal barrier entry section recommendation since smes indonesia are dominated the microenterprises with financial constrain really important build the financial infrastructure support the growth smes particularly micro business level the integration fintech ecosystem creating innovative financial solution for smes indonesia may become one the most powerful tool stimulate the sustainable economic growth the future indonesia however order succeed manifesting such integration some vigorous effort need accomplished the stakeholder improving the infrastructure this moment the internet penetration indonesia still considerably below the average global standard meanwhile the adoption level digital technology highly related the success rate making fintech service benefit the smes therefore the support from government build sufficient infrastructure and improving the quality service existing internet service really crucial especially rural area indonesia providing regular training and workshop improve financial knowledge the smes human resource important increase human resource competence smes especially finance literacy regular training and workshop can held public and private sector government may create program educate smes financial subject but any educational institution financial service institution bank nonbank including the fintech player also need align and work together help smes enhance the finance literacy and understand the advantage fintech impose heavier regulation after the industry become more mature any high barrier entry market due excessive regulation early growth stage fintech industry indonesia could restrain the ability fintech firm compete and grow the market important for the government observe the business practice fintech firm indonesia and just lightly regulated this early growth stage after intensely monitor the industry and the industry become mature then the government may impose heavier regulation which focus the risk management issue prevent any illegal activity fintech firm rather than adding legal barrier entry the supportive action from the government and regulator pivotal determine the succeed this industry
