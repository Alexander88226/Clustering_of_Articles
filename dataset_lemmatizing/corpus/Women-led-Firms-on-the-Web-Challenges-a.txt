research agenda general sample womenled firm are small and generalisable finding are scarce there great deal work ahead understand how woman perform online seller and online exporter and importer and whether and which type womenled firm any firm for that matter grow faster create more job and reduce poverty among their employee and community than firm that not sell onlineinclusive economic transformation viiiif the policy goal enable womenled business engage trade online then much more research need done three question what are the challenge facing womenled firm that seek engage ecommerce and crossborder ecommerce what are the challenge facing womenled firm before they start selling online digitise formalise and start online business and iii what are the impact business success online woman life their business growth and jobcreation potential and their country economy this paper address the first questionin addition donor and policymakers need careful when interpreting data gender difference and should not read too much into descriptive statistic when assessing them before deciding that woman face higher hurdle that womenled firm better worse than maleled firm important control for the many other variable that shape firm performance engagement ecommerce export participation job creation and growth the gender the chief executive officer management team may one the factor that make difference but hardly the only one and probably seldom the main one and may not matter all introductionpromoting woman economic opportunity become major global development tenet that permeates the united nation sustainable development goal sdgs also become common seek promote woman international trade this positive least three levelsfirst while there are some study the impact trade liberalisation gender there are few data how womenled firm international trade exporter and importer good and service genderbased reporting and data are useful for understanding what any difference exist between woman and menled firm their participation trade export and import intensity and diversification place regional and global value chain and export survival and how those difference they exist vary country sector and onsecond woman are becoming more prominent many economy employee employer business owner consumer family main breadwinner and investor since woman behaviour choice and constraint play growing role global economic activity useful know more about themthird woman economic empowerment widely viewed mean optimise society productive resource expand the tax base and improve economic growth household welfare and intergenerational wealth transfer other word society are more likely thrive when woman thrive thus useful know more about what woman and prefer and what challenge they face including tradethe purpose this paper elucidate the role womenled firm and regulatory challenge trade focusing the most rapidly growing area world trade crossborder ecommerce good and servicesthis paper take broad definition ecommerce covering both physical good ordered online the usaid and digital good and service delivered over internet platform the paper based insight from several survey covering more than firm that nextrade group run both own and partnership with entity such the united state agency for international development interamerican development bank iadb and the world bank over the past year latin america south asia southeast asia and africa understand how firm developing economy engage ecommerce and build global database and countrylevel index the enabling environment for digital trade the survey design and first pilot were carried out late and early with the support usaid data this paper draw smaller random sample small mediumsized and large firm developing country southeast asia africa and south asia the data are from two survey carried out nextrade group one december january with support from usaid and another august the survey work not been motivated question about gender rather been aimed understanding how different firm type engage crossborder ecommerce and develop global countrylevel database the enabling environment for ecommerce however the survey capture the gender firm chief executive officer ceo and owner and thus lend themselves analysis gender difference any firm participation ecommerce and the barrier they facegiven the attention woman trade and development policy circle one might expect find enormous difference the performance and barrier facing womenled firm compared with menled firm trade ecommerce several recent survey firm striking finding how similar the online sale export and growth performance womenled firm compared with menled firm the same size and the same country and how similarly male and female business leader ass and rate their barrier ecommerce short there appear bangladesh ghana indonesia kenya nigeria pakistan the philippine south africa and viet naminclusive economic transformation meaningful difference between firm run woman and firm run men term participation ecommerce the severity regulatory challenge facing company after controlling for other variable that are widely known drive firm export participation and barrier trade such firm size and country this finding may and itself suggest that getting woman into business and into selling online may help level the playing field between woman and menled firm notion that would cemented more comprehensive data that showed that female owner business that are not digitised and that not have online commercial activity notably worse than their male counterpartswhere there difference between firm various size and between firm country different level development smaller firm whether run men woman are uniformly more hampered than large firm ecommerce and crossborder trade firm leastdeveloped country ldcs are more hampered than firm emerging market small firm uniformly see the various element the enabling environment for ecommerce such logistics online payment and access staff capability for ecommerce more challenging than large company these finding are extraordinarily consistent across country and region and align with large body literature firm participation trade what new course that ecommerce appears alleviate the fixed cost that have famously kept most small and mediumsized enterprise smes from exporting according most survey firm that engage ecommerce whether led woman men are more likely export and import than offline sellersanother finding that there are markedly fewer womenled firm than maleled firm any one category these survey offline buyer and seller online buyer online seller and online buyer seller this course reflects the significantly smaller share womenled firm the broader economy most country and probably also reflects various challenge and entry cost that study suggest woman particular face becoming business owner acquiring technology and capital and growing their business the question then how overcome these challenge and help woman get into business and become active onlineif the policy objective champion small womenled firm developing country ecommerce then there are four major challenge focus across most region custom procedure for ecommerce import and export logistics cost including lastmile delivery that particularly impact the more remote and rural firm digital regulation such online intellectual property and copyright rule legal liability for online seller and platform supporting them and data privacy and localisation rule access finance including earlystage financing fastdisbursing working capital and trade financein poorer country basic internet connectivity and functioning online payment are also significant challenge helping womenled firm deal with these challenge would inherently help menled firm well the first four area can improved through regulatory reform the latter two can dealt with both through regulatory reform such liberalising logistics service passing equity crowdfunding law and specific financing programme public private partnership and tax incentivessection review how woman are behaving online business owner exporter consumer and borrower order ass whether their economic life different the web than offline and perhaps justify different policy prescription for the two sphere section discus the survey result the regulatory challenge doing ecommerce cited most pressing small business including womenled firm selected economy southeast asia africa and south asia section offer remedy light the finding section concludes web and woman business different for woman online woman and ecommerce intersect the same way that men and ecommerce intersect the opportunity engage ecommerce shape how woman behave business leader exporter online service worker consumer and borrower appears the web making particularly notable difference for woman several area discussed belowbusiness owner fewer woman than men run and own company most country according the world bank enterprise survey data from percent

december january and august the first survey and original survey design conducted with the support the united state agency for international developmentthere appreciable difference survey data between the ratio online seller offline seller for womenled firm and maleled firm after controlling for firm size and country whether womenled firm are more likely than maleled firm start sell online can tested with larger set data another hypothesis tested whether online seller employ more woman than offline firm survey the pacific island including fiji and samoa showed that business that are active online are newer and smaller and have greater concentration female executive under year age than traditional company the region dicaprio and suominen these woman reported preference for ecommerce because they can run their online business while handling inclusive economic transformation household obligation and expand their market reach country such australia bolster their earningsa survey the international trade centre suggests that while woman offline seller make only quarter offline seller they make half online seller international trade centre this interesting finding but based sample that not random and prone pick more woman than men the reporting also doe not appear control for the possibility that womenled firm are larger based more developed country than maleled firm size and other variable drive the difference the survey here other survey the share womenled firm all surveyed firm online seller not higher than the overall sample the broader market overall whether woman are

thing being equal parrotta and smith glance the world bank enterprise survey suggests that percent firm with female top manager export compared with percent firm with male top manager small difference that will probably not statistically significant after controlling for variable that shape export participation rate such firm size world bank survey suggest that womenled small firm are just likely

firm that not sell online figure there barely been any difference the export diversification woman and menled firm fact this particular sample suggests that womenled small firm that export are more

microenterprises and small firm mediumsized firm and larger firm the data suggest that ecommerce help business export although share firm that ecommerce already exported before they started doing ecommerce and also convey the familiar finding that trade economist have repeated for year smaller firm are likely than large firm export course one might then reasonably ask whether larger share

international developmentthis not say that promoting woman exporter would futile would not improve economic and social outcome more than promoting men exporter well might this also not say that there are gender bias online one study found that woman selling ebay get lower number online bid and make only percent what men when selling the same new product and percent what men when selling used product even woman are perceived more honest and reliable seller than men the study suggests this because people perceive good owned men have more value especially good are army knife car seat cover krichelikatz and regev online service provider online work can particularly empowering for woman culture where they are expected stay home and lack the professional network and resource men world bank empirically there may difference woman job prospect online compared with offline for example there are proportionately many more woman employed the online platform upwork percent total than there are the offline nonagricultural labour market percent world bank this may also reflect the flexibility that online work can provide for people work online work opportunity enable woman developing country just like men developed country live digital nomad for example indian born upwork freelancer radhika basuthakur provided social medium and content marketing service online whilst living and working various country including colombia and thailand feltham online shopper woman hold more wealth than ever before both absolute and relative term woman will have trillion disposable income china and india alone from trillion medaglio accounting firm ernst young belief woman will hold percent the world discretionary spending power ernst young this extent because woman also direct their family finance offline for example asian woman control household spending grocery clothing and cosmetic percent asian family the economist intelligence unit also appears that woman are more voracious online shopper than men according market research compared with men woman spend percent more their online time retail spend percent more dollar term online and spend about percent more time social medium including interacting with brand febriana study suggest these gender difference are specific the internet compared with men woman are more voracious online shopper but rather similarly disposed buying the offline economycrossborder purchase show different picture google consumer barometer suggests that while young men are still the most voracious crossborder shopper most market for example mexico percent men the age group year buy from overseas least once year compared with percent woman the same age category however china generation and woman are the most likely fill their virtual shopping cart with foreign product consumer barometer these are descriptive statistic that not account for such variable buyer income level which may more impactful their online purchase pattern than their gender indeed empirical work the united state find that gender particular explanatory power online buying after other buyer characteristic such income race and educational level are controlled for lieber and syverson one interesting hypothesis that the availability online shopping and service such grocery delivery and cleaning service enables woman save more time than they previously spent household task and thus put longer hour work perhaps their online business online borrower and fundraiser academic study and anecdotal evidence suggest that woman have harder time than men accessing financing whether equity from angel venture capital fund loan from bank this partly because gender bias among investor and lender alesina and lotti calcagnini giombini and lenti harkness the woman that successfully raise equity are found get only percent the funding they seek while men get percent teare woman are widely found likely make these request perhaps because they not want raise money for their business because they selfcensor believing gender bias will lead their application rejectedcrowdfunding the internet may changing this pricewaterhousecoopers find that womenled rewardsbased campaign not equity crowdfunding involving sale security are percent more successful than menled campaign however the study doe not control for other variable that may affect these outcome such the type and size organisation led woman compared with those led men not know whether woman seem succeed more because they are woman because some other variable other study have found that woman have easier time getting loan online from peertopeer platform than the offline world even they tend ask for money than men barasinska and sch fer marom robb and sade another hypothesis that accelerating job growth warehousing and delivery ecommerce may enabling bluecollar male get back work thank michael ferrantino for engaging discussion these questionsinclusive economic transformation not entirely clear whether success due the web being more genderblind the rise woman online lender and investor and womenfocused platform such portfolia other factor brush also not clear whether woman better equity crowdfunding than purely offline raise and bias may seep more easily often equity request investor and investees still kick the tyre talk meet discus and take thing offline after meeting online there some evidence the contrary banking woman may worse when relationship banking replaced datadriven banking study sweden found that banker analysis borrower creditworthiness based data and paper had greater gender bias against woman than when the banker met the borrower malmstrom and wincent overall the jury still out whether the online economy bridging the distance between men and woman economic opportunity yet whether woman behaviour shopper business owner exporter are different the online economy than the offline world somewhat irrelevant the point that woman use the internet intensively consumer producer exporter and investor and thus policy and regulation that shape the online economy critically shape the economic prospect woman and the extent that woman are more active online than men policy and regulation that shape economic activity the internet can have outsized impact womenwhat then are the challenge facing woman who are seeking are doing crossborder ecommerce challenge facing womenled firm ecommercetechnology for firm engage crossborder ecommerce there must enabling environment with excellent internet connectivity and information ecommerce logistics iii

correlated with country level development and firm size familiar predictor firm participation trade many other database good thing together country where business assign good score one area tends also get good score all area these empirical regularity tend hold survey after surveyanother important issue keep mind that this paper survey mostly people who are working business and some ecommerce they are the people who know something about the regulatory issue associated with selling and exporting online thus this paper omits large set people who are still dealing with issue related establishing business getting networked client and partner accessing information technology and area where study suggest woman many country tend face more obstacle than menthis survey did not ask firm which ecommerce platform they use some respondent may well have classified themselves online seller even they use social medium platform such facebook instagram market online and then perform transaction offline based those lead using cash cheque bank transfer anecdotal evidence suggests that most seller developing country are indeed facebook and instagram seller suominen forthcoming the study the pacific island woman were marketing australian shopper facebook until some point they were able set their own online store and proper online payment capability hypothesis explore whether social medium platform such instagram and facebook are effective incubator online seller who then graduate transacting online after certain event occur such securing bank account effect online payment securing capability create online store this were the case then the path online seller with online payment could shortened with donor support facebook offering transactional ecommerce capability the data suggest that once womenled firm are business and selling online woman not worse than men anything they betterinclusive economic transformation policy implication and agendaecommerce opening new sale and export and import opportunity for company large and small but many challenge especially developing country hamper both woman and menled firm from taking advantage online commerce for export and import government and donor intent helping womenled small online seller thrive sell more and export should improve market access custom regulation and the range digital regulation that fuel online transaction and provide company with certainty that their protected and their data are accessible and enhance womenled firm access earlystage finance and working capital specific challenge these area vary country but they are steepest for small business and nonexporters irrespective whether they are run men woman thus improvement these area will help business run either men womenthere are number specific suggestion for helping small firm including those run woman sell onlinein acquiring technology setting formal promote woman business and starting sell online study have found several barrier facing woman segment not captured this survey those that are seeking establish business and access technology financing business network and talent meanwhile seems that womenled business covered this survey firm that are the formal economy digitised and online experience fewer any gap compared with similar menled business while much more research still needed there question that policy attention critical design and support programme that enable woman get into business formalise their company acquire technology and access financing these aspect should the first step towards building economy where there more equal share womenled and menled firm offline and online and tradea number country have created programme help woman get connected business and into trade for example the united kingdom had programme enable womenled firm access superfast broadband connection also created woman innovation campaign understand the challenge being female entrepreneur and host womenonly

energise financial service and innovation and number country have now adopted some country also see the sandbox approach useful for financial inclusion jenik adopt legislation for crowdfunding online seller uniformly complain about access earlystage and growth capital study suggest that woman are facing fewer bias securing equity financing online than offline equity crowdfunding where company can sell security online investor expanded dramatically recent year and opened financing company that may not have extensive investor network that are run woman minority most developing country africa and southeast asia still not have equity crowdfunding law legislation and regulatory oversight are seen important mean fuel the crowdfunding market and keep the cost issuance reasonable while lowering the incidence fraudulent practice and educating newer investor about the high risk inherent earlystage deal alibhai bell and conner woman investor developing country can follow the footstep woman investor advanced country who have started angel fund and crowdfunding platform focused exclusively womenled firmsunderstand what keep firm from formalising and thus doing online business major problem developing country informality womenled company are found particularly likely remain informal this impedes their access bank account and investor company are typically informal because rational choice the cost being formal business exceed the benefit would useful for donor take deeper look seller journey the step and pain point that company especially online seller different country face when formalising their company and when making transaction and running their business banking paying tax filing for paperwork custom and and then determining how formalising company could made easier and more attractive especially for online seller whose success critically hinge financial inclusion these mapping could disaggregated gender order discover unique bias against woman the journey becoming online seller and operating online businessecommercerelated collect data the content and impact regulation disaggregated gender genderspecific data international trade and ecommerce are very nascent and yet firmlevel data disaggregated gender are critical for developing programming specific for woman and targeting development assistance the hurdle womenled firm face government have already made progress with some genderrelated reporting part the united nation semiannual paperless trade survey there much more work done classify and quantify the range regulation that impact firm doing business online and uncover best practice one recent effort the alliance etrade development the author coordinated with usaid king spalding google paypal and ebay which analysed regulatory and policy area across country suominen forthcoming this work also analysed country programme aimed woman such helping womenled firm use highspeed internet access earlystage funding this type regulatory mapping appears very useful for developing country crafting ecommerce strategy developing digital regulatory framework need scaled and made regular basis for the policy community keep finger the pulse the critical regulatory development shaping the global digital trade and economy the next step ass the impact these various regulation different firm type including woman and menled firm leading there are also excellent opportunity for public private partnership support woman ecommerce given many corporation keen interest empowering womenled firm and meeting sdgs related woman for example holding pakistan logistics company been rolling out gender diversity initiative aimed increasing the participation woman the workforce pakistan where woman make percent the population but only percent the workforce holding been working increasing gender parity within rank through series woman initiative such hiring woman ecommerce courier teach other woman remote village how use ecommerce mobile phone tablet mastercard worked with the iadb the kchallenge initiative coach connect and certify more than woman entrepreneur the america donor can use social impact bond also known development impact bond which the private sector invests first and upon achieving metric interest the donor such some percentage point expansion online export sale number online seller the donor buy successful project and compensates the private investor for generating social impact suominen more general note important for government mainstream trade consideration into digital regulation regulation crafted one agency can inadvertently have negative implication small business seeking online commerce for example consumer protection data privacy law intended protect consumer may crafted way that make complicated and costly for small business market sell online data are still quite sparse the trade effect various digital regulation trade but clear that these effect can detrimental government other objective such promote digitisation and small business exporter drafting and revising digital other regulation that impact doing business off online government need mainstream digital trade consideration into the process drafting digital and other business regulation regulatory process need ask for example this data regulation designed enable small online business how privacy and transfer rule limit country company competitiveness the global digital economy doe this consumer protection law financial regulation internet intermediary liability law promote undermine country company and consumer ability crossborder ecommerce good and service these question can extended firm different segment such asking how given digital regulation might impact womenled firm rural firm firm that are still informalinclusive economic transformation conclusionthis paper made six main point first woman worse online seller than men very similar share womenled and maleled firm sell online and womenled online seller tend export just many market maleled firm womenled firm that sell online also tend not perceive higher barrier doing ecommerce than maleled firm the same size from the same country however the share womenled firm all firm that have online sale activity still small and simply reflects the share womenled firm the overall economy this along with some other early evidence suggests that woman may better online than offline business leaderssecond these data not say that woman not face higher hurdle start business make profitable secure technology and financing and compared with maleled firm study suggest that many country woman wage bigger uphill battle these area than men which may one reason why most formal enterprise are run men the survey here tends not capture people who are still trying get into business rather biased towards people who are digitised the survey are part fielded and thus taken online are working employee business owner and often are using ecommerce buy sell online because those people who have something meaningful say about the challenge selling online this particular set people there are few difference between men and woman performance business leader size business export propensity and challenge faced selling online the policy question not how help bridge gap between woman and menled firm performance online rather the question how get more woman into the formal economy and sell onlinethird the policy goal promote ecommerce womenrun firm developing country then policy need tailored the country and the type firm regulatory and other challenge vary significantly and consistently firm country size and export status the hurdle that for example mediumsized company salvador face doing ecommerce home and across border are different from those that mediumsized company indonesia face regardless whether the firm are run men woman likewise hurdle faced small indonesian firm are often different from those faced large indonesian firm and hurdle faced small indonesian exporter are different from those faced indonesian nonexporters whether run men woman presumably other characteristic such firm sector the gender the ceo matter far allfourth small firm led woman and men across market face higher hurdle than large firm doing ecommerce and crossborder ecommerce they uniformly rate the element the enabling environment for ecommerce such logistics and custom procedure online payment access finance and access staff capability for ecommerce lower than large company they also struggle with digital regulation such and copyright rule online legal liability for online seller and platform supporting them and data privacy and localisation rule the various traditional regulatory issue related doing business such registering business handling paperwork filing tax and appear pose fewer obstacle firm whether run men woman sell online than the regulatory issue related custom clearance market access and copyright and liability protection onlinefifth developing country have yet adopt the range regulation that would enable their company engage crossborder ecommerce but regulation are just one piece helping womenled firm trade more online policymakers should also focus two other leading constraint facing womenled and menled firm developing economy logistics cost and access finance course these area can improved through regulatory reform such liberalising logistics service passing equity crowdfunding law but they can also remedied with specific programme public private partnership and tax incentivesowners once the starting point these area are the same the outcome depend the entrepreneur environment gender than their ability empowering woman also critical because the central perhaps outsized role woman household welfare and intergenerational wealth transfersixth there are several potential solution simplifying and digitising business registration and regulatory and tax filing securing and facilitating trade and revenue collection using blockchain and predictive analytics that separate licit from illicit shipment efficiently and iii adopting digital regulation and programme that encourage innovation fuel the flow data promote secure online identity and accelerate firm and consumer access secure interoperable digitised payment would also helpful make the financial service ecosystem much more agile and responsive the need small business through promotion fintechs open banking practice that enhance flow between bank and financial service equity crowdfunding that enables investor and company looking for capital connect scale and leveraging blockchain banking run knowyourcustomer check and accelerate trade finance all these reform help womenled business developing country engage online commerce many them may help woman disproportionately removing gender bias custom banking venture capital and marketingthree final point first while not all clear and seems unlikely that woman are severely disadvantaged when selling online trade and some evidence appears suggest the opposite opening opportunity for woman and girl get into business and learn about exporting valuable particularly country where woman have access technology finance knowledge and network and where they are seldom business second policymakers need careful interpreting data gender difference and not read too much into descriptive statistic before deciding that woman face higher hurdle that womenled firm better worse than maleled firm important control for the many other variable that shape firm performance engagement ecommerce export participation job creation and growth gender the ceo management team may one the factor that make difference but hardly the only one and probably seldom the main one and may not matter allthird research only incipient sample womenled firm are small and generalisable finding are still scarce there great deal work ahead understand how woman perform online seller and online exporter and importer and whether and which type womenled firm any firm for that matter grow faster create more job and reduce poverty among their employee and community than firm that not sell online the policy goal enable womenled business engage trade online then much more research need done three question what are the challenge facing womenled firm that seek engage ecommerce and crossborder ecommerce what are the challenge facing womenled firm before they start selling online digitise formalise and start online business and iii what are the
