billion fine levied regulator since billion fine charge incurred bank regulatory compliance failure global systemically important bank gsibs top tier bank hit headline domestic systemically important bank dsibs typically second tier institution financial institution significant regulatory compliance top agenda across industry take example morgan chase spending billion boost staff fix compliance
