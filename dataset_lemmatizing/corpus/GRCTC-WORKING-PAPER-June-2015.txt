bherein file grctc working paper june knowledge elicitation for regulatory compliance the financial industry tom butler elie abilahoud leona brien marcello ceci bill emerson and tabbasum naz grctc abstract financial institution are struggling address the volume velocity variety and complexity regulation failure comply with existing regulation costing the industry billion with profit being paid fine and payment customer since such problem are caused fundamental information system failure they people process technology origin this design science research study address these problem designing standardsbased methodology for interpreting regulatory text the methodology construct model method and related guideline form the architectural basis information technology artefact instantiation called ganesha based the object management group omg standard the semantics business vocabulary and rule sbvr the methodology guideline and related artefact enable practitioner capture regulation regulatory natural language rnl that both human readable structured english and machine readable xml and owl the methodology and guideline have been evaluated through application several regulatory domain and the result presented major actor the financial industry their instantiation ganesha therefore enables knowledge elicitation legal and financial subject matter expert facilitate knowledge sharing training and decision making around regulatory compliance financial service organisation keywords design science research sbvr semantic technology regulation law vocabulary knowledge elicitation for regulatory compliance the financial industry introduction problem with and deficiency information system being used and across the financial industry contributed significantly the organizational and institutional failure that occurred across this industry bamberger the institutional response the financial crisis industry reform and increased regulation global scale grant wilson kendall report that most the largest bank understand that they not only have inadequate capability address the regulation that have already been imposed but that even more regulation inevitable the consequence this are significant financial institution have been paying over their profit fine and payment customer since the for example over billion fine were levied regulator since the billion fine and charge were incurred bank while the regulatory compliance failure global systemically important bank gsibs top tier bank hit the headline those domestic systemically important bank dsibs typically second tier institution and other financial institution are significant regulatory compliance top the agenda across the industry take for example that morgan chase are spending billion boost staff and fix compliance and riskcontrol problem people term hsbc staff specialising risk and compliance almost entire workforce hence while fine are charge profit regulatory compliance costing firm dearly they comprise anywhere from total operating cost such are the scale the regulatory compliance challenge bank such hsbc standard chartered etc are withdrawing from smaller market our unpublished research indicates that support for regulatory compliance patchy best just usbased financial technology fintech are focussed compliance and risk with support for key regulatory compliance process the exception rather than the norm hence major gsibs are investing more people than technology due the gap the fintech market evidence the widespread failure apply people process and come from the basel committee banking supervision viz one the most significant lesson learned from the global financial crisis that began that bank information technology and data architecture were inadequate support the broad management financial risk this had severe consequence the bank themselves and the stability the financial system whole researcher and practitioner argue that traditional information technology are not the task addressing what are significant regulatory compliance challenge facing the industry bamberger bennett kendall the financial industry grc technology centre grctc established industryoriented governmentfunded research centre conduct the use semantic technology for regulatory compliance the financial industry one core objective design and build semantic technology enable sensemaking complex regulation actor order facilitate compliance financial organisation this paper present the finding our design science research initiative the development methodology which includes the elaboration concept guideline technical specification and artefact which enables legal and financial subject matter expert express complex legislation regulation and rule regulatory natural language rnl this rnl expressed according the object management group semantics business vocabulary and rule sbvr standard making both human and machine readable and understandable specifically describe the design cycle our research winter which tightly coupled with the rigour cycle the design process hevner underpinned adherence industry standard and the theory interpretation described abilahoud another output the design cycle help address the vocabulary and translation problem the design traditional see furnas bamberger illustrates how legal business and financial subject matter expert smes can capture domain knowledge directive regulation rule and regulatory guidance structured regulatory natural language this sbvrbased rnl can also transformed into the resource description framework rdf web ontology language owl for inclusion knowledge base the design artefact are also applicable other domain indicated insight obtained the rigour cycle our research the remainder this paper structured follows section first describes the motivation and context this design research study and includes short overview design science research perspective and their application this study section present the finding this design science research study which involved two research phase iterative design process which produced several artefact culminating the design artefact called ganesha phase the final section discus the finding and offer concluding thought motivation and research approach the widespread failure operational and regulatory compliance information system across the financial industry contributed the financial crisis bamberger however there were also global failure regulatory oversight campbell following the global financial crisis the velocity volume and variety regulation increased across all regulatory domain grant wilson clear that big regulation led big fine which are charge profit typically for larger bank this turn led industrywide recruitment drive for regulatory compliance staff and upsurge demand for grc and related information system kpmg such grc are typically developed using traditional information technology sheth however argues that traditional grc are incapable delivering the type risk and compliance functionality required financial service organisation the solution argues lie capturing the semantics risk and regulatory compliance bennett kendall and atkin also identify problem with traditional approach grc data management the financial industry and argue for solution based semantic technology take for example bamberger that traditional are deficient due problem translation regarding the translation both legal mandate and business understanding risk into computer code and actionable control hence one the key challenge facing financial service organisation and others servicing the sector understanding the regulatory compliance implication increasing volume local and global legislation regulatory rule and various form soft law brummer the translation problem arises due primordial challenge involving the interpretation regulatory text industry rule and standard such ifrs legal and financial subject matter expert smes this problem magnified however when software engineer attempt translate rule and compliance imperative into the development process plagued with poor communication and bias friedman nissenbaum within this context that gsibs dsibs grc and fintech firm supported the institution the financial industry grc technology centre grctc indicated grctc governmentfunded research centre whose purpose investigate the design semantic technology for regulatory compliance and risk data aggregation the financial industry industry member sit the steering board and inform the design research programme thus these organization are also collaborating the initiative coresearchers the context the current study multidisciplinary team researcher knowledge engineer software engineer and legal researcher from grctc undertook programme research make financial law and regulation human and machine readable significant that this study conducted with the initial participation two the primary author the omg sbvr standard also significant that one the research artefact from the first phase the study the sbvrbased methodology for regulatory interpretation applied part proofofconcept poc regulation the the omg financial domain task force and the enterprise data management council edm council while section illustrates the process and product the design cycle the participation the standardsmaking body and industry association indicate the transition through both rigour and relevance cycle indicated next design science research approach according winter design research aimed creating solution specific class relevant problem using rigorous construction and evaluation process while design science reflects the design research process and aim creating standard for rigour this design research project accord with winter categorisation this form research the design artefact being produced this study include construct regulatory concept vocabulary relationship between and rule constituted these concept model represented the semantics business vocabulary and rule sbvr and method approach the construction concept relationship and model hevner argues that design science research must incorporate design cycle which involves the core activity developing and evaluating the design artefact and research process rigour cycle connects the design cycle with knowledge base scientific theory experience expertise and metaartefacts and relevance cycle that capture the interaction between the environment context the problem domain and the core design activity hevner these cycle were incorporated into our design science research the first phase the project described below the rigour cycle underpinned our adoption the sbvr standard from the object management group omg the design our methodology design science theory one level informed formalism west and the bungewandweber bww ontology wand weber but chiefly the concept tenet and abstract model provided the sbvr standard the design cycle hevner hevner involved iterative approach the build design artefact and process phase and evaluation phase the first phase the study governed hermeneutic approach developing both constituent construct and model based pragmatic phenomenological hermeneutic theory interpretation developed team member abilahoud winograd flores fonseca martin thus thinking informed the process and underpinned rigour this design research study commenced february the first phase our study saw immersion the philosophy tenet and process involved the application the sbvr standard and direct engagement with the designer the sbvr standard following this detailed requirement were gathered scoping research conducted and proof concept pocs developed these were component activity hevner rigour relevance and design cycle while the focus the design cycle the nature the study saw natural movement into and between rigour and relevance cycle due strong foundation the omg sbvr standard and engagement with and feedback from toptier bank the and europe international legal firm the legal informatics research community the and europe and member the edm council the second phase the solution the aforementioned problem iteratively developed the initial move through the rigour cycle saw the sbvr standard being adopted the dsr knowledge base movement through the relevance and design cycle the evaluation phase conducted internally with industry coresearchers and externally with member the object management group where the artefact were presented member the enterprise data management council edm council finance domain task force fdtf ontology psig and sbvr community omg technical meeting and may the edm council ceo mike atkin publically acknowledged the contribution the sbvrbased methodology over member from london citybased gsibs dsibs grc vendor including chief data officer chief information officer and other practitioner design rigour and relevance cycle phase despite being one the most isintensive industry sector the financial industry lag behind other business domain the application semantic technology however all that changing the financial industry through the enterprise data management council developing common vocabulary called the financial industry business ontology fibo bennett atkins have previously adduced evidence the effect that this initiative unique term process and product however argue that transcends term purpose detail and rigour extant approach capturing the semantics the regulatory domain financial service support for this contention come from our previously published research abilahoud presentation and interaction with academic and practitioner the omg and the international conference legal knowledge and information system abilahoud brien and contemporaneous published work sbvr ramakrishna paschke the following section present the knowledge base that informed this study rigour cycle section then delineates the dsr study term the design artefact sbvr knowledge base for the rigour cycle the semantic business vocabulary and rule sbvr object management group iso compliant formal terminological dictionary the sbvr vocabulary used define coherent set interconnected business concept not merely list term and definition however much more enables the creation rulebook that contains business policy rule etc that govern organisational activity and process based the principle formal and firstorder logic developed enable business practitioner capture the unambiguous meaning the concept and entity that constitute business domain and the rule that govern the relationship and behaviour such entity thus sbvr could author intended used cross the chasm between business and software engineering domain providing common vocabulary and formal but businessoriented mechanism for expressing business rule sbvr part the computation independent model the omg model driven architecture and support the use structured english machineindependent natural language thus structured syntax for capturing business vocabulary and business rule representing both structural and behavioural dimension business process and activity addition policy and rule that govern actor organisational context sbvr being applied research and practice for example extract business vocabulary from business process model njonko controlled natural language for business rule specification njonko jesus melo and standardbased approach for knowledge transformation and knowledge representation patent law ramakrishna paschke use the financial industry business natural language been indicated chapin while our previous published work and presentation omg technical meeting indicate potential regulatory natural language abilahoud use been popularised among practitioner rob van haarst his instructional sbvr made easy business vocabulary and rule critical asset sbvr iso compliant formal terminological dictionary and rulebook business vocabulary and rule comprised the following noun concept these correspond thing entity that populate business regulatory domain verb concept these capture the relationship between entity expressed noun concept definitional rule these constrain the relationship between noun concept and are expressed verb concept behavioural rule these govern business activity which noun concept play role thus sbvr contains the noun concept verb concept definitional rule and behavioural rule for specific business business domain and regulatorybusiness domain such for example antimoneylaundering aml mifid the revised market financial instrument directive interesting note that sbvr itself defined according the sbvr specification significantly any domainspecific terminological dictionary and related rulebook extension sbvr however sbvr doe not include behavioural rule such sbvr simply terminological dictionary that defines what sbvr including constituent concept such what behavioural rule are and how specify them according the sbvr specification terminological dictionary and associated rulebook should complete and consistent each noun concept should defined explicitly adopted from authoritative source alternatively may acknowledged implicitly understood that the everyday natural language meaning the term only defined noun concept may play constituent role verb concept rule should built from defined verb concept only and articulated using defined set structure element such obligation necessity then that least and sbvr doe not have normative syntax any syntax that adequate expressive power acceptable sbvr specified sbvr structured english simplified version natural english sbvrse probably the most widely used syntax for domainspecific sbvr model thus the conceptual model separated from the external representation and any suitable simplified natural language may used other dimension the application our dsr knowledge base and the movement through the rigour cycle are integrated into the following section which describe phase and phase our dsr study iterating though the design cycle phase methodology and guideline january when the first phase the present study commenced the team legal researcher began their training the semantics business vocabulary and rule sbvr specification from the object management group omg this culminated day workshop provided two the chief author the omg specification february they subsequently collaborated with the team the design the first poc for antimoney laundering regulation drawn from the bank secrecy act and associated federal register final rule the then objective expressing regulation thus transform them into business natural language such that nonlawyers from the financial industry could read and understand the rule provide audit trail for the formation organizational governance policy enable software knowledge engineer transform from sbvr owl vocabulary and other formalism without encountering translation problem and contribute the development the edm council financial industry business ontology fibo from this experience which emerged the regulatory interpretation methodology now described figure iterative design cycle phase regulatory interpretation methodology and guideline the focus the initial transition which this case the antimoney laundering aml regulation title the code federal regulation cfr chapter the latter over word source text before following external reference related text the united state code usc the cfr annual codification federal register final rule generally federal register final rule are selfcontained thus final rule add amends section the cfr related one more regulated domain for example aml subdomains such money service business report foreign financial account etc beginning with such foundational text present legal smes with the opportunity limit the scope the knowledge representation using sbvr that the creation regulatory natural language this commences with the identification key section the legal regulatory text figure present high level view the iterative design process which led the development the methodology guideline and technical specification which use create our regulatory natural language significantly also underpinned the design our dsr artefact ganesha now describe the iterative design process that underpinned the development our sbvrbased methodology and guideline for legal and financial smes help them identify interpret stylise disambiguate clarify the meaning regulation and how then represented regulatory natural language expressed the form sbvrcompliant vocabulary and rule the sbvr specification enables such smes structure natural text around concept specified the sbvr metamodel which may then expressed xml grammar xmlschema however the sbvr metamodel just that may have illustrated modified represent domainspecific knowledge previously indicated the two main category concept the sbvr metamodel are noun concept and verb concept noun concept are group entity the regulatory business domain discourse for example regulator financial institution etc individual noun concept are particular type noun concept representing actual entity individual for example security and exchange commission regulator regulationw regulation well fargo bank regulated entity and verb concept fact type capture the relationship between noun concept for example the verb concept money service business submits suspicious activity capture the submission relationship between the noun concept money service business and suspicious activity report typically sbvr knowledge base semantics repository two part vocabulary and rulebook sbvr vocabulary terminological dictionary where entry are termed noun concept while relationship are captured using verb concept also contains definitional rule which act constrain these relationship using alethic modality modifier such that necessary that etc and related advice possibility sbvr rulebook set guidance statement containing behavioural rule the form deontic modality obligatory that must etc and advice permission compliant sbvr instance should complete and consistent this determined three basic principle noun concept should explicitly defined from the text from other authoritative source recognized implicitlyunderstood the smes previously defined noun concept are used construct verb concept while verb concept are the basic ingredient definitional rule and behavioural rule must noted that sbvr doe not have normative syntax however the omg specification includes sbvr structured english sbvrse which relaxed convention based natural language sbvrse text style visually identify element from the sbvr metamodel the following example adopt typical style express example sbvr for monochrome publication with software programming tool and integrated development environment metamodel element are stylised using different colour and italic the basic approach noun concept are underlined with single line individual noun concept are doubled underlined the verb part speech verb concept italicbold font face keywords are bold font face and they are usually the natural language representation logical operator logical quantifier modal operator and selected article and determiner applying the sbvr metamodel provides legal andor financial smes with the ability apply their experiential and technical knowledge transform complex legal rule into human and ultimately machine readable vocabulary hence reading the text legal smes focus identifying modality that the obligation prohibition etc specified referenced the text following this propose the following activity the stylizing activity consists indicating which element the sbvr metamodel term set term corresponds while undertaking linguistic analysis the text this achieved applying the appropriate sbvrse font style entity noun concept and verb concept the disambiguation activity consists consolidating and identifying the explicit meaning the text and the clarification activity which identifies the implicit meaning the text order formulate guidance when the regulatory intent not clear subsequent each disambiguation activity each these activity demand legal experiential and technical knowledge the methodology and guideline aid these activity use case based mifid order validate the extended sbvr metamodel legal researcher conducted short experiment transforming legal text into rnl following the process set out the methodology and guideline ensure applicability across different financial regulatory domain decision taken move away from the antimoney laundering domain which informed the original development the methodology and guideline the researcher were directed towards mifid tier bank and leading international legal firm due impending enactment that will have direct effect all international financial entity trading into and within the the test involved two legal researcher working independently the transformation from the regulatory text the metamodel and one knowledge engineer using the metamodel build the xmlenriched version the law the end the test the two resulting transformation were compared measure the consistency the output figure excerpt section from relevant mifir article the preliminary phase implemented identifying the theme contained within the mifid domain any legal regulatory text concerned with mifid these theme were then assigned the article mifid and mifir the identification theme the regulatory text allows for more dynamic machine assisted knowledge exploration and retrieval while the assignment theme not hard task itself the consistency the resulting classification primary importance towards effective highlevel generic and jurisdictionally independent categorization applicable across entire domain the resulting classification were different yet consistent with each other allow common assignment article within the identified theme with the only issue coming the fore when choosing the legal perspective adopt for the classification legal subject involved regulated activity the addressee the law after choosing the section transform the legal researcher proceeded stylise disambiguate and clarify the regulatory text performing the following activity divide the section into segment rewrite segment plain english producing selfcontained sentence and fleshing out reference external document other part the same document identify the modality the rule obligationprohibitionpermission identify and define term and relation between term the resulting transformation carried out each the legal researcher differed number rule and vocabulary yet this not weakness the methodology the guideline prof fact that they allow for different approach not constraining the legal expert into limited language here example rule resulting from the transformation regulatory text article mifir see figure for the original text fragment each the noun concept and verb concept the rule are described the vocabulary part the sbvrcompliant rnl transformation for example this the entry for market operator

our nascent sbvrbased semantic repository and the xml version the repository written the knowledge engineer such mostly manual process confirmed positively timeconsuming and highly complex being difficult for the legal expert keep track the many implicit link established between the rule and the vocabulary entry further underlining the need for specific tool assisting the legal expert the transformation the artefact produced using antimoney laundering legislation and mifid and associated regulation mifir contribute towards this goal helping software engineering researcher design dsr which explained the following section ganesha phase dsr artefact given the scale regulation and rule being produced globally realised that word template and hypertext link would not scale the task thus once funding had been approved and allocated software engineer were recruited with aggressive month schedule deliverable the initial stage phase had newly appointed principal investigator collaborate with the research fellow postdoctoral researcher and legal researcher undertake the initial iteration using agile software development approach one the software engineer from india brainstorming the design and purpose the proposed artefact christened ganesha the god wisdom knowledge and new beginning the first task the design the dsr artefact design and develop xml schema tag the sbvr metamodel this not insignificant task now outlined figure illustrates the form and function the ganesha application legal document pdf xml text are imported into ganesha legal subject matter expert these are then presented for interpretation and the iterative process stylising disambiguating and clarifying begin the system will highlight candidate term both noun concept and verb concept they have already been defined where multiple definition from different jurisdiction are present the knowledge base the sme will select the most relevant ganesha will however maintain and present link alternative definition and the source text all action the sme will recorded the form metadata this will permit versioning and document management thus the sme will enabled create regulatory vocabulary the form noun and verb concept these will then form the building block the rule which will drafted interactively smes ganesha sbvr logic layer will enforce compliance with the sbvr standard extended this study straightforward this sound the devil detail hidden the complexity the underlying sbvrbased xml schema presented the following subsection figure ganesha form and function what the legal sme

transformation are possible and viceversa thus linking and integration with industry standard vocabulary and taxonomy are possible this end intended exploit such link enrich and widen the scope the vocabulary likewise have investigated the behest international consulting firm the possibility capturing the semantics and rule international financial reporting standard ifrs financial instrument ifrs and linking the ifrs taxonomy our scoping research indicated that this possible indeed having both regulatory and standardsbased which have regulatory dimension compliance imperative single knowledge base feedback from industry indicates that this immensely attractive and valuable proposition for reason will presently adduced use case for ganesha have been provided toptier bank international legal firm focusing the financial industry and fintech company illustrative small example from our mifid proof concept presented section while have articulated the roll royce solution above the current need bank and financial institution are much more fundamental there are currently solution available the market that enable legal and financial subject matter expert capture store and transfershare knowledge regulatory compliance imperative according international standard and map these onto business vocabulary and rule enhance governance risk management and regulatory compliance indeed our experience and that regulator that financial institution are deficient the basic capability capturing business vocabulary and rule thus ganesha provides the capability present legal financial smes disambiguated and clarified vocabulary and rule regulatory natural language that complete logical and free legalese complexity and ambiguity our methodology and guideline have proven that this possible ganesha provides the functionality automate and informate this addition while legal opinion guidance regulatory compliance typically presented word pdf format such document can not queried meaningful way likewise grc vendor typically use sqlbased repository which not support querying unstructured data such text xquery xml database such berkeley what sql relational database such oracle xquery expression can query many xml document simultaneously and return more valuable information with greater precision and granularity than mere word search sql query mccreary kelly the sophisticated tagging regulatory natural language sbvrcompliant xml document ganesha provides powerful capability extract transform and load regulatory compliance information into user interface for the purpose knowledge sharing training inexperienced personnel both the desktop and webbased see below version all vocabulary and rule element with presented hypertext link rendering them highly navigable with the ability explore drill down and follow link related content and including the original source regulation and rule and their chapter article section and paragraph furthermore our intention add functionality transform from sbvrxml owl provides the ability for semantic query and inferencing the knowledge base enroute this will the provision graphing functionality for visualisation thus vocabulary and rule will mapped and multiple relationship highly visible another use case harks back the original reason for the institution sbvr the omg help solve both the vocabulary and translation problem identified earlier with one notable exception tool support for sbvr absent from the omg catalogue hence one the use case identified toptier bank have domain specific sbvrcompliant tool enable software engineer understand better the business and regulatory vocabulary and rule such that they can embedded application and database similarly governance can enabled identifying such the above paragraph mifid the mandated information provision functionality investment banking system thus such system can help address operational risk where concerned foundational sbvrbased xml schema this section therefore begin introducing and explaining the xml schema that underpins the architecture the dsr artefact codenamed ganesha the schema provides detail about regulatory document structure element and attribute design guide and conceptual assumption that were made the development the schema are discussed well overview the xml document using this schema the objective this phase the dsr project design solution that capture regulatory compliance vocabulary and rule design application help create semantics repository the domain regulatory compliance based the semantics business vocabulary and rule sbvr specification the schema used foundational model for ganesha this model based sbvr and utilised generate sbvrcompliant xml document store sbvr structure natural text around concept from the sbvr metamodel which expressed xml grammar xmlschema indicated sbvrcompliant microsoft word template were used legal smes create rnl representation regulatory rule however among other thing word document are not machine readable and not possible directly validate the correctness knowledge representation the design ganesha xml schema make easier enforce content structure and validate the correctness data the xml schema describes the data facet restriction data and data pattern data format and ensures mutual understanding the content between legal sme and software engineer based this schema sbvrbased xml document can generated stored xmlbased document store and subsequently queried identify specific information about regulation and rule the best our knowledge this the first xml schema the domain regulatory compliance based the sbvrxml schema the schema follows the sbvr model that structure text around vocabulary and rulebook extended this with metamodel capture the rule noun concept verb concept and metadata the regulatory compliance domain figure jaxb architecture the xsd xml schema definition for regulatory compliance three main element rulebook vocabulary noun concept and verb concept metadata and other data element this schema play key role the architecture the design science research artefact which next described artefact detailed design the design the artefact the following challenge had met the xml schema contains rich set connected concept and extends the standard sbvr schema this give comprehensive base for modelling regulatory concept but challenging from software engineering point view term complexity addition the xml schema much richer model than that possible with uml class diagram entityrelationship model and this reflected the code support the model given the novelty the approach and the demand for usable artefact within aggressive timeframe the architecture the system would need flexible and designed for possible change requirement this end decided that the best way leverage the richness the xml schema use java architecture for xml binding jaxb reflect the xml schema comprehensive java model this using the domain model software design pattern see figure any change the xml schema can then reflected with ease the java model the jaxb technology generates set tagged java class which can persisted xml and marshalled back from xml file database with minimum effort figure iterative artefact detailed architectural design cater for the constraint outlined above the software being constructed three phase desktop database enabled and web enabled ganesha version figure illustrates approach artefact design that both iterative and incremental the following figure illustrates the incremental evolution ganesha from the desktop version databaseenabled version multitier web version deployed saas during the technical design the artefact based established architecture and design pattern knoernschild mccreary kelly the desktop version designed full featured order transition through the relevance cycle and maximise the fit with enduser need capturing enduser requirement the database version ensured the application would scale enterpriselevel requirement finally the webbased version originally designed softwareasaservice multiinstance application while multitenancy version the planning stage conclusion this design research study make several valuable contribution research and practice pragmatic practitioneroriented approach present approach that applies the philosophy formal firstorder deontic and alethic logic and metamodel the sbvr standard order underpin rigour this further enhanced the researcher direct engagement with the standard creator the object management group the team network research relationship with leading academic researcher the area legal informatics also place check the rigour cycle activity industry that seeking increasingly standardise both process and product including creating common language bennett looking theoreticallyinformed standard inform rigour also make the output such more relevant engaging with the broader community practitioner through membership and engagement with industry association such the financial industry enterprise data management council also enhanced the relevance the study that the researcher team were regularly engaging with tier and tier retail and investment bank also specific research engagement had the research team work with fintech company this approach ensured that the design cycle tightly coupled with both rigour and relevance cycle there natural movement into and between rigour and design and design and relevance cycle while the broader engagement with practitioner were important the specific engagement with and feedback from one toptier bank international legal firm and the legal informatics research community the and europe that shaped the output the first phase which produced design artefact such the regulatory interpretation methodology and guideline must noted that the methodology and guideline were designed iterative fashion and applied across jurisdiction and europe and problem domain aml mifid and ifrs the second phase the solution ganesha also iteratively developed again standardsbased design pattern and architecture were adopted however innovation and contribution the design artefact the translation the methodology and guideline into the sbvr logic layer and the design the complex sbvrxml data schema here the design the application informed the use case outlined the previous section thus ensuring relevance the design also factored the need scale the application and deliver softwareasaservice thus global regulatory environment where for example domestic regulation are now international scope brummer such ganesha can used create common understanding regulatory rule from london new york across the same financial institution
