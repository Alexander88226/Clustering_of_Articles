point perception fierstein however islamic automobile basically replicating the conventional framework the area consumer behaviour according trocchia beatty the most basic thing are consumer behavior rosenbaum and belk individual often associate themselves with the thing they have but there are other view berry and maricle durgee and oconnor that question why consumer are increasingly choosing use item without owning them where they can use item that are usually rented and leased user including apartment and car fact there were independent store the united state and had grown over however still limited the model decision related economic cost and the interest financing the lease therefore there are four main motif related automotive rental financing versus purchasing decision firstly desire diversify the need and ramli research colloquium vol will the are come riba interest agreement promotion conventional satisfaction shariah compliant the person can use secondly get easy maintenance then thirdly satisfaction and lastly upgrading term the choice slab model keeping the monthly payment low the motivational discussion the concept use without ownership supported decision factor such car depreciation interest rate cash flow estimate capital cost and tax rate even shorter rental motivating factor allows manufacturer and retailer better understand why large percentage the market chooses rent rather than buy rental auto and way obtain vehicle for those shortcoming money than borrowing money with aggressive promotion information expectation behavior ownd car the car comfortable stylish and fun drive however the concept hire purchase islam differs from conventional according journal ijarah rent arabic known rah resembling lease rent purchase banking system promise the profit legally while avoiding usury financial transaction the objective transaction are known maqasid shariah for the islamic rental concept must comply the requirement the three category need and luxury imam ghazali categorizes his while objective into main category religious objective and worldly goal dunyaw general maqasid classified basic divided into five type that protect religion soul intellect lineage and property already mentioned the contract condition specific the contract may have separate objective but not against the general objective shariah the contract ijarah the benefit and the duration the contract period had determined precisely this show that the main objective the contract jar access the asset even not have client will enjoys the use asset within the expected time frame thus the contract the distribution wealth the market economy set forth the quran hashr with the concept shariah maqasid ijarah then can manage risk better that the risk uncertainty gharar usury riban and ignorance jahalah however there are challenge implementing these instrument based history the ijarah thummal bay lease contract that expires with the sale known aitab and ijara muntahiyah tamlik lease ending ownership the difference between the two that the former case the title the asset transferred the taxpayer the end the contract the sale agreement whereas the latter the transfer made gift gradual transfer throughout the lease contract but the islamic hire the objective financing model the benefit rah fulfills and the need basic two are the for risk bear liability and giver rent should responsibility responsible purchase contract malaysia under the jurisdiction several government organ such the ministry domestic trade and consumerism which exclusively control over higher purchasing effort and the ministry transport which administers the levy vehicle and road tax lack governance major problem for aitab then there syariah legal framework under the hire purchase act the issue ownership the bank the owner the asset the aitab instrument should take the the asset however practice bank try avoid all kind liability even they claim the owner the asset for example according the principle ijarah the the cost associated with these asset the cost insurance but current practice malaysia show the cost car that renter are insurance this measure legally supported section hire purchase act which clearly state that the vehicle owner bank liable bear the cost insurance for the first year under the name the lessee and section the same enactment explaining the responsibility the taxpayer bear the cost insurance for the next two year and the following year and this violation the maqasid therefore the malaysian government must take proactive step address the legal barrier towords implementation aitab this can done whether there draft muamalah law adding some law amendment act this mean that the syariah court should given greater jurisdiction similarly the bank should adopt the risksharing method providing aitab financial service customer therefore they will have bear the cost maintenance due the leased asset islamic finance and technology framework purchase shariah hire the development through maqasid like key role peer driver competitiveness immediate solution recommended that islamic bank with high level awareness shariah maqasid able take advantage
