principle little stream make great river and introducing appropriate technological solution the uniqueness the market well reflected the fact that the role the buyer and the seller are determined the basis perspective while the platform represents the supply side the project owner and the simple usersmall investor are also part demand contrast with the service offered the traditional banking system the driving force behind the propagation crowdfunding primarily from userinvestor perspective can summed follows drew hendricks tthe transaction convenient and easily accessible for player both

solution banking product are accessible business with minimal collateral background banking activity typically becomes sluggish the time financial crisis such period crowdfunding becomes primary fundraising opportunity daniel blaseg michael koetter the following section present the four basic crowdfunding model known today according their spreading over time mollick the patronage model where the community support various charitable initiative and expects direct return perhaps the least interesting form from economic perspective this essence simple donation individual group some part the world requires help and the community come their assistance patronising them along humanitarian principle perhaps the most wellknown manifestation this model the supporting typically agricultural initiative that facilitate the daytoday sustenance impoverished people the third worldin the lending peertopeer lending model private individual lend money based certain principle others for specific interest who then repay the loan according preagreed schedule given the fact that these business transaction collateral not adequately elaborated the patronage nature frequently apparent deviating from the philanthropic model the target audience these platform not the developing world but primarily western civilisation where user often borrow buy vehicle hobby tool the service mostly considered replacement product credit card smaller personal bank loan contrast with conventional banking operation the benefit internet lending can summed follows alistair milne paul parboteeah tthe lender able generate higher yield with lower fee than for example investing money bank deposit tcredit assessment often more lenient which mean that people considered insolvent from banking perspective also have access fund tsocial valuecreation potentially realised during transaction while the process also personal element ttechnological innovation improves the quality and speed administration resulting more convenient service for both the lender and the beneficiarythe third model rewardbased crowdfunding the most prevalent form crowdfunding today with truly impressive and easytocommunicate project having been implemented result these initiative this approach funders receive tangible intangible reward for backing project they are often referred early customer prebuyers they purchase the given product before they are actually marketed the prototype phase thereby supporting product development and market introduction based this logic multitude online development invention computer game technological innovation and culturalartistic creation have found million supporter through the mediation the revolutionary public finance quarterly kickstarter website venture capital firm have the most fear from the continuing progress these platform but the market lowamount coveragebased corporate loan product could also take hit beyond the fact that the project owner doe not have release business share launch operation another great competitive advantage the model contrast conventional banking product that financing typically realised confidential and not coverage basis one the most important collateral instrument such platform publicitythe efficiency the model well reflected the fact that research found successful fundraising campaign will very likely lead further investment the case usd campaign the probability the target company receiving another capital injection when reach the marginal efficiency level other word from that point onwards each additional dollar attracts new investor smaller rate addition successful campaign can generate considerable publicity and the stakeholder are very likely find committed employee conclude beneficial business agreement and establish stable clientele venkat kuppuswammy kathy roth the traditional capital investment model differs from the aforementioned three arrangement that based strictly business foundation the interest investor are properly represented and the yield expected vary depending the risk the given projectundertaking the founder acquires capital while the investor receive their stake well related voting right the project owner offer investor certain percentage future revenue talk about royaltybased model these model require higher level expertise well appropriate statutory regulation the only accredited investor can take part ipo initial private offer study ings private individual such issue are riskier but promise higher return the loosening this barrier amongst other thing that the job act meant accomplish the which reducing bureaucratic obstacle considerably expands the fundraising opportunity startup business and also make the route public listing simpler this model could bring restructuring primarily the market larger corporate loan and bond addition private equity investment fund operating with considerably lower yield expectation compared venture capital firm will also gain new competitorscriticism traditional modelsgiven that certain crowdfunding website can look back ten year operation considerable operationrelated experience been amassed this topic the business model been criticised numerous occasion both academic and professional circle the issue that perhaps impact the greatest number stakeholder the protection funder interest very few industry opinion leader are truly aware that respect the operation crowdfunding platform the funder least important player the project owner the website unable guarantee that the donor money will safe place that the beneficiary can only use the fund for the predefined purpose sustainability thrown into doubt study published examined kickstarter project that succeeded reaching their funding goal interestingly the project had clearly identifiable outcome before the date selected the researcher the closed and assessable project launch there were initiative that turned out fraud other word the project owner disappeared public finance quarterly study failed account for the fund raised mollick based the report released kickstarter itself the number registered fraud fraudulent attempt negligible which impressive for semi notforprofit initiative although doe raise number question when compared bankon related note than one third the project featured the aforementioned study were completed time other word product manufacturing did not start the undertaken deadline clear that despite project ownersentrepreneurs taking their commitment very seriously professional and organisational problem are frequently encountered during implementation many feel that the success given product launch depends more presentational ability and luck than actual entrepreneurial and industryspecific knowhow founder not through the usual entrepreneurial creative and preparatory process the fund more fall into their lap after wellexecuted video presentation but afterwards many them fail manageaccount for the money received deviating from this logical analogy the opinion which state that the launching project the power generate demand and such many are systematically using these site marketing tool the first step introducing new professional serviceproduct the market the case classic equity investment one the most important characteristic the funder that addition the necessary fund also provides social and knowledge capital their partner due the high number investor involved crowdfunding establishing intimate relationship practically impossible and this type cooperation decidedly impersonalanother interesting observation that traditional model the minimum amount own fund risked the beneficiary can not regulated and therefore idea creator project launcher primarily use the fund others and risk nothing but their own time another justified criticism about the operation traditional crowdfunding site that due unlimited publicity project offering confidential businesstechnology solution are wary raising fund online caldbeck the same time facebook twitter and other popular social medium site can make any given campaign lose credibility tabloidinfected fundraising might scare off serious investor planning for the longterm finally perhaps the most severe criticism traditional model that crowdfunding become trendy and the realisation idea generated the truckload not shaped realistic demand and supply the segment showing sign the emergence dangerous financial bubble allowing people invest into project without expertise thereby giving financial support others without merit dupree moreover those familiar with the system are able manipulate certain campaign for profit and company with multiple successful campaign launch under their belt are able accelerate process through welltimed capital injection from their own fund thereby bolstering the viral proliferation project through consciously generated false popularitythe equitybased crowdfunding modelin response the critical observation detailed the previous section based the crowdfunding report published annually massolution the four general platform equitybased crowdfunding site have the highest rate growth

thanks community valuecreation innumerable realisation and concept were integrated into the various project last but not least player that previously did not have the opportunity can also invest startup business almerico equitybased crowdfunding differs from the three basic model several respect most case the site guarantee some sort project screening preliminary revision this followed the capital allocation process based the all nothing principle where the venture either raise the target amount within specific funding window the project not realised with the site involvement and the money returned investor this followed the investmentimplementation period where optimal situation owner are provided information throughout the process resulting interactive communication sort the process concluded the operating period where ownership restructured the company headed professional management and profitgenerating corporate operation realised from single idea collins pierrakis the representation investor interest the above model can realised number way optimal case they can influence the company operation virtual general meeting and get involved the operation fullfledged shareholder should noted that one the exceedingly rare version the equitybased model the royaltybased crowdfunding model where investor acquire royalty interest the intel study lectual property the company thereby becoming stakeholder the given project with different perspective and with different interest world bank the study prepared the european union admits that the volume crowdfunding low for the time being but the same time the sector considerable potential respect growth and job creation impacting the sme sector startup and unlisted small business the analysis also touch potential risk and note that their regulation the responsibility the country concerned european commission these risk may include the following tinvestors losing part all their capital not getting the return

successful campaign launch requires immense effort and high rate equity investment from project owner well the number those making the attempt limited enik piti the situation not ideal the investor side either mainly because the disposable income enlightened hungarian internet user mere fraction the income their western counterpart addition hungary still lacking entrepreneurialfriendly environment and young people are not all motivated turn their idea into reality based article published bak the reason for the limited popularity crowdfunding hungary can summed follows bak tthe market too small and the number project owner and investorsdonors limited tthe financial literacy and education hungarian low there are still very few people managing their finance online tthe
