leader bank will evaluate the retailer andthe manufacturer nancing condition initial capitalbankruptcy risk and procurementproduction quantity and make optimal decision announce the interest raterr and respectively then response the bankthe subleader manufacturer will simultaneously update hisdecision and decide how much charge the buyer for thewholesale price acting the follower the retailer decides how much order according bank interest raterr and manufacture wholesale price pursue the resultof the stackelberg equilibrium retailer and manufacturerselect bestreply policy denoted and the
