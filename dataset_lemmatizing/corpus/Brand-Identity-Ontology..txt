paramount importance for ganizations today due the advancement technology faster innovation growing competition and more demanding consumer managing brand becoming more and more complex entrepreneur startup and smes need have clear branding strategy narrative that defines the company vision inspires employee and others and remains relevant through change this hard since the branding concept been researched from many different perspective which make foggy this paper aim present ontology that uncovers the key concept startup and sme brand identity order not only bring some semantical clarity the topic but also lay the foundation for the development codesign tool collaboratively inquire brand identity startup and smes keywords brand modeling brand identity startup sme introduction brand identity paramount importance for organization today due the advancement technology faster innovation growing competition and more demanding consumer managing brand becoming more and more complex brand identity strategy aim guiding brand decision guarantee the coherence marketing strategy over time and should associated with specific and limited core value that are complementary organizational value and culture through the development specific brand identity that company make brand unique and conveys distinctiveness the creation welldefined brand identity during company infancy help manage strategic direction and the value creates for stakeholder startup and smes need attract attention from both internal and external stakeholder order successful they need communicate their purpose and identity order sell their potential investor and customer well communicate consistently social medium however often sme ownermanagers seem think that branding out their reach adding that fetscherin and usunier state that the concept brand still unclear and could benefit from conceptual model because brand identity illdefined problem codesign tool would help practitioner better frame the problem and allow them collaboratively prototype potential solution nonetheless our knowledge and according sme the domain energy switzerland and fintech startup based switzerland and mexico who both tried rethink their brand identity strategy real issue and date there existing tool that proven useful for that moreover been demonstrated that startup and smes have far put little emphasis branding this paper contribution are twofold first present state the current brand identity ontology and second lay the foundation for the development visual inquiry tool for entrepreneur codesign their brand identity this ontology implemented formal language could also used company for supporting their information system for managing their brand identity the remainder the paper organized follows section describe the component the ontology present the current state that ontology section section discus these result and present future work section brand identity systematic literature review slr conducted order uncover the different component captured and useful for the brand identity ontology total paper were found the topic corporate brand identity the different source looked google scholar emerald fulltext jstor isi web knowledge and springer link then some inclusion and exclusion criterion were applied keep only the paper written english that were relevant define the brand identity concept ended with total paper which led concept seen relevant among these concept some were sharing same meaning but with different semantics and others were not applicable for startup and smes brand identity strategy thus kept only nine element which seemed summarize all the necessary concept brand identity applied startup and smes when trying apply the concept corporate brand identity startup and smes one look the main difference between brand identity for large organization and smaller organization according spence and hamzaoui the main difference are the following the brand identity concept come from visionary management whereas come from visionary individual the entrepreneur systematic process based extensive market research order fill gap the market place whereas intuitive process based the entrepreneur personality and value for the strategy multiple strategy are used with the aim maximizing market coverage and overlap usually part the overall brand strategy development the number strategy limited collaborative strategy well corporate branding are generally not used all these finding show that the concept brand identity been looked from wide range discipline marketing organizational behavior strategy and communication which explains the semantic confusion around this concept the brand identity concept includes set component that determine brand way being thinking and behaving defines the purpose and meaning brand and the direction should follow for marketing scholar one the main concept corporate branding identification for instance aaker and melewar have defined the communication the unique feature product service customer which turn differentiates the brand from competitor from strategic perspective seen key activity that requires managed which constructed different activity organizational behavior scholar tend look brand identity understand the relation between internal and external stakeholder organization but different discipline author seem agree that the brand era shifted from relationshipfocus era where only external and internal customer were taken into account stakeholderfocus era where all stakeholder are considered method this project relies design science research methodology which widely accepted information system for designing innovative artefact this approach particularly suit this project because allows both support the design phase and the evaluation phase the different artefact that are developed particular hevner state that knowledge and understanding problem domain and solution are achieved the building and application the designed artifact because the aim this project better understand the problem brand identity startup and smes and build new artefact solve this seems like the appropriate approach conceptual model from the literature review and following classical ontology engineering methodology formalization brand identity ontology developed the ontology follows the modelling principle the previous section and try close the literature possible the objective develop ontology flexible enough accommodate all the existing theory from all the different field research like the one presented the section the first step been formalize the brand identity model started the model looking brand identity from strategical viewpoint hatch and schultz propose that vision image and culture are the main concept that need aligned they explain that organizational identity ongoing process that behaves like conversation between the organization self the culture and the image held the key stakeholder that sense they are the first author and our knowledge the only one look identity dynamic process constructed from interrelation between different concept started from these three element and tried look all the component found the literature with that lens thus looked all the other element relation with these three main element two main different part interface can identified the model they differentiate between the internal and external part company fig emergent brand identity relationship based the slr vision internal element organization that will drive the positioning organization brand the organization long term purpose reason existence vision and philosophy describes the starting point from where all the activity the organization are initiated will also generate certain culture culture collective way thinking collective feeling among internal stakeholder this feeling result from value culture strength and future direction for instance differentiator from competitor culture highly influenced the value which are the moral belief and principle the organization these value mixed with all the belief and the ideology present organization form personality this personality will highly influence the visual component all the visual element such the name symbol design website and everything that can seen that will used communicate with different stakeholder communication refers all the medium used for communicating with stakeholder which will transform these different communication that reach them into image image seen being both internal and external organization some researcher see the way they would like outsider see their organization whereas others see the way different external stakeholder actually see the organization combining both these view state that image holistic view held stakeholder internal external towards specific organization and the result sensemaking these stakeholder and communication from the organization projected picture itself also influenced daily interaction between organizational internal member and external audience relationship ufo unified foundational ontology order enrich the ontology chose take existing upper ontology into account upper ontology also called toplevel ontology allow for defining the basic entity and general category that constitute the universe and provide common reference framework and vocabulary for building new ontology foundational ontology are seen good starting point provide reference point for allowing comparison among different ontological approach they are conceptualization that contain specification domain independent concept and relation based formal principle derived from different source because want define ontology based new concept adopted the descriptive ontology for linguistic and cognitive engineering this allows better define these new concept grounding them more general category ufo unified foundational ontology created guizzardi developed provide foundation for conceptual modeling based philosophically principle well capturing the ontological distinction underlying human cognition and common sense adapted the brand identity concept because they are drawn from different domain research marketing organizational theory strategy proven useful for helping defining ontological realworld semantics for their underlying concept and providing guideline for their correct use ontouml patternbased and ontologically wellfounded version the unified modeling language uml metamodel designed compliance with the ontological distinction the unified foundational ontology ufo thus logical use ontouml when designing unified formal ontology allows attain great level expressivity while producing ontology that can easily shared through the web and thus opened third party extension the ontology presented this paper been formalized oled lightweight editor for developing evaluating and implementing domain ontology using ontouml the result shown fig fig brand identity ontology conceptualized using ufo formalized ontouml the different part the model have been modelled using the primitive provided ontouml the main building block are category the first step been model all the found concept shown fig category therefore there are category such vision culture image and for the relation among these concept the model property have been generated derived formalization characterization etc the full specification the brand identity ontology ontouml format can available upon request the previous formalization provides little semantics apart from those explicitly present the model have started this conceptualization looking the three component brand identity that need aligned order provide the company with strong coherent brand identity these three element are vision culture and image and according hatch and schultz vision the longterm vision organization the reason existence and the purpose company describes the starting point from where all the activity the organization are initiated the result company purpose and reason existence then influence the positioning which derived from value and positioning have added the subkinds the visual component and the member the member the collective stakeholder the different relation between the component have also been further specified conclusion and future work this paper present model for describing brand identity the context startup and smes the model formalized ontology that can easily computerized this concept even though lack clarity and formalism not our knowledge been looked formal way until now and according the concept lack clear definition and would benefit from conceptual model conceptualize brand identity startup and smes propose ontology based systematic literature review and the definition relevant contextual element this ontology based the ontouml standard which allows mutable expandable and reusable having taken this approach can deal with the fuzziness and complexity the topic brand identity further work includes evaluating this ontology trying apply realcase scenario see manages describe brand identity creation and management startup and smes evaluation and iteration this ontology will allow specify and refine well enrich make close possible the reality the observed phenomenon gomezperez proposes that evaluation allow for correctness and completeness ontology definition documentation and software they should thus evaluated any intermediate final definition set definition documentation and software environment almeida proposes framework that allows evaluate whether the ontology representative the domain try model the evaluation process proposed this author lie two phase prototype use and questionnaire answer the goal the prototype see application the ontology can used whereas the questionnaire aimed the concerned user ask them evaluate whether the ontology able represent what should according their knowledge and expectation plan applying both these author proposition and evaluate different intermediate version the ontology before reaching some stabilization the next step include the design visual tool corresponding the proposed and refined ontology after been evaluated designing visual artefact corresponding the logic this ontology will allow use for startup and smes following avidiji this ontology would the basis visual inquiry for entrepreneur codesign their brand identity the conceptual model would instantiated into visual tool using visualization principle this tool would allow practitioner have shared visual and shared understanding their brand identity strategy would support and guide them towards exploration and discussion about potential brand identity strategy this visual instantiation would brand identity canvas that would complement the business model canvas and the value proposition canvas would thus contribute the practical domain giving practitioner
