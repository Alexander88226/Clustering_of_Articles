need balance the tradeoff between the benefit that fintech technology may generate and potential added risk and vulnerability given the lower level financial inclusion bank competition and macrofinancial linkage subsaharan africa relative other region regulator and central bank could potentially benefit from considering fintech leapfrogging opportunity foster inclusive economic growth and development the same time these new technology and business model present new risk that would need addressed with suitable regulatory frameworkspolicy measure are needed reap the potential benefit fintech while managing associated risk first policymakers need fill the large existing infrastructure gap the region starting with electricity and internet service second there need address the

infrastructure verify identity facilitate faster and cheaper crossborder payment and protect property right however these technology may rapidly creating new type risk that are not well understood covered existing regulationsagainst this background careful consideration the potential fintech needed boost banking and financial development subsaharan africa necessary balance the tradeoff between the potential benefit that fintech generates and the added vulnerability that may created however given the low level financial inclusion and competition africa and more limited macrofinancial linkage

blockchain technology could provide more efficient alternative the traditional correspondent banking model provided the new system can still satisfy the international amlcft standard this could

all member the network and all process involving ordering settlement and payment are implemented real time currently payment system across subsaharan africa settlement process that are not operated realtime non realtime gross settlement system may involve several day fully executed thus increasing operational cost and creating operational and counterparty risk dlt could speed the settlement transaction with decentralized and automated settlement process thus reducing backoffice cost however should noted that use dlt for wholesale payment brings own specific set operational risk and some limitation scalability some central bank subsaharan africa are actively experimenting with dltbased payment system for example the south african reserve bank initiated proof concept that simulated

public procurement could also benefit from the use smart contract that are designed facilitate verify enforce contract negotiation performance with existing fiscal operation effective system would need measure protect privacy and minimize generating new method for fraud and evasion moreover the use dlt could offer tool help promote transparency and reduce corruptionif adopted widely digital currency could have profound implication for the monetary sector been argued that some digital currency and other form digital money could potentially replace traditional currency the economic literature widely cited the three economic function money medium exchange unit account and store value digital currency issued the private sector differ along many dimension and the moment struggle

transformation and implicationsthe nature the tradeoff between safetyefficiency regulation fintech evolving see box the efficiencysafety tradeoff conceptually very similar comparable tradeoff that

more difficult for regulator and policymakers determine with reasonable certainty and accuracy the benefit term economic efficiency and the additional vulnerability side effect and risk that these technology can bring society moreover inflated expectation about fintech that are part what been called the hype cycle gartner increase the difficulty for regulator provide fair assessment these tradeoff continued research needed remain date with the potential benefit and cost involved these technologiesdue pioneering effort mainstreaming mobile money subsaharan africa became early leader regulatory innovation subsaharan african country with large fintech operation can use their central bank license and regulate mobile network operator for instance the kenyan national payment system regulation mobile payment service provider are telecommunication service provider licensed under the kenya information and communication act and authorized the cbk offer payment service the common

frontier possibility curve the safetyefficiency frontier and the set point inside the frontier summarizes the possible set market structure that may attain various level safety and efficiency level subject current regulatory and technological constraint more specifically along the frontier technical efficiency achieved because certain market structure can not achieve more safety without compromising efficiency and vice versa point inside this frontier represent technical inefficiency because there exists alternative markettechnological configuration that could achieve more safety efficiency both point above and the right the frontier represent market and technological structure that are unattainable given current constraint over time regulatory change and technological progress create movement the frontier making some these point technically feasiblethis simple framework can used analyze the impact financial technology fintech broader term considering the social impact these technological innovation would expect that fintech expands the possibility frontier term efficiency and safety fintech provider expand the value chain recent technology can increase allocative efficiency reducing the cost providing financial service increasing competition and adding new service also these innovative technology can useful better monitor risk reduce operational failure provide solution emerging vulnerability such cyberattacks and antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing for instance the blockchain technology essentially distributed network

risk through regulation and supervision ensure financial stability and integrity the fintech sector evolving rapidly subsaharan africa and challenging for regulator identify measure and manage the associated risk however regulator should flexible enough not stifle innovation but the same time ensure that their objective maintain macroeconomic and financial stability and financial integrity not
