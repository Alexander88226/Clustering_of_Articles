bherein file paper for presentation the european alternative finance research conference october utrecht university the netherlands the selection based habit sme financing increasingly diverse market frankjan graaf kirsten rauwerda lex van teeffelen jamal abid draft version not quote over the past year different type financing have become available the netherlands now possible combine bank loan crowdfunding loan and risk capital moreover fintech application lower the threshold for application and reduce response time from week just day even hour fraser bhaumik and wright point out there lack knowledge the cognitive process involved selecting sme financing this paper look into the selection process financial adviser use against the backdrop the growing range funding possibility ass this process try understand dominant habit and related heuristic within our explorative study experienced and independent sme financial adviser were interviewed the question address their knowledge skill experience and choice the selection process the financing refinancing working capital and growth taking grounded theoretical approach use atlas label all answer and statement step step the finding suggest strong bias decisionmaking towards the more traditional banking product yet adviser state they are aware and familiar with other solution have also found that fintech solution are hardly used prepare financing solution front financial adviser estimate the likelihood acceptance few financial provider they know well within their personal network suggest that there behavioural approach financing the daytoday decision made financial adviser long automated selection are not fully transparent and are unable combine all type financing front financial adviser will guided habit availability confirmation and affect heuristic rather than looking for new financing solution and combination introduction this qualitative study seek produce insight into how financial adviser settle particular recommendation these insight may based academic theory but also knowledge and experience that can not traced back directly existing theory the aim gain insight into how professional this case financial adviser smalltomediumsized enterprise smes come decision financing what extent are one and another convention custom involved and how these relate conventional economic theory answer this question describe decisionmaking process and link this description recent heuristicsrelated academic insight into behaviour the process also show the possibility and the impossibility involved tracing heuristic very little known about the choice made adviser financing smes fraser financing theory offer some general insight which have been tested for the most part large company the one hand there are the neoclassical economic theory such peckingorder theory and growthcycle theory they start with the basic assumption that selection process take place the basis rational economic consideration this connection rationality mean certain economic logic accordance with which those involved choose the best economic solution solution that offer actor the highest value the lowest cost speak rational economic consideration when explicit reference made those requirement financier that are formulated economic term such solvency profitability and liquidity the word rational also used here everyday usage when reference made economic consideration this rationality discussed detail the interview have conducted with adviser and explicitly referred the interview protocol see appendix the other hand there are finance and socialpsychologyrelated behavioural theory how people come decision simon kahnemann these theory focus the limitation rationality and unconscious bias decision making this view adviser use nonrational maxim rule thumb based their knowledge and experience and behaviour are determined habit and convention that people are often not even aware nonrational thus refers particular decision for which difficult for the party concerned provide economically logical argument our analysis look whether adviser give similar answer and make choice that attest certain custom without this being particularly logical from economics standpoint for example notice one point that some adviser prefer call bank first when come financing issue regardless the type application involved this not always logical rational because for some application financier other than bank are more suitable rather habit whereas the adviser had first made economically logical assessment they might have called another party these habit are referred heuristic sociopsychological theory but also behavioural finance they are rule thumb behavioural guideline that the professional applies based knowledge and expertise they have gained combined with their own experience these decisionmaking rule are usually based certain convention and routine and often depend the organisation sector involved these heuristic lead certain dominant way doing thing heuristic are not necessarily irrational many custom are also economically logical for example because they save time are easier someone want pay for speed instead being helped inexpensively possible habit become irrational only when they have not been thought through properly such case where speed not important but decision end costing more than they should because they are taken hurry all the same order grasp decisionmaking process make use abductive methodology alvesson and ldberg which mean that analyse issue both inductively and deductively inductive that gradually process interview data into category concept through coding and themselves these concept quickly become rather meaningless what doe mean the word bank mentioned most often particular context the deductive side our study the found the use theoretical assumption saying something about people behaviour general that making number theoretical assumption beforehand can put the data context through insight about heuristic from simon among others can search deductively guided proposition and description for expected pattern our discussion will combine these two form the rest this paper structured follows first will discus existing theory will then present four proposition will then set out more detail our method working and our approach data collection will then discus the result finally will discus the theoretical and practical contribution this research well topic for future research theory sme financing and decisionmaking this section describes the current state knowledge sme financing and decisionmaking these insight are brought together number proposition first look the nature loan application smes and the role that adviser play will then discus briefly what theory say about financing including the financing smes here that will look particular peckingorder theory and lifecycle theory after that will discus decisionmaking process limited insight into sme financing there very little knowledge about how the structure sme financing come into being particular academic research been done large company that have their own treasury department they are called which coordinate company various form financing there are treasury department micro small mediumsized enterprise many entrepreneur lack financial knowledge and the company already financial department the accountant are usually primarily responsible for accounting they often lack knowledge financing van der veen van teeffelen ibrahimovics and lentz addition financial decision are complex because social behavioural and financial factor play role romano tanewski and smyrnios addition smes have greater barrier overcome gaining access financing because high information asymmetry agency risk insufficient collateral and small transaction volume artola and genre ferrando and griesshaber van der veen van teeffelen ibrahimovics and lentz and rauwerda van teeffelen and graaf the academic literature outline the aspect that are important arriving the right choice financing two theory are important here peckingorder theory and growthcycle lifecycle theory many publication combine these theory explaining the availability credit company gregory berger and udell and beck and demirguckunt peckingorder theory the most important theory that relevant sme financing peckingorder theory myers assumes that borrower have order preference when come choosing source financing first all preference given the use internally available resource followed shortterm debt and longterm debt and ultimately share capital the simple logic behind this that the use one own money the cheapest doe not cost money that interest must paid the bank money and that share are even more expensive because will keep costing part the future profit forever one refinement that emerged from peckingorder theory involves the use friend family and fool first provider venture capital company starting kumar and rao the empirical literature test peckingorder theory mean database with information from annual report corporates mediumsized enterprise which public company data are available chittenden hall and hutchinson frank and goyal mina lahr and hughes result based analysis this data support peckingorder theory this theory quite general and can applied small enterprise only very limited extent for example peckingorder theory focus three main category one own money loan and share capital while around different secondary form financing can now distinguished rauwerda van teeffelen and graaf growthcycle theory unclear both practice and theory how the different form financing interact with each other especially something change company development this respect growthcycle theory berger and udell offer number insight over and above those had from peckingorder theory this theory state that there financial growth cycle which the financial need and the financing possibility change the company grows the explanation given for these development that the company grows more information that itself more transparent becomes available this mean that younger company are more dependent insider finance supplier credit andor financing from angel this allows access venture capital and mediumterm loan followed later listed equity and longterm debt the company more experienced and the information become more transparent should noted that the anglosaxon research world the role bank smaller than europe see duffhues eli where bank loan credit predominate van der veen van teeffelen ibrahimovics and lentz and moritz block and heinz empirical research led support for important component growth cycle theory mediumsized and large enterprise gregory mac bhaird and lucey and robb and robinson smes and their adviser order understand sme financing properly there lack insight into another important link namely the adviser who help entrepreneur make financing decision the netherlands almost twothirds entrepreneur use financial adviser usually accountant van der veen what striking that the involvement financial adviser effect the chance success getting financing van der veen the reason for this are not clear there knowledge gap around the role adviser financing and what added value they bring this gap also recognised the literature sme merger and acquisition see van teeffelen and van teeffelen financial decision and heuristic there greater need understand financing decision fraser bhaumik and wright mina according fraser two other aspect are important how can financial product combined and what the impact one another combination the company performance order meet this need for smes necessary understand the financing decision financial adviser because they are the only one who can seen specialist this field are currently lacking insight into what the decisionmaking process look like behavioural science however lot research been done decisionmaking process general recently lot attention been paid the role cognition and perception and how they influence behaviour also known behavioural finance well known for example that new knowledge cognition can only made serviceable accompanied change habit and line with socioemotional need cohen lot attention been paid recent year the role heuristic rule thumb decisionmaking rule see kahnemann professional use relatively simple maxim determine what and what not possible certain situation these maxim reduce complex assessment simple rule the bestknown heuristic are order investigate the interaction among knowledge attitude and behaviour affect heuristic people are swayed something that feel good availability heuristic people opt for obvious choice confirmation heuristic people are swayed factor that seem confirm their prejudice simon koumakhov state that heuristic form individual level close interaction with the environment the institutional context within that context the organization which people are connected colour the heuristic unique way this often embodied specific instrument but also policy and even symbol and ritual heuristic are built cognitive insight emotional preference and habit cohen this mean that each person make their own decisionmaking rule especially when they have make decision that not come that often everyone will follow automated process such driving car more the same way but people buy car many different way the same applies decision taken professional such financial adviser smes complex environment professional develop rule thumb and behaviour that follows from them this study will use broad definition heuristic namely the use concept artefact form thinking the search process that known decisionmaking artefact abstraction but also story that are help coming decision play major role decisionmaking this often lead concrete document such contract management control system this definition heuristic broader than the one simon used himself talk about heuristic approach and heuristic model which mean formalised process such the field operational research also differ from kahnemann see for instance who the together with colleague narrowed the concept down number psychological categorisation related bias they not discus the possibility that the same time different story and logic can forged into single outcome within social process simon put decisionmaking determined the role outlook individual decisionmaker view the organisation and mental model reflected sector standard and society institutional value koumakhov these view converge heuristic depending the rolebased outlook someone they occupy place their environment for example the world sme adviser this place coloured the organisation for which work for example individual see himherself accountant role for company region and depending which office they are they will place certain business emphasis this see table table simon understanding routine and convention related heuristic level analysis adviser decisionmaker assumption hidden heuristic habit rolebased outlook example heuristic certain implicitly methodological way which individual deal with say product supplied the professional group context mental model organisation social and organisational identification agreement perhaps policy agreement professional group sector for instance how adviser relate their behaviour regulation there are any the business model adviser which the rolebased view individual involved and the institutional context are incorporated simon routine are linked cognitive knowledge and emotion and taken together can constitute heuristic according cohen simon wrong pull routine cognition and emotion hand head and heart apart from one another and this led the idea that given the right cognitive model the right knowledge the emotion and the routine can managed simply put this mean that decisionmakers are guided their own rolebased view good adviser doe and what they think about certain sector and about that sector society and what their organisation role bank employee who doe work similar that done account manager leasing company may have the same rolebased view and the same idea sector but will still behave differently simply because their organisation asks them proposition get insight into how financial adviser smes make decision will look into which decisionmaking rule they use their advisory process what are their view financial product given company and the advisory process what can traced back economic other knowledge this knowledge reflected economic theory and how these cognitive insight relate their attitude certain product can identify certain preference particular behaviour one adviser can spend lot time good relationship with the client while another focus mainly the right technical solution for them and what the role tooling this process the moment lot attention being paid fintech technical solution that make financial service cheaper and faster will this new technology lead different advisory process almost all these are new and open question that must therefore examined qualitatively through interview which the adviser reflect their working method see four area that determine the daily behaviour adviser their daily activity they use certain instrument whereby people they have certain knowledge and skill and certain attitude order systematically address all these theme and then able analyse them systematically interview protocol been drawn see appendix assume advance that adviser use wide range decisionmaking rule that can linked specific organisation and context also look the three wellknown heuristic mentioned earlier affect availability and confirmation heuristic order link the result our research insight into decisionmaking have drawn number proposition proposition adviser use maxim rule thumb heuristic this proposition correct there are many view and preference for certain financing instrument and these can not traced back knowledge that been set out scientific insight otherwise clear economic logic these may for example insight that say something about adviser preferred form financing prejudice about sector about behaviour presumed required the part the adviser the entrepreneur also assume that financial adviser see themselves official with specific role and particular code conduct follow this mean that there certain agreement about the instrument that the adviser put forward the entrepreneur this brings proposition proposition opinion financial instrument are divided thus assume that there kind communal opinion shared agreement what knowledge and skill what attitude what activity and what tooling are needed for the various financing instrument such bank credit and crowdfunding free market adviser should disagree their preference for one another form financing after all organisation differ their working method and each company differs from colleague and competitor here expect difference the subfields because otherwise every adviser would exactly the same positioning the proposition this way gain insight into where the difference lie and which area adviser distinguish themselves assume that the organisation they work for certain influence and this brings proposition proposition the opinion adviser financing instrument are influenced the organisation they work for addition the instrument themselves the method working can also differ and related attitude activity and tooling this brings proposition proposition the opinion adviser the right way working the right process are influenced the organisation they work for proposition and can make clear whether mainly the working method that adviser use that distinguishes organisation from one another whether adviser also have completely different knowledge offer within the dominant economic theory all financial instrument should have the same function ansari and mode application this mean that adviser who have the same level knowledge can differ and thus compete only based the working method they use analysing the data with these proposition can make clear whether this assumption correct methodology this exploratory study which work with abduction combining inductive and deductive approach financialeconomic decision are described openly possible and the extent possible irrespective theoretical assumption interview protocol been used for this see appendix then analysed the result the basis number proposition describe this process detail below through our analysis want gain insight into what the decisionmaking process adviser look like and thus make use the concept heuristic not possible inquire directly about habit and routine because people are usually only slightly aware this addition not know what the decisionmaking process for financing decision will fraser bhaumik and wright and mina therefore can not indicate advance what these habit might addition the research into heuristic done mainly experimental setting which welldefined group asked answer clearly defined question and which little research heuristic done practice loock hinnen order get clear picture habit have made distinction between consideration that attest stepbystep process through the use economic information such solvency and behaviour that guided habit and preference order trace these consideration habit and choice strict interview protocol been drawn with open neutral question the researcher used this interview protocol conduct the interview and also followed the sequence topic and question order get insight into the knowledge and skill financial adviser smes followed number step that are common qualitative analysis patton hsie and shannon the construction and codification that use follow number phase five iteration code have been designed they have then been converted into concept which have been grouped into category finally aligned with simon theory heuristic there had agreement all time between all the researcher involved group interview three group interview talked group adviser about their work adviser financial company that those that sell financial product themselves adviser who among other thing give advice financing and those who advise exclusively financing based this initial description the adviser working method followed this showed important difference among these group order arrive unequivocal group with similar decisionmaking process focused financing decided focus only adviser who mainly provide financial advice without being part company that itself provides financing this led interview with financial adviser smes these were independent adviser well adviser who had joined small well large consultancy there were three brainstorming session each with five researcher which one session with representative three independent financial consultancy firm settle advance the cluster funding topic the choice made for these four cluster the financing objective financier and financing possibility the risk associated with financing and the process moving from financing need through advice the application for financing and acceptance the financier based this initial stepbystep plan and interview protocol have been developed what the decisionmaking process adviser might look like the stepbystep plan and the interview protocol were discussed the researcher who conducted the interview this led definitive protocol four theme were discussed with the adviser namely knowledge and skill attitude activity and tooling the interview protocol can found appendix interview were conducted five researcher from utrecht university applied science hogeschool van utrecht and amsterdam university applied science hogeschool van amsterdam the same time student from rotterdam university applied science hogeschool van rotterdam also conducted interview the interview have been transcribed the end the researcher interview were used and those done the student group from rotterdam university applied science the interview are comparable the sense that all question from the protocol were systematically gone through and followup question were asked case where the answer were not clear the researcher settled the codification for the qualitative analysis the basis the four theme that were settled during the brainstorming session step namely the financing objective the financier the risk involved and the process these theme were also settled group code atlas addition three code were defined with regard heuristic affect availability and confirmation the analysis being carried out using the atlas software programme which the group code are further elaborated through the use list code the researcher first analysed three transcript these code were defined around the four theme the financing objective the financier the risk involved and the process the crosscomparison left code with unambiguous definition after this step the remaining transcript were analysed based this coding codecooccurrence analysis carried out which those connection that occurred frequently were further analysed the result this analysis were then related the proposition with the help codecooccurrence analysis investigated whether the different proposition could confirmed rejected analysis and result the interview with financial adviser financing bank the form that mentioned far and away the most frequently time see figure there strong preference for this method financing starting option then there are loan and revolvingcredit facility addition bank financing factoring and leasing are also frequently mentioned financial adviser crowdfunding frequently mentioned fourth form financing time but often point discussion and not the most popular form financing during the interview lot opinion about crowdfunding came this point difference from financing bank and from leasing and factoring which are actually chosen frequently smes and their adviser all other form financing such microcredits and funding from friend family and fool get nary mention figure the number time that financiersfinancing opportunity were mentioned during interview bank loan and overdraft facilitiescrowdfundingfactoringleasingfintechgovernment guarantee and facilitiesbussiness angelsprivate equityqreditsmicrofinancefamily and friendsinvestment companiespension fundskredietuniessubordinated loansconvertibles this context bank refers both bank loan and revolvingcredit facility category bank predominated interview look step almost always the bank for reason such just neat pricing good cetera well always start the regular bank funding loan credit think about leasing think about debtor financing factoring adviser you need explain more fully older sme client particular that there are also form financing that can serve alternative financing bank former bank adviser have short line communication with the bank and consider financing bank first bank are also far the largest provider loan capital dutch smes which eur billion outstanding with three big bank treur factoring and leasing are also widely used practice and are offered both bank and nonbanks the volume these two form financing that outstanding more than billion treur the current situation still very similar that which obtained the only difference from that the share nonbanking form finance growing significantly with estimated billion alternative financing provided smes through the end treur but remains niche market view the outstanding volume given the dominance bank topic the interview interesting look the topic under which bank are often mentioned bank financing mentioned with particular frequency combination with crowdfunding time with the information provided the entrepreneur time and with cost time bank and crowdfunding crowdfunding can used alternative form financing bank are unwilling offer financing extra financing company crowdfunding often seen workingcapital loan and fit well consumer market because the marketing tool also the form crowdfunding campaign bank nowadays usually find workingcapital financing unattractive according some adviser the current account with permanent limit used the standard solution for working capital but nowadays such account are provided hardly all not all under very strict condition working capital can financed crowdfunding according one third the adviser interviewed only one adviser belief that this not possible because crowdfunding flexible than bank financing sometimes bank also want join campaign they see that entrepreneur successful obtaining working capital financing mean crowdfunding they see the success campaign approval the company business plan this give the bank more security crowdfunding together with bank financing not only often mentioned together but practice actually occurs combination according the interviewee bank that are not interested first sometimes suggest crowdfunding for part the financing requirement order determine how enthusiastic the market they will then see this confirmation low risk and will prepared meet part the financing requirement fact this way bank would allowing the credit assessment carried out the crowdfunding market however bank are strict with regard the repayment obligation entrepreneur crowdfunding loan and sometimes set certain requirement regarding the repayment obligation addition number bank are the process setting partnership with crowdfunding party most the interviewee are not very enthusiastic about this they have the impression that bank are doing this mainly for show and that reality not whole lot going here category crowdfunding what you see more and more nowadays the bank that want remain involved the bank doe part for example with crowdfunding you see more collaboration bank with crowdfunding platform for example well what you see more and more nowadays the bank that want stay involved anyway that the bank doe some part for example with crowdfunding you see more collaboration between bank and crowdfunding platform that itself relatively obvious combination the one hand welcome this but the other not always agree with the way this done term certainty and that sort thing crowdfunding suitable only for business consumer company and entrepreneur you want caught with your pant down entrepreneur see crowdfunding something new and unknown entrepreneur need convinced some sme adviser have good feel for crowdfunding while others see expensive and timeconsuming alternative bank and information the interviewee often spoke about bank and their information requirement this element the advisory process that take lot time sme often find difficult provide all the necessary information and substantiate all plan and forecast the financial adviser play major role this part the process general bank and crowdfunding platform request the same information from smes however crowdfunding platform often more flexible brainstorming about how substantiate the turnover for instance the interviewee felt that bank did look rather lot the rearview mirror especially the case smaller smes and smaller financing requirement bank often look only the historical information company they also often want supplied standard digital format which hardly any forecast can included this type development significantly reduces the chance success for smaller loan application some bank also want information placed portal when applying for financing information that then come directly their system financial adviser see this costcutting measure which work delegated the client the client doe not enter this information into the portal the bank charge handling fee you say want have ton credit with the bank then yes that absolutely the standard approach what more even for our intermediary becomes difficult find onestop shop but that not nice you entrepreneur with nice business you doing good job and the door keep getting slammed your face like that sorry but just can anything for you hereyou have call our call centre for credit request lower than information and entrepreneur not only the combination bank and information that mentioned frequently information and entrepreneur were also mentioned very frequently combination time for all financier not only information about the company but also about the entrepreneur themselves vital importance figure the number time the risk associated with financing are mentioned during interview entrepeneurcollaterallife cycle stagesizesector according adviser the level knowledge that entrepreneur smes have varies considerably one entrepreneur doesn have the first clue often the smaller entrepreneur while another can arrange everything themselves without the help adviser there are also entrepreneur who are curious and who get actively involved new development while others not understand them very much and not really want learn about them any detail addition some entrepreneur wonder whether party they not know are fact reliable for adviser smes important discus open discussion during the orientation phase the advisory process what entrepreneur expectation and objective are and what the company situation what kind product and market the entrepreneur active and generally what needed not crucial that the adviser have the best financing make sure that the funding and the financier are good fit for the entrepreneur all partiesthis applies micro small and mediumsized enterprisesfor all party true that they want the best overview the preference business with few different party possible and preferably with party where continuity the card take crowdaboutnow for instance that requires huge effort the part the entrepreneur themselves because they have grab the bull the horn and get their network all fired and that certainly not something that every entrepreneur can pull off that easily sometimes you think might suit you but then the entrepreneur see that they themselves are not all interested doing thing that way and had entrepreneur where thought well that perfect fit for you the whole crowdfunding thing but then turned out later that well actually after quick form financing and don want have put too much effort put into getting solution crucial that the entrepreneur able choose the financing solution that best suit them the adviser can advise the client but the client who ultimately decides what they want adviser smes indicate that important that they know what type entrepreneur they are dealing with well what kind motivation vision and mission but then also what their need and preference are one entrepreneur can not stand bank while another just the opposite according adviser smes some entrepreneur often the older one find difficult publish their data and forecast crowdfunding platform they think this sensitive information from the competition standpoint addition crowdfunding campaign often cost lot time energy and money that entrepreneur must willing spend for financier important know entrepreneur age education and experience and whether they already have strong track record are just starting out any experience employee fundamentally different from being business for oneself addition information about client and competitor lender also want know how entrepreneur built their new existing business and what they have done that end perhaps they have been bit passive some adviser also take their client the financier they themselves can tell them all about their company and show their enthusiasm adviser want show that entrepreneur with smes have good understanding how business work and that they know what they are talking about these aspect the entrepreneur are reflected both financier attitude and how much the financing they offer cost entrepreneur often know what they are strong but they are often not focused their weakness successful application for financing should able show both entrepreneur strength but also how they can come grip with their company weak spot one adviser said this also important reason why some entrepreneur are unable get financing when come their business they not have all their duck lined row this adviser also said always possible get loan you entrepreneur can offer exit option and good rate return financier whether the financier bank privateequity entity some other investor request for financing that demonstrate too little pragmatism and betray too much opportunism the part entrepreneur have chance succeeding bank and cost bank have the advantage being able offer low interest rate and high volume the market this give them huge amount power when come financing smes entrepreneur and their adviser will always look bank for financing the first instance this the most inexpensive way securing funding that generally the perception the market and the interview show that most case the bank the cheapest option financing bank possible this also recommended financial adviser nevertheless still happens that bank charge relatively high rate for bank loan from and that mean that other form financing such crowdfunding are hardly possible all the cost bank charge can not separated from lack flexibility the bank part from the speed with entrepreneur want their application processed category cost the most important factor consider factoring that expensive that expensive form but you get cash immediately you immediately get liquidity bank are inexpensive and fast compared the other possibility factoring rather expensive form financing financing bank seems cheap but the risk increase the rate increase and come close the other form bank and leasing leasing reasonably straightforward and suitable for the cofinancing investment machinery and transport adviser spends relatively little time lease application leasing also easy combine with bank financing one the first option adviser will mention along with banking crowdfunding and factoring when come the wellknown financing product leasing also offered the bank themselves bank and life stage bank are keen offer financing where the business model and the entrepreneur have demonstrable track record they are looking for predictability and pattern recurring turnover they are much more cautious with startup only startup with that special something can expect financed bank startup are often better off with crowdfunding private equityventure capital possibly leasing the case machine and family friend and fool the proportion bank financing increase with the maturity the company starter are often better off with crowdfunding platform than with bank but starter with silver lining then you can use also bank deposit bank and starter that not really the logical combination anymore often use factoring especially for highgrowth business when come entrepreneur who have very flexible demand for working capital will soon look debtor financing because that change with the growth shrinkage that take place bank and criterion bank and the criterion they set for sme client were mentioned time the adviser smes who were interviewed what striking that most people say that the criterion that sme meet order obtain bank financing are constantly changing credit analyst like that the bank spends the whole day looking application behind closed door doe this guy ever get out and about refinancing often difficult because the big bank have agreed with each other not solve each other problem you have problem with one bank you won get foot the door another bank this one the most difficult thing keep with for adviser some organisation keep central record for their adviser the policy bank this respect determined from the top down and the contact person with whom financial adviser communicate must also keep this mandate may that one bank want finance sector one week and longer the next week there are also major difference among bank according the adviser this everything with basel solvency requirement and the perception risk bank are constantly aware the solvency requirement their loan portfolio for this reason adviser say bank have also become stricter their lending standard previously for example bank would say that company had sufficient capital within three year would willing finance bank are now saying that there must sufficient capital the outset cost and time the cost advice mentioned time and time mentioned time are dominant aspect the financing process only the information requested the entrepreneur mentioned more frequently time see figure figure the number time the element the advice process were mentioned during interview entrepreneural informationcoststimecriterianetworkrefusalfeasibilityskillsacquisitionsystemsmonitoringaccountants time and cost are mentioned the interviewee time combination these are important consideration for the process because the more hour adviser must charge the higher the cost the advice will clear from the interview that financial advice from adviser sme usually too expensive especially for startup and sole proprietor who want expand need some extra financial latitude that case the amount financing needed can not justify the cost the advice addition there group smes that can pay little for financial advice but not too much there group financial adviser who can provide this short time with kind hitandrun approach the adviser help the entrepreneur just once with the financing requirement and the adviser and the entrepreneur then part way smes with little more room for manoeuvre can afford moreextensive financial advice there also group adviser who focus these these adviser also take the financial structure the company into account their analysis and also look towards the future financial picture form financing that are opted for now will also have impact flexibility and the range option the future there seems this score kind dichotomy the market for financial advice the one hand there group adviser who focus smaller smes and who use hitandrun approach keep the hour they put and the cost they incur minimum the other hand there group adviser who have longerterm relationship with smes and who can assist them more extensively with advice not only their current financing need but also the financial structure and the future the company question the latter course cost more the adviser time and result steeper bill rational consideration and heuristic when analysing the codification with regard unconscious habit heuristic and their counterpart conscious consideration based rational economic argument striking that the number time interviewee refer rational consideration much greater than the number time they actually make statement that can traced back one the three accepted sociopsychological heuristic affect availability and confirmation see figure try regard every question about financing tailormade and see what can help that entrepreneur both right now and the longer term stacked financing particularly interesting for growing company network that what all about this world network ourselves like crazy this give financial adviser the impression that they are always carefully considering the dozen existing form financing from the analysis the codified form financing however appears that the adviser are talking primarily about bank loan revolving credit from bank and leasing and factoring whether from bank other entity the most frequently chosen form other form financing are sometimes mentioned but they come much frequently adviser repertoire figure the number time heuristic and rational consideration are mentioned rational considarationconfirmationavailibilityaffectrepresentation discussion financial adviser smes seem take rather similar approach they have rather similar idea what their role and what client and others expect them however distinction can made between organisation there the hitandrun way working quick advice financing with relatively few hour spent giving advice and there are organisation that provide financial advice looking the longer term too and that build relationship with the entrepreneur more hour are spent giving advice and thus higher cost are incurred than hitandrun way working the concept heuristic quite difficult put into operation the wellknown heuristic are sometimes discussed stated number time that something must feel good affect heuristic interviewee also seem opt for the obvious number place availability heuristic and would like see their prejudice confirmed confirmation heuristic short extend the concept heuristic habit and convention these are certainly present the market while this study expressly not about bank but about the use different form financing bank keep coming the fore the empirical part focused emphatically how adviser work and how they deal with various financing instrument can conclude that banking product always get the first look and that that doe not work the search continues the result also suggest that what key sme adviser not arriving the optimal financing solution but keeping their client satisfied this number consequence for the proposition with regard proposition adviser have rule appears that financial adviser have personal preference based their experience and their network based this over time they have developed certain habit and particular approach financing issue the preference the habit and the approach application for financing vary from one financial adviser the next and are more practically focused than inspired theory far proposition concerned view are divided appears that different financial adviser have different view financing tool this particularly the case with financing bank the proposition confirmed the case bank loan the basis the personal experience financial adviser there are fact many conflicting view nonbank financing this applies for example crowdfunding and factoring one sme adviser will see attractive financing instrument while another will have reservation about the cost and the risk involved and the chance success the proposition doe not hold for nonbank loan for proposition organisation that shape insight into instrument not possible substantiate based the result the present study advisor are not influenced the organisation for which they work when come the form financing chosen mutual knowledge financial instrument and possibility deliberately shared and made available and application for funding are discussed and advice sought from colleague alternatively twoeye principle used this applies every consultant however some substantiation can found for proposition organisation determine the way working adviser are clearly influenced the organisation for which they work organisation business model largely determines the approach that the financial adviser working there take one organisation focused hit and run and can deal with single financing request quickly and relatively cheaply other organisation are more focused longterm relationship and the analysis the financial structure sme and how organised this generally associated with more time and steeper cost there seems this score kind dichotomy the market for financial advice for smes the first market sector attracts smaller smes with smaller application for financing and not such deep pocket the second attracts somewhat larger and more mature smes which can also use more comprehensive advice their financial structure there are also number other point that stand out turn out that financial adviser network very important the work they seems that this rather than other consideration often determines their decision new supplier and new technology fintech not seem changing this situation doing directly even though the supply grown and the use new form financing been simplified new technology still new possibility seem simply being missed adviser find difficult get off the beaten track ignorance the product lack time study the instrument and mistrust the part their client these are some the reason that may explain this the time aspect perhaps the most prominent here the financial adviser must come good decision limited period time this can often get the way optimal choice financing option because the adviser can consider only limited number option such moment the adviser often seems have made wellconsidered choice down the beaten track they can spend only limited number hour any given case which the business case and all financial data must properly substantiated concluding remark our analysis show that there are several economically rational solution economically sound solution for the sme adviser from which they derive their income and which satisfies their client doe not have the financially best solution for the client sometimes speed more important entrepreneur may need fund quickly because for example the continuity their business risk and sometimes the adviser able spend only very few hour recommendation with the result that they can not find the most inexpensive solution these are all reasonable logical economic reason apparently economic rationality depends the context which people live here simon speaks satisficing economic actor not seek the best rational solution but look for solution that satisfies them any event simply because they can not aware all the possibility addition our analysis suggests that peckingorder theory not followed financial adviser financing bank dominant that the freeing internal capital within the company for example through leasing and factoring used much often
