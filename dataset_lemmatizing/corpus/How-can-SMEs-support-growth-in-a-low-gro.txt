growth have been performed and reviewed delmar wiklund and shepherd sadlersmith davidsson love and roper although the topic smallfirm growth received quite extensive attention several reviewer deliver with relatively critical account the criticism concern both theoretical and methodological shortcoming storey gilbert davidsson mckelvie and wiklund wright and stigliani spite the longitudinal and process nature the concept growth many growth study are crosssectional growth and entrepreneurship research there general wish for more longitudinal real time research davidsson wright and stigliani described the theory section below large number firm growth factor exist gilbert davidsson these growth factor can both internalorganisational factor and external market factor and they can act both positive driver growth and negative barrier obstacle for growth extant growth and sme literature extensively addressed how firm grow related favourable external condition and how firm not grow due unfavourable market condition barrier wright and stigliani however current empirical research firm growth adverse condition scarce and knowledge how firm may grow the mechanism and driver spite generally unfavourable external condition limited bamiatzi and kirchmaier this explorative study investigates key driver growth for smes external context characterised low growth and economic recession the study investigates how number danish smes have achieved high growth rate spite unfavourable external condition these smes are facing the specific challenge few highly specialised employee low funding opportunity for smes few large company from which attract larger group employee and educatedspecialised citizen moving highgrowth region with more possibility growth the context lowgrowth region unexplored area within sme and growth research and the finding presented here are relevant and applicable for manager smes well for policy maker and institution supporting growth and business development lowgrowth region this paper provides insight into the key facilitator growth danish smes lowgrowth area the research question this paper how can smes lowgrowth region actively support firm growth and which facilitating activity are applied answer this research question examined eleven danish smes over period month within specific region denmark characterised low growth and favourable socioeconomic situation compared growth rate and the financial situation the rest the country the next section the paper discus and elaborate the theoretical perspective firm growth and smes including internal and external growth factor after the theoretical discussion present the method applied the study then present the empirical finding and conclude with discussion the result and the implication the study firm growth and growth facilitatorsfrom the review growth study penrose gilbert garnsey davidsson senderovitz wright and stigliani clear that growth factor can make out very long laundry list factor that may facilitate hinder growth growth factor can roughly speaking divided into internal within the firm and external environmental factor even may some instance difficult determine what truly external and truly internal davidsson the industry development usually seen external factor whereas porterian world industry affiliation seen strategic choice made the firm porter similarly opportunity may viewed external factor factor out there discovered factor that the firm should create and develop internally shane and venkataraman dew danish journal management business how can smes support growth lowgrowth region internal growth factor facilitating hindering growthin her seminal work firm growth penrose argues that firm resource play key role achieving growth and competitive advantage limited resource mean limited possibility for growth through the internal resource general and management resource particular that the firm may develop unique entrepreneurial managerial service which are turn seen prerequisite firm growth and achieving competitive advantage according penrose the internal resource use key determinant firm growth internal inducement expansion arise from the existence currently unused productive service resource and specialised knowledge which according penrose are always found any firm penrose the issue management capacity been elaborated and categorised storey management motivation education management experience number founder and functional skill number study have investigated the relationship between growth aspiration and actual growth these study general find that manager with higher aspiration achieve higher actual growth this view the management the firm lay the foundation for growth wiklund and shepherd delmar and wiklund stam and wenneberg external factor facilitating hindering growthexternal factor also influence growth these factor include macroeconomic development market condition environmental dynamism access external financial capital access other external resource and network and access general human capital education level and specific human capital experience wiklund and shepherd growing venture are highly dependent the local environment for resource needed for their operation and the ability acquire resource locally substantial implication for the level growth the firm will attain the growth the individual firm also influenced the growth the industry and the economic and financial situation the country and region well the industry dynamism gilbert bamiatzi and kirschmaier general firm growth appears correlate with the general macroeconomic and regional financial trend summarising from theoretical perspective argue that achieving growth may matter management capacity growth aspiration willingness and skill but that fundamental facilitator and obstacle the environment play key role for firm growth methodology and empirical contextthe objective the paper obtain applicationoriented knowledge what creates growth smes investigating this use exploratory longitudinal multiple case study design this article based research project conducted collaboration with danish region danske regioner with aim enhance sme growth lowgrowth region the research project fall two phase the first phase identi fied growth process sme growth company the specific lowgrowth region south and western zealand denmark where randomly selected company were contacted the case company were selected based their size private smes their location close proximity the region south and western zealand positive growth record during the past year and finally case company were selected representing different industry the fourth criterion included because industrial characteristic may affect growth potential contacted case company expecting that approximately half them would accept the invitation participate interview out the case company company accepted participate the project and through site visit and individual interview with the ceo and other key personnel made extended company portrait these company the data collected during the interview session were analysed using meaning categorisation kvale and brinkman where similar statement from the interview were grouped within related theme and six key growth theme were derived through abductive process danermark going back and forth between theory and the empirical evidence company portrait and data from the interview these theme were explored further during the second phase the project which out the firm were selected for further indepth longitudinal analysis see figure the eleven firm were selected based relevance the project objective variation across different industry four productionretail five serviceknowledge service and two building construction and willingness and ability participate the indepth studieswe investigated the firm over period month where management and employee representative were interviewed explore the specific content the identified growth theme and the actual growthfacilitating activity involved the data derived from the interview session were analysed through meaning categorisation and the facilitating activity within each the six growth theme are explained detail the finding the empirical contextthe firm this study are located the southern and western part zealand the four key growth and socialeconomic challenge this region are related low productivity the region own business globally oriented industry gradually moving other region difficulty attracting and retaining highly skilled employee and finally that innovation concentrated few but very innovative company addition the region challenged the demographic development the projection the age composition hold the reduction the number people the working age predicted will significantly decrease the level prosperity and growth the region copenhagen economics danish journal management business how can smes support growth lowgrowth region finding the following section will describe the growth facilitating activity according the six growth theme and the context which the activity unfold for the respective firm figure show the case company with indication primary and secondary growth theme some growth theme were higher priority some the case company the identified

narrative illustrate how smes may work with the specific theme practice growth facilitating theme strategic thinkingwhat doe working with strategic thinking imply existing research underline that the smes approach strategy inherently different from that seen large company hofer and charan sadlersmith evald and senderovitz the management small firm usually consists single very few individual who then naturally have carry out all managerial and strategic task and responsibility one the important issue term strategic thinking how balance the tension between strategic planning and goal setting for setting target and giving the firm clear sense direction the one side and stay flexible and improvisational for being able explore and exploit the unexpected event and contingency the other side managing this balance may one the most important factor influencing smaller firm growth and competitive advantage march hitt how smes work with strategic thinking practice osteb rsen ability improvise and make quick iterative move according the change food trend and customer taste made them competitive and able achieve high growth rate however the organisation growing the management feel that too many decision are made going various direction and they need become more structured and have more formal clear strategy and work one unified direction the challenge plan ahead and remain flexible and agile this process the two owner manager have started mapping the individual functional area the company including the related action and each employee required competence and responsibility while leaving room and flexibility for each team employee make their own independent decision they thereby try maintain balance between improvisation and planninggrowth facilitating theme selfmanaged teamswhat doe the establishment selfmanaged team imply establishing selfmanaged team mean deliberately giving autonomy and formal decisionmaking power team employee without the classic direct supervision line manager giving responsibility small team employee and allowing them exercise high level selfmanagement the team should according the firm carry out key decision without management involvement and the firm thus attain higher level flexibility and efficiency the informant from all eleven case company indicated that they had been able ensure higher growth through the application selfmanaged team different function their organisation danish journal management business how can smes support growth lowgrowth region how smes work with selfmanaged team practice geocenter klint applies selfmanaged team development and innovation function this function six people with very different skill biology geology project management financial management and creative skill are put into play their collaboration specific project the growth potential the application selfmanaged hoc based team geocenter klint lie the benefit that come with the small and flexible organisational way which the eventoriented business the company are organised this allows them more efficient more flexible and have fewer fixed cost than would the case with permanent development organisation growth facilitating theme management public fundraisingwhat doe management public fundraising imply smes ability attract external funding for development project particularly from the public sector way overcome the regional resource scarceness within the private sector public funding can help the smes obtain growth financing and supporting firmb ased development project serving cultural leisureoriented purpose some the company have experienced declining sale recent year however with effective project management targeted towards public project fund the company have been able develop and grow strategically into other business and industry order obtain adequate public fund important duly prepare project description which includes integrating administrative public procedure and obtaining publicprivatecollaboration experience with new technology and important develop personal relation local regional national for project collaboration and fundraising how smes manage public fundraising practice kragerup god developed and created growth through investment project experience centre offering gohigh activity area and they have developed integrated course programme owing publically funded investment project kragerup god been able develop and attract new business and reach new target group which improved their competitive advantage and corporate branding comparison other traditional conference centresgrowth facilitation theme open source innovationwhat doe working with open source innovation imply open source innovation focus the interaction between producer and user innovation and employeedriven innovation focused innovation initiated and facilitated staff these two innovation approach conceptualise company process interactive learning the micro level lundvall both research and practice show that both formal and informal approach these innovation process may taken smith ulhoj kersting the present case active and continuous dialogue with customer detect their need key growthfacilitating activity that generates new solution the customer indeed the key driver the innovation process providing input for tailored service and product suit the specific need customer whenever possible this approach give smaller firm potentially competitive advantage compared with larger company with more formalised process that lend themselves readily such flexibilityhow smes work with opening the innovation process practice vilcon experiencing growth dilemma the owner key driver the business innovation process but may become bottleneck hampering the company continued innovation and growth the solution for vilcon been create open and forthcoming culture where idea can come from anyone inside outside the organisation and once matured the idea may integrated quickly and efficiently owing the firm flat and teamoriented structure which promotes the implementation userproducer and employeedriven innovation vilcon customer need and request and customer interaction with the employee often initiate idea for new product servicesgrowth facilitating theme middlesourcingwhat doe working with middlesourcing imply middlesourcing occurs when similar productionoperations are taking place simultaneously two more different but collaborating company middlesourcing may seen alternative outsourcing where the production part product removed completely from the focal firm smes outsourcing may counterproductive for various reason first because transaction cost may higher than expected second because smaller firm may encounter difficulty dealing with the management challenge international outsourcing cooperation and finally company which have experienced ongoing improvement and efficiency danish context may find that this may not necessarily continue when production outsourced foreign country address these challenge outsourcing middlesourcing emerging viable alternative that achieves competitive advantage and flexibility while minimising productionrelated risk and maintaining the potential for continued improvement how smes work with middlesourcing practice the two company fintech and hardi are the same line business and they produce similar albeit not identical product originally hardi planned outsource their production completely fintech however the two firm decided engage middlesourcing instead stimulate the flexibility and the competitive advantage both company applying middlesourcing they assist each other gaining access danish journal management business how can smes support growth lowgrowth region larger customer and they both minimise their individual risk they can enhance flexibility and potentially exploit each other production capacity peak situation and enhance flexibility and reduce cost for fintech and hardi positive side effect that the production and business stay the local region opposed outsourcing other countriesregions which creates local demand for skilled labour growth facilitating theme local regional relation based networkswhat doe working with localregional relation based network imply smes are highly dependent localregional relationbased network their pursuit growth and development key challenge smes relates the fact that they have fewer internal knowledge resource because the smaller number their employee the localregional relationbased network not only provide opportunity for collective learning and knowledge development they also provide access resource and potential collaboration this creates good foundation for innovation and growth among the smes both individual organisation and group keeble wilkinson characteristic success these type network high level mutual trust and interest among the networking partner the network are not based formal contractual relation however regulative factor proximity everybody know everybody localregional community one network partner doe not deliver live the expected level cooperation that partner may excluded the incentive trustworthy network partner may therefore expected relatively high these type networkshow smes work with local regional relationbased network practice toftebo actively networking with similar company that otherwise could seen direct competitor such cooperation with the competitor based much social relation business deal this network solution are created mutual and flexible process that doe not rely formal agreement contract this network help toftebo gain competitive advantage flexibility and access more and larger assignment and contract that they would otherwise able carry out themselves toftebo local region demand rather confined and collaborating with other similar otherwise competing firm make possible gain largerscale order outside the local area with they normally operatein summary the eleven case company revealed that logical and hierarchical order the six growth factor exists fundamentally the case company all had clear growth intention and shared interest strategic thinking and worked diligently nurturing their strategic growth potential through various strategic initiative this appeared prerequisite for their success and growth the lack resource these small firm accommodated organisational design focusing selfmanaged team allowing the employee room explore and take responsi bilities the case company gained access more knowledge and innovation potential from their dedicated employee the strategic thinking combined with the selfmanaged organisation employee supported particular three key activity open source innovation middlesourcing and fundraising open source innovation applied all the case eleven case company various way and resort selfmanaged team allowed the firm think outside the box and open the development and innovation potential middlesourcing applied way ensure flexibility primarily the production company furthermore fundraising applied gain access resource for new development activity yet primarily the service company however all three activity were undertaken attempt gain flexibility either financial innovationresourcewise andor achieve production flexibility and way navigate effectively localregional sme lowgrowth region postfiscal crisis time finally the case company local and regional based network contributed all the other five growth facilitator providing knowledge collaboration innovation and facilitating joint growth hence the network were therefore used extensively all eleven case company figure below illustrates the logical order the six growthfacilitating theme discussionthe study reveals that firm achieve growth applying interplay internally and externally oriented activity the different characteristic the eleven case company indicated variation which growth facilitator were most optimal supporting growth the specific context industry and situation the case company line with contingency theory galbraith van ven the practical implication the finding stress the need for smes identify and develop their unique set combination growth facilitating activity pursuit and support growth one solution specific set growth facilitator fit everybody however larger comparative study would have carried out able identify the correlation between industry company situation and growth facilitating activity strategic thinking key element ensuring growth smes existing research stressed that strategy smes different from strategy large organisation however little known about how smes actually apply strategic thinking manage their organisation daily basis and which extent they use emergent andor planned action the finding the present study revealed different combination action where the smes were combining their flexile emergent action with more planned activity various degree these finding are not conclusive and large study strategic thinking among smes could provide further knowledge relation how combination planned and emergent action combination hereof generate danish journal management business figure the six growth facilitation activitieshow can smes support growth lowgrowth region network gnisiardnuf gnganaminoitamrofni ecruos nepo gnicruoseddmli selfmanaged team strategic thinkingmore growth certain type smes context and situation the successful application the autonomous team and selfmanagement growth facilitator implies practice that smes invest developing the employee professional skill able handle more and different assignment including their ability organise plan and communicate many different level the new project economy may important and neglected growth facilitator for smes the study show that administrative capability and effective process encompassing preparation project description that include integration public procedure well the use personal network local regional national for project collaboration and fundraising are important for attracting new public fundingit common theme the public debate that wage competition primarily the industry from lowwage country constitutes serious challenge for maintaining and expanding employment denmark conversely the case company have applied middlesourcing activity ensure movement the opposite direction maintaining flexibility well production and job denmark middlesourcing business strategy perhaps one the finding with the greatest growth potential also phenomenon that not yet wellidentified and included part the economic policy effort the recommendation therefore consider this opportunity and further examine how middlesourcing may take place danish lowgrowth regional context regard userproducer and employeedriven innovation smes need aware the fact that the lack process formalisation and involvement external knowledge apart from that the customer may represent challenge knowledge sought primarily among few company employee may represent potential limitation new innovative solution you ask the same people each time then you are like only get the same response and approach this finding stress that extended interaction with external partner important ensure innovative solution and development however the customer knowledge lack knowledge may potentially barrier radical innovation company focus too much solving each customer hereandnow need business strategy userproducer and employeedriven innovation may demand the fewest resource for generating positive growth for business the finding the present study support the existing research suggesting that smes participating network enhance their competitive advantage and growth conversely much present research focus the professionalization and formalisation the network however the case presented here show that there wide selection collaborative network that are informal and the finding stress the need for company nurture their local network and harvest the growth potential even more the informal network should not necessarily changed into more formal one appears that the level informality may actually the strength the network for the smes the six growthfacilitating theme were present all the case company however some the case company portrayed these growth theme much larger extent than the others and some the theme were critical their ability generate growth the growth theme and facilitating activity identified the present paper will hopefully inspire both theoretical and applied study the field sme growth conclusionthe finding provide demonstrate chronology growth facilitator and the identified six growth theme and related activity may serve inspiration for smes longitudinal study eleven case may considered acceptable for preliminary and exploratory conclusion yet statistical generalisation can made based the present study the finding and contribution this paper offer suggestion for future research particular interest would perform similar research across different company and industry determine whether the present finding are generic industrycontextspecific one could speculate whether the industrial context would emphasize certain growth facilitator over others because the similarity industrial context and characteristic this study performed regional context denmark and the finding may therefore also influenced regionalnational characteristic given the implication the present study quantitative comparative study applied growth facilitator across different industry and different regionalnational context called for test the combination and generalisability the six growth factorsdanish journal
