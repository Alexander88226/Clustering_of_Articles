ability small and mediumsized enterprise china such analysis will helpful for their sound development keywords small and mediumsized enterprise technological innovation difficulty financing cause for poor technological innovation sme china imperfect policy and regulation promoting sme technological innovation ever since the reform and openingup some regulation and policy relevant technological innovation have been established and implemented china such strengthening the construction service system for sme technological innovation and the law sme development and have exerted favorable effect promoting development and technological innovation however some problem also exist relevant law and regulation seem empty with some content repeated omitted and contradicted most the current policy and regulation relevant technological innovation sme support those enterprise especially the technological innovation program hightechnology enterprise such torch program sme incubator and fund for the technological innovation small and mediumsized enterprise however insufficient importance been attached sme the manufacturing industry especially the technological innovation sme the tertiary industry relevant policy more emphasis put the favorable term for enterprise the late period their industrialization than technological innovation the incubation the achievement the early period industrialization relevant experiment and having not established effective industryuniversityresearch cooperation system currently very difficult construct innovative system focused enterprise and sticking the combination industry university and research due relevant system china industry university and research have long been separated from each other scientific research fund and staff are over concentrated national scientific research university and institution and the value scientific achievement evaluated according the fund they gain the number issued essay the academic status the participant and the level award they win such evaluation system succeeds reflecting the academic value scientific achievement while neglecting their market value hence leading the failure lead the market the infeasibility industrial production this source scientific resource waste well one the main reason for chinese enterprise poor innovative ability incomplete protection system for intellectual property right present the incomplete law and administrative system relevant the protection intellectual property right china have resulted some problem such multifarious administration ineffective strike against tort low cost for tort high cost for safeguarding legal right unscientific evaluation system and hence leading the current vol international journal business and management indifferent consciousness protecting intellectual property right all over china low protection level and unbearably high cost for safeguarding legal right lacking agency and collaborative network beneficial for innovation sme currently agency for technological innovation china include productivity promotion center innovation service center engineering technology research center information center intellectual property right affair center all kind technological consultation institution permanent technological market human resource market technological property right transaction institution and spite their driving force these institution are mainly concentrated large and mediumsized city suffering from low level specialization poor collaboration onefold service function poor function innovation service system including feasibility argumentation financing guarantee patent agency mediation dispute and hence failing provide excellent allout service for small and medium enterprise besides because most service institution are established governmental department only few them are directly open enterprise what more only those large enterprise can served the high charge commercial agency have also prevented sme from getting necessary guidance their technological innovation addition insufficient collaboration and communication among small and medium enterprise independent production the shortage necessary technique during the development process formal and informal communication and the shortage specialized collaboration and technological and sale network have increased the cost for the transaction among small and mediumsized enterprise and therefore that for their technological innovation impassable financing channel for sme technological innovation common problem harassing the whole world that great difficulty for sme finance shown that those commercial bank with their asset than gave their loan small and medium enterprise those with asset between and gave their loan them the data for those bank with asset between and went down for those with asset between and for those over also shown relevant survey that small and mediumsized enterprise china regard difficulty financing the top obstacle faced with the common problem gaining capital most small and mediumsized enterprise regard impassable financing channel their biggest

demand for investment and loan such proportion seems too low the supportive role financing sme technological innovation with capital being indispensable element for sme innovation especially their technological innovation stable financing channel can provide effective guarantee for their innovation process because their technological innovation not only high growth and effectiveness but highly risky economic behavior and therefore closely related their survival such society based knowledge economy addition since technological achievement are transformed into commodity the innovation process uncertain factor due technology well market exert influence this process this case risk investment come into being and becomes the major force sme innovation well international journal business and
