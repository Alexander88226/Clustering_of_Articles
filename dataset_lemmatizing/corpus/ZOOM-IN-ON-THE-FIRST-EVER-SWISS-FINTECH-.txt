finally section present the conclusion and suggestion for future research jmic value meeting case study series page methodology data source primary and secondary data have been used this research the primary data collected using exploratory technique namely semistructured interview they were guided questionnaire which focused primarily the benefit for geneva the macroeconomic level appendix the interview were carried out during the month march the interviewee were anja loetscher director the geneva convention bureau dgcb michael kleiner economic development officer state geneva edo sven bossu head sibos sibos and john hucker president swiss finance technology association sfta the group included least one member each the main stakeholder group from hereafter reference will made the respective interviewee with the assigned acronym that are indicated italic following their respective title parenthesis above the secondary data are from two difference source examine the benefit

following metric new follower tweet total tweet impression link click retweets like and average engagement rate all the series are monthly the series length one year from march march except for the new follower data where the data start from july unfortunately one year even not enough measure filter seasonal effect pattern data analysis the interview were collected and recorded via skype and manually transcribed the only exception the interview with sven bossu which case sibos handled the recording through cisco webex but unfortunately the process failed the interviewee then agreed answer the interview question again writing the author acknowledge the limitation the methodology but this beyond their will the interview were analysed using sphinxiq quali software boughzala using lexical and statistical approach the lexical approach identifies the most frequently used word and expression swiss fintech corner one the main goal show the homogeneity opinion across the interviewee the statistical approach help estimate the level homogeneity across interviewee this end crosstabulations between the main word expression yielded the lexical analysis and the interview were calculated principal component analysis test the satisfaction survey among the startup analysed using descriptive statistic for the social medium data structural time series used koopman however most the case the reduced length the time series only allows estimation using classical ordinary least square ols model model built for each the variable all the model have the independent variable time and the dependent variable which each the variable listed finally order estimate the strength the effect the swiss fintech corner dummy intervention variable jmic value meeting case study series page were added september the time when the event took place result interview analysis the first question the interview see appendix addressed the possible effect the swiss fintech corner the visibility geneva the lexical analysis show three slightly different group dgcb and sibos show significant level homogeneity and broadly positive evaluation dgcb the highest lexical richness that the term used referred almost entirely mass medium impact this show that she exclusively fully aware the importance including geneva global mass medium for have had sibos here geneva gave wide local and international press coverage dgcb the second group the lexical component analysed sibos for the head sibos the impact the event geneva destination not significant personally don think the fintech corner had any impact the visibility geneva destination and that not purpose neither sibos rather the aim showcase switzerland and geneva fintech hub the entire idea around the fintech corner promote switzerland fintech hub and connect local fintech company with the global financial institution sibos the abovementioned observation line with the aim the geneva convention bureau gcb the convention bureau align our work according the edo cluster one them being finance dgcb the two other interviewee are also close each other and form the third group for sfta there impact but more geneva canton and not the city itself for destination general think people could see just how high quality but also term the scale the city well think general good bring the jmic value meeting case study series page global audience that scale city like geneva sfta finally the edo focus the direct impact such the fact that the number overnights generated specifically the swiss fintech corner sfc limited well very difficult say because the audience that were catering for very specific startup fintech audience which not much with tourism industry general and because they very rarely meet large meeting the startup had our corner were not people who either organise such large meeting who usually take part such large meeting they rather meet little demo day and pitching day and meeting with vcs etc but not necessarily large event edo nevertheless and line with the preceding interview the edo agrees the importance the event for the startup reinforcing the position the sfta for the startup this quite unique opportunity such large event edo therefore the impact the sfc the image geneva destination general destination particular limited the impact the whole switzerland fintech hub connecting local fintech company with the global financial institution sibos the aim the second question study the inverse effect how geneva global financial market affect the visibility andor synergy startup the dgcb did not answer this question sibos gave limited answer only main lexical element whereas the edo number and the sfta the big imbalance the number lexical element invalidated the statistical analysis homogeneity geneva being financial center one the key determinant for sibos choose location the fact that geneva important banking market place one the reason why sibos came geneva sibos jmic value meeting case study series page regard increasing awareness among the public and political authority the existence fintech startup and their importance sibos think positive that sense did boost awareness with the public opinion and local political authority sibos line with this opinion sfta see impact public opinion and recognises the role geneva this impact think geneva and fintech are sometimes surprised hear there startup community and think honestly speaking not the most vibrant large scale one and something that could further developed and improved even you just look contrast lausanne for example think the fact that financial centre can real advantage and that huge strength sfta edo member the government geneva slightly different opinion the public opinion not changed lot but the awareness the fintech startup among traditional genevan financial actor increased the link between fintech and sibos made but think term public opinion this really made big difference for the political awareness what also interesting the business awareness because our main issue sensitise the banker the financial actor about fintech could invite swiss banker private banker from geneva could invite them for evening event that fintech corner this allowed make link between the local geneva banker and the startup company that were the corner and that for maybe the biggest challenge create that link between the local finance industry and the local startup industry because the political awareness there our politician they are aware and they really want advance fintech edo the literature review pointed out that switzerland two financial centre zurich and geneva which raise the question possible change their relative position the repositioning geneva respective zurich generally rejected but there consensus the whole country jmic value meeting case study series page switzerland the international level there broad consensus that geneva provided good opportunity link startup traditional actor which shown the precedent quote edo and the quote here below sfta switzerland huge financial centre here whether you speak geneva switzerland whole and there really this demand for innovation and lot the bank here are not necessarily innovative they were traditional lot way and the culture were about rocking the boat doing thing differently and that think why particular not only about startup doing thing but about how startup enable corporates thing and that something think rich history all part switzerland where you marry the tradition with innovation and yes think the fact that such huge financial centre and such unique financial centre geneva creates truly unique opportunity global context and that something say not only locally but also tell that the world and yeah you can probably tell that something little bit excited about sfta the third interview question examined the effect the sfc the geneva startup ecosystem the question not answered the dgcb but the statistical analysis the other three show heterogeneity the lexical element the positive role geneva ecosystem yielded different strength consensus the edo partially credit the sfc but focus more the sibos conference overall than the sfc event there were other place there one from belgium one from luxemburg there one from singapore and you had different place where startup were concentrated and people could and meet each other also gave them the opportunity walk around and meet other startup because said were not the only fintech corner edo sibos and the sfta have the most positive opinion about geneva fintech ecosystem the global financial community loved the idea because allowed them connect directly smaller company with bright idea how tackle big issue for our jmic value meeting case study series page industry and the feedback got from the swiss fintechs really positive well they were given access the global bank and privileged contact with very senior person those institution and the event organised around the corner such networking presentation etc did only boost this the startup corner something had never done before and proved very successful for whether creates competition synergy actually saw both sibos for the sfta the focus put switzerland whole innovative fintech ecosystem one the more prolific influencers social medium man named pascal bouvier said that going come switzerland find thing out part because started hear stuff through his innotribe network because sibos every year and because people told him about some these company the crypto valley the blockchain community and didn actually invest that but got involved syndicate that invested knip which wellknown zurich startup there event there association there some other thing like that but big international event like sibos and platform like the swiss fintech corner particular get the best startup all one place and they get see each other really high level environment and what great they get not only represent themselves and wrestle shoulder against each other but they stand shoulder shoulder representing switzerland which really great sfta conclusion the representative the government seems pay attention the big picture namely the sibos conference overall whereas for the sibos and sfta representative focus put the positioning switzerland and not specifically geneva fintech ecosystem for them the event real success this regard the fourth question concern general remark about the event this question answered all the interviewee with the exception sibos which why the heterogeneity analysis will not included the analysis the dgcb highlighted the innovative character the sfc the sibos conference and also linked the success the event both the sibos conference and sfc the jmic value meeting case study series page importance geneva financial market place organizer will prefer come the congress the topic relevant the destination dgcb the edo point out the good coordination effort the cantonal authority with the dgcb for having succeeded bringing the event geneva line with this the sfta noted the coordination between different stakeholder being key aspect the success think the swiss fintech corner fantastic example the power coordinated effort really highlight the economic benefit all this and the commercial opportunity for swiss stakeholder international context and what would challenge the audience help with something that actually for group involved took great coordination and wasn without special extraordinary effort that possible sfta the final question explored point for improvement the dgcb and the edo identified some challenge with local tourism actor such hotel transportation provider and the dgcb agreed that one the problem the cost the event our pricing average too high dgcb mean there postmortem you know discussion with the hotel with the public transport with all the different actor edo edo have made effort order reduce the participation cost for startup and the end managed make something that did cost anything for the startup themselves thanks the sponsor found could reimburse the startup with the amount they had given the end did cost them hardly anything edo sibos want improve governance expanding their data collection before and during the event order better ass the event changed make sure governance clear from start and also set the follow study before starting the event allowing collect data also during the event sibos jmic value meeting case study series page sfc startup survey out the fintech startup answered the satisfaction survey with some them providing incomplete response according the survey result just under the participant spent two day the fintech corner while the majority spent only one day the sfc the mean overall satisfaction level rating scale from unsatisfied extremely satisfied most were either very satisfied extremely satisfied overall some point which participant felt could improved include preparation done earlier more advance more medium coverage and focused article the startup asking private bank visit the corner and spend some time each booth allowing startup have the opportunity participate the innovation talk better location the sfc and more space for each startup despite these suggestion the average ranking for the following sfc aspect all received score above preparation the association involved organising the fintech corner the swiss fintech corner communication location design and layout well the relevance participation term the amount medium coverage due the participant presence the swiss fintech corner the main platform social medium representing over the total medium coverage piece medium coverage related the participant however just under half this social medium coverage linked single participant the online press represented piece the total medium coverage and the same participant mentioned above responsible for almost half those piece too the printed press radio and followed with considerably lower figure must noted that this question can interpreted many way especially with regard social jmic value meeting case study series page medium where the same post shared multiple time and the inclusion exclusion retweets may significantly affect the figure provided therefore there not enough data interpret the effectiveness each type medium coverage there very low amount technical lead with total nine possible reason for this may that getting technical lead not the aim all the startup present and the audience may not have been suitable despite the fact that the participant had average roughly five commercial lead each the quality commercial lead were rated average with score out possible hypothesis may that many commercial lead were considered early lead and not converted lead missing information such the specific field each fintech participant well how old the startup company may explain some the abovementioned factor conclusion the overall satisfaction ranged from good excellent the item improve for the startup corner included better organisation advance location more advertising and other pull factor put place attract the right visitor more egalitarian participation the startup with regard participation interview and innovation talk more medium coverage and finally from academic point view would useful improve the quality the followup with the startup order see the evolution any that may related the impact such event the participant social medium metric analysis the reader should aware that the hashtag swissfintechcorner only used during the event therefore some the conclusion below should considered with caution the twitter analysis the sfc effect yield the following conclusion jmic value meeting case study series page firstly positive effect observed new follower and average engagement rate the former case the number follower steadily and exponentially increasing the latter case unfortunately the trend show slow decrease with negative effect immediately after the event october secondly tweet retweets and link click show positive punctual effect punctual mean that the effect only persisted during september disappearing afterwards the case tweet and retweets added effect average were and the development link click september were half what would have been observed the sfc had not occurred thirdly for both total tweet impression and like the effect positive for september both case the sfc doubled the longrun trend unfortunately the positive effect shortlived with the number decreasing during the four month following the event even though the startup participating the sfc showed high level satisfaction the survey regarding the social medium campaign the positive effect were difficult maintain after the hashtag longer used this prof the good quality the strategy the community management the association during the duration the event the lesson these analysis that the event increase visibility retweets like link click but making these effect last over time still challenge the analysis social medium metric during other business event will necessary not only confirm this fact but also find strategy cope with this issue benefit realised firstly important mention the difficulty isolating the swiss fintech corner from the sibos conference which especially been demonstrated during the interview carried out for this study nevertheless benefit related the sfc have been concluded based three level which follow below jmic value meeting case study series page geneva destination while little evidence show the specific benefit the sfc geneva destination the sibos conference been seen further the image geneva important financial centre the fintech hub relevance not limited geneva but instead spread over the whole switzerland macroeconomic level according the sfta traditional banker were able connect with and made aware the existence and importance fintechs for the financial sector the sfc also enabled the creation link between the local startup industry and the local finance industry edo microeconomic level the startup who participated the sfc the interview and survey analysis document stakeholder optimism that the sfc will contribute the future success the startup company through the eventrelated exposurevisibility and the direct contact with audience that may potentially lead partnershipscollaboration despite the fact that some startup showed highly successful outcome term social medium coverage converted lead and exposure general must noted that these benefit were not distributed evenly among the startup who participated the survey this mainly due some the startup not being directly involved the banking sector the swiss finance technology association the hashtag created and used during the event swissfintechcorner able drive meaningful traffic term social medium exposure for the association with specific regard twitter jmic value meeting case study series page discussion and conclusion the benefit derived from the sfc have proven difficult isolate and identify many situation whereas the entire sibos event been clearly linked many benefit identified the interviewee furthermore the interviewee have shown have notably different point view based their position relation the event and their overall profession the most contrasting viewpoint that the edo who focused the main event sibos rather than the sfc another demarcated opinion that the dgcb who more focused the development geneva successful destination for the dgcb the importance global mass medium coverage significantly higher which understandable given link the image destination the finding this study did not yield enough evidence support the statement that organizer will prefer come the congress the topic relevant the destination appears that may depend the kind event such the field scientific industrial the customer corporation association furthermore the author believe that even this correct can not supersede other factor such competitive position pricevalue access additional service leisure facility boo nor the quality supplier management weber and ladkin fact the latter statement about the relevance the event topic the destination appears push factor however the author believe that instead pull factor therefore the destination could employ this factor mean increase appeal and subsequently increase the chance hosting more event some the interview point out the difficulty engaging with different provider such the accommodation the transportation sector despite the benefit this event yielded finally evidence show that the virtue feedback loop existent noted the benefit section some startup were seen get opportunity while the sfta able increase publicity moreover while geneva may not have gained visibility specifically the fintech ecosystem jmic value meeting case study series page switzerland whole indeed succeeded this way limitation the research the primary data more specifically the interview that were carried out for this study had few issue namely some question were not answered all the interviewee and secondly one the recording failed term the secondary data the survey that sent the fintech startup who participated the event answered out furthermore given that there lapse time between the event and the survey answer there need recall certain answer and this could have changed the evaluation the time series evolution metric used the social medium metric analysis than one year therefore some sophisticated statistical tool namely the structural time series could not applied and seasonality pattern could not filtered future research could carry out delphi study with all the fintech startup participant order evaluate the actual sfc effectiveness which beyond the scope this paper acknowledgement the author would like thank
