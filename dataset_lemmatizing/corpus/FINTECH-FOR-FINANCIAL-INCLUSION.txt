for financial inclusion all right reserved fintech for financial inclusion overview september the full potential fintech for financial inclusion may realized with strategic framework underlying infrastructure and enabling policy and regulatory environment support digital financial transformation drawing from experience range developing emerging and developed country our research suggests that the best approach staged and progressive focused four main pillar the first pillar building digital identification and ekyc system simplify access the financial system once these are established for individual and business they provide solid foundation not only for finance but also for the development the digital economy more broadly the second pillar digital payment infrastructure and open electronic payment system the primary way facilitate digital financial flow economy the third pillar combine the promotion account opening and access with the electronic provision government service particularly for public transfer and payment scale the use digital finance and related service supporting access payment and saving together these three pillar provide foundation for digital financial transformation and financial inclusion the fourth and final pillar design digital financial market and system build the first three support broader access finance and investment underpinning use case including security trading clearing and settlement and other more sophisticated financial function finally there need for regulatory approach that support and adapt these four pillar this major journey for any economy but one that experience increasingly suggests tremendous potential transform financial inclusion and support digital economic development fintech for financial inclusion introductionaccess finance financial inclusion and financial sector development have long been major policy objective over the last century series initiative have aimed increase access finance and financial inclusion but these have accelerated the last decade technological development combined with strategic policy support show potential for progress beyond anything that been achievedthe world bank global findex show that the last three year million adult acquired financial account and between and billion people opened account with formal financial institution mobile financial service provider including mobile money for the first time this impressive progress any measure but much remains done billion people year older still did not have access account some percent the world adult populationthe number financially excluded are still disproportionately higher developing and emerging market country but there been substantial progress most the billion people who gained access account for the first time the last eight year live developing country and emerging market particular progress been made east africa china and indiawhat account for these development from much the progress related the impact financial technology fintech number country three example stand out the first the development mobile money particularly kenya and east africa where this type fintech done the most promote financial inclusion narrowly defined ensuring access financial service allowing the unbanked make payment remit fund and save using their mobile phonethe second example china where traditional and not overly efficient financial system became one the world most digitized financial system this process accompanied the single greatest decrease poverty world history the third major example india where financial access increased dramatically very short time percent adult india had account this the result major strategy build ecosystem for new digital economy and financial system india stack particular underlying infrastructure and enabling policy environment among other thing this led approximately million people gaining access account for the first time million adultsacquired financial account between billion peopleopened account with formal institution mobile financial service provider adultsin india have have access account result fintech the world adult population still not have access account million businessesand billion people remain financially excludedof the billion unbanked adult have mobile phonemobile moneyhas played major role advancing financial inclusion the mobile phone arguably the most powerful instrument development historysource world bank global findex key fact billion unbanked adult twothirds have mobile phone although smartphone penetration level are not high they are increasing rapidly and appropriate strategy support the ecosystem infrastructure and policy environment for transformative digital financial system financial inclusion and economic development are real possibility for many economiesdespite massive progress china and india these country still have the largest unbanked population the world million china and million india increasingly the unbanked are those who not have access mobile phone and this digital divide remains major challenge however the gap appears closing every day the cost mobile phone and smartphones continue drop and could reduced further with foundational digital financial infrastructurefintech for financial inclusion however beyond account access india like china experiencing transformational reduction extreme poverty the extent that longer the world largest number people living extreme poverty these development are part global phenomenon known financial technology fintech the interaction between finance technology and regulation while finance and technology have long relationship new fintech era emerged characterized unprecedented speed change and growing range new participant from startup bank ecommerce company today fintech encompasses not only the digitization and datafication global financial market but also the emergence new startup fintechs around the world the technological transformation finance through digital financial service developing country and most recently the emergence giant technology firm engaging finance techfins what can learn from the experience and trend fintech over the last decade particular what step can developing and emerging market take increase financial inclusion and economic development through fintech mobile money played major role advancing financial inclusion and the mobile phone arguably the most powerful instrument development history originally developed east africa mobile money usually led telecom firm and focused feature phone relatively simple device limited their potential application useful and important mobile money fintech far greater potential promote financial inclusion through transformative digital financial service and economic development while important mobile money only one aspect building broader ecosystem support digital financial transformationthis paper make the case that reap the greatest benefit for financial inclusion and maximize the potential fintech framework that support infrastructure and enabling policy and regulatory environment built strong foundation digital identification and electronic payment system will support much broader digital financial transformation addition india growing number other economy are developing and implementing such strategy including thailand the philippine bangladesh and the similar strategy being implemented part the global response historically unprecedented level forced displacement particularly jordan where unhcr the refugee agency partnered with the government and private company provide identity system based iris scan and combined with electronic account despite these achievement significant work needed assist the billion people and over million business that remain financially excluded what lesson can draw from success and failure date what sort strategy should financial policymakers and regulator pursue there are reason optimistic the fintech for financial inclusion financial inclusion what have learned far this section address three question what financial inclusion and why important what lesson have learned from different initiative support financial inclusion and what fintech and what type fintech are most likely advance financial inclusion financial inclusion why mattersfinancial inclusion involves the delivery financial service affordable cost all segment society according the alliance for financial inclusion afi ccess financial service the grounding principle financial inclusion afi financial inclusion data fid working group defines the three main dimension access usage and quality today financial inclusion significant international policy goal including enabler many the sustainable development goal sdgs approximately two billion people roughly percent the world adult population did not have formal bank account figure for show substantial drop this figure indicating that are making progress but still have far the majority the unbanked live developing economy and emerging market and are unable procure deliver the necessary paperwork open account they can afford account can not afford the time off work and travel cost attend branch financial inclusion vital improving the livelihood the poor and disadvantaged providing people developing country with access financial service such payment saving insurance and credit help them manage their financial obligation and build better future for their family while also supporting broad economic growth development and poverty reduction this achieved first making individual vulnerable enabling them save increase their resilience and invest their education health and microbusinesses second financial inclusion can make the management daily life far more efficient electronic payment allow people pay for essential service without taking time off work pay the bill

experience date draw lesson for policymakers around the worldd fintech and financial inclusionfintech new term for longstanding phenomenon the application technology finance with the advent cloud computing smartphones and highspeed internet the sector expanded dramatically over the last decade today fintech describes new era digital finance around the world that extends from the application artificial intelligence and machine learning big data and from the use biometric identification blockchain technology what type fintech innovation will have the biggest impact those who remain financially excluded the most obvious answer mobile money the provision emoney mobile phone where the greatest success story kenya with vodafone mpesa product however the real opportunity fintech affords the development entire digital financial ecosystem that meet the need both individual and smes this the essential next phase the journey comprehensive financial inclusion and vital digital economic development and broader financial sector developmentbased experience date suggest framework for fintech for financial inclusion based four major pillar together with supporting infrastructure and enabling policy and regulatory environment these pillar provide foundation for evolving digital financial ecosystem and help economy maximize the financial inclusion benefit from fintech while also balancing financial stability consumer protection and financial integrity these four pillar arepillar idigital and ekyc for identification and simplified account opening pillar iiopen electronic payment system infrastructure and enabling regulatory and policy environment that facilitate the digital flow fund from both traditional financial intermediary and new market entrant pillar iiiaccount opening initiative and electronic provision government service providing vital tool access service and save pillar ivdesign digital financial market infrastructure and system that turn support valueadded financial service and product and deepen access usage and stability fintech for financial inclusion case study india stackthese four pillar have formed integrated strategy india and had impressive impact india stack set system policy and apis application programming interface that enable government business and others use digital infrastructure support range paperless and cashless service india stack comprised four main level which together are making india financial sector more efficient expanding access financial service across the country opening the market competition from entrepreneur startup and itecommerce firm supporting economic growth and development and reducing poverty the first level national system biometric identification aadhaar identity the base most financial access issue and india addressing this involved developing biometric national identification card based fingerprint and two retina scan these have been issued more than billion people since the second level the establishment bank account deliver national service such pension health and other social welfare payment date over million bank account have been opened part this process the third level common payment api enable payment made anyone through common system supported the reserve bank india rbi the fourth level involves series electronic kyc initiative that allow individual maintain detail their financial affair and provide these detail financial service and other provider meet kyc requirement these ekyc utility platform show how regtech regulatory technology can strengthen the integrity financial market and reduce counterparty risk apart from infrastructure enabling policy ecosystem play big role advancing financial inclusion india some the policyregulatory consideration that have propelled financial inclusion include allowing correspondent banking with relaxed kyc norm allowing payment and small finance bank and thereby permitting new player such telecommunication and fintech firm into the market allowing aadhaarekyc open account and developing national financial inclusion strategy with focus digitizing governmenttoperson paymentsmore and more country are developing similar strategy that india the following section highlight the core element these strategy and the lesson that have been learned date fintech for financial inclusion pillar empowering access digital identification ekyc and simplified account openingexperience show that identity and digital identity particular central digital financial inclusion and the transformation digital finance this particular challenge developing country where large segment the population often lack any form formal identification formal legal identity for all included the sustainable development goal and the world bank taken leading role with idd identity for development initiative launched according the idd global dataset one billion people face challenge proving their identity these percent are under the national age and mainly live developing country where percent people lack officially recognized identification compared percent lower middleincome country and just five percent upper middleincome country eightyone percent those without live subsaharan africa and south asia lack identification clear barrier financial access particularly the context international standard for customer identification and due diligence the global findex highlight that percent the billion adult without account cited lack necessary documentation the main reason the same time this show the potential digital identification have major and transformative impactdigital the basis strategy for digital financial inclusion beyond simple proof identity country without extensive bank branch network digital allows person sme open account without having present themselves person the idd global dataset show that country now have some sort identification system using digital technology which while introducing data security and privacy risk important potential opportunity for digital financial inclusion example india aadhaar systemindia aadhaar system the first level india stack operated the unique identification authority india uidai and involves issuing digit randomized number all resident voluntary basis since launched been increasingly used access government service social benefit and banking and insurance among others enrolment obtain aadhaar number free and process biometric deduplication aim ensure only one number generated for each individual the aadhaar number then act proof identity the aadhaar system also provides for number method updating data which important can linked growing number service for example biometric data can updated child grow the case accident disease the quality technology improves aadhaar proven extremely useful the context financial inclusion making access financial account easier enabling digitization government payment and service when combined with other element the india stack strategy increasing efficiency and lowering cost although there correlation between aadhaar and level financial access india highlighted the global findex also introduced range issue especially around privacy and data protection gain clearer picture aadhaar impact idinsight and omidyar launched the state aadhaar study data becomes available the main conclusion far been that indian generally approve government use aadhaar for identification purpose and lesser extent private sector use however the study also found high level concern about data protection the most significant problem with the implementation aadhaar have been around data security the aadhaar authentication regulation provides for transaction data archived for five year and aadhaar even been described mass surveillance technology the time writing the aadhaar system subject hotly debated constitutional challenge the supreme court india being argued that the identity card are breach privacy and that data being collected thirdparty contractor without proper safeguard place also argued that fingerprinting and iris scanning are susceptible misuse and fraud related proceeding mid ninejudge bench the supreme court india held that indian have right privacy but declined rule the constitutional validity the system however aadhaar also proven extremely beneficial for example billion rupee financial benefit previously lost annually through fraud and corruption are now finding their way the intended recipient government estimate suggest there have been important saving result the availability and use aadhaar provide government service and transfer payment with the economist highlighting estimate that saving have been high usd five billion some state india before aadhaar and associated financial service percent government welfare payment were failing reach their intended recipient due leakage difficulty with implementation should not detract from the potential national biometricallybased identification system underpin digital financial ecosystem digital however established and validated provides necessary and solid foundation for the rest digital financial ecosystem including sophisticated and advanced payment infrastructure fintech for financial inclusion streamlined account opening procedure system that support the payment government benefit and other payment into those account and financial system that provides credit individual and smes the basis credit score compiled from diverse and accurate data such comprehensive digital financial ecosystem will transform governance and service delivery and deliver economic gain that can used fund investment education health road and other infrastructure will likewise transform the payment government benefit dramatically reduce loss from corruption and allocate credit allow smes the primary employer most country thrive the experience the and jordan with developing digital identity solution for refugee are good example collaborative system design and development irisguardirisguard iris recognition technology that algorithm convert image iris into unique code that then used identify individual since irisguard eyepay platform been used the especially the world food programme deliver financial aid iris recognition technology provides beneficiary with sufficient digital identity receive food voucher withdraw cash and transfer fund the spot without requiring credit card bank account the system depends the biometric data refugee collected unhcr early irisguard entered into agreement with ifc world bank group member use this technology promote financial inclusion for syrian refugee jordan using eyepay conjunction with the ethereum blockchain process supermarket and atm transaction securely real time over million refugee have registered for the system and april the platform been rolled out five supermarket refugee camp jordan serving over syrian refugee secure technology important for vulnerable individual protect themselves and their money from corruption and identity theft iris recognition and distributed ledger technology work toward this goal providing immutable form digital identity and rendering physical cash card and voucher unnecessary similarly using blockchain technology transfer fund internationally can cut huge cost from bank transfer fee the world food programme cash transfer amounted usd million about country eliminating bank transfer fee for these transaction will allow fund deployed elsewherebased these experience unhcr established strategy digital identity and inclusion regional approach eidas the euthe eidas regulation adopted provide mutually recognized digital identity for crossborder electronic interaction between european citizen company and government institution member state can notify the european commission their national form eid and other member state are then required recognize september although they have been able recognize other state eids voluntarily since once the eid recognized throughout the individual will able use any member state the eid assigned certain level assurance based security specification allowing state determine the service for which may used this system doe not make the sovereign form identity redundant but allows national form digital identity recognized throughout the eud principle identification for sustainable developmentdrawing these experience and lesson the world bank coordinated the development principle identification which have been endorsed wide range organization the principle explicitly recognize the importance identification financial inclusion and economic development believe that every person the right participate fully their society and economy without proof identity people may denied access right and service they may unable open bank account attend school collect benefit such social security seek legal protection otherwise engage modern society one should face the indignity exclusion nor denied the opportunity realize their full potential exercise their right share progress one should left behind the principle not only highlight the role legal identification the context sdg but range others including financial inclusion from the standpoint building infrastructure vital consider how digital can extended much the population possible maximize efficiency beyond individual similar system can also considered for corporation such the legal entity identifier system lei ekyc and kyc utilitiesbase identity essential and itself but when linked electronically with data like tax and address information provides the basis for simple ekyc system that can dramatically reduce account opening cost while also addressing concern about market integrity antimoney laundering recent research from microsave highlight the benefit ekyc the context financial inclusion and market integrity the core objective ekyc make simple and inexpensive possible for most people and entity open account including smes and allow resource fintech for financial inclusion focused higher risk customer support financial inclusion and market integrityperforming and verifying customer identity and conducting customer due diligence cdd both when onboarding new customer and providing ongoing service are vital maintaining market integrity this process embodied range amlcftcdd requirement based internationally agreed approach and the basis for understanding customer need which essential providing appropriate financial servicesexample south africa webbased kyc databaseone approach kyc compliance that doe not rely digital biometric identification been taken south africa where three major financial institution and thomson reuters have partnered create webbased database kyc information the service collect kyc information from the customer verifies once and then distributes all the institution the customer chooses allowing them control who can access their information the centralized database avoids duplication and streamlines account opening procedure for the customer cost the benefit this system are not yet fully apparent not all financial institution have chosen participate but adoption increase should efficiencyexample india ekyc systemin india paperless ekyc service based the aadhaar digital identity system been developed instantly establish the identity prospective banking customer when customer consent the service making their identity available provides proof identity service provider that can not repudiated the india stack esignature layer also interacts with ekyc the digitization identity authentication streamlines the account opening process and give all consenting customer easy access both digital and traditional financial service axis bank the first india offer ekyc accountopening facility late this service reduced the turnaround time for opening bank account from day just one day today many financial service provider traditional bank payment bank nonbank financial company insurance company etc and nonfinancial service provider telecom company government institution etc india leverage ekyc open transaction account and provide other related service the aadhaar ekyc service become prevalent that august over billion authentication identity and over six billion ekyc request have been processed despite the rapid uptake there have been issue with some entity using ekyc open account without obtaining express consent from customer response the reserve bank india issued new directive kyc norm for payment bank early requiring verification kyc information third party example eidas and ekycin the eidas intended starting point for similar system use electronic identity scheme set out eidas would make possible open bank account online while meeting the strong requirement for customer identity proofing and verification the legal certainty and validity qualified esignatures could also enhance the security electronic transaction this should work across border first step that direction have been taken the european antimoney laundering directive which allows electronic identification accepted under eidas meet customer due diligence requirementsf synthesizing the lessonstechnology provides opportunity reconsider existing system and build the infrastructure necessary balance market integrity financial inclusion and economic growth while also meeting international financial standard including the basel committee banking supervision financial action task force money laundering fatf the financial stability board fsb and the united nation sustainable development goalsin this context digital identification for individual and legal entity combined with ekyc system provides the basis for better outcome from the standpoint both market integrity and financial inclusion compared existing approach this context there clear potential solution many issue surrounding correspondent banking and derisking that have emerged between developed and developing country bank and customer crossborder initiative based lei have real potential going forward achieve range major objective the context corporates likewise system mutual recognition optional registration have great promise the context individual similar synergy are possible the context the oec common reporting standard for automatic exchange tax information among member jurisdiction the fatf and others are increasingly looking the potential transform existing amlcft taxation and corruption mechanism through the application technology design new system based upon new technological approach offer major opportunity better protect the financial system from criminal and other while the same time enhancing financial inclusion the opposite what are seeing many case today for instance the context derisking and correspondent banking problem going forward the real opportunity rethink how approach many these issuesat the same time all these system while technically feasible may not politically feasible many country such case where national identity solurions are not possible optional digital identity system that are separate from nationalsovereign identification system have the greatest potential transformative the eidas directive one such framework and system developed alibaba and tencent china represent other possible approach fintech for financial inclusion pillar enabling use digital payment infrastructure and open electronic payment systemspayment system provide the basic infrastructure for money flow through any economy and are therefore vital financial inclusion economic development and the functioning the real economy many developing country inefficient traditional payment system have frequently been major barrier economic activity generally inefficient system moving money and making payment combined with lack access that system are core barrier financial inclusion well economic growth reflecting this effort have been going for several decade build better payment system particularly electronic payment system connecting disparate party country important success have been achieved many place but the beginning the century still the case that moving money around many developing country and making payment were major daily challenge and barrier development the same time large value payment system particular are potential source system risk well major supporting financial infrastructure result there also been significant effort over several decade build more resilient system particularly rtgs real time gross settlement system and relating policy and regulatory framework including part the world bankimf financial sector assessment process fsap and post global regulatory reform effortsinto this context have come first mobile money and more recently fintecha mobile moneymobile money enables individual use their mobile phone pay bill remit fund deposit cash make withdrawal and save using emoney sometimes issued bank but most often telecommunication company telco mobile money service were operating developing country and continue grow while terminology tends vary across country and the research literature emoney typically defined type stored value instrument product that issued receipt fund consists electronically recorded value stored device such mobile phone iii may accepted mean payment party other than the issuer and convertible back into cash today more than year since inception mpesa major success providing financial service sizable proportion kenya population other mobile money success story can found ghana uganda the philippine and other country but this success not been consistent worldwide why mobile money service have taken off some country and not others doe not have simple answer part because different consumer need different country the inability service provider adapt their offering other market different regulatory approach across jurisdiction lack trained payment professional many market and challenge with payment interoperability between different network provider when one network dominant market share well interoperability between mobile money and bank account other aspect why cash remains king many developing country relate issue around cashincashout network with limited use case for emoney payment option well matter cultural and anthropologicalmobile money service including those offered telco are key part the solution financial exclusion they also pose significant regulatory and supervisory challenge consumer protection while simultaneously addressing risk financial integrity and stability regulation must proportionate and not overly burdensome relative the level risk mobile money service are typically not profitable banking and not usually introduce systemic stability concern these service grow they can not afford and not require the level regulation generally applied traditional bank such basel capital and liquidity requirement what service provider need central bank that interested encouraging innovation digital financial service and understands the need customer this major shift the role central bank financial regulator from traditional bank supervision function enabling innovation among bank telecommunication firm and payment company provide emoney the unbanked the magnitude this shift should not underestimated and recent year intensified with the explosion fintech startup around the world and the challenge developing and implementing appropriate policy and regulatory environment theme return section flourishing mobile money digital financial ecosystem one contribution fintech made financial inclusion many country but new technology and approach focused developing comprehensive digital financial ecosystem are emerging and offer significant promisethere however much bigger story told that technology can enable many developing country leapfrog extensive network traditional brickandmortar bank branch and deliver coherent seamless financial system entirely digitally and provide even the most vulnerable segment society such the rural poor woman and forcibly displaced person with account that meet all their financial need and give smes access the credit and payment service they need flourish china experience highlight the sort transformation that possible but also some the risk and challenge fintech for financial inclusion alipay and wechat payin china alipay and wechat pay while they are closed system demonstrate the power allowing new market entrant and digitizing traditional payment systemsalibaba established alipay payment method for ecommerce business and today one the largest mobile wallet provider the world along with paypal and wechat pay the bao money market fund integrated with the alipay mobile wallet and provides the opportunity make small investment now the largest money market fund the world having outgrown the leading fund that have been operating for least half centurywechat established messaging platform tencent the wechat wallet introduced allow user make mobile payment wechat social game and call and pay for taxi through the app cash transfer and instore cashless payment some chain store became available later that year percent respondent survey were using mobile payment system like wechat pay for retail payment this skyrocketing use prompted the people bank china pboc subject these mobile wallet service increased scrutiny and regulation the pboc announced that mobile payment institution will required from june channel payment through new centralized clearing house the china net union clearing corporation this change will give the pboc more control over all payment channel rather than user interacting with the payment institution directly the pboc also raised the reserve fund ratio for payment platform percent from percent effective april with the ratio gradually increase percent over time further protect consumer the same time address extensive fraud transaction using code generally replacing legitimate code with fake the pboc introduced cap such payment payment institution must now obtain permit offer barcode payment method proving increasingly popular china the experience wechat pay and alipay highlight that payment provider should subject appropriate proportional regulation both address risk and provide level playing fieldc designing regulatory infrastructure for open electronic payment systempayment system have long been major focus central bank around the world and electronic payment and settlement infrastructure supported appropriate policy and regulatory environment form the core modern financial system the committee payment and market infrastructure cpmi the bank for international settlement coordinated related effort with the imf and world bank providing important support for individual country and central bank including establishment core international regulatory standard with iosco the international organization security commission more recently the cpmi considered issue relating financial inclusion with the world bank and financial exclusion the context correspondent banking according the cpmi new technology and provider are improving efficiency and access crossborder retail payment with clearing and settlement infrastructure and appropriate regulatory and policy framework unlocking the greatest benefit meanwhile new technology also transforming the nature retail and other payment the domestic level particular with faster payment system and technology such distributed ledger technology including blockchain based experience with both traditional and new form payment growing attention being placed the design infrastructure and the policy and regulatory framework for such system including afi member and other participant this includes comprehensive set principle for the design national retail payment system support financial inclusion traditional large value and retail payment system emerged out particular combination institutional technological financial and historical factor primarily the century the late century technological change allowed incremental evolution many these system particularly with the advent electronic payment the atm automated teller machine and large value rtgs system this combination brought new risk and consequent regulatory and policy response but also fundamentally transformed the relationship people particularly the developed world with money and paymentby the beginning the century however many these benefit were largely confined more developed urban area many developing country and emerging market the entry mobile money the basis the feature phone thus transformation number case particularly kenya and east africa challenge regulatory and policy framework but also dramatically enhancing financial inclusion and improving the life million peoplelooking forward the greatest challenge and potentially the greatest opportunity going forward the emergence new technology particularly the smart phone data analytics cloud system and potentially distributed ledger technology and the internet thing iot these new technology have the potential not only transform access payment already happened china and rapidly happening india and increasing range country around the world they also have the potential for the redesign existing century bankbased payment paradigm the question will how best deal with this process technological transformation from policy and regulatory standpoint the combination digital idekyc with open electronic payment provides crucial infrastructure support wide range transaction including ecommerce and service payment however the greatest potential transformation can achieved when combined with pillar iii fintech for financial inclusion pillar iii scaling use digitization government payment and provision servicespillar iiiiii infrastructurecan also support national pension system which can not only strengthen the social safety net but also provide additional financial resource support the economypillars and provide the foundation for access financial service and for digital financial system digital identification and simplified account opening under pillar form the basis for financial access well mechanism for addressing concern around market integrity the context the vast majority the population digital payment infrastructure and policy and regulatory framework for open access electronic payment system facilitates transaction and payment combined pillar and support wide range application and have the potential rapidly scale access the financial sector and the use payment mechanismshowever experience some jurisdiction have shown that pillar and pillar are not sufficient themselves dramatically increase access rather people need application that they find useful necessary and which pillar and pillar make work better than beforeperhaps the best example how this can supported through policy the digitization government payment service provision and related service especially utility payment whether stateowned controlled since government generally one the largest employer any economy beginning with simple electronic payment via pillar government salary into bank account via pillar can very effective way kickstarting the transformation digital finance this can then extended the electronic provision government transfer payment such pension and various form income support bank account this will typically need combined with some sort strategy encourage require account for all citizensperhaps the strongest application the payment utility tax and other form government payment these are the sort application that begin change people life important way reducing the stress queuing bank and other transaction cost well potentially increasing receiptswhile many government have experimented with electronic provision service and growing number are experimenting with range mandatory account approach these tend have limited effectiveness unless combined with pillar and pillar infrastructure programsare operating developing countriesonly transaction pakistani program for woman were initiated woman the rest were initiated male representative response the pakistan government adopted biometric technology ensure woman received the cash directlythis combination intensified the impact the third element the india stack strategy which provides government salary and service electronically through bank account similar approach been taken the jordan where benefit refugee are transferred electronically bank account established the basis biometric digital identification via the existing national payment system and delivered via iris scanequipped atm machinessuch system not only support financial inclusion empowerment and saving but also have the potential dramatically reduce leakage designed appropriately over time these system have the potential improve tax collection smes grow within the formal financial system addition simple saving the pillar iiiiii infrastructure can also support national pension system which can not only strengthen the social safety net but also provide additional financial resource support the economya electronic payment government salary and transfersfor the poor many country state statebacked support payment are very important financial inclusion policy focusing government payment the poor have two beneficial outcome first digital payment enable government shift from inkind assistance food water supply which come with significant delivery and accountability issue inexpensive cash transfer such payment reduce administrative cost better control leakage and increase transparency and accountability fintech for financial inclusion second account used for support payment once established are available used for nongovernment payment initiated the receiver once the unbanked gain access digital financial service through government support payment they can learn trust and deal electronic payment instead cash time government payment made electronically can undermine the custom which cash kingthere are many notable example governmentto person payment program aimed financially including the unbanked least program are operating developing country among the most prominent example probably the bolsa familia card program brazil established which covered around million family and quarter brazil population however most these project are not fully digital for instance the case bolsa familia brazil familias colombia and the benazir program pakistan debit card provided recipient who withdraw cash with the card and spend additional transaction further digitization these project face real challenge however according cgap percent account lowincome country and globally seem mailbox account used for only one two withdrawal per month similarly cgap research india found that percent the account opened for disbursement were showing only one monthly transaction withdrawal the total amount the benefit transfer cgap also examined the reason for this outcome which range from use limitation the account itself insufficient recipient and agent training using the account negative and risky experience recipient trying access and use these account the missing value proposition intermediary which translates into low quality product and customer service the center for financial inclusion highlight the need for payment process align with customer life pattern for instance pakistani program for woman mere percent transaction were initiated woman the rest were initiated male representative some whom were not even the age required under pakistan law response the pakistan government adopted biometric technology ensure woman received the cash directly hopefully empowering them decide how spend the money fintech and the design systemslooking experience with system around the world clear that fintech offer real potential for enhancing impact and the same time making pillar and useful for large number people providing the necessary scale which other product and service can growif properly designed payment have the potential advance financial inclusion but they often not underpin flourishing digital financial ecosystem the three following feature need addressed any system governmentdesigned account procedure should facilitate general unrestricted payment and include sufficient option and reserve for that purpose from the outset for instance the kenyan uduma card issued since february can used government counter least four major kenyan bank atm and merchant that accept major global credit card for any digital payment program succeed the digitaltoreal life gap must bridged when there are few digital transaction partner individual will prefer use cash this generally seen agent efficiency issue and provider will seek increase the number and liquidity agent given area adding incentive which eventually translate into cost however fully digital system there are agent and merchant can not business without accepting emoney they will provide the device accept emoney with without incentive and will find the most efficient mean therefore all start with eliquidity the customer side discouraging the exchange significant amount emoney into cash and slowly calibrating the amount depending the availability and acceptance system could viable strategy functionality must simple and reduce the need for training what one learns receiving government payment must enable the person make and receive other transfer for instance customized system that provides customer with the account information their most important dailyuse recipient such electricity and phone company and school could facilitate ease use fundamentally system appropriately designed can used trigger the flow money through account and electronic payment system once people begin using the digital financial system that infrastructure can then support much wider range service product and activity this exactly the process which have seen take place china particularly the context the alibaba and tencent ecosystem fintech for financial inclusion electronic payment and provision other core servicesthe combination pillar and iii addition core government service support range service payment particularly for utility and telecommunication service that fundamentally improve the life individual and enhance collection service provider the infrastructure for pillar and iii also support ecommerce which turn significant benefit for smes growing number business run large proportion their activity through ecommerce platformsgovernments can support digital transformation highlighting the advantage emoney setting limit for cash transaction the real economy requiring merchant offer digital payment low cost customer one example fiji where the program led greater digital inclusion with account function saving device from these foundation pillar focus infrastructure and system for more complex financial product and functionsd looking forward bridging the last milelooking forward the combination pillar and iii which offer the greatest potential bridge the gap the billion people who still lack financial access given that percent have access mobile phone appropriately designed strategy emphasising these three pillar have the potential bring the majority this group into the formal financial system the next decadeat the same time the global findex also highlighted that despite all the progress over the past decade the gender gap remains major challenge the context supporting financial inclusion among woman pillar iii system offer one way forward design government provision service target delivery government transfer and payment woman this will require consideration the context designing such system well the complementary pillar and pillar structure however digital finance offer the possibility bringing woman into the formal economy new way once the system comprising pillar and iii been established provides the framework empower individual all sort well business small and large well government use new and innovative waysnonetheless the fundamental digital divide remains those without access mobile smart phone the internet will not able access the fundamental framework payment saving and government service addition the digital divide within country there increasing risk digital divide between country which develop effective strategy and those which not pillar and iii offer framework for such strategy and combined with decreasing cost mobile and smart phone and increasing access offer path addressing many aspect financial inclusion and the digital divide going forwardpillar expanding the quality and range service designing financial market infrastructure and systemstogether pillar and iii provide the fundamental infrastructure and policy and regulatory environment for digital financial inclusion however they also provide the basis for the development broader ecosystem product and service that move beyond basic financial inclusion and digital efficiency pillar focus the design appropriate digital financial market infrastructure and policy and regulatory framework that support wider range valueadded financial service and product deepening financial access usage and stability pillar thus about the framework infrastructure and policy and regulatory environment support broader digital financial transformationpillars and iii support additional digital infrastructure increase the use and quality financial service financial stability and market integrity they are fundamental identity access payment saving and government transfer and service pillar allows for the provision investment opportunity particularly the context debt and equity market much lower cost the experience china kenya and india among others highlight how these system can used provide greater access investment product particularly government bond and support financial sector development more broadlywe are also seeing china and india but also many other country how the development digital financial infrastructure facilitates the entry innovative new provider however new product service and entrant can introduce regulatory concern regulator must continually seek understand new technology balance potential risk and opportunitiestogether the four pillar form package ecosystem digital financial infrastructure appropriate policy and regulatory environment supporting financial transformation and economic growth pillar and iii provide foundation for pillar but must also seen mutually reinforcing example pillar transformation include sme finance insurance and investment fintech for financial inclusion transforming credit provision from collateral and microfinance cashflowone the most exciting area where are seeing development the context credit for smescredit provision traditionally suffered from problem information asymmetry with bank specializing credit risk analysis costly process that make commercially unviable ass many individual and smes this approach relies heavily collateral cheaper alternative managing and analyzing credit risk but collateral often not available developing country where property right and other institutional framework may weak nonexistentthe traditional response this challenge create credit bureau that aggregate credit data and turn reduce overall cost term default loss for the industry digitization characterized disintermediation particularly for information intermediary the provider with the most accurate detailed and extensive digital information about customer the best position analyze that information and price credit and other financial service such insurance them superior comprehensive customer data may generated from software company aggregating information about user activity hardware company and iot company using sensor that continually monitor usage behavior and location social medium service facebook tencent and search engine google baidu providing insight into social preference and activity ecommerce providing insight into consumer preference and payment history and telecommunication service provider for example safaricom vodafone providing data mobile activitiesall this data then able analysed identify that which correlate with increased creditworthiness big data increasingly being used techfins large technology internet and telecommunication firm entering into financial service improve business decision these data set are often far better quality than those traditional financial institution big data provides far better picture close real time the real financial position the business individual applying for financial service for example the techfin will know whether certain receipt represents loan from another source income from customer sale from financial inclusion perspective techfins negate the need for interpersonal relation common traditional banking techfins can better adjust credit rate the risk the client and paradoxically can repersonalize the financial relationship via algorithm databased finance can simultaneously more attuned the real risk profile individual provided the databased methodology sound and more inclusive can provide tailored financial service much lower cost per clientrealworld example include amazon lending program small business seller and alipay consumer loan offering similar approach are being taken all country with high level tech penetration including kenya with safaricommpesa and indiathis one the most exciting development the use technology provide cash flowbased lending for individual and smes costeffective and riskprudent way given that substantial research revealed the major role smes play job creation and economic growth and that smes almost invariably have difficulty accessing finance this development the potential revolutionize access finance however this development requires the necessary foundational support adding insurance and investment saving and creditwhile online payment and lending are the heart most financial inclusion strategy they are not the whole story the investment sector also necessary this particularly true payment infrastructure designed nationally with participant subject the same systemic risk for instance case serious drought not only farmer are affected but also the financial institution that serve themin developed economy insurance and investment product make financial customer dependent their region and ensure risk are diversified both type financial service are necessary for thriving ecosystem for instance crop insurance help farmer recover from drought and investment product security investment fund unit that are segregated financial institution becomes insolvent protect the customer saving case fund bankruptcy digitization could address two major barrier financial inclusion these area access and transaction cost third advantage that online provider can reduce human bias particularly serious issue with longterm investment and pooled money management insurance this been widely discussed the context roboadvisers but also applies other type financial service that rely longterm cash flow plan the same time enhanced saving rate can strengthen local capital market and reduce the need depend upon volatilityenhancing foreign capitalfrom consumer protection perspective adding online insurance and investment both opportunity and challenge financial market risk are exchanged for other type risk for instance exposure insurance and investment increase the risk volatility and fraud since the exposure long term insurance and investment therefore require provider that are stable over many year another major issue the complexity longterm fintech for financial inclusion investment interestbased saving not fare well over long saving cycle but investment come with higher degree uncertainty and complexity that can encourage misselling and ponzi scheme been seen even the world most sophisticated financial market trust intermediary the heart liquid financial market investor can not control the risk their longterm investment many online micro insurance and investment scheme have been developed that commit financial inclusion principle some are being tested now and others are innovator the startup stage building better financial infrastructuretoday cloud iot blockchain and other technology are being used design better market and infrastructure particularly for payment system security clearing and settlement system early stage financing and trade and agricultural finance all these area and many more experiment proof concept pilot new busineses and model are all emerging offer better way approaching longstanding challenge likewise regulator and policymakers domestic and international are increasingly working with industry participant everwider variety background develop appropriate policy and regulatory approach balance opportunity and risk where possible building system and financial infrastructure that not only perform better from the standpoint market participant but also from the standpoint major regulatory and policy objective have discussed one key example the context system address market integrity and money laundering have the potential build better system matter deciding whether and how however maximising this potential requires the foundation the first three pillar described earlier the example gdpr psd mifideuropean digitalization the regional level developed bottom following the financial crisis starting with extensive reporting requirement and creating the need for intermediary and supervisor digitalize kickstarted the introduction extensive and purely digital reporting regulator and the imposition open banking where incumbent intermediary must share client data with innovative competitor europe digitalization strategy multidimensional compared india the european approach characterized lack centralized agenda rather the path determined need such those financial regulator better control systemic risk ensuring privacy world dominated datadriven firm the approach highlight that financial system digitize necessary carefully consider approach not only financial regulation but also competition and data security and protection each case there will need balancing objective across the three area financial policy competition policy and data protection and security policy makiba kenya for instance kenyan government bond can acquired through mobile account that rely the makiba scheme makiba enables digital saving kenyan government bond for retail investor well the trading those bond money raised from the issuance makiba earmarked for infrastructure development project kenya with the aim advance fintechsmakiba avoids the investment risk associated with regional global market access but doe not diversify regionallevel risk and depends the involvement the public sector this may disadvantage the kenyan government experience economic shock that threatens the ability the state budget serve loan regardless could function well starting point for investor unequipped deal with more sophisticated financial product fintech for financial inclusion developing comprehensive strategywhat broader lesson can draw from experience date strategic approachthe power our four pillar approach greatest when all are pursued and become mutually supporting and reinforcing implement this approach regulator and policymakers need develop understanding the range technology impacting the financial sector and the opportunity and risk they presentthis major focus area for afi particularly supporting national financial inclusion strategy many which refer specifically the use technology achieve their objective the framework presented here may provide guidance develop those strategy further especially they relate the role fintech for financial inclusionb the challenge technologyany fintechregtechbased approach financial inclusion must recognize that technology not perfect and can have unanticipated consequence for instance selflearning algorithm may enhance rather than mitigate bias the data they screen until technology are sufficiently advanced police the effect technology provider will need continuously and retroactively test the outcome algorithmic interpretation datasecond technology may exactly what developer anticipate but the issue may with the developer themselves financial history replete with fraud and every new technology will abused some individual recent example include the use virtual currency for drug trafficking and money laundering and the use initial coin offering defraud investorsparticipants third technology always accelerating and creating space for group new entrant which make the role the regulator ever more challenging many case this will require regulator respond using technology regtech includes automation and datadriven analysis internal control system compliance risk management audit and internal and external reporting fintech also raise broader issue how approach the regulation innovationfull panoply regulation return regulator require applicant incorporate appropriate safeguard there are currently over sandbox that have been announced are operation eligibility enter sandbox standardized and publicized requiring market participant articulate their added value predefined format this cost effective for participant and resource effective for regulatorsthe number entity regulator sandbox typically very small and exemption from regulation not the most important aspect for instance pioneering sandbox established the financial conduct authority there were participant cohort one and cohort two our research suggests that sandbox play two far more important role and both should appeal developing country regulator first establishing sandbox sends strong message fintechs that the regulator open innovation second provides important learning opportunity for regulator especially when coupled with innovation hub which typically portal through which innovative startup can interact with the regulator and seek their advice and bespoke waiver adjustment licensing condition sandbox and innovation hub can change traditional dynamic the industry come see the regulator entity they can approach for assistance with regulatory challenge rather than distant policeman avoided the australian security and investment commission asic series proactive move managed achieve this cultural shift with combination innovation hub regulatory sandbox and digital finance advisory committee which meet quarterly and includes representative from industry industry association and all relevant regulatory agency the number really highlight the effectiveness innovation hub relative regulatory sandbox asic case from march august asic innovation hub dealt with entity and provided informal assistance and advice those granted new credit licence and varied existing licence compare these figure with the six entity that slightly shorter period took advantage asic regulatory sandbox the experience seems that very few potential entrant qualified for the relatively strict sandbox requirement and that nearly every potential entrant required the more bespoke approach that the hub facilitates furthermore while hub admittedly far more demanding regulatory resource than sandbox this demand regulator time also major advantage hub facilitates more interactive twoway knowledge exchange vital for regulator this field keep them right the cuttingedge development the technology regulatory sandbox piloting and testandlearn approachesone recent development that the potential expand financial inclusion regulatory sandbox regulatory sandbox structured safe harbor for experimentation basic level the sandbox creates environment for business test product without having meet the however sandbox alone will not guarantee financial transformation will likely provide limited assistance and most useful when jurisdiction exhibit the following characteristic strong rule law and transparency regulation time market the main barrier innovation fintech for financial inclusion fintech for financial inclusion risk corruption low the ecosystem advance social business model and functional substitute the sandbox are not availablethese functional substitute include balanced reform financial regulation such removal red tape legislation and established waiver practice with transparent reasoning why waiver granted should noted that regulator can achieve the most important feature sandbox indepth discussion with innovative firm without sandbox experience australia and elsewhere suggests innovation hub which facilitates knowledge exchange between supervisor and innovative firm more important regulatory innovation hub and sandbox not depend one another balancing financial inclusion with other regulatory objectivesconsumer protection key digital financial inclusion one promising option for regulatory restriction embedded technologically the product protect customer from risk these restriction would based exposure and the ability bear risk and would substitute for current blanket restriction access financial servicesa reasonable approach never aim for full access all kind financial service for all segment society protect customer adequately and proportionately any policy must restrict access product considered too risky for people with low financial literacy such certain derivative currency trading and those that provide extensive leverage however the outcome always asymmetric paternalistic system which people with higher level financial literacy have access wider range financial product envisage that customer will instead assessed their income education experience and wealth and categorized class whereby access risky product controlled depending the class into which they fall this approach would also align ethical restriction with customer choice and preference for instance customer that qualify for risky product but want avoid leverage for religious reason islamic finance because they not trust themselves use leverage wisely would able opt outin the context challenge around the digital divide well around financial literacy design such system should interact with educational and public awareness system addition infrastructure and regulatory structuresthe fintech aspect this classification that criterion can set reviewed and adjusted automatically daily basis application can follow datadriven rule and outcome can supervised using regtech fact central the design many system will considering how technology may used achieve better regulatory outcome the core regtech for this happen system are designed there need not only for balanced and proportionate approach which consider the possibility developing better system through new technology but also building into these system regulatory feature through digitization regulatory and compliance process allowing better use datification tool such machine learning and provide clearer picture the financial system and participant regulator and policymakerse designing regulatory system the example mexicoan increasing number jurisdiction are developing specific regulatory approach fintech given the speed change law and regulation should focus objective and principle rather than detailed rule mexico provides very good example comprehensive approach focused general objective and principlesmexico financial technology law came into effect march the law regulates the registration and operation nonbanks offering access finance investment the issuance digital money and the exchange cryptocurrency the law also deal with related issue such crowdfunding regulatory sandbox roboadvisory service and apis several authority have been given supervisory power under the law the law also established the committee financial technology institution grant authorization prospective fintech institution well the fintech council industry advisory body with representative from both the private and public sector participate the regulatory sandbox company may apply for temporary authorization for two year during which they can trial their service small number customer mexico law comprehensive with balance regulation that protect consumer such supervisory power and authorization requirement and promote innovation such the regulatory sandbox significantly the approach based regulatory principle rather than tied specific technology type business product looking forward such principlesbased approach will key successful regulatory development key however for regulator and policymakers understand what taking place around them understanding new technology and trend necessary order approach risk and opportunity balanced fashion fintech for financial inclusion fintech for financial inclusion looking forwardalmost half the world unbanked live seven country china india pakistan indonesia nigeria mexico and bangladesh dramatic progress been made china and india and similar strategy for digital financial inclusion have been developed indonesia mexico pakistan and bangladesh many other country are developing similar strategy support the transformation offered digital financethe transformation that occurred china underway india and likely occur many other developing country and emerging market economy creating major new challenge these include the risk permanent digital divide within and between economy well cybersecurity and data protection issue strategy develop digital financial infrastructure rest the availability communication infrastructure and offer the greatest potential country with high smartphone penetration rate and inefficient financial system while financial inclusion remains challenge many country the cost smartphones falling rapidly and the construction supporting infrastructure proceeding apace most market especially urban and semiurban area the combination pillar and iii offer tremendous potential address those with access mobile particularly smart phone but without financial access this the metric where this strategy offer the greatest potential for rapid transformation the coming decadea key risk the emergence insurmountable digital divide between country that provide the condition support smartphone access and develop strategy for digital financial infrastructure similar the one this report and those that not can not this fundamentally issue governmental effectiveness and institutional and policy framework going forward peerbased organization such afi have the potential for significant influence this respect positive example make their way around the worldin addition digital divide emerging between country there are also divide within country that are posing major challenge for example financial access often varies greatly between more affluent urban dweller and poor rural resident and the elderly the global findex also highlighted that the gender gap financial inclusion not closed and afi commendably made this focus under the denauru action plan respect the last mile and particular genderbased disparity digital financial inclusion the combination pillar and iii offer tremendous potential particularly the context the design pillar iii system area for future attention going forwardwhile the fourpillar strategy outlined this paper will not solve all financial inclusion challenge designed address the vast majority them efficiently thereby freeing resource focus the remaining one with appropriate framework digital infrastructure and enabling policy and regulatory
