defined the three pillar meaning that company asking for money positively satisfies them will obtain loan proposal the platform the above factor are the following quantitative element such percentage revenue increase financial ratio such current ratio current asset over current liability debt equity ratio gross profit percentage gross profit over gross sale roa net income over total asset and roe

investor the process lending start opening account and give few personal information and more specific detail about the amount money lend the desired interest rate and the duration the investment basically each investor participates placing bid loan request which corresponds the amount money the investor willing lend for this purpose each platform allows investor decide whether set the investment automatically automatic way through the algorithm the platform using the called handpicking business way that permit the lender set hisher own criterion lending him her self particular this form allows investor decide the business which heshe willing lend money choosing among those that satisfy specific requirement such risk band the region which the borrower operates the sector the business the reason for the loan company financials etc and have independent assessment the company financial position order minimize the credit risk single offer split into multiple chunk that will finance microloans different borrower for instance investment may split into different request each this case the risk associated with single borrower spread among multiple investor and potential loss may result small share the total investment according the information given the investor the platform match the investor proposal with the loan demand which are close once the match done the borrower the right choose whether accept the financing and case acceptance heshe will receive the fund the lender will then receive hisher capital plus the relative interest monthly instalment finally the repayment can recycled into new loan withdrawn the lender case recycling the new loan will the latest interest rate provided the marketplace which mean that the loan book rate will evolve overtime figure the step the lending process source httpwwwlendfundcomhowitworkshtml how capital move between party within the entire process the money borrowed and lent the party held the platform their behalf within segregated bank account known payment account which can freely opened the platform correspondent bank simply the party bank account the account not part the platform asset which mean that would not available creditor case insolvency the intermediary case missed payment most platform will appoint debt collection agency pursue the payment due unless until default the borrower would occur furthermore mitigate the credit risk many platform provide contingency fund which used repay capital loss lender the event borrower default this fund built charge the borrower which normally pay small percentage fee together with the monthly instalment legally the fund owned trustee separated company how much doe cost the total cost borrowing money determined two factor the interest paid investor and the fee paid the platform the interest rate typically set the platform and based the risk associated with the amount the loan and the length the repayment term the higher the length term the higher will the risk this lead higher interest rate pay and consequently higher yield for the investor during the lending process each loan grade assigned annual percentage rate apr that refers the cost borrowing money yearly basis apr allows the borrower quickly compare different loan and includes the interest rate well fee necessary finance the loan normally fee are charged the total loan amount lent and are around per annum across the whole market commission selling fee are charged either the amount left outstanding the loan the original investment amount depending the type platform performance fee can charged lender profit risk crowdfunding although crowdfunding market much bigger and characterized big player there are whole range risk face this paragraph will provide the description the major risk associated with peertopeer lending and equity crowdfunding solution for what concern the loanbased option the main risk are lender side and they can described follow credit risk the biggest difference between putting money into bank and turning this alternative finance solution that the risk borrower default shift from the bank the lender which may have capital loss platform insolvency may happen that online platform blow due undisclosed loss lack control failure role intermediary between lender and borrower interest rate risk the event increase the interest rate some longer term loan might become unattractive and this would cause lack liquidity due the fact that many investor may decide move back conventional deposit however there doubt that equity crowdfunding riskier than the lending solution especially when involves unquoted company the main risk associated with this kind model related decision making through platform investor have access

bank should take this chapter will provide the analysis strength weakness opportunity and threat fintech industry with particular focus alternative finance sector order formulate the conclusion the present study next page will analyse how bank may decide approach these phenomenon better compete collaborate this last chapter will try answer this question evaluating what are the main advantage staying swot analysis the analysis different operating business model allows gather many information about value proposition and competitive advantage that characterize and distinguish alternative financial solution with respect traditional one however also got aware about the risk associated with these model order recap all the main positive and negative feature and outline potential opportunity and threat next paragraph will propose swot analysis that mix the common characteristic fintech and alternative finance since they are strictly connected vistrengths alternative finance absence legacy operating cost one the most important advantage fintech company relies the cost advantage company operating alternative finance not face operating cost typically linked bank extensive branch network and system this requires bank sustain huge amount cost that could saved the figure above demonstrates figure the cost advantage fintech marketplace lender source lending club website regulatory advantage the aftermath financial crisis banking regulation become more stringent forcing bank respect certain capital requirement improve the ability financial institution absorb shock and avoid further collapse all resulting lower efficiency and lack possible innovation fintech company instead are subject light regulation with capital requirement and some case platform operating certain type alternative finance solution will join some exemption higher flexibility while bank not have too much flexibility term opening time fintech company make financial transaction and customer finance available from any place speed fintech company provide more speed term time process the loan application which approximately take day against approximately month took bank the process includes the process investigation the potential borrower the loan listing into the marketplace and the lending process see figure this represents big advantage especially for situation where business need liquidity figure loan bank loan source funding circle website technological advantage fintech company are totally digital and totally based technology innovation collateral requirement alternative finance solution not require collateral indeed marketplace lender offer unsecured lending favouring small business which very often have stable cash flow but tangible collateral that bank could lend against more efficiency fintech company use any paperwork letting customer stay home and access financial service directly onto the web this result bureaucracy issue and more efficiency customer experience differently from bank fintech able offer customer the experience reach what they need with few click whenever and wherever they want viweaknesses alternative finance low customer base element that can negative affect the development nonbanks player activity the lack existing customer faced fintech company which may find difficult acquire them costeffectively most case lack reputation from the moment that fintech new phenomenon that still growing nonbank player can suffer from lack reputation due the low level awareness among the public information asymmetry big weakness the market represented imperfect information affecting smes and online platform which result market failure many smes only approach the largest bank when seeking finance although large number these application are rejected rejection rate part these are viable and are rejected simply because they not meet the risk profile the largest bank however there are often challenger bank smaller institution and alternative finance provider with different business model that may willing lend these smes but many case challenger bank and other provider finance are unable offer finance they are not aware the existence such smes and the smes are not aware the existence these alternative source finance opportunity alternative finance leverage existing infrastructure fintech company may take advantage from the possibility join coopetition and find way engage with the existing ecosystem bank specific paragraph argue about this topic will proposed next innovation the use big data and credit scoring model big data and advanced analytics offer potential predict customer next best action understand customer need and deliver financial service new way credit underwriting bank often operates with case law mindset and relies heavily precedent world where more than data been created the last two year fintech data experiment hold promise for new product and service well evaluates more accurate the creditworthiness borrower marketplace lender use heavily datadriven and semiautomated risk assessment method which bank may not have foundation capital defined the access new data possibility outfico fico the best loan marketplace have developed their own data source and algorithm evaluate potential borrower new insight can gleaned from data source that incumbent have not even begun consider retail bank not have access these data but foundation capital pointed out they lack the analytics and organizational focus lead even keep with this growing field new marketplace the

friend and family alternative finance platform rather than bank increasing government support some country government initiate launch series initiative intended support the development nonbank player help match smes rejected for loan large bank with alternative finance provider vithreats alternative finance borrower default the biggest risk associated with alternative finance solution the risk that borrower default and investor will loose money fraud serious threat the risk turning fraudulent platform recent case fraud affected the leading company lending club which sold nonconforming loan

opportunity threat leverage existing infrastructure innovation the use big data and credit scoring model customer referral government support borrower default operator insolvency fraud opportunity threat for bank how bank respond alternative finance financial institution have multiple approach respond the potential disruption alternative finance while some year ago the great attitude bank avoid the rise such new phenomenon today thing have changed let new trend emerging particular there are more strategy that bank are taking into account for remaining competitive into the new space financial service and they are analysed follow competing depending strategic goal bank may decide develop own alternative finance platform thus becoming direct competitor existing marketplace lender this way small business owner that doe not meet the bank credit andor profitability criterion and consequently see hisher loan application rejected can obtain the fund well particular with hybrid lending strategy the bank can guarantee part the loan balance sheet based risk appetite while listing the rest online lending platform where investor lend the money off balance sheet slightly higher interest rate however deciding approach the competing solution may have some difficulty such the risk for bank cannibalise own product and higher cost implementation collaborating the collaborative solution provides the bank act investor purchasing loan from alternative finance player this case bank make contractual arrangement with online platform buy their loan and diversify their investment into segment that are not normally subject traditional lending example existing partnership between marketplace lender and financial institution include the british business bank development bank wholly owned the government provided ratesetter with investment and for each loan that qualifies under agreed criterion the bank will one the investor for this loan they agreed create strategic alliance under which union bank purchase personal loan through lending club platform the two company work together create new credit product made available both company customer base this strategic relationship brings together lending club low operating cost and union bank strong balance sheet and large customer base both company focus responsible lending and customer service which help unlock lower rate and superior service both company customer from lending club perspective this strategic alliance the way leverage union bank strength consisting high reputation for transparency high quality product and customer service from union bank perspective instead this the chance invest high quality asset and new product while the core business borsadelcreditoit just the lending for amount that they not lend given their role intermediary higher than those imposed the bank italy there are support from the partner bank this case deutsche bank that provides such payment the platform limit itself make first investigation potential borrower then pass the practice the bank that eventually meet the customer provide the funding partnering create partnership attractive opportunity for many institutional investor and work two way that involve partnership program with the local government and other governmental institution creating partnership agreement between bank and platform the first partnership requires financial institution refer customer who not meet traditional lending criterion marketplace lender this way customer can apply for loan cobranded website this mutually beneficial arrangement enables platform access more borrower while bank can leverage the platform technology screen their current customer for consumer loan refinancing the the country whereby the above partnering solution the most developed also thanks the government action establishing the mandatory referral scheme for high street bank which being implemented under the small business enterprise and employment act this program obliges the most higher street bank refer any small and mediumsize business whose loan application been rejected the option turn down for credit alternative finance platform the second way partnering requires financial institution institute process which borrower fulfil loan application lending platform infrastructure and receive loan from the financial institution date range bank from small large national and international institution are partnering with many existing marketplace lender help make smaller loan and take advantage low cost structure others instead partnering with the aim join product development example existing partnership between marketplace lender and financial institution include funding circle supported the british business bank the british business bank and subsidiary not offer bank account take deposit provide regulated banking service but provides financial support smaller business through delivery partner any decision provide finance smaller business are made funding circle not the british business bank they work together help business accessing the daytoday banking solution lending club made partnership with alliance partner which manages the bancalliance network national consortium community bank through this partnership member bancalliance are able offer access cobranded personal loan their customer through lending club platform well purchase certain these consumer loan and others for their portfolio this program designed give community bank and their customer access lending club benefit relying low cost operation compared with the bank low the british business bank provides finance smaller business deploying fund through partner intermediary that now include alternative finance platform such funding circle zopa ratesetter martkeinvoice and urica date the british business bank supported billion finance small business cost capital help drive down the cost credit for consumer mark pitkin president ceo bancalliance member sugar river bank commented partnering with lending club through bancalliance our bank can offer access responsible product our customer while the same time acquiring asset with which are very familiar and that offer higher return than many alternative former regulator also appreciate having access the legal regulatory compliance and credit expert bancalliance that helped vet the lending club program according the program the bank are committed buy certain amount loan from lending club which will check borrower ability repay the borrower come either from the bank own customer who the bank send lending club website come directly lending club now instead analysing the loan their own the bank rely lending club software which datadriven process evaluate borrower ability repay this help small bank extend credit borrower with lower credit score than they previously served and build pool those loan the effort aimed helping small bank overcome the cost underwriting large pool loan while also meeting regulatory requirement the wall street journal wwwwsjcom morgan chase turned deck platform provide loan smes through this partnership morgan chase offer smalldollar business loan many four million small business account using ondeck underwriting technology able give quick approval and funding for their loan short loan are chase branded and kept chase balance sheet but ondeck provides the loan servicing special white label program for chase exchange ondeck receives origination fee well servicing fee each loan acquiring acquiring fintech company another option that bank may decide consider choosing the current option requires all carefully manage the risk that are brought closer the parent company hampering growth and killing the viability the product example include simple working independent business operating parallel with bbva banking operation bbva compass bancshares inc working together allows bbva and simple combine simple expertise user experience design and technology with the operational expertise and global reach bbva this will help simple develop new innovative product and service while enabling the company expansion transforming the advent digital disruption change the ecosystem and all bank know that they want survive they have change transforming into digital company that are able stay closer the need digital customer date the number financial institution that have taken this strong reorganisational decision still very limited because this operation requires bank invest much money into technological process the example successful transformation the follow after seven year work bbva finally transformed itself and achieved the state art platform including all product and service and employee that are now working digitally this result into increase the number transaction processed daily from million million incubating other strategy follow the principle you can beat them join them many bank are not launching incubator accelerator such space where startup can grow and collaborate with third party gain better insight into their technology example include barclays tech accelerator and intesa sanpaolo startup initiative investing number financial institution are establishing venture fund actively invest startup one the most recent case includes unicredit one the leading european commercial bank and anthemis group the leading financial service technology venture and advisory firm which have announced new joint investment venture unicreditevo dedicated initiative focused unicredit evo exclusively identifying and investing bestinclass financial technology startup with initial capital commitment million from unicredit the initiative target mid stage startup and followon investment more mature and established fintech business well early stage digitally native financial service startup working more pioneering solution the aim the investment help unicredit accelerate the digitalization banking group through investment partnership unicredit and anthemis will cover the entire lifecycle emerging fintech company with primary focus europe and north america the initiative will span across the early startup idea phase maturity and apply different field retail banking and consumer finance investment and corporate banking wealth and asset management capital market and trading payment and financial data technology and infrastructure the source unicredit website the coo and deputy general manager unicredit paolo fiorentino noted thanks this partnership are ramping our digital transformation building new business model maximize the combined strength traditional market player and newcomer bank have the resource financial expertise and large customer base that can complement startup innovation this will turn boost our digitalization enabling better adapt the everevolving need our customer today anthemis becomes key partner this journey leveraging their wide expertise anthemis will help identify top class player and opportunity that will drive innovation and ultimately help better serve our customer conclusion the aim this thesis understand how the evolution disrupting alternative finance reshaping the sector financial service and what are the major impact incumbent for decade major bank have faced minor disruption from the invention the automated teller machine atm the arrival new technology the difference that while those innovation came from within the large bank and most were driven internally bank themselves the current revolution more profound today bank live global economic and financial context characterised more strictly regulation and the aftereffect the financial crisis that leaded bank reduce their lending activity principal cause financial trouble smes this situation individual and business consumer have begun approach financial product and service different way embracing new challenger platform get financing and satisfy their financial need customer need are changed aim direct access their capital everywhere and any moment overthrowing physical distance and bureaucracy issue customer expectation rely fast and painless digital banking experience and expects incumbent offer something similar most bank instead are not prepared meet these expectation from the moment that they are still strictly linked the traditional concept banking characterised the presence huge amount branch inflexible opening time and paper document these factor together with stringent regulatory framework which continues pile pressure ensure that bank develop sufficient protection prevent further financial collapse and poor data management system hamper financial institution quickly respond consumer need all this result increase cost infrastructure loss efficiency and lack the opportunity for bank invest technology and customer experience the contrary fintech challenger and particular alternative finance solution provide everything bank are not able offer becoming more agile efficiently responding customer expectation indeed they have built business based total digitalisation that allows nonbank player dismiss the physical presence infrastructure and paper documentation and the possibility for customer access their capital and financial transaction wherever they are context whereby payment system lost physicality furthermore fintech company rely technological advanced datadriven approach that permit gather significant amount personal data such level education current and previous job living situation hobby and interest etc different from those accessed bank better ass worthiness client date there almost online platform operating alternative banking solution the total amount investment fintech nearly billion and growing fast across the year well the level awareness associated with the fintech company this the time where financial institution have choose how approach this phenomenon whether compete collaborate the time where disrupting evolution infancy bank tended move toward the competition approach facing the risk cannibalise their own product now that the industry maturing and becoming mainstream the attitude incumbent changing too from this study emerges that the number large financial institution that are approaching alternative finance solution collaborative way increasing and significant number integrating and strategic partnership between incumbent and challenger have been developed resulting wintowin situation bank figured out the importance being technological advanced and got aware that fintech player are not their direct substitute but can their partner enhance and accelerate the level digitalization banking sector partnering mean leverage each other strength create the best possible ecosystem where bank get the opportunity fill their gap and reduce the risk being marginalized within the sector being proactive would allow bank improve technical innovation get the speed responding customer need expand credit lower operating expense and finally increase the level creativity that they would become able offer customer the experience they are looking for these online process reduce the loanclose cycle while improving accountability transparency and efficiency furthermore providing better customer experience will also increase revenue and harden loyalty among the customer base the same time developing integrating partnership would give fintech company the opportunity get the feature they need particular what alternative finance solution need capital since regulation forbids the possibility lend own money more liquidity operating license and good reputation reach broad range customer based the above evidence question about the future bank and financial service are coming light date difficult state for sure what will next because the phenomenon fintech and alternative finance are still more recent and many country are starting experiencing them now however the result the present study give important contribution fix what are the future action that should taken ensure the success new market that involves collaboration between both the sector financial service and digitalized player from fintech perspective the analysis the whole regulation currently force highlighted some weakness the system based nonhomogeneous regulatory framework among european country most which use their local legislation regulate the development the different form alternative finance furthermore other country like italy the study show that there still poor regulatory structure for what concern certain type financing solution all this result lack efficiency and opportunity join from international capital flow and cross border activity that have seen very limited another relevant obstacle that emerged from this study the level awareness among customer about the existence alternative finance player although statistic show big increase the level global investment there are still potential customer investor and borrower that are not aware about the potential fintech company the contrary there are even challenger bank that not know about individual and smes trouble order solve these serious gap initiative from local government and international authority are needed sustain the development and success such these new phenomenon particular for what concern the nonhomogeneous regulatory framework the effort the european commission build capital market union can considered only primary step that will surely bring some economic and financial opportunity for what about increasing the level awareness among customer whereas further institutional way sustain growth and success alternative finance model may rely the effort government invests into promoting campaign and the implementation some program the case the that implemented the referral scheme for high street bank from bank
