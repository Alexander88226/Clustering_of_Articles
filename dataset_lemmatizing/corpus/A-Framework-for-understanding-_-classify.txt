muie brian donnellan school business nuim giovannimaccani muie briandonnellan muie nuim abstract the the ecosystem government objective transition smart city herald new possibility for urban data business model address pressing city challenge and digital transformation imperative urban data business model are not well understood due such factor the maturity the market and limited available research within this domain understanding the barrier and challenge urban data business type model development well opportunity for incumbent and new entrant therefore the aim this paper develop framework for understanding and classifying urban data business model udbm this paper embedded case study method derive the framework analyzing publicly funded and supported business model experiment that address pressing city challenge under one initiative this research contributes the scholarly discourse business model innovation the context smart city introduction essential the paradigm smart city response increasing urban population environmental pressure budgetary restraint legacy system ongoing city development and renewal well policy and rationale for bottom city engagement and participation opened new possibility for innovative business model propositioning urban data focused solution response pressing city challenge and digital transformation imperative here define urban relating town city reviewing existing definition urban data and urban big data define urban data data concerning one more town city spatial region physical social cultural political economic environment thus urban data about town city region citizen infrastructure business government and natural environment etc for example citymapper offer wayfinding across several european city leveraging such source open urban transport data order offer mobile app based solution recent year business activity focused developing pilot demonstrating prototype with some offering commercial solution city however the sustaining and scaling ecosystem urban data business model proved slow and some case fraught with difficultly compared previous data driven business model through open data from the public private sector other data marketplace the context urban data herald specific technical sociopolitical ethical and economic challenge etc urban data may existing data that can purchased reused for free even generated though development sensing technology crowdsourcing initiative these process create value network comprising different actor which significantly add complexity business model creation digitization and datadriven innovation datification urban context overcome additional challenge therefore need flavored data becomes seen the new oil and critical source new insight for city policy translating research effort the focused developing marketplace and supporting social innovation through the use urban data through various capacity building exercise thus the playing central role promoting fostering and facilitating economic development and new business creation some the most popular example include federated living lab like organicity support innovation and sbir small business innovation research precommercial procurement mechanism promote innovation and collaboration among entity sector business and across city regard governmental funding and support market make new urban data ecosystem funding research interoperability and encourage address standard experimentation exponential growth innovative value proposition this regard vendor have struggled developing sustainable business model due continuing lag standard interoperability data model iot and innovation may themselves initiative lead this for for and logic supplier customer stakeholder the major benefit section concludes comparing the framework existing work and identifying future research work related work weill and vitale describe business model the description the role and relationship among firm consumer customer ally and supplier that identifies the major flow product information and money and participant osterwalder defined business model conceptual tool that contains set element and their relationship and allows expressing the business logic specific firm despite the presence myriad business model definition there are few central tenet that are common across definition such value creation the consideration crucial value creating activity performed party external the company such complementors comprehensive approach explain the value creation logic company however business model definition are static and often fail give sense firm action analysis business model give more dynamic sense firm the dynamic perspective key identify firm journey towards establishing sustainable competitive advantage however the two widely accepted view industry positioning view and dynamic capability view discus the condition for competitive advantage but not elaborate the journey towards industry positioning view proposes truly differentiated position within industry that can defended achieve competitive advantage dynamic capability view argues that such advantage can only attained developing competency that are hard replicate moreover mcgrath argues that business model innovation move for competitive advantage can neither strictly categorized positional move nor capability move also the dynamic setting technology based business impossible visualize the constraint that eventually prove competitively important the time decision pertaining business model innovation need such case experimentation the preferred strategist tool choice than analysis further business model evolution path dependent early experiment often shape the future business model also draw from the business ecosystem literature for this study the evergrowing interconnectedness associated with the networked economy prompted the research community refocus business ecosystem moore explains business ecosystem allegory natural ecosystem order present the made telecommunication network maturity well budgetary constraint city etc hoped that critical mass differing urban data type and source will unlock new opportunity for urban data focused business model establishing network synergy urban data ecosystem scaling crucial factor realizing these opportunity minimum viable business case for vendor could depend multicitycountry takeup offering this and multicountry experimentation vendor needed develop solution compatible across differing politicalculturalenvironmentalsocial context regard multicity despite academic debate how conceptualize business model there agreement that business model articulates value creation within the existing literature there have been some effort formulating business model dimension classification taxonomy datadriven digital service concept definition across the data value chain business model for open data and data driven business model though study developed framework that can apply consistent language and lens organisation focusing urban data solution such framework can fruitful for researcher analytical lens identifying and understanding challenge across the value network developing urban data business model identifying opportunity for value proposition and related urban data substantiating commercially successful type urban data business model out there thus pose the following research question business model combination and what are the related value generating element that inform differentiated value proposition and related urban data business model address the research question case study the project organicity and the experimental case funded and supported derive urban data business model framework these case are addressing city prescribed urban challenge developing innovative urban data business model through open innovation cocreation and some case multicity experimentation method realworld the remainder this paper organized follows section overview the related literature business model business model experimentation and existing framework and taxonomy data driven business model section describes the method including the case and sample section describes the validated framework derived from the casestudy finally and table related study research question framework analyse and compare ddbms taxonomy data driven business model identify the dimension data driven business model develop taxonomy develop taxonomy fintech business model what characterizes data driven digital service how can data driven digital service clustered domain data driven business model data driven business model fintech business model data service iot business model methodology deductive study from existing literature combination deductive and inductive approach inductive study combination deductive and inductive approach author hartmann engelbrecht schmidt aya turber design science research develop framework that capture specific iot driven ecosystem company should business way together ecosystem comprise multiple actor working together that contributes the ecosystem core purpose despite having seemingly unrelated value proposition hence the business ecosystem view includes network actor unlike that conventional value chain view which focus delivering single value proposition the end customer from ecosystem point view next review framework that map actor business ecosystem that are closely connected the urban data ecosystem table snapshot related study domain where data play vital role hartmann framework deal with data driven business model their study defines data driven business model the business with data key resource though hartmann acknowledge that this criterion used for determining whether business model data driven not ambiguous given the ubiquitous importance data all the business model moreover despite the use multiple case study cluster business model the framework development study based reasoning develop the framework moreover the framework characterization various second order element leave scope for redundancy which turn translate multicollinearity between explanatory variable during cluster analysis schmidt have developed similar taxonomy for fintech business model however study used hartmann framework for representing fintech business model that were further clustered derive cluster when put together represent the fintech ecosystem turber proposed framework map iot business model space with dimension representing the who where and why business model while the study represents interesting way inductive case lack their and consumerorganization mapping value creation across the ecosystem doe not focus capturing various intricacy associated with value creation capture configuration and delivery engelbrecht too map data driven business model dimensional decision tree the three dimension data source usernonuser target audience technological effort highlow derived from study involving expert interview the decision tree used map data driven business model into category like hartmann engelbrecht work help identify the higher order dimension central data driven business model however unlike hartmann engelbrecht not represent the granularity sub dimension composing data driven business model final aya study data service focus service interaction between customer and service provider the study focus the key activity necessary understand data driven digital service data acquisition insight utilization and service interaction based the review related literature identified the higherorder dimension urban data business model with which investigate case derive framework although various business model ontology matrix etc identify various dimension business model follow hartmann approach which been utilized researcher focusing the most commonly cited dimension business model hence the higher level dimension the framework explore consist key resource key activity target customer revenue model value proposition cost structure have adopted value proposition focused definition the business model empirically data exploitation for figure case organicity crosseuropean funding support and capability mechanism for experimentation new urban data driven solution that address pressing city challenge model experimentation service facility essence federated living lab infrastructure across several european city london santander aarhus with the goal enabling and supporting innovative urban data solution ranging from environmental pollution monitoring new form citizen engagement work with city defining city challenge fund with core principle cocreation and real world experimentation funding and supporting the defining problem and reaching solution the rationale for federated multicity support and living lab flavoured principle are encourage the sustainability and scalability the solution support experimenter with toolkit both capability that can aid experimentation well privacy ethical and methodological guidance carrying out emerging furthermore examined for this study for instance company that produce sensor measure urban data may not qualify unless they include data management service their offering portfolio thus define urban data business model business model where urban data central the value proposition this implicitly implies urban data key resource methodology research design the udbm context given nature argue the conventional dichotomy between the social and the technical problematic technical and social choice are constantly negotiated and socially constructed therefore also given the exploratory nature this study interpretivist approach been chose address the from ontological perspective this mean that investigate udbm development complex phenomenon that contingent several social actor and activity order capture this richness inductive qualitative interpretive case study method found suitable although there are numerous definition yin defines the scope case study follows case study empirical inquiry that investigates contemporary phenomenon within reallife context especially when the boundary between phenomenon and context are not clearly evident hence case study research qualitative approach which the investigator explores bounded system case specific settingcontext over time through detailed indepth data collection holistic case study shaped qualitative approach focusing single unit analysis whereby embedded case study involves subunit analysis which focus different salient aspect level the case these subunit are specific and for answering the overall research question analysis each subunit completed withinlevel before betweenlevel analysis occurs inductive qualitative case study researcher usually combine multiple data collection method and keep the data collection and analysis process flexible multiple source data were leveraged provide stronger substantiation construct the element the framework interpretive case study outside observer walsham argues that interview are the primary data source since through this method that the researcher can best access the interpretation that participant have regarding the action and event which have are taking place and the view and aspiration themselves and other participant relevant aspect mobility over half the case related environmental solution education air quality vegetation sound water waste health social welfare housing security disabled health multidomain parking wayfinding carpooling tourism urban planning government procurement and sport forty three percent had iot based experimental element most these sensor based whilst the remainder concerned mobile apps web platform data innovation hardware based data interaction many relied api whilst some drew social medium platform validated framework this section describe the validated framework derived from analysis the case use example from the variety case where necessary illustrate inclusion the subdimensions though this been restrained due the need for brevity detail all the case can accessed through the organicity website wwworganicityeu the framework figure presented appendix the bottom this paper key resource data term key resource both engelbrecht and hartmann distinguish data source the key resource for hartmann this classified internal and external data whereby internal data concern data generated through crowdsourcing sensing tracking existing source internal data repurposed deliver the value proposition external data data acquired externally and further differentiated such factor freely available data web tracked data open data social medium data etc the other hand engelbrecht differentiated data source user data and non user data however argue that sourcing the data key activity and not key resource whereby hartmann data generation and data acquisition activity instead argue data the key resource should focus the nature the data the company generates repurposes procures through the activity the nature the data key resource can then looked term characteristic for delivering the value proposition for example open data comprising realtime geospatial pollution data may procured from the city and overlayed with geospatial mobility customer provided data already capture experiment this regard organicity gone through two open call fund and support over european experimenter ranging from startup sme grassroots movement ideating and developing prototype that acquire and leverage urban data deliver urban data driven ecosystem thus contributing realising the smart city many these experiment develop leverage iot mobile and web apps soft sensing interface and open data the first open call open individual association organisation business legally registered and awarded funding for each experiment euro well support and resource evaluation proposal for experimentation the organicity experiment evaluation committee eec this committee consisted two external expert organicity technical team member and one representative for each cluster city aarhus london santander proposal were evaluated term the novelty impact and feasibility the idea and the experimentation proposed with cocreation expected experimentation experiment experimentation understood term planning staffing cocreation activity testing prototyping and evaluation and reporting each experiment group had appointed experiment lead who coordinated the group and responsible for providing feedback organicity pillar the the experimenter data collection casestudying organicity interviewed over interviewed city stakeholder across london well collected and analyzed experimenter document report blog and publicly available information well city policy strategy and organicity report this helped understand both organicity and the ecosystem organisation and their journey experimentation developing the solution the data collected and thematically analysed contributes our understanding european urban data driven ecosystem and the development urban data business model upon initial analysis the experimental case identified the experimenter were smestartup and the rest related ngo grassroots initiative academic project multistakeholder partnership included all case they could offer insight into the data resource being leveraged the technology being developed and the key activity undertaken deliver solution furthermore although some the experiment were notforprofit social innovation focused organisation they still wished sustain the solution the level traffic realtime airpollution resource suggest data site proposes new way for citizen interact and submit data about the city government data relates data about city governance and council activity and process the case for spend network who drew open data offer insight into public sector sending cultural data refers data about history event social activity etc the city such for walk the city developed map recommend place and space for senior walker finally mobility relates travel and wayfinding related data the urban context for example traffic controlled air quality which aimed improve movement traffic improve air quality level hardware and software not only will the nature data needed deliver the value proposition have implication for resource and activity organization but the hardware and software type value proposition organization offer whether capturing data and delivering data insight for example offer city and citizen analytics service organization may require installing iot internet thing hardware sensor asset across the city order capture data hardware user interface combined with app based software installed deliver descriptive insight citizen well browser based software deliver predictive insight city official thus further differentiate key resource term hardware and software needed capture data and deliver data andor insight through the value proposition whilst engelbrecht distinguishing data driven business model this study proposes both key resource term hardware software and key activity elucidates how urban data business model are identified therefore term hardware sensor device such iot device may used capture objective noise level across the city such with the belgium organisation sensifai user interface may installed for the public capture subjective view sound level citizen and then aggregated analyzed and visualized delivering prescriptive recommendation city official through hardware user interface and delivered citizen through app based mobile software program for example research design data site developed toolkit solution for public participation whereby voting hardware and software device are installed city asset empati designed identify technological effort required public place order order verocity whether data generated iot sensor order deliver descriptive insight about the relationship between traffic and pollution importantly the characteristic the data bearing such aspect the resource and capability needed leverage the data well wider sociopolitical factor collection and use for example generating real time data may require greater storage could have higher telecommunication cost additional processing and analyzing capability and may not suitable generate through low powered sensor device auditory visual data may involve additional privacy and security consideration whilst open data may have sustainability concern business reliant data updating and longevity etc all found data could characterized according real time streaming data near real time data data sensed and uploaded very frequently and historical data all other data for example several experiment provided near real time data using low powered sensor rather than real time streaming the variability data also consideration whereby static data refers data unlikely change over time for example data the location asset the city dynamic data which data that likely change and thus requires frequent measurement for example spendnetwork drew both static and dynamic open data offer insight city council data may also have variety term being subjective objective subjective data refers user input based data such with the case tranquil city where citizen identified tranquil space the city objective data such icycle iotee lab which use iot measure the fill level bottle bank the type data auditory textual visual numerical also important distinction the proposed solution offered and the resource and activity needed capture and the data and deliver the solution for example citizen textual annotation iot sensed numerical data used objective and subjective air quality level finally distinguish the domain urban data term environment mobility citizen infrastructure example infrastructure data relates urban space and place and facility the city including building park power supply etc this may relate unused vacant space the city such the solution from the social enterprise space engagers environmental data refers data about the natural environment the city such air and water wildlife even soil and grass such the case experimenter green roof monitoring citizen data refers any data about citizen communicated citizen for example government combine business cultural camon for and andor cleaning analysis structuring abstraction preparing report pattern transforming converting data exploitation aim mobile flower pot style interface place city park gather subjective feeling citizen key activity following rizk propose that data acquisition key activity whereby organization draw hardware software resource such sensor tracker user based input interface generate data software resource procure either open proprietary data existing data resource internal the organization repurpose further distinguish data exploitation and data visualization subdimensions key activity create additional value from the data through processing analyzing and simulating data processing mean etc aggregating combining datasets different type datasets modifying data which lower degree data exploitation and simulation are higher level data exploitation aiming extracting knowledge insight rizk these can classified descriptive summarize relationship predictive analysis data make prediction prescriptive identifies option recommends insight simulation refers the recreation complex system run various what scenario and ass the behavior the actual system finally data visualisation concern the activity with which the exploited data may presented the end use converting complex information into visually engaging chart and image very niche value proposition few firm specialize usually firm couple the visualization capability with other key activity such analytics rather than offering standalone edinburgh citysounds one such experiment selected for the second phase organicity the experiment capture sound installing auditory data sensor device aas across the city these aas will capture short clip ultrasonic and audible noise bat bird and other wildlife traffic and human activity real time these sound inturn are combined with other data set such light temperature humidity pollution answer question pertaining the impact human activity animal behavior change humananimal behavior with exogenous variable etc imperative for edinburgh citysounds develop visual standard represent these seemingly unstructured inconsistent incoherent data set doing greatly enhance the utility the final offering for and seen other citizen citizen business business stakeholder often target customer the basic premise organicity experiment tackle urban challenge consequently the experimenter would look deliver any one more stakeholder urban setting stakeholder such city councilsgovernmental organization could all the key customer for experimenter moreover unlike traditional business that mostly focus one customer segment time business model urban setting have more complex interwoven nature with are various experimenter that deal with multiple customer segment the same time this also seen way achieving larger market needed for eventual viability the business model green roof monitoring oslo based experiment example for operating multiple target customer segment offer multisensorial monitoring vegetation the municipality another experimenter leapcraft sensing platform measure air quality the city council target customer revenue model discussed earlier most these experimenter are still the process discovering stable revenue stream some these experiment their current state only lend support the experimenting firm other business without generating any revenue themselves moreover revenue model like other business model component are prone frequent change have observed different revenue model adopted planned experimenter extract value from their offering asset sale usage fee leasing licensing subscription fee and advertising fee for instance wayfindr provides customer consultation for setting audio navigation service and charge usage fee while airpublic provides insight the air quality the city council that subscribe service fstr license the use carpooling application business which turn make available for their employee further into each these revenue model the actual pricing mechanism for service andor product osterwalder three broad characterization pricing mechanism fixed differential and market based have been used experimenter predictably most the experimenter that deal the and segment owing lack bargaining power while dealing with larger business have been playing the role price taker rather than price maker also been observed that the only handful experimenter with protected asset were able take the lead and set price fee brokerage their relative that most cost structure the continuum value driven cost driven have observed the organicity experimenter are aligned closer value driven extreme could due emphasis innovative and novel solution rather than cost effective solution the reviewer having said that there are few experimenter who are focused delivering solution costeffective way empati and leapcraft are example cost driven experimenter each one them deliver solution seeking capture market offering lower cost solution for example leapcraft seek lower the cost measuring air pollution and increase spread developing mobile based air quality sensor that traverse the city vehicle besides organicity created platform facilitate experimentation facilitating experimentation includes minimizing overhead needed run these experiment providing technical expertise legal framework and access data set the platform provided frictionless environment for innovation however since all the experimenter have common access these facility have not delved deep these provisionsfactors they not distinguish between experiment conclusion future work this study presented framework urban data business model defined business model where urban data the central the value proposition analyzed urban data focused experimental case under the umbrella the organicity inductively derive the framework the framework composes higher level dimension based the dimension identified from the literature review through the exercise developing the framework determined that value proposition will logically flow from other higher level dimension the framework and thus not included the final framework otherwards data resulting knowledge insight reflected through the activity business undertakes exploit and visualize the data and thus captured through the framework this also avoids the problem multicollinearity which would affect subsequent clustering business model type when applying the framework through the analysis case determined that key resource should compose both urban data capturing and delivering hardware and software these were core offering many the case explored comparing the existing literature this thereby making implicitly referred product application based service interaction technological effort and hartmann through subdimensions data source and data generation result the literature review the variable our framework have carefully been identified avoid inter variable redundancy the framework amenable for developing taxonomy urban data business model for example argue that sourcing the data key activity and not key resource whereby hartmann already capture data generation and data acquisition activity addition capturing these through the key source that distinguishes touched the introduction believe the framework can useful for researcher allowing the applying analytical lens understanding challenge across the value network developing urban identifying opportunity for value proposition and related urban data substantiating the type urban data business model furthermore the framework may drawn practitioner assessing proposal for funding and support including viability the context the funding and the challenge with which develop solution the next stage the study will apply the framework organicity supported case cluster and classify business model type furthermore plan apply the framework existing business which have already established sustainable business model
