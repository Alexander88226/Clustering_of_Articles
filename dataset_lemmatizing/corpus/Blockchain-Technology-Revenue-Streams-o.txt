have bright future disintermediate the financial institution become more popular this research analysis the potential revenue stream through blockchain technology however the promising disintermediation their technology leaving turmoil all startup release the decentralize system because there revenue proposed long tail business model term release initial coin offering ico based physical assetbacked cryptocurrency rather than close platform release ico the provider cryptocurrency tends open the platform niche market like personal businessman msms others releasing their ico the result show many user cryptocurrency make ico raise fund and also many transaction currency exchange occur the platform look like high product ico with low volume fund but currency exchange will often occur therefore margin currency exchange will made new revenue stream for blockchain technology startup monetize their platform shift another stage growth and stability keywords blockchain technology long tail business model revenue stream introduction blockchain technology currently attracting great attention from public because the uniqueness their technology characteristic foundation for disintermediate transaction the problem doublespending such bank notary escrow agent potentially replaced blockchain technology blockchain digitized decentralized ledger allow record keeping all peerpeer transaction without the need for centralized authority latest review technical paper blockchain research show that the majority scientific paper have focused increasing and the challenge the current protocol especially for cryptocurrency general and particularly bitcoin the increasing peertopeer platform like blockchain technology can denied and changed the way for commercial transaction the main issue developing blockchain technology the elimination trusted party among the hype that the first question answer the appropriate solution whether blockchain technology the best technology build peertopeer platform transaction trying remove trusted party such suafbe december jakarta indonesiacopyright eaidoi eai bank even multidisciplinary blockchain research framework about intermediary tends disseminating how blockchain technology could provide intermediary service there are three element intermediary function the bank core business rising fund make loan and provide service managed trillion dollar global economy and take trillion fee per transaction through system slow payment additional cost and take more time finally the customer bear the burden and opened over per year criminal opportunity from financial intermediary activity include payment network money transfer and stock exchange worth estimated save sixteen billion dollar fee per year from banking and insurance transaction through smart contract blockchain technology while others estimated could reduce infrastructure cost billion per annum blockchain technology also introduce new venture raising fund through initial coin offering ico coin are unit original value from the blockchain therefore also important distinguish between coin and token the only purpose coin exchange value and have limited function beyond that token new type digital asset that represent underlying asset least there are three taxonomy understand token first currency token like bitcoin that can used purchase good and service second platform token like ethereum that provide payment gateway and three assetbacked token which bound underlying physical asset such real estate fine art even gold collection the promising blockchain technology envisioned online payment platform token without trusted party but many entrepreneur startup company difficult choice about decentralized system that may release fixed revenue stream this research aim see the possible revenue stream from blockchain technology term disintermediate function trusted party research methodology first define framework classify current activity banking system and investigate possible activity blockchain technology acquire revenue stream literature review the most important thing disseminating new technology about the adoption the adoption diffusion innovation theory four main element include innovation communicated through certain channel over time among the member social system this theory explain how idea and invention technology will adopted through reducing uncertainty system over time blockchain technology also need decision making tool that will defining technology the correct perspective reach disintermediate the rise blockchain technology marked the operation peerpeer electronic cash system known bitcoin outline the mechanism new currency based cryptography security system that will eliminating the trusted party online transfer sent directly from one party recipient party blockchain technology one the most enchanting research field because the digital disruption shaken financial service whereas level analysis multidisciplinary blockchain research field around user and society intermediary platform firm and industry least there are five different activity between banking system and blockchain technology first payment when banking system offer intermediary function term approving transaction between customer while blockchain technology offer the anonymity user second clearing and balancing system user customer take more time reconcile their transaction and also check their balance operating procedure intermediary party blockchain technology can reduce transaction time and simplifying reconciliation process through realtime clearing and balancing arrangement third get funding banking concept execute fundraising from customer whom excess fund through saving giro time deposit product blockchain technology trying remodelling the business through initial coin offering ico may characterized with the publication such white paper token sale term that contains detail information about price pricing per coin product supply token place adopted and promotion business plan and marketing team raise money through cryptocurrencies not only get funding from investor customer but creating new opportunity from broader access capital the fourth security the term asset security shifted from nonasset asset backed when asset native issued onchain digital representation called tokenising the last lending loan credit removing the necessity for gatekeeper within the lending business the blockchain will build safer borrow cash and supply lower interest rate there term that will confuse blockchain researcher clearly define about the idea distributed use architecture not for policy decision making whereas decentralization open network for everyone access the ledger identity are not recorded and the validation may lead decreasing speed transaction blockchain type distributed ledger that made out chain cryptographically connected square containing bunched exchange before examine potential revenue stream discussion section better start define what type business model blockchain technology business model the art how company generate revenue and making profit term revenue stream found type activity blockchain technology include infrastructure provider application developer and operator most revenue stream one more the following way revenue model description table revenue model blockchain technology software service professional service flat fee transaction fee maintenance fee service level agreement sla premium support package charging fee for using api and infrastructure developing custom application for enterprise client charging fee for subscription fee per transaction charging for the maintenance distributed ledger network codebase providing professional support and training consulting utility token method providing consulting service customer seeking adopt dlt can range from ideation and the development proofofconcept fullproduction deployment network might discharged which might wont access the network can even listed inside the network use the long tail business model research approach order create new opportunity revenue model the long tail concept proposed chris anderson his book titled the long tail concept about selling that focusing large number product with low volume anderson defined the section two the potential disruption banking system including payment clearing and balancing system funding security and lending with blockchain technology after that try investigate new revenue model through long tail business model canvas see figure evaluate the business model canvas will arrange fgd and depth interview with stakeholder the blockchain technology including interviewee from islamic fintech association interviewee from otoritas jasa keuangan ojk msme the outcome the method will describe value proposition customer segment and finally making decision about the revenue stream the revenue stream describe revenue generating from customer segment whom buy the value proposition the product revenue stream can take from two stream transaction revenue that come from onetime payment recurring revenue that come from ongoing payment and repurchase others similar product fig long tail business model canvas concept discussion the real challenge commercialism niche content finding interested potential consumer see the old model music industry the customer segment focusing mass audience match making with the value proposition from superstar artist and hit while the new model open the platform did not focus mass audience but switch niche market like people who want buy listen song from another hit maker rather than entering the main market our interviewee proposing open strategic avenue pursue niche market strategy niche market small market that consist individual small group customer with similar characteristic and need therefore banking industry usually target mass market funding customer and they also try match making with the customer lending product they earn revenue stream from the deviation lending margin and funding interest different from blockchain technology reworking everything from payment transaction however cash raised within the nonpublic market mention above blockchain can beyond question have impact just about each side the financial setup because relates banking and also the disruption will expect work out happening our research result show the initial coin offering ico are mostly carried out blockchain provider operator and proposed the initial coin offering offer user fig value proposition canvas initial coin offering icos represent completely unique mechanism for funding extremely innovative venture that use distributed ledger technology dlt ico represent radical innovation financial technology ico investor get the token directly from startup token unit supposed the future the venture project for example utility property right royalty icos alter startup lift massive amount funding with negligible effort whereas avoiding compliance and reduce intermediator cost let illustrate the value proposition canvas above nature initial coin offering ico usually written white paper document document which the company provides the information deemed necessary for the public and important component the campaign company ico mention the detail ico total cap and distribution legal and compliance team security marketing and public relation and also have within maximum time coin selling while niche segment one customer for example stand home industry and need some funding term rising their working capital around dollar they open register the initial coin offering ico platform and offering their equity crowdfunding mass market about coin they start campaign within certain period raise fund kind online word mouth and not just peertopeer transaction equity crowdfunding example new economic model for raising working capital for home industry compare with raise money through venture capital difficult process entrepreneur have gathered with sat through countless meeting with partner and last long time negotiation over equity and assessment hope exchanging some part their company for review blockchain not need platform raise money dont need venture capitalist and also not need negotiation all user can raise money from anyone any time and anyone can invest their project indonesia still have gap financing about trillion and over million msmes unit not yet bankable world bank suggest there are between million msmes emerging country million are formal smes million are formal micro enterprise and million are informal enterprise estimated all micro small and medium enterprise emerging country lack access lending may give large breath access people msme home industry and startup company rising fund through initial coin offering quarterly report cryptocurrencies mention about amount raised from april june include number icos with the average amount raised over only ico that reach hard cap from apriljune and number cryptocurrencies provider the world recorded wwwcoingeckocom over our interviewee expected might look like onethird small number ico will offer cryptocurrencies provider large volume and three quarter large offer user msme and personal cryptocurrencies low volume the future where revenue stream come from our interviewee estimated that ico are fundamentally shift from seed fundraising new investment ecosystem kind mid utility and equity token because represent ownership asset and also provide user with future access product service for example case study from cryptocurrency assetbacked like gold dinar and dirham when the crypto coin sold for currency can represent ownership the ingot and also enable the crypto coin purchase for another product service fig long tail business model projection supposed bring through individual exchange currency from fiat gold dinar and dirham additionally implies the model revenue stream from fee based income margin currency exchange cryptocurrency may enable provide price sell and buy the crypto coin the website normally buy price expensive from sell price because the difference number indicate the margin the exchange this revenue model tends comply with islam because similar with the alsarf currency exchange but may contradiction with the term and condition purchasing gold via online should cash transaction and handover directly and narrated that ubadah bin assamit ubadah bin assamit and muawiyah met stopping place the road ubadah told them the messenger allah forbade selling gold for gold silver for silver wheat for wheat barley for barley date for date one them said salt for salt but the other did not say unless like for like hand hand and commanded sell gold for silver and silver for gold and wheat for barley and barley for wheat and hand however wanted and one them said whoever give more ask for more engaged riba but sharia standard gold and trading control point sale gold ingot for currency the solution the problem above cited following below when gold ingot are sold for currency the countervalues must exchanged during the contracting session possession the ingot the buyer his agent realized either physically constructively constructive possession realized allocation the ingot and enabling the buyer dispose holding certificate that represents ownership specified ingot that distinguishable allocated ingot from others serial number other distinct mark from other ingot provided the certificate issued the day the contract concluded trade date officially customarily recognized agency enabling the buyer take physical possession the purchased ingot his request impact the ico usually launch cryptocurrency provider with the low number product shift ico launch cryptocurrency user with the high number product the important challenge marketing niche content finding interested potential patron powerful search and recommendation engine user rating and community interest have created this much easier many type ico product indicated the high volume currency exchange between fiat and cryptocurrency even volume each product low fig long tail business model revenue stream conclusion this paper tried use long tail business model model revenue stream approach but still comply islamic may produce aggregate revenue even exceeding revenue produced via long tail business model because each currency exchange even the first market cryptocurrency will impact the margin also will eliminate the cost intermediary into free from the advantage blockchain technology furthermore the future research topic ico about the islamic scheme contract for the underlying asset the assetbacked
