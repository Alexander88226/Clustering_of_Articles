alike consequently there abundance research study and practitioner report and textbook that center internationalization motif market entry strategy efficient organization foreign partner joint venture and subsidiary however research the internationalization smes still relatively underrepresented the literature coviello mcauley beamish wright westhead ucbasaran more than decade ago the review paper sme internationalization research past present and future ruzzier published the journal small business and enterprise development according google scholar since then been cited more than time while research international entrepreneurship which the core the ruzzier review well related research born globals knight cavusgil cavusgil knight and international new venture zander mcdougallcovin rose intensified over the last decade there are still many issue that are yet addressed the gap becomes even more obvious with respect teaching the field international management and international business almost any textbook the field predominantly focusing large mncs whether from developed emerging economy cavusgil knight riesenberger peng meyer phatak bhagat kashlak yet although large corporation and global brand such hsbc lenovo mcdonalds siemens toyota are known all student the majority graduate will work smes that show different approach regarding their internationalization strategy and process than what they have been taught business school what could the reason for this neglect despite apparently intensified interest from research perspective lack easily accessible secondary data compared big publicly listed corporation may one important reason moreover using case study from huge international enterprise that are well known research study and particularly for teaching purpose important advantage first researcher lecturer and student can draw from many source and easily access data and information secondly recipient such reader learner are often familiar with global brand and can better comprehend complex circumstance the case that one refers smes that are regionally well known yet not international level even they are global player within their industry final reason that international study conducted leading strategy consultant based upon their industry and countryspanning expertise are targeting big multinational enterprise too order gain reputation and acquire new client these are able settle their high price tag hence smes seem largely neglected research and consulting subject with regard internationalization especially they pursue different aim strategy and organizational form hollenstein not only southtyrol but also neighboring region big european economy such germany italy smes are the backbone the economy with regard internationalization activity smes one distinguish between micro business especially local handicraft enterprise which are most doing business area close the respective border and not pursue clear growth strategy and enterprise which internationalization and management the center their firm strategy these enterprise range from hightech startup which are certain extent prototype born globals cannone ughetto over component supplier smes with distinct growth strategy different business sector the latter smes are confronted with challenge and problem such formulating effective internationalization strategy reaching far beyond just copying successful competitor even more challenge are associated with efficient implementation such strategy for instance the need for initiate and orchestrate change management process the headquarters additionally operative efficiency organization management process auditing manufacturing logistics and hrm which frequently the source for competitive advantage smes risk structure and process have adapted international requirement many these aspect are not all insufficiently researched the scientific insight their reliability and usability are not known ttisme proceeding against this background started research initiative the free university bolzano leading internally seedfunded research project called management internationalization small and medium sized enterprise smes blind spot research despite major relevance for the economy misme which been started january and will last until december address research question ranging from motif smes internationalize formulation and implementation internationalization strategy marketing challenge such the need customize product and service different local market human resource management related question for instance international talent management cultural distance and training need well issue financing international activity partly initiated and funded the misme project successfully submitted proposal for professional development workshop the international management division the academy management which conducted the annual meeting the aom atlanta august building this pdw decided organize the first conference internationalization smes new insight and future research opportunity the free university bozen bolzano may which aimed discussing fresh idea and innovative research initiative the field the internationalization smes more workshoplike format invited international scholar interested this field including senior phd and postdoc submit and present their early stage research the internationalization smes this interactive conference were particularly interested empirical and conceptual paper that advance already existing knowledge from diverse discipline affecting smes and their attitude towards internationalization and the unexpectedly high number interesting study from author originating from many different country demonstrated that our idea offer developmental format that allows for constructive feedback and discussion among the participant been highly appreciated the interactive conference opened jeanfranc ois hennart who gave inspiring keynote speech smes and international business theory which further commented and supplemented timothy devinney hennart started with what call the universal belief that selling abroad always slower more difficult and more costly than domestic expansion which even more relevant for smes the message his keynote speech selling abroad even for smes doe not have difficult risky costly and slow fundamentally depends the firm business model some business model make selling abroad cheap easy and quick the course his presentation challenged and questioned basic assumption the uppsala model well the mainstream born global literature referring his article entrepreneurship theory and practice showed that product customer and delivery system characteristic the business model are essential predict the speed and scope internationalization hennart according him worthwhile use classification export barrier leonidou for analyzing internationalization pattern smes finally outlined current research project that simultaneously test the explanatory power traditional internet high tech founder experience and firm business model antecedent uniqueness transportation cost etc important implication future research concluded that one should look beyond the product the business model and ask the question what are the most important measurable characteristic fast internationalization business model further

friederici christian schwens heinrichheineuniversit sseldorf germany christinefriederici hhude during the past decade research the field international entrepreneurship jones gained momentum with considerable amount study focusing the phenomenon young internationalizing firm fernhaber autio considering that young firm typically suffer from scarce resource little experience and small error margin bruneel the performance implication their crossborder expansion have attracted special research attention for recent metaanalysis see schwens forthcoming however opposing theoretical argument indicate that the literature far from being conclusive while some study argue that internationalization enables young firm benefit from additional revenue source mcdougall oviatt realize economy scale khavul and explore learning opportunity foreign market zahra other study emphasizes the uncertainty and additional resource requirement associated with internationalization sapienza opposing argument are also reflected inconclusive empirical finding reporting positive bloodgood negative zhou and nonsignificant effect mcdougall oviatt for the internationalizationperformance link among young firm effort help overcome the ambiguity extant research study have begun examine the boundary condition the internationalizationperformance association notably pointing the critical role knowledgebased resource inside the firm schwens forthcoming bloodgood however our understanding incomplete term least two important aspect first while firminternal knowledge large part bound firm employee remains unclear how different type knowledge typically associated with different type employee are influential for the internationalizationperformance relationship young firm second although knowledge based resource are likely valuable they also represent cost the firm however existing study focus the absolute rather than the excess level knowledgebased resource consequently not know young internationalizing firm should ensure the availability certain type knowledge within the firm holding costly human resource slack employ more worker than needed attend routine operation lecuona reitzig our study examines the moderating influence slack the relationship between internationalization and performance among young firm specifically argue that the magnitude which internationalization lead improved performance depends the associated type knowledge inherent different type slack consistent with lecuona reitzig draw the knowledgebased view kbv grant and distinguish among tacit and specific tacit and general and codified slack thus the knowledge associated with different type excess worker can tacit codified polanyi and specific general helfat while task performed manager typically require knowledge that difficult transfer and bound specific work context skilled blue collar mainly contribute knowledge that difficult codify but can used diverse setting comparison the task unskilled blue collar require primarily knowledge that easy codify regardless specificity lecuona reitzig while assume that tacit and specific slack improves the benefit and reduces the cost young firm internationalization resulting improved performance expect tacit and general slack well codified slack have the opposite effect offer two contribution extant research first contribute the literature theoretically establishing and empirically validating how different form slack moderate the impact internationalization performance young firm worker hold knowledge expand previous study schwens forthcoming offering more detailed perspective the relevance knowledgebased resource for the internationalizationperformance link second our study the first examine slack the unique context young internationalizing firm consequently contribute the literature slack mishina tailoring our argument the specific characteristic young internationalizing firm ttisme proceeding methodology test our hypothesis draw sample young manufacturing firm from france italy and spain derived from the euefigebruegelunicredit dataset altomonte aquilante with firm performance being the dependent variable choose hierarchical linear regression model including interaction term validate our theoretical prediction consistent with prior study use return asset roa measure firm profitability operationalize firm performance and percentage foreign sale total sale measure the degree internationalization operationalize the different type slack divide the number relevant employee manager skilled blue collar unskilled blue collar total sale and subtract the mean ratio firm operating the same industry and country lecuona reitzig mishina address potential concern regarding endogeneity test our model using lagged performance result find positive moderating influence tacit and specific slack support and negative moderating influence codified slack support the relationship between internationalization and performance however not find support for negative moderating influence tacit and general slack implication integrating the notion slack into the domain emphasize the role excess human resource critical source knowledge which may affect the implementation young firm international strategy thus our research promotes further consideration concerning the fit between strategic choice and knowledgebased resource young internationalizing firm furthermore our finding are significance for practitioner they show that young internationalizing firm typically challenged

the main core topic internal business research the last decade brouthers hennart regardless the relevant role smes into the world economy term both gdp and employment previous study foreign entry strategy have mainly focused large mncs overlooking smes bruneel cock thus the relevance the research foreign entry augmented focus smes that have been overlooked far moreover the limited knowledge smes foreign entry lack comparison with the result obtained for large firm while true that smes and large firm differ some instance not clear whether these different characteristic affect also their foreign entry strategy thus still not clear whether the major theory foreign entry strategy transaction cost economics institutional theory resource base view and are valid also for smes shed new light this topic the focus this paper this aim investigate foreign entry the italian market from until using dataset investment using the smes definition the european union the sample contains smes and large firm large firm might choose differently their foreign entry strategy because their economy scale and specialisation large availability financial and human resource wagner moreover the family ownership structure might affect differently the entry and establishment mode large and smes bruneel cock laufs schwens given that most smes are family controlled also the presence high initial

effect magnitude and sign the foreign entry choice smes and large firm the aim this research investigate whether the effect set determinant widely used previous research studying large mncs foreign entry strategy the same for smes focus our empirical analysis the ownership mode selection joint venture versus wholly owned subsidiary and the establishment mode choice greenfield versus acquisition using the classification brouthers and hennart some our finding show that smes and large firm entry strategy are driven different factor highlighting possible future research path for instance our result show that the manufacturing sector that large firm prefer establish wholly owned subsidiary manufacturing while this sector not significant for the sample smes furthermore smes select wholly owned subsidiary over joint venture when the local firm also sme while diversified smes prefer joint venture investment rather than wholly owned subsidiary these two effect are not significant for large firm whose ownership mode mainly driven the industry growth the host market the psychic distance and the family control the local firm with reference the establishment mode our finding confirm well for the ownership mode the need further investigate the determinant smes choice indeed our analysis show different result for the two sample while smes propensity make greenfield investment negatively affected the age the sme experience the italian market and the investment the manufacturing sector for large firm these determinant are not significant indeed their establishment mode choice affected other factor geographic distance and return asset our result show that smes foreign entry strategy are determined different factor compared large mncs thus future study foreign entry

source for potential future growth but they form clear minority among internally entrepreneurial firm lion share these firm expand slower pace and for many them international operation although they may have continued for year remain importance than their domestic market activity entrepreneurial internationalization lie the heart research jones and there the term been understood very broadly way that understandable because internationalization always includes new entry either with the existing new product new market and new entry essential act entrepreneurship lumpkin des whether the behavior internationalizing firm entrepreneurial another question being entrepreneurial refers combination bold and opportunityseeking decisionmaking with innovativeness risk taking and proactiveness des one could argue that the great majority smaller internationalizing firm not act entrepreneurially the contrary they are nonentrepreneurial and conservative and their management style mainly riskaverse

the best distribution channel and both administrative and legal barrier digital iot firm have percentage foreign sale the range while them between and them the range and before approaching international market digital iot smes need stable and competitive the domestic market subsequently they could start slow internationalization process the other hand the remaining firm the sample business only the domestic market due the following reason lack resource and competence low knowledge the local market product adaptation problem lack financial resource and low knowledge the new

empirical research developed multiple case study approach give contribution this direction investigating the influence technology the competitiveness smes within international context through purposive sampling design selected italian manufacturing exporting smes from the metal and machinery sector which had already implemented one more application three company are invs than year old while the rest them are established incremental exporter this sample some company are regionally oriented selling mostly their home continent while others export globally even distant country asia

first group includes half the interviewed company which have adopted one more technology with two goal incrementing the efficiency their plant the home country and offering more service their customer for instance the first purpose company have adopted robot for more than year and have also invested realize the vertical integration within the company with various degree implementation these technology reduced the operating cost allowing them remain competitive with their competitor located east europe distant emerging market china india despite their mediumhigh positioning moreover other technology such simulation have been used support the design and engineering phase the one hand and offer postsales assistance the other hand these service were used strengthen the relationship with the customer along this line pushed big client few these company have also been developing horizontal integration system horizontal integration required transparency between the client and supplier but then strengthens the relationship between them and increase the mutual interdependence line with rezk consequently smes tend reduce the number their customer focusing their activity regionally order better serve the few important client with whom they implemented integration generally mnes the second group smes have developed smart andor connected product porter heppelman this group the competitive advantage mainly related flexibility problem solving skill and the product quality isme proceeding since the establishment year the invs have specifically committed their effort create smart andor connected product with customeroriented logic from the real beginning moreover they started early thinking about developing big data analytics and tend more oriented towards servitization logic vendrellherrero contrast for the remaining company connected product were the result natural evolving process continuous investment into innovation and technology here again the best customer are large mnes and the competitive advantage stem from building tight relationship with them over the year sum consistent with the limited amount resource available have observed selective investment technology with different result term international competitiveness the one hand technology are the mean obtain higher efficiency that could spent against international competitor even from low cost country and redirect some resource from production service activity the other hand can considered end enlarge the market portfolio involves product innovation and even the business model innovation
