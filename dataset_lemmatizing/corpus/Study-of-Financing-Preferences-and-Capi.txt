financing among smes are important not only providing clear and better understanding smes capital structure but improving knowledge about how these aspect influence smes their capital structure decision capital structure the study capital structure attempt explain the mix security and financing source used corporation finance real investment most the research capital structure focused the proportion debt versus equity observed the righthand side corporation balance sheet myers there consensus theory that explains firm capital structure but finance theory offer two broad competing model tradeoff theory and pecking order theory tong and green and these theory appear have the most support seifert and gonenc theory optimal capital structure differ their relative emphasis certain factor the tradeoff theory emphasizes tax the pecking order theory emphasizes difference information and the free cash flow theory emphasizes agency cost myers empirically distinguishing between these hypothesis proven difficult booth aivazian tong and green crosssectional test variable that describe one theory can classified others and vice versa booth aivazian tradeoff did better one case large equity issue lowleverage firm and pecking order impact profitability leverage tong and green the other the negative tradeoff theory tot hereafter firm seek debt level that balance the tax advantage additional debt against the cost possible financial distress myers optimal capital structure achieved balancing the benefit debt tax and reduction free cash flow problem with the cost debt bankruptcy and agency cost between stockholder and bondholder seifert and gonenc firm viewed setting target debttoequity ratio and gradually moving towards this implies that some form optimal capital structure exists that can maximize the firm value while simultaneously minimizing external claim the cash flow stream such claim include tax bankruptcy cost and agency cost kjellman and hansen valuemaximizing firm will pursue optimal capital structure considering the marginal cost and benefit each additional unit financing and then choosing the form financing that equates these marginal cost and benefit benefit debt include tax advantage and the reduced agency cost free cash flow cost include the increased risk financial distress and increased monitoring and contracting cost associated with higher debt level tong and green applicability the tradeoff theory the sme been the focus number study the debt tax shield relevant for sme for publicly quoted firm mac bhaird the pecking order theory hypothesis capital structure poh hereafter among the most influential theory corporate leverage frank and goyal contrast the static tradeoff theory with competing popular story based financing pecking order firm are said prefer internal external financing and debt equity issue security the pure pecking order theory the firm welldefined target debttovalue ratio myers the pecking order hypothesis describes hierarchy financial choice firm make according the pecking order hypothesis internally generated financing preferred first followed debt safe and then risky and lastly outside equity seifert and gonenc the firm will borrow rather that issuing equity when internal cash flow not sufficient fund capital expenditure thus the amount debt will reflect the firm cumulative need for external fund myers fundamental issue corporate finance involves understanding how firm choose their capital seifert and gonenc what structure asean entrepreneurship conference aec determines the optimal capital structure still ongoing and complex matter esparanca gama researcher are still puzzled how firm choose the debt equity hybrid security they issue kjellman and hansen theory capital structure suggest how some the factor might correlated with leverage rajan and zingales there have been many empirical study attempting test the explanatory power capital structure model corporate behavior developed country particular setting most the work been identify the determinant capital structure the main determinant capital structure tested include profitability size growth opportunity asset structure cost financial distress and tax shield effect chen incorporates the case capital structure however the set feature one must include such general model large and complicated that the resulting structure would not yield clear insight based theoretical capital structure study firm capital structure emerges from three source firm specific country institutional and macroeconomic factor there empirical evidence for the importance all three firm institutional and macroeconomic factor determining firm capital structure however there still lack study spanning large number country and different firm type simultaneously joeveer previous study among large firm show some factor that seem have influence capital structure decision among them this particular study namely profitability firm size asset tangibility firm growth firm age nondebt tax shield and liquidity review these study are used support the decision selecting those factor tested this study analysis factor used investigating into capital structure decision among smes show that factor selected this study were among the factor that mostly included the previous study concerning the determinant capital structure among smes interestingly firm size included all selected study this might important factor differentiating financial practice among smes most definition sme divided sme into different group such micro

objective desired outcome need reflected when stating research objective viewed the starting point rigorous research that they demonstrate the potential legitimacy the research project far stronger term than statement the research idea hair the objective this study are investigate level the towards different preference financing among manager smes malaysia financing source investigate the capital structure among smes malaysia and determine there are any significant association between selected manager characteristic with their level financing source preference financing firm characteristic with the firm capital structure among smes malaysia towards different and between selected these specific objective are accomplished through gathering specific data among chosen sample enterprise award winner gauge the issue financing preference and choice capital structure and factor influencing their decision these two data collection response rate and analysis accomplishing the research objective dependent the reliable analysis response received from large number respondent therefore survey research considered the suitable and appropriate data collection method for achieving the objective this study availability the internet recent year overcomes some drawback traditional way postal survey especially the one relating cost postal questionnaire for that reason electronic survey chose the appropriate and reliable instrument supporting the accomplishment data collection process not only for increasing the response rate but also increasing reliable analysis and finding research objective this method involves selfadministered electronic survey through email the world wide web interactive voice response and touchtone data entry dillman web survey chose used this study this particular type electronic survey have more refined appearance and have flexibility provide survey capability far dissemination beyond the email and paper survey dillman hair questionnaire the sole survey instrument used this study very clear that detailed and careful planning should undertaken develop reliable instrument after considering the comment and suggestion received from the pretesting and pilot testing the first draft the questionnaire the final version the questionnaire constructed involving four different part and accessible via designated link the link for the final version the questionnaire sent via email the selected sample upon satisfactory result pilot testing list enterprise winner from were formed guide the overall process data collection smes listed the list were classified based alphabetical order and the distribution email were made the basis completing the list telephone contact were also made the case where direct email contact not available mainly get direct email address designated person charge which turn hoped increase the response rate the pilot study the overall contactable smes were out smes two smes refuse participate and excluded determining the overall response rate this rate deemed appropriate the average response rate for survey among smes malaysia this study employ email survey thought that this instrument yet tested within malaysian context especially among smes and anticipated open new way researching smes malaysia the actual survey which took almost six month complete resulting total response received this figure used determining the response rate received for this survey total smes were contactable and out this them were not interested and refused participate after all these were taken into consideration the overall response rate for this study determined follows response rate upon satisfactory response received data analysis were performed the basis response descriptive bivariate and multivariate analysis were involved accommodate different function mainly achieve the research objective parametric and nonparametric analysis were used based the type data collected all parametric assumption fulfilled and justified before the asean entrepreneurship conference aec parametric analysis were used the following section will discus the result these analysis profile respondent table

investigate statistically significant between manager characteristic and manager level financing preference towards different source financing and statistically significant association between firm characteristic and firm capital structure these objective were translated into two main general alternative hypothesis follows there statistically between significant are relationship manager characteristic and their level financing preference towards different source financing association there are statistically significant relationship between firm characteristic and firm capital structure data transformation were performed several variable this study these variable were assessed through few indicator gauge the much needed data for the analysis these indicator were then grouped and reduced into smaller group variable simplify the analysis and increase understanding the data more easily achieving research objective the response given were asean entrepreneurship
