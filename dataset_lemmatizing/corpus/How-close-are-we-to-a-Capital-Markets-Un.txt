europe right now bank dependency the financial system bankdriven and dominated large universal bank the financial crisis showed that would greatly benefit from rebalancing economic structure towards more marketbased finance the cmu should help this rebalancing process integrating nationally fragmented capital market the sts securitisation step the right direction well the streamlining rule for security prospectus and the simplification market entry however more effort made support startupssmes reduce access barrier public trading platform and develop venture capital private financing and crowdfunding addition the cmu need attract and incorporate more actively household and corporatesector saving vehicle that will invest capital market and encourage them diversify across the order for

the adoption new regulation central security depository and the creation the european central bank the targetsecurities platform for security settlement many the giovannini barrier remain identified the giovannini report the should aim reduce eliminate the current difference between crossborder security transaction and transaction within single country more efficient settlement transaction and

the blockchain agreed embedding the transfer ownership asset other agreement this would remove the need for posttrade affirmation confirmation and central clearing during the settlement cycle which some case been shortened minute even second since all participant would now use the same underlying dataset for traderelated process the blockchain would reduce the scope for data error dispute and reconciliation lag which would speed the endtoend process currently expert group european posttrade forum eptf been established ass the evolution the posttrade landscape following recent legislative change market development and the emergence new technology the group will also ass the extent which the giovannini barrier have been removed and identify any new emerging barrier parallel the

successful they should accompanied critical and comprehensive assessment the investment solution and outcome proposed retail investor initiative such the smarter consumer communication which change the way information communicated and delivered customer and the regulatory sandbox which allows business test innovative product service business model and delivery mechanism live environment could set great example crowdfunding despite the expansion funding source available smes especially nonbank funding via private equity and peertopeer investment and borrowing securitiesbased crowdfunding and peertopeer business lending still represent small share sme funding number reason for this are nonharmonised legislation crowdfunding across member state lack credit information about smes which narrow access crowdfunding well other funding source iii lack informationknowledge and awareness security based crowdfunding and peertopeer lending amongst investor this being said should noted that the commission taking step towards assessing national regime and best practice and monitoring the evolution the crowdfunding sector however the current fragmentation and local dimension these activity will certainly benefit from the mifid passport initiative that aim develop the crossborder crowdfunding business and harmonise existing legislation with existing and upcoming national regulatory
