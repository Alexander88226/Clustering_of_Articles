large corporate client doe all these involve cost lack reliable information small business owner are not transparent not open their business outsider for some reason they not give the true information about their asset liability profit and others tax collector their employee and outsider access external finance depends open trade information between the one receiving the fund and the giver more

comparably high interest rate even longterm relationship between borrower and bank exists situation like this having audited financial statement play major role audited financial statement are very useful accessing credit from financial institution often bank require audited financial statement before granting credit for issn print issn online international journal small business and

information order deal with the loan application small firm given the reduced information risk arising from audited financial statement potential lending institution may offer low interest rate well other word audited financial statement improve borrower credibility and therefore reduce risk for lender sacerdoti the ability borrower provide adequate financial statement and the establishment credible credit bureau and financial data base are essential encourage the expansion credit promote competition the banking system and thereby reduce the cost credit borrower many country bank are reluctant extend credit smes because the inability the borrower produce formal financial statement and audited account strengthening accounting and auditing therefore key requirement for widening access bank smes many country however the accounting profession not well regulated and the quality account varies widely hampering transparency opaqueness small enterprise bank face two basic problem the opaqueness small enterprise and small size transaction they not want relinquish control over outsider and they personally want take control every aspect their business according zavatta cit one the problem financial institution lending fund with unwillingness small enterprise relinquish control over the company outsider quite widespread among sme most smes not keep proper book account credit rating agency one the challenge that financial institution face lending smes make accurate risk assessment loan application without generating high cost per application one the way assessing risk loan using credit rating agency credit bureau sacerdoti advanced country database centralizing information borrower are frequently established the private sector however number continental european country

the major problem facing the growth their business order importance the participant ranked lack finance the major constraint the growth their business followed competition which recorded technology ranked the third major constraint the growth smes with just thinking that irregular power supply also constrained their growth this result reinforces the theory cuevas where they indicated that access bank credit smes been issue and continues raised numerous study major constraint growth which also supported aryeetey that from the view point private sector problem related finance dominate all other constraint business expansion these also indicate that finance for smes particularly ghana still major problem even though the number bank operating the country increased tremendously since when aryeetey came out with their study with total based the number bank wwwboggovgh and number nonbank financial institution operating the country one would expect that access credit these smes will greatly improve competition among lending institution becomes keen but this expectation not been met since the result confirm the numerous theory that lack access credit and bank loan remain key constraint that need attention resolve order enhance smes growth this notion also line with schiffer and weder who found that the smaller the size firm the more difficult attract loan from financial institution lending rate high cost credit the major constraint facing small and medium size business ghana and the main problem hampering the development industrialization ghana issn print issn online international journal small business and entrepreneurship research volnopp march published european centre for research training and development wwweajournalsorg extremely high high acceptable low figure lending rate the above figure show the opinion respondent the level interest rate charge loan the financial institution the response received from participant saw the interest rate loan extremely high the total respondent think the rate were high with just saying the rate were manageable one significant thing that among the respondent none saw the interest rate charged loan the financial institution low this result support appenteng who said some saving and loan company charged much percent per month which when accumulated would over percent interest rate per annum more difficult for firm paying such high interest rate obtain excess profit after being able settle this high cost debt the extremely high interest rate group pay interest between and per month the respondent which indicated that the rate charged the financial institution are high also pay interest per month with just which may termed fortunate service their debt maximum rate per annum this put the business under intense pressure and eventually making the business unprofitable issn print issn online international journal small business and entrepreneurship research volnopp march published european centre for research training and development wwweajournalsorg than one year one year two year more than two year figure maturity period one the difficulty faced smes accessing debt the financial institution the period repayment the repayment period for loan given smes too short the above figure show the loan repayment duration indicated respondent this study can seen that were given repayment period than one year whilst repayment period one year and indicated repayment period two year the result consonance with ricupero position that commercial bank loan extended smes are often limited period far too short enable them pay off any sizeable investment abereijo and fayomi also made similar observation when they stated that the majority commercial bank loan offered smes are often limited period far too short pay off any sizeable investment understanding interest calculation many loan beneficiary have complained that financial institution not explain how interest are calculated their loan the researcher therefore investigated this phenomenon and arrived the following respondent confirmed the assertion that financial institution not educate loan beneficiary applicant how interest are calculated however revealed that they were informed about the mode interest calculation therefore important that financial institution involve loan applicant the computation interest exonerate the financial institution from any perception fraud activitiesthis accentuate the opinion donkor that thought microfinance institution are doing good job providing loan facility for smes but they sometimes not tell the truth some these institution take advantage their educational level and for one reason the other refuse give detail and explain the interest rate and implication the loan small business owner the effect realised when they begin the repayment the loan issn print issn online international journal small business and entrepreneurship research volnopp march published european centre for research training and development wwweajournalsorg meeting loan approval criterion from the survey conducted realized that smes are unable meet the bank requirement most smes fail obtain guarantor and collateral require the bank some also fail prepare financial statement their business and such being denied the loan the result line with eca which state that bank and other financial institution have confidence smes they are perceived highrisk venture with high rate failure result prohibitive collateral condition are set prevent smes from obtaining loan that most guarantor are not willing offer support due the nature and management style the smes there were only the respondent who faced the challenge cash flow and faced with other challenge such lack business plan default payment loan estimated that about respondent have had default the payment loan with only being able repay back loan received from financial institution within the regulation time some these defaulter close down their business and run away which affect the bank financial performance result the high default rate financial institution are compelled charge high interest rate further research revealed figure some factor that accounted for the high default rate complained low turnover high monthly instalment payment and short duration repayment constituted while complained high interest rate and other interesting finding such poor management account receivables these smes however believed that with proper management smes receivables they should have enough cash boost their working capital run their operation and also meet their financial obligation figure response problem repayment period and interest rate issn print issn online international journal small business and entrepreneurship research volnopp march published european centre for research training and development wwweajournalsorg the difficulty faced financial institution providing loan smes many challenge were revealed when the loan officer the selected bank ghana were interviewed some were exactly what the smes gave while others were different below are the challenge given the officer the bank history high default rate the interview conducted the respondent indicated that smes are characterised with high default rate default rate very high risk and would hinder every institution from granting credit facility many business lacked the accounting and management capacity demonstrate their ability service loan land tenure issue limited business ability raise the collateral that the bank required allay perceived risk the legal and court system made difficult for bank seize collateral when borrower defaulted and the absence credit bureau made difficult for bank ass borrower credit history add the risk the international monetary fund imf concluded that because they have focused largely government debt bank may have limited expertise evaluating risk associated with private sector lending false information about business from the survey conducted the respondent agreed that small business owner habitually give false information about their business when applying for loan while the respondent mildly agreed however disagreed the fact that smes provide false information about their business when apply for loan justify their claim indicated that smes may give false information out ignorance true and quality information are supplied bank and other financial institution would easy ass creditworthiness business and reduce risk default this would also enable financial institution give small enterprise favourable term payment this finding line with what ricupero said part the reluctance bank lend smes the bank inability evaluate risk because lack reliable financial information also identified that poor record keeping smes the difficulty the financial institution ass their financial performance moreover the most the loan obtained are not used for intended purpose sometimes the owner the business use the loan solve personal issue and later find difficult pay because turnover accrued service the debtwith regard the demand collateral further explained that the property must insured for acceptance however some these smes provide collateral that are covered with false document some the property may not bear the name the business the cosigner and may impossible secure the loan moreover most smes were known sole proprietorship and not operate the account the business separate entity from their personal account result the bank may unwilling provide loan facility business that have account with them implication research and practice the research may contribute the existing knowledge and doing create environment necessary for sme financing this through the identification and exploration challenge issn print issn online international journal small business and entrepreneurship research volnopp march published european centre for research training and development wwweajournalsorg confronting smes access debt financing and find out appropriate mechanism that would encourage demand and supply this debt financing the major contribution this research the body knowledge that many challenge such high default rate inability calculate interest the smes provision false information lack collateral and many others have been examined how they affect smes access debt finance expected that this research will open the way for the availability longterm debt complement the internally generated fund which will enhance growth and expansion business when these challenge are carefully addressed this work will add the body knowledge making sure smes are encouraged seek debt financing when the government and other institution and donor allocate financial resource support the growth smes ghana for example when information available assessed smes and the financial institution good relationship will encouraged also make sure that financial market bank doe not concentrate growthoriented business but rather focus smes that have been denied long time when their challenge are considered hoped that the finding and recommendation this study will contribute the body knowledge providing information the bank ghana the appropriate model and strategy that need developed order ensure longterm debt delivery the smes ghanathe result the study will offer direction the management financial institution through reduction risk providing debt and develop attractive product support the smes the research will therefore promote

ghana association bank collaboration with the bank ghana will organise routine workshop and seminar some issue that emerged and recommended the study these recommendation may database implementation monitoring scheme and establishment model which will facilitate longterm finance recommendation and conclusion the light the above discussion the following could recommended the government should introduce tax reduction incentive the bank that involve providing long term debt finance smes this may encourage the financial institution lend smes the bank ghana their regulation should help bank come out with innovative package such sme department this department may responsible for offering education monitoring and collection smes debtsin order reduce the high default rate and the perception risk the government ghana should formulate supportive law that will ensure smooth retrieval loan the bank accurate database business must set for their proper monitoring all smes must registered under
