since the reform and opening china smes have experienced rapid development playing increasingly important role prospering the economy increasing employment promoting innovation and maintaining stability present there are more than million small and medium enterprise smes registered the industrial and commercial sector china accounting for the total number enterprise china creating job for the urban labor force statistic show that the total production value china smes account for the country total output value import and export account for the country total import and export volume and the total amount tax paid the country account for more than the country total tax revenue the same time smes have the advantage rapid response and flexible mechanism and they are playing increasingly prominent role technological advancement and innovation since the reform and opening about patent were invented smes more than technological innovation were completed smes and more than new product were developed smes addition smes have flexible management system wide range business operation and rich business project they have the characteristic low investment quick result and strong adaptability when the economic cycle fluctuates they can take advantage turning small boat and turning around better and make timely change quickly adapt change economic structure and market demand many difficulty the operation smes china information asymmetry the root cause the financing problem small and mediumsized enterprise and the uncertainty business prospect important reason for the financing difficulty smes many small and mediumsized enterprise are competitive industry have low market entry threshold are not technically monopolized have poor antirisk capability and are most vulnerable the impact and impact economic cycle fluctuation leading unstable business operation these factor have increased the concerned and unwilling lend smes under the current economic and financial situation home and abroad some small and mediumsized enterprise our country have experienced difficulty their operation and they have been concentrated and prominent some region rapidly rising price production factor recent year especially since the purchase price index raw material fuel and power risen all the way although the exfactory price index industrial product and the retail price index good have also risen but have fallen below the former the rise the price energy and raw material caused great difficulty for the smes operating downstream the international conference business economics and management busem copyright francis academic press industrial chain the increase labor wage increased the operational difficulty laborintensive enterprise the promulgation and implementation the new labor contract law better protected the legitimate right and interest worker but also increased the operating cost laborintensive enterprise some study have estimated that the implementation the new labor contract law will increase the cost labor addition with the improvement social living standard and rising price the requirement for worker raise wage have become more and more urgent and have been highlighted the improvement labor wage standard the international financial crisis brought lot difficulty the development exportoriented smes affected the international financial crisis the lack external demand led fewer international order for smes especially exportoriented smes lower product price increased inventory and capital turnover difficulty and even funding problem iii change rmb appreciation and export tax rebate policy have reduced the profit margin laborintensive lowvalueadded smes without market pricing power with the continuous improvement china overall national strength the rmb will inevitably enter appreciation channel the appreciation the renminbi led significant decline the profitability small and mediumsized enterprise that competed the international market relying low price and some company were even eliminated china extensively adjusted the tax rebate policy for export product eliminated export tax rebate for product with high energy consumption high pollution and resource and reduced the export tax rebate rate for product that are likely cause trade friction the valueadded product the enterprise involved are low and the industrial transformation slow will lead decline profit margin and even closure according some survey among the company that accounted for more than the sale the international market exchange rate appreciation and export tax rebate rate reduction ranked first and second the major difficulty facing the company enforcement environmental protection policy increased the operating cost small and mediumsized enterprise through strengthening environmental governance and safe production the government internalized the production and operating cost that enterprise should have undertaken but did not assume and restored the true cost production and operation enterprise this will inevitably result squeezing high cost deformity low cost internal and external factor that restrict the financing smes most smes are competitive industry with low technical content poor antirisk capability high business risk shortterm business operation usually only year and high level downturn potential for bankruptcy according report released the ministry industry and information technology december according the score point the average health index chinese smes point which subhealth state and internal management level also the middle and lower reach the ephemeral nature the life cycle smes and the uncertainty their operation have some extent curbed the willingness financial institution lend the scale and credit level smes are low and restrict their financing capability the people bank china surveyed number small and mediumsized enterprise concentrated area indicating that over sme financial management system were not sound and over smes had credit rating below which severely weakened their financing capability the lack asset available for collateral security result high financing cost due bank preference for smes fixed asset they are generally reluctant accept smes liquid asset smes asset structure the proportion fixed asset small especially hightech enterprise and intangible asset account for relatively high proportion there real property that can used collateral and difficult meet the requirement for lending financial institution even financial institution agree lend order cover high risk the interest rate lending also much higher than that large corporate loan addition since the period for most guaranteed loan within half year and not more than one year credit guarantee agency basically only guarantee shortterm liquidity rather than longterm loan such equipment investment which increase the difficulty financing for smes the complicated guarantee procedure and high guarantee fee increase the financing cost the company and affect the financing efficiency realistic choice for solving sme financing the first enhance the overall strength smes only improving
