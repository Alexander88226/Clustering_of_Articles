popular strategy accelerate innovation among business firm however open innovation doe not always increase innovation performance argument extant literature respect the relationship between open innovation practice and innovation performance are inconsistent and inconclusive most existing theory have internal focus and therefore fall short explaining why some firm succeed open innovation initiative and why others fail open innovation about knowledge flow understand how boundary condition influence knowledge flow conducted detailed qualitative inquiry open innovation initiative software firm where leading university and private commercial bank participated the knowledge partner and commercialization partner respectively developing award winning fintech solution analysis data revealed that ability and willingness teacher firm share knowledge and also the ability and preparedness student firm acquire knowledge facilitated knowledge flow between the open innovation partner firm bundled those factor and named sequential coherence trust that our finding bridge gap open innovation literature these finding could generalized through large sample covering many other industry sector managerial implication the finding that ability scan the entire chain knowledge flow across boundary and taking corrective measure for any bottleneck hindrance observed can bring better result from open innovation initiative further sequential coherence lead multiple research opportunity furthering our knowledge open innovation keywords open innovation innovation performance knowledge flow boundary condition sequential coherencesinternational journal accounting business finance vol issue introductionthe increasing propensity firm work across their traditional boundary operation been captured open innovation mina openness strategy chesbrough and trend innovation management lopez carvalho attracted wide academic attention kim encourages organization open their process harness external knowledge accelerate internal innovation and also use external path early chesbrough although the importance acquiring external knowledge widely accepted how the knowledge flow happens little understood lakemond far known about with whom partner acquiring external knowledge lane lubatkin why doe not always bring higher innovation performance not adequately addressed existing literature yapa many firm struggle harness value from initiative salter lee shin they fail engage external actor dahlander piezunka challenge firm face involving external actor have become popular area for research afuah tucci felin zenger hossain aneesurrehman the rationale organization select the best partner organization among multiple candidate possessing the required knowledge can not explained existing theory west rusanen von krogh the objective this paper present our finding from qualitative inquiry undertook understand how organizational boundary open innovation initiative therefore frame the research problem how boundary condition influence performance initiative this address gap literature this enables answer why initiative lead varying level innovation performance open innovation demand permeability organizational boundary dahlander gann although conceptualized knowledge inflow and outflow the level organizational boundary most research work lack focus individual involved bogers manager and academic lack proper understanding the mechanism involving the boundary the innovation process enkel brunswicker vanhaverbeke suggest that research open innovation should investigate the interrelation between boundary condition and firm nature openness the boundary can between partner firm and the lead international journal accounting business finance vol issue firm between internal department any organization the lead firm partner firm our finding will further enhance the understanding factor influencing innovation performance literature review despite growing popularity research divided whether organization can benefit from lauritzen karafyllia inconsistent argument and inconclusive result appear extant literature respect the relationship between and

piezunka the stakeholder important study object boundarycrossing innovation activity hargrave van van geels bogers challenge firm face involving external actor have become popular area for research international journal accounting business finance vol issue afuah tucci felin zenger hossain aneesurrehman lane lubatkin emphasize the importance examining with whom firm should knowledgeopen innovation beyond the boundary the focal firm munir powell and recent publication have persistently stressed the necessity understanding the organizational and contextual factor that moderate the relationship between and innovation performance bengtsson therefore our study boundary condition and knowledge flow justifiable methodology used the case study approach looking for new explanation for the relationship between open innovation and innovation performance merriam emphasized that there standard format for reporting case study research some case study generate theory some describe case and others are analytical nature creswell yin suggests that case study can either single case study multiple case similarly case study can either holistic single unit analysis embedded multiple unit analysis lincon guba suggest that substantive case report should include the explication the problem comprehensive description the context detailed transaction process observed salience and outcome the inquiry the lesson learned stake outline case study step outlining vignette identification the issue purpose and method study extensive description case and context presentation issue presenting assertion and experiential note with closing vignette practice are popular among business organization sri lanka yapa senathiraja however practice the software industry sri lanka show varying level innovation performance yapa selected initiative sri lankan software firm developing award winning fintech solution case study extensive discussion and interview were conducted with key employee the selected firm and the partner firm understand the factor and circumstance that facilitated innovation performance respect knowledge flow across the focal firm and partner firm reader should note that the real name the organization not divulged zenith renowned software firm with proven track record offering solution the domain document management and digital enterprise automation they were keen entering international journal accounting business finance vol issue the banking and financial software solution sector fintech solution were gaining attention globally enabling customer engage online real time banking transaction easilyzenith decided design and develop innovative fintech solution which can replace the traditional wallet with digital wallet zenithalso realized the importance acquiring external knowledge the domain secure electronic payment and also partner early commercialize the solution they partnered with local university their inbound partner acquiring new knowledge zenithalso selected leading bank the country and known for innovative digital solution their outbound partner the mobile wallet they jointly developed named ewalletwas adjudged the best software solution the category banking financial service the national best quality software award the product also represented sri lanka the asia pacific ict alliance award and won merit award outperforming other economy the region the founder ceo zenith had this say when asked about the secret successoptions selecting bank the commercialization partnerafter careful evaluation the option selected the best known local university for software engineering the knowledge partner fortunately there were several academic with adequate exposure secure payment information security and digital forensics common interest shared pushed the project forward smoothly similarly partnered with the right bank which had the passion innovate with dire necessity penetrate the market when described the digital wallet they readily accepted partner with there again assigned the right people from our end work with the employee our partner firm zenith employee were aware the challenge the project they had learn not only banking but also accounting and regulatory framework their preparedness learn and share made success successfully concluded the open innovation initiative introducing the best banking innovation the country and also bringing glory and fame the country winning international award the asia pacific ict alliance award identifying the right partner very important activity open innovation had many university the mind among whom had select the most appropriate one similarly had many this how the chief operating officer the company explained the situation acquiring the required knowledge from another organization not something like you connect pipe and open the international journal accounting business finance vol issue valve that knowledge flow people who belong various rank from the organization take part the process their passion and motivation level may vary out many potential employee the knowledge partner the employee assigned from our end know the most appropriate one interact with and get the project going look for knowledge that not easily found book journal the web more than selecting the person with the best knowledge the one who the desire share and the right capability can make big difference this very important knowledge transfer doe not end with one conversation you got interact regularly the learner absorbs and build new knowledge gradually like the way wall constructed placing brick one another had extensive discussion with key people from zenith their partner university and their partner bank zenith had play the role student firm acquiring new knowledge and also act the teacher firm transferring knowledge their commercialization partner comprehensive analysis interview result revealed that the ability and the willingness the employee the teacher firm share knowledge and the ability and preparedness the employee the student firm for learning are the factor influencing the knowledge flow bundle those factor together and describe sequential coherence finding and discussionwedefine sequential coherence the reciprocal result the push and pull effect individual teaching firm and the learning firm respectively that enables knowledge flow across boundary firm argue that sequential coherence can measured through the ability and willingness teach the teacher firm participant and the ability and readiness learn the participant the student firm observed through the qualitative study done sequential coherence can explain the relationship between initiative and innovation performance much the interorganizational learning research use absorptive capacity which assumes firm can equally learn from any other firm lane lubatkin suggest that sequential coherence enables organization make use absorptive capacity the boundary firm become more porous with process and increased interaction with external actor litchtenthaler sequential coherence focus the boundary condition required for smooth cross border flow knowledge and technology both inbound and outbound practice focus not only the ability but also the willingness both the transferor and the recipient international journal accounting business finance vol issue knowledge more than measure internal ability sequential coherence focus boundary conditionshindrance sequential coherence between firm may affect innovation performance purposive management knowledge flow across boundary necessary chesbrough bogers lakemond and argue that sequential coherence can explain and ensure smooth knowledge flow manager should carefully examine sequential coherence between the lead firm and each partner firm achieve the expected innovation performance the strength chain defined and constrained the strength weakest link sequential coherence each boundary the knowledge flow matter ensuring smooth flow knowledge through regular scan the chain knowledge flow manager can identify any drawback bottleneck and hindrance take corrective action firm being the lead firm cooperates with firm inbound partner access knowledge sequential coherence between firm and firm matter ensuring the knowledge flow happens similarly firm work with firm the outbound partner where firm will assist firm early commercialize their innovation the sequential coherence between firm and firm important ensure the knowledge flow achieve the desired innovation performance argue that any absorptive capacity considered critical resource that depends the prior knowledge firm and determines the firm innovative capability dell anno nonaka takeuchi describe knowledge the result the interaction between the actor the transferor and the recipient argue that order transfer knowledge both the ability and willingness the transferor and recipient will matter this context sequential coherence compliment absorptive capacity acquiring knowledgeinternal capability are indispensable effectively exploiting external knowledge cohen levinthal vanhaverbeke cloodt important understand the internal organization the innovation process which determines diffusion and exploitation technical knowledge within the organization noteboom levinthal march argyres silverman lakemond describe the importance firm choice knowledge governance innovation performance bogers emphasize the importance the role played individual who are assigned with various task ensuring innovation performance international journal accounting business finance vol issue heath and staudenmaier describe that accomplishing work organization should motivate employee that their goal are aligned the agency problem and should organize the individual that their action are aligned the coordination problem argue that sequential coherence can considered addon absorptive capacity better understand the knowledge flow from one person another across boundary organization partner firm department and work team each point knowledge transfer the push and pull effect created the willingness and ability the participant from teacher firm and the ability and preparedness the participant from the student firm impact the result examining and influencing the degree sequential coherence practicing manager may influence innovation performance initiative vanhaverbeke cloodt explain that absorptive capacity explains only the inbound process and doe not pay attention outbound sequential coherence can bridge this gap address seamless knowledge transfer across the value chain from inbound internal knowledge transfer and outbound this regard the unit analysis using sequential coherence may the organization the entire network relationship inherently dynamic process that demand research incorporate dynamic element appleyard chesbrough argue that sequential coherence dynamic measure capable influencing innovation performance initiative why some open innovation initiative lead higher innovation performance and some fail cheng huizing bengtsson firm succeeds with firm initiative whereas similar initiative firm undertakes with firm fails examine only ability that pertaining firm can not explain why one initiative failed and the other succeeded suggest that sequential coherence can explain this and precondition for absorptive capacity work favor organization sequential coherence ensures that knowledge will flow smoothly from teacher firm student firm unbroken manner this transmission may happen through people via discussion presentation and interactive learning kogut zander and also through product and process higher social interaction between firm facilitated through multiple tie enhances knowledge acquisition ylirenko naqshbandi emphasizes the importance manager keep touch with people from different firm ensuring performance compare international journal accounting business finance vol issue knowledge flow across partner firm with the current flow electric circuit where component are considered different firm sequential coherence describes the soldered joint between various component also similar the cable lug used connecting different component specification individual component will use fail make the proper connection engineer quickly scan all the soldered joint between different component assembled printed circuit board when found not working properly manager can examine the knowledge flow boundary when thing are not moving initiative expected argue that sequential coherence enables knowledge fusion there growing interest assessing more micro level than the organization bogers salter dahlander ahn however individual level factor remain relatively ill understood bogers most research study have neglected the human aspect gassman west salter emphasize the challenge faced employee initiative employee need allocate time innovate within and also outside the firm dahlander argue that higher sequential coherence lead improved innovation performance initiative practicing manager may use sequential coherence influencing innovation performance open innovation initiative taking action address the four area highlighted namely willingness and ability participant from teacher firm and the preparedness and ability student firm participant research study show that when adopting strategy organization benefit differently and the reason for these difference are not explained saebi believe that our finding support extant literature and will increase the understanding propose test the new determinant sequential coherence with larger sampleusing quantitative research methodology for generalizing itinbound practice outbound practice innovationperformance sequential coherence figure suggested conceptual model for quantitative studywillingness and the ability teacher firm employee share knowledge and the preparedness and the ability the student firm acquire knowledge from international journal accounting business finance vol issue the teacher firm are the measurable dimension can identify operationalizing the construct sequential coherencefurther will interesting understand how sequential coherence can address issue cognitive distance search depth organizational inertia and ambidexteritythe regularly used variable explaining innovation performance through further research for example may test whether high degree sequential coherence influence search depth initiative whether attempting engage both simultaneously may lead waste resource and effort will another area researched from sequential coherence perspective how sequential coherence can address stickiness knowledge szulanski szulanski will also interesting area for further research further may examine whether the opportunity for participant from teacher firm learn from the student firm enhances the knowledge flow from teacher firm student firm finally major area future researcher may explore study how individual factor such attitude personality perception and motivation participant affect
