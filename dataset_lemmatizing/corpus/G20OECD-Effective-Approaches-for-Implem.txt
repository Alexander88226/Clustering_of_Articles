gather evidence smes which not have access mainstream financial service and product through survey government rely public body for such exercise too with only few country collecting data from through private sector provider very few country collect information the specific product smes not have access though relevant stakeholder are involved the assessment sme financing gap through institutionalised consultative body like sme committee panel through more informal hoc consultation which seems more frequent this assessment generally published often through periodic dedicated online publication the central bank the ministry finance the sme agency strengthen sme access traditional bank financing principle guarantee appear the most widespread tool strengthen sme access traditional bank financing most guarantee scheme target specific segment which receive preferential condition particular innovative and growthoriented smes young and woman entrepreneur well startup

smes located remote area and woman entrepreneur are the most widespread priority subsegments programme targeting specific sme population are more rarely evidencedriven while most country can provide breakdown the evidence and data collected smes which not have access mainstream financial product and service sector and size only few country can provide breakdown location owner demographic for instance while country have designed policy targeting smes located remote area only country collect data disaggregated location there appears room further build the evidence base regard access finance

process aiming considering the potential impact relevant upcoming law and regulation sme access finance the drafting stage few country have undertaken tax reform with the explicit aim supporting the diversification financing instrument for smes these reform generally take the form fiscal incentive for certain type investment investment venture capital fund improving transparency sme finance market principle digitalisation appears effective way improve access the data contained business credit registry can also help increase the coverage and relevance these data making submission and update process simpler and costly there remain important difference the level consultation fee across country though which may reflect different view regard the importance free access such information and transparency for efficient functioning market commercial credit reporting company are more frequent than public credit registry half the country which have commercial credit reporting company have put place oversight these company the nature the oversight and the authority charge vary across country the reflection the risk which come with the benefit such company can provide market player and the most efficient way mitigating and managing them still ongoing many country enhance sme financial skill and strategic vision principle very few country measure the financial skill sme owner and manager order identify their strength and weakness financial education initiative for smes target range skill including basic knowledge financial concept understanding traditional and alternative financial product well accessing and managing credit most initiative deliver financial education via workshop training printed booklet and online information but mobile phone application online video and elearning platform are also emerging some country national strategy often target the sme population whole nonetheless some country notforprofits and frequently government tailor programme specific segment such young entrepreneur woman entrepreneur indigenous and immigrant entrepreneur startup empirical evidence the effectiveness financial education and business training programme remains limited adopting principle risk sharing for publicly supported sme finance instrument principle nearly all responding country have public financial institution which contributes national objective regarding sme access finance generally operates alongside through private sector player bank largely remain the most important partner public authority with other financial institution nonbank financial institution like leasing factoring company equity fund playing prominent role guarantee financing operation undertaken smes with commercial player are the most widespread type collaboration between privatesector financial institution and public financial institution the public financial institution provides guarantee twentysix country few country offer risksharing instrument other than guarantee generally firstloss risk cover slightly more than third country which have public financial institution the public financial institution coinvests alongside privatesector player encouraging timely payment commercial transaction and public procurement principle when come tackling the cash flow issue smes may face result payment delay the majority government tend focus payment public body while they seem reluctant restrict the contractual freedom private firm pay invoice there are numerous initiative that area from prompt payment code tracking system which can provide detailed information payment delay public body some these mechanism have proved particularly effective swiftly and substantially reducing payment delay designing public programme for sme finance which ensure additionality cost effectiveness and userfriendliness principle ensuring the financial and economic additionality public programme guiding principle almost all country there are different interpretation what these concept imply though there appears room improve the methodology when assessing the additionality programme likewise while large majority country report that framework place ensure that the cost associated with the implementation public programme not outweigh their benefit than third conduct formal assessment regarding userfriendliness government recognise the importance raising sme awareness programme for which they may eligible and through dedicated website awareness campaign monitoring and evaluating public programme enhance sme finance principle there contrast between government recognition the importance evaluating programme improve sme access finance and corresponding evaluation methodology and procedure very few country conduct evaluation based rigorous methodology and thorough metric systematic manner there also appears scope increase the extent which the finding evaluation are taken into account when designing new programme however most country publish evaluation generally online introduction november their summit antalya leader welcomed and agreed the goecd highlevel principle sme financing which were developed the oecd together with other

found addendum this document definition common other and innovative approach common approach are approach which are adopted majority responding country other approach are approach which are adopted than majority country innovative approach are approach adopted only few country sometimes only one country which show some novelty the approach adopted implement the principle and potential for replication policy are qualified effective when they are considered effective implementing country and when experience result and evidence suggest that this the case the effective approach identified the report are not comprehensive illustrative and nonbinding they are intended example assist policy maker and other relevant stakeholder their policy work improve sme access finance see oecdinfe high level principle national strategy for financial education endorsed leader their los cabos summit june the survey fed into the oecd working paper financial education for msmes and potential entrepreneur report effective approach for implementing the goecd highlevel principle sme financing principle identify sme financing need and gap and improve the evidence base first step developing strategy enhance sme access finance government should ass the extent which smes financing need are met and where gap exist cooperation with relevant stakeholder including central bank and financial supervisory authority financial and research institution and sme representative this requires strong evidence base and better understanding sme financing need and challenge public authority and financial supplier effort should placed improving statistical information sme financing particularly developing economy where lack reliable evidence constrains policy design implementation and assessment this call for cooperation the national and international level including through expansion the oecd scoreboard financing smes and entrepreneur increase transparency regarding definition improve the comparability data and indicator within and across country facilitate international benchmarking and regulatory coordination and shed light outstanding financing gap and issue common and other approach government recognise the importance building the evidence base for policy making the area sme finance and take step identify the financing need and challenge their sme population all the country surveyed framework place collect quantitative data sme finance regard data bank loan the central bank and statistic office generally play major role data collection effort data collected almost always include sme loan stock and flow interest rate and nonperforming loan rate frequently data collected loan rejection rate collateral request drawdowns overdraft utilisation evidence sme financing including micro data and micro analysis needed for informed policy discussion the evaluation policy monitoring the implication financial reform smes access finance and for better understanding financial supplier sme financing need evidence financing need and gap firm size and stage the firm life cycle especially important tailor policy strategy this regard regular quantitative demandside survey can represent important source information but their harmonisation the national regional and international level should encouraged improve the quality information and crosscountry comparability difference definition and methodology the international level comparison data sme finance significantly hampered strengthening the ability document difference sme access finance across country can shed light policy experience and facilitate the exchange and adaptation good policy practice loan term and condition direct government loan government guaranteed loan restructured loan export credit guarantee data collection done through reporting exercise these public body well through survey while reporting due regular basis with basic data collected monthly basis survey are conducted either regular basis based need before designing new programme for example their frequency can vary substantially from one type survey another well from one country another that frequency can linked the scope the survey for instance some country conduct resourceintensive survey pluriannual basis and lighter survey the year these resourceintensive survey are not conducted for data fund received smes from private equity and venture capital firm business angel most country rely relevant specialised business association these association tend collect data through survey which are generally conducted annual basis with some data also collected biannual quarterly basis other source used collect both quantitative and qualitative data include bank association economic research institute and research centre development bank for all country which have one and guarantee institution resort data from commercial provider and nongovernmental organisation rarely mentioned breakdown collected almost always include size sector and location age firm and form ownership are collected some country albeit frequently collection data owner characteristic also frequent sometimes due privacy law confidentiality concern however number country collect data the gender age the owner well other characteristic like the birth country the owner for example large majority surveyed country also gather evidence smes which not have access mainstream financial service and product out survey appear effective tool gather such evidence with around twothirds country conducting survey several survey breakdown sector and size appear the most prevalent with country which can provide breakdown size generally measured number employee turnover and country which can provide breakdown sector breakdown other dimension are widespread only seven country can provide breakdown location and six breakdown owner demographic while there certain variety the body through which data collected whether through survey not public body are considered effective data provider with only few country resorting evidence collected the private sector the paragraph evidence gathered country smes which not have access mainstream financial service and product draw country reply related survey question under principle they are grouped with information gathered under principle since reply these question both relate identifying sme financing need and gap and improving the evidence gap under principle country have provided information the data they collect the funding provided smes while under principle country have provided information how they gather evidence smes which not have access mainstream financial service and product the two most prevalent body involved are the central bank supervisor mentioned country and the statistic office mentioned other public body involved include government agency eight country ministry five country the development public bank five country six country also leverage data collected international organisation very few country collect evidence the specific product smes not have access with the information gathered through survey process relating access finance general among the country which not collect data the product smes have access not one country however organises informal roundtable with smes hoc basis order better understand the financing product which they have sufficient and insufficient access when come gathering comparative evidence from other country and region ass sme financing trend and condition nine country mention the oecd scoreboard financing smes and entrepreneur with six out nine relying the scoreboard only most eurozone country also use data produced the european central bank particular data collected through the european central bankeuropean commission survey the access finance enterprise and the ecb bank lending survey well data produced eurostat survey reply also suggest that other eurozone country are considered the relevant benchmark for these country the oecd sme financing scoreboard appears the main tool through which surveyed country contribute international effort improve the comparability statistical data sme finance out country which answered this question country mentioned the scoreboard and the scoreboard only country which participate other initiative improve the comparability statistical data sme finance are generally european union country which participate european union initiative including through the sme envoy network large majority country report that they involve relevant stakeholder the assessment sme financing gap these include the main public body central bank ministry finance and statistic office well relevant business association bank association private equity and venture capital association and sometimes also sme association some country have sme committee panel which meet regular basis generally three four time year discus smerelated question including access finance and serf consultative body for most country though the consultation process seems more informal and conducted hoc rather than regular basis consultation sometimes also include research institute expert likewise most country report that they publish the government assessment sme financing need and trend this publication take various form periodic hoc publication the central bank ministry finance sme agency are widespread with publication often occurring the respective website these body frequently some country also publish press release organise press conference make the main highlight this assessment known the general public innovative approach novel approach adopted gather data funding provided smes private equity and venture capital firm business angel partnership between public body central bank ministry finance andor statistic office and private equity venture capital angel capital business association conduct survey the state sme financing these segment this represents interesting combination access the relevant company the one hand and technical capacity the other hand since these public body have technical capacity the statistic field particular that very few business association have the same extent sector which not submitted the same type regulation the banking sector and whose player not submit regular reporting selected effective approach identify sme financing need and gap and improve the evidence base based survey result collecting quantitative data sme finance through reporting and survey conducted public body central bank statistic office etc collecting data fund received smes from private equity and venture capital firm business angel through the relevant business association partnership between public body central bank ministry finance andor statistic office and private equity venture capital angel capital business association conduct survey the state sme financing these segment gathering comparative evidence from other country and region through the oecd scoreboard financing smes and entrepreneur involving relevant stakeholder the assessment sme financing gap through institutionalised sme committee panel through hoc consultation publishing the government assessment sme financing need and trend online principle strengthen sme access traditional bank financing main source external finance for most small business effort improve bank capacity lend smes should pursued measure may include credit guarantee securitisation credit insurance and adequate provisioning for loan loss risk mitigation measure should strengthened making use new technology and mechanism for underwriting risk effective and predictable insolvency regime should ensure creditor right while supporting healthy company and offering second chance for honest entrepreneur likewise smes should afforded credit reasonable term and with appropriate consumer protection measure place policy maker should consider enabling smes use broader set asset beyond fixed collateral such movable asset secure loan the feasibility expanding the use intangible collateral should carefully considered ease access lending particularly knowledgebased company while taking into account potential risk the use credit information should also enabled improve risk management for lender and access for borrower improving bank capacity lend smes common and other approach out country which completed the survey provide direct policy support bank lending smes guarantee sme loan appear the most widespread instrument with guarantee fund mentioned almost all country and the main pillar support for sme lending guarantee are generally capped but this cap can quite high and few country guarantee the amount the loan most country have one guarantee fund providing guarantee for sme loan few country various institution are involved depending the sector which the sme operates for instance most guarantee fund target specific segment which receive preferential condition particular innovative and growthoriented smes young and woman entrepreneur well startup are priority for number guarantee programme incentive foster sme lending commercial bank are widespread than direct support policy measure eight country not have such incentive for european union country incentive include the sme supporting factor introduced the capital requirement directive under which the capital requirement for loan smes reduced the application multiplier similar multiplier applied some noneu country other incentive include lower reserve requirement ratio and different term for liquidity provision for country which have minimum amount sme loan share sme loan their total loan portfolio country the government put place the process introducing measure support the securitisation sme loan most case these measure aim creating enabling and conducive framework through legal and regulatory reform the creation register increasing the availability and transparency information country which have public financial institution generally participates actively the securitisation market support growth one country worked increase awareness and skill that area the mean inhouse and external seminar and training help market participant understand securitisation and actively participate the market these seminar are complemented online information regard the effectiveness measure only six country could reply that the measure implemented had proven effective other country the measure were just being put place too early tell whether they had been effective innovative approach some innovative approach intend make the credit approval process more transparent smes one country bank have obligation provide smes with standardised credit report and with their credit rating based common methodology another country put place credit review office providing credit appeal process for smes the credit review office meant help smes who have had application for credit three million euro declined reduced participating bank but feel that they have viable business proposition also look case where borrower feel that the term and condition their existing loan new loan offer are unfairly onerous have been unreasonably changed their detriment regard securitisation one country the government supported the creation securitisation company the initiative the central bank and partnership with commercial bank this company issue guaranteed debt security backed loan portfolio including sme and midcap loan portfolio these security can used collateral capital market operation the company rating system established the central bank play major role the good functioning this scheme insolvency regime common and other approach nineteen country have introduced measure streamline insolvency procedure and reduce the related administrative burden these measure tend put place simplified accelerated procedure for smes thus aiming making them more manageable for entrepreneur and small business which may not have internal legal resource access external legal advice eighteen country have taken measure enhance timeliness insolvency proceeding overall the measure established clear timeline for the various step insolvency proceeding particular the filing claim the creditor meeting and the court hearing shortened these timeline this often coupled with digitisation the procedure through online form meant make easier and quicker deal with only three country have conducted evaluation the effectiveness measure enhance timeliness insolvency proceeding one through government evaluation body one through independent consultancy and one through published research article sixteen country have taken step ensure that the insolvency framework provides creditor with range opportunity receive information and monitor the progress insolvency administration which they have interest seven these country have put place online insolvency register while generally provides realtime access submission made other party the proceeding report the insolvency administrator and issued judgement the court there are some variation across country both the extent the information contained the online register and the extent the access provided who can access the register and when the information contains can accessed one country put place insolvency bulletin the form electronic newsletter which provides renegotiations and reorganization conducted and undertaken this bulletin considered the only valid form notify the party any person can have access the newsletter and review all the proceeding undertaken information about liquidation seventeen country have taken measure enhance insolvency competency court out these country have put place specialised court judge and two have provided specific training judge few country allow debt discharge facilitate second chance for nonfraudulent entrepreneur however the timeline vary substantially from one country another one country debtor subject bankruptcy are discharged from their debt after month with the restriction extended beyond month only when there been some wrongdoing another country however early debt discharge for insolvent entrepreneur implies that while the general rule that discharge can only obtained after six year early discharge available after three year provided that the debtor cover the cost the proceeding and discharge least outstanding debt some country report that such regime place one them insolvent entrepreneur can not request any credit from bank for seven year innovative approach the most favourable regime term debt discharge under which debtor are discharged their debt after month also includes some innovative feature intended allow nonfraudulent entrepreneur quickly start new activity particular during bankruptcy debtor may keep their tool trade and vehicle enable them continue work they may also set new business whilst bankrupt but must disclose their full name and obtaining credit over limit must disclose their bankruptcy status bankrupt individual can not company director but she can seek leave the court take continue directorship collateral common and other approach among measure reduce the cost and time for filing and registering security interest few country have digitised this registration that can made few minute digital register also appear effective way publicising the existence security right asset creditor purchaser and the general public only three country reported having taken step facilitate the use nonfixed and intangible asset such patent trademark and other intellectual property secure loan two country have undertaken evaluation ass the benefit cost and risk implied the use nonfixed and intangible asset secure loan selected effective approach strengthen sme access traditional bank financing based survey result providing government guarantee sme loan with specific programme targeting priority segment woman entrepreneur young entrepreneur startup etc supporting the securitisation sme loan including creating enabling and conducive legal and regulatory framework putting place register increasing the availability and transparency information making the credit approval process more transparent smes for instance providing them with standardised credit report and with their credit rating based standardised methodology making insolvency procedure simpler and quicker for smes including digitising the process through online register allowing online submission form and realtime consultation the party along the process establishing clear timeline for the various step insolvency proceeding enhancing insolvency competency court through specialised court judge the provision specific training judge digitising the registration security interest digital register can also effective way publicising the existence security right asset creditor purchaser and the general public principle enable smes access diverse nontraditional financing instrument and channel recognising the complementary nature the role bank and other financing channel access sufficiently broad range sme financing instrument desirable order obtain the form and volume financing best suited smes specific need and the stage the firm lifecycle multiple and competing source finance for smes should supported and effort should made increase entrepreneur awareness the available financing option through targeted outreach initiative the development alternative financial instrument for smes should also aim attract wider range investor including institutional investor and enhance their understanding sme market assetbased finance could fostered enable young and small firm access working capital rapid and flexible term well supply chain and trade finance support their integration global value chain alternative form debt could cultivated enable smes invest expand and restructure adequate policy attention should the development hybrid tool and equity instrument strengthen smes capital structure and boost investment innovative startup and highgrowth smes special consideration should given venture and private equity financing including capital for seed early and later stage investment well trade finance instrument increasing entrepreneur awareness the available financing option common and other approach online platform providing comprehensive and tailored information order increase the knowledge sme owner and manager all available financing option are common information programme and campaign are widespread they can institutional investor and their related effective approach see also the goecd high level principle long term investment financing finance warehouse receipt and leasing asset based finance includes for example assetbased lending factoring purchase order alternative form debt include corporate bond private placement direct lending nonbank institution and peertopeer lending hybrid loan and bond silent participation participating loan profit participation right convertible bond bond with warrant and mezzanine finance include subordinated instrument instrument specialised platform for public listing smes and equitybased crowdfunding equity instrument comprise venture capital business angel investing other private equity instrument for investor the existence appropriate channel for exit can help increase the attractiveness these take different form and undertaken various stakeholder depending the country context example include awareness action conducted the public financial institution partnership with the chamber commerce the form seminar the capital and the region they are sometimes accompanied tailored consulting service one country free regional advisory clinic give smes the opportunity meet with corporate finance expert discus private and onetoone basis their individual funding plan another one launched sme business navigator which free web tool for entrepreneur willing start business which provides them with helpful information including financing option make the sme business navigator particularly accessible mobile application are available innovative approach innovative approach beyond raising awareness providing consulting service and play active role matching smes with fund investor this can achieved through online platform matching startup and investor need business network created the government concierge service offering free customised advice smes and connecting them funding and support programme that will help them grow their business through innovation such matching can also achieved through meet the funder event providing business with information and access range funding provider speaker address how business should approach the funding process and company have opportunity network with funding provider one country also put place referral regime whereby smes rejected for credit the largest bank must offered referral designated online finance platform broadening the base sme investor common and other approach government country have taken action encourage retail investor invest sme financial market two third these country this took the form tax incentive tax reduction granted for investment smes are always capped but this cap varies substantially across country eligibility for the tax reduction may also depend the fulfilment certain number criterion which can include the age the sme location the way the share were acquired must via crowdfunding platform for example assetbased finance common and other approach only few country report having taken action support the development assetbased lending for smes some case because such reform are not considered needed because enabling framework already place few country have promoted factoring electronically recorded monetary claim while industry effort aim developing system that enable different electronic monetary claim recording institution electronically transfer recorded monetary claim each other some others have put place framework supporting supply chain finance for instance allowing lending between nonfinancial institution there commercial link between them few country have set supply chain finance electronic platform accompanied with access assistance and training innovative approach one country after setting online platform providing registration service for account receivable pledge and transfer finance lease inventory and warehouse receipt pledge well public notification system for movable asset financing working service platform for inventory finance with the authorisation the owner lender could have access the warehouse system for owner inventory historical record information related the collateral situation would also available during the effective period pledge the platform would also enable the simultaneous exchange commodity ownership information alternative form debt corporate bond and private placement common and other approach fifteen country have introduced measure enhance the public issuance trading and clearing condition corporate debt security nine report that rule are place provide for private placement corporate security country the legal and regulatory framework allows nonlisted smes issue corporate bond and this can generally done the same term for listed company which include the preparation prospectus unless exemption granted such exemption are granted for issuance below certain cap addressed sophisticated investor only for instance hybrid instrument common and other approach few country support the provision mezzanine finance smes through mezzanine fund targeting smes and with the objective supporting the development commercial mezzanine finance market these fund can managed the public financial institution for country which have one funding can provided privately managed fund extending mezzanine finance smes one country put place micromezzanine fund which provides silent partnership for smes with smaller funding need equity finance common and other approach country government governmentrelated institution make direct equity investment smes the public financial institution generally charge these equity investment through series different fund they are generally coinvestments alongside private investor most case this combined with indirect equity investment through fund fund few country offer targeted initiative improve investorreadiness startup and smes generally through accelerator incubator providing them with training finance and pitching training particular well mentoring coaching and networking opportunity most country seed and early stage investor such venture capitalist and business angel are not subject licensing norm solvency funding requirement accounting requirement investment regulation likewise very few jurisdiction have restriction investment seed and early stage venture bank insurance company retail collective investment restriction tend affect pension fund more with eight country mentioning restriction pension fund investment seed and early stage venture support equity investment through tax incentive widespread however foreigner are eligible for these incentive only eight country and two these country only they are resident while for two others only eea citizen are eligible regard listing rule and requirement are adapted small equity issuer country innovative approach few country support provided smes which are will listed the form mentoringcoaching with the objective helping them comply with listing requirement such support can even mandatory until one year after the listing crowdfunding common and other approach clear regulatory framework place country however this framework generally cover only equity crowdfunding various limitation apply both the issuer and the investor the issuer submitted number information and publication obligation the amount the issuer can raise can also limited investor are limited the amount they can invest and may obliged seek the advice investment adviser cap vary substantially across country campaign increase awareness crowdfunding option are conducted various form including seminar crowdfunding day and brochure crowdfunding some country focus the risk associated with equity crowdfunding for investor and carefully monitor the activity crowdfunding platform selected effective approach enable smes access diverse nontraditional financing instrument and channel based survey result increasing awareness sme owner and manager all available financing option through combination online platform information programme and seminar delivered various location across the country matching smes with fund investor through online platform through dedicated event improving the investorreadiness startup and smes through accelerator incubator providing them with training well mentoring coaching and networking opportunity putting place referral regime whereby smes rejected for credit the largest bank must offered referral designated online finance platform principle promote financial inclusion for smes and ease access formal financial service including for informal firm policy should aim maximise the number smes which have access and use mainstream financial service and product reasonable cost financial inclusion important tool reduce informality and national financial inclusion strategy should include reviewing the legal and regulatory framework the financial sector defining public intervention strategy and identifying appropriate delivery instrument and ensuring the existence tool for group excluded from the formal banking sector microfinance scheme should given adequate attention particularly developing country mean enhance entrepreneur access small amount funding affordable cost common and other approach most country have implemented numerous measure the field financial inclusion although they not necessarily fall under financial inclusion strategy only six country have financial inclusion strategy sme access finance important dimension country work the area financial inclusion with country signalling that smes are among target the financial inclusion strategy measure the area financial inclusion out concerned these are reviewed regularly country including seven country which the review conducted annually regard policy aiming increasing the access finance specific subsegments priority segment are generally young entrepreneur smes located remote area and woman entrepreneur with specific policy targeting these subsegments around twothirds surveyed country half many country have launched programme targeting senior entrepreneur and entrepreneur with disability migrant business are priority ten country some programme combine component and target rural woman entrepreneur for example policy targeting smes located remote area are generally component regional development programme aiming supporting the development region lagging behind and ensuring fair access across the country that regard there seems contrast between the high number country which design policy aiming improving the access finance smes located remote area and the low number country collecting data disaggregated smes which not have access mainstream financial service and product location seven supra there appears scope further build the evidence base regard sme access finance across territory number country

approach almost all country have business registry which considered effective tool for overcoming information asymmetry the registry generally available online can held different body including chamber commerce and either the national the local level regional chamber commerce for example most country have undertaken measure enhance the accessibility the business registry out and one exploring undertaking such measure the main measure undertaken the digitisation the registry make available online some country this includes not only the possibility consulting the registry but also the possibility register business online and sometimes very short time one day for example digitisation appears effective way improving access the data contained the registry while few country have made all information available for free the norm seems that basic information date incorporation address etc accessible for free while access other information financial statement particular requires the payment fee few country have aimed increasing accessibility reducing the cost consult the register this generally achieved decreasing the cost each consultation but can also take the form allowing number free consultation for example one country consultation cost usd while another one every business allowed free consultation which not include the possibility copy save however overall there seems remain important difference the level fee across country large number country out have undertaken measure increase the comprehensiveness and quality the information provided the business

country smes operating the agricultural sector two country and smes operating the green sector one country practically all public financial institution operate alongside through privatesector player out regard the type partner the public financial institution work with country mention bank mention fund and mention nonbank financial institution nbfis therefore bank largely remain the most important partner public authority their policy increase sme access finance with other financial institution playing role which still far prominent that may somewhat constrain public financial institution capacity contribute broadening the range financial instrument smes have access guarantee financing operation undertaken smes with privatesector financial institution are the most widespread type collaboration between privatesector financial institution and public financial institution the public financial institution provides guarantee twentysix country coinvestment mentioned slightly more than third country which have public financial institution and few country offer risksharing instrument other than guarantee generally firstloss risk cover ceiling direct indirect support increased access finance accompanied technical assistance bit more than half the country which have public financial institution contributing increasing sme access finance technical assistance provided mainly the field business management and development nine country and accounting and finance eight country other area mentioned include sale and marketing four country international expansion two country corporate governance two country two country and two country therefore some country public support sme access finance appears focused the supply side and the demand side providing smes with the knowledge and skill needed apply for the most suitable financing instrument successful and sustainable manner importantly there appears scope strengthen the evaluation the contribution the public financial institution national objective regarding sme access finance fourteen out country indicate that evaluation conducted one country declares that evaluation conducted but not recently and another country declares that evaluation currently being undertaken among these country number country appear rely measure effectiveness which may benefit from being further developed disbursement increase overall sme lending number loan for instance innovative approach regard evaluation one country the activity the public investment fund are evaluated every three year with the latest evaluation conducted consulting company and the fund engaged collaboration with consultant and business school with the aim mapping the effect activity the entire evaluation made available online selected effective approach adopt principle risk sharing for publicly supported sme finance instrument based survey result accompanying the direct indirect provision funding the public financial institution with measure addressing demandside challenge and obstacle for example providing smes with the knowledge and skill needed apply for the most suitable financing instrument successful and sustainable manner conducting regular evaluation the contribution pfi programme improving and diversifying sme access finance publishing evaluation the activity the public financial institution online for instance principle encourage timely payment commercial transaction and public procurement timely payment business business and government business transaction could encouraged enhance the cash flow small business supplier policy maker and regulator should ensure that smes which are particularly vulnerable late payment nonpayment are offered clear and appropriate payment term norm could designed implemented and enforced discourage late payment commercial transaction including for crossborder trade common and other approach the majority government not restrict the contractual freedom pay invoice only around third surveyed country took action that direction address payment delay more have put place measure ensure automatic entitlement compensation for late payment this compensation can consist penalty the payment interest both number country mention that they took related measure when transposing the late payment directive one country although action taken restrict the contractual freedom pay invoice the public authority encourage business sign the national supplier code developed the industry which commits signatory paying small business within thirty day similarly another country which taken action restrict the contractual freedom pay invoice also introduced prompt payment code whereby signatory commit pay supplier time provide clarity their term and encourage good practice third country which also taken action restrict the contractual freedom pay invoice accompanied such action with two voluntary initiative support prompt payment day prompt payment agreement for public sector body only and voluntary prompt payment code conduct date the country count public sector and private sector signatory the code also launched public campaign advertise the code and encourage sign while official attend and manage various late payment information event every year fifteen country have put place mechanism enabling smes challenge unfair contractual term and practice only one them conducted study the use such mechanism smes and specifies that survey conducted every year other country not ass the effectiveness these measure government appear focus their effort payment public body with country which have implemented measure ensure automatic entitlement compensation for late payment public body eight specify that late payment public body result right for smes claim interest upon meeting certain condition one country and two that smes are entitled the payment both penalty and interest while out country did not provide answer that question five country report that measure ensure automatic entitlement compensation for late payment public body mechanism enabling smes report late payment public body resulted improvement the delay under which public body settle their bill and can provide supportive evidence three other country report improvement but without supportive evidence and five country declare that improvement observed yet among these five country one country report that the average payment time public order decreased from day another one report that the average payment delay decreased more than compared the previous year innovative approach one country established observatory payment delay which gather number directorate from ministry and representative from the statistic office and examines the condition payment between enterprise every year based data company balance sheet provided the central bank this observatory proven quite effective contributing the reduction payment delay among mechanism challenge unfair contractual term and practice one country the mediator enterprise competent all question related payment delay whether the client public private the mediator enterprise proven effective mechanism support smes when faced with unfair contractual term and practice and the nonrespect payment term one the main reason for resorting the mediator with case likewise another country launched complaint handling service small business commissioner ensure fair payment practice for small business the small business commissioner advises sme complaint and challenge late payment and payment term including considering complaint and providing alternative dispute resolution service nine country have put place mechanism enabling smes report late payment public body among these country one designed comprehensive programme called timely payment which aim promoting supplier payment public institution thirty day the programme structured around five dimension timely information the programme provides public institution official permanent information related their institution payment behaviour application through which both supplier and public institution can manage their payment process iii claim management unit follows payment claim made supplier training the programme train both supplier and public institution payment procedure and good payment practice strategic alliance the programme signed strategic alliance with specific actor mostly public institution these country gather statistic regarding the use such entitlement mechanism one country the government survey and report the payment performance agency with the pay time survey which also report the amount penalty interest paid across reporting agency another one part the management accountability framework process department are required provide annual basis for the latest completed fiscal year the following element the number payment supplier made time the total number payment supplier and the percentage payment supplier made time going beyond one country put place system which record all the information reported electronic invoice this system allows gathering the number invoice issued each supplier and their amount well the number invoice received each public body and their amount report payment time and possible delay and allows calculate the average payment period and delay for each public body one country all information payment performance public body available online ensuring high level accountability and transparency another interesting example government payment service monitor under which the ministry report parliament the payment behaviour public body the monitor includes central government and local authority and also published online finally one country put place project bank account some sector ensure prompt payment public body the supply chain project bank account bank account with trust status used make payment supplier working project whilst providing protection beneficiary case insolvency selected effective approach encourage timely payment commercial transaction and public procurement based survey result tracking delay payment public body consolidating related data and potentially also publishing online sharing with the parliament putting place mechanism enabling smes report late payment public body establishing observatory payment delay examine the condition payment between enterprise creating mediator commissioner competent all question related payment delay whether the client public private setting project bank account ensure public body prompt payment supplier working project principle design public programme for sme finance which ensure additionality cost effectiveness and userfriendliness the design public programme enhance sme access finance should ensure financial and economic additionality along with cost effectiveness policy coherence across level government and between government and nongovernment body dealing with sme finance should pursued based reliable evidence the target population eligibility criterion credit risk management and fee structure should considered carefully and defined clearly when designing programme which should easy understand for smes the administrative burden and compliance cost new and existing policy should proportionate the service provided the impact beneficiary firm and the broader economy well the nature and size the targeted business common and other approach almost all country declare ensuring financial additionality when designing and implementing public programme for sme finance out and many declare that framework place ensure that programme for sme finance generate economic additionality the other hand there appear wide difference what the concept additionality cover across country particularly economic additionality while the definition financial additionality seems more consistent and capturing the need for public programme not crowd out the private sector and rather address financing gap addition most the time the information provided regard how additionality assessed whether financial economic suggests that there scope for methodological improvement that area twentyfive country report that framework place ensure that the cost associated with the implementation public programme not outweigh their benefit the other hand than third surveyed country report conducting formal assessment for country which conduct assessment post assessment the most widespread country with ante assessment coming next nine country and with few country monitoring this along the transaction additionally assessment rely clearly defined and measurable key performance indicator kpis just two country twentyeight country have put place coordination mechanism ensure the consistency policy aiming enhance sme access finance across level government while twentyfour have put place coordination mechanism ensure the consistency policy between government and nongovernment body response suggest that government recognise the importance raising smes awareness programme for which they may eligible indeed country ensure that smes are made aware public sme finance programme transparent and clear manner through dedicated website nine country awareness campaign three country both country one country the business network the government multichannel information and advisory service for small business and entrepreneur provides information and advice smes that are seeking government programme service permit license and regulation start manage finance and grow business main service delivery channel include website programme and service tollfree telephone and email service well inperson service provided through local service centre additionally each local service centre mandated undertake outreach and information session their particular geographic region through these initiative centre staff give presentation attend conference and offer training session help inform local smes about programme and service that are available them including sme financing programme numerous country have also taken step facilitate access sme financing programme mainly making relevant information available online some case the application process can also completed online innovative approach requiring some form evidence additionality the form refusal from financial institution approach that appears effective one country rejection letter from two financial institution are necessary eligible guarantee ensure that the borrower would not qualify for loan from privatesector financial institution reasonable term without government guarantee another country lender must first apply their normal lending requirement ass borrower finance application and only application that are unsuccessful are then offered loan under the programme against payment two percent annual guarantee fee the government regard sme awareness government programme support sme finance one country put place sme online tool thanks which answering eight simple question business owner entrepreneur can find out which support programme are available them selected effective approach design public programme for sme finance which ensure additionality cost effectiveness and userfriendliness based survey result defining clear methodology ass the additionality contemplated measure increase sme access finance and putting place procedure make sure that this assessment done systematic manner requiring evidence additionality the form refusal from financial institution for instance raising sme awareness public programme for sme finance for which they may eligible through dedicated website coupled with awareness campaign various location and partnering with business association local authority increase outreach principle monitor and evaluate public programme enhance sme finance monitoring and evaluation policy ease smes access finance should promoted ante and post evaluation should performed regularly based clearly defined rigorous and measurable policy objective and impact and cooperation with financial institution sme representative and other stakeholder evaluation finding should feed back into the process policy making particular when measure fail meet their stated objective are found have undesirable impact regional national and international policy dialogue and exchange experience how monitor and evaluate public programme enhance sme finance should encouraged common and other approach response suggest significant contrast between government recognition the importance evaluating programme increase sme access finance the one hand and the degree which corresponding evaluation methodology and procedure are place the other hand almost all country have framework place ensure the evaluation sme finance programme out and one establishing this framework includes ante evaluation country continuous monitoring country and post evaluation country the other hand these evaluation and monitoring are not always systematic and may conducted only casebycase basis when asked whether mechanism are place ensure that monitoring and evaluation need are taken into account the design stage the programme while country declare that such mechanism are place only can provide example such mechanism likewise while country report that evaluation are based clearly defined rigorous and measurable policy objective and impact although not always systematic manner the example provided only sometimes meet these criterion particular objective and impact seem rarely quantified and their achievement even more rarely assessed against baseline set the beginning the implementation phase one country conduct incrementality study which seek determine the extent which the programme assisted smes accessing financing that they would not otherwise have been able access the absence the programme their additionality another country conducted study both the guarantee fund additionality and contribution the economy relative cost finally one country mention research article which have looked into the incremental lending smes which resulted from the programme implemented the country directly support sme lending most country engage series stakeholder the evaluation process including beneficiary and partner financial institution generally through survey interview focus group combination these which appear effective way gathering feedback and view public programme one country when reviewing one guarantee programme received input from over stakeholder including individual business and business representative representative from the accountancy and advisory profession representative from bank responsible finance provider assetbased lender and academic addition part the review independent study conducted consultancy undertake qualitative assessment with delivery partner and borrower ass the effectiveness the scheme and identify potential delivery barrier this research involved conducting indepth interview and focus group with fifteen lender and indepth interview with twentyfour borrower the borrower interview were structured the type lender from which they had accessed their supported loan although they are not systematic and may benefit from relying more rigorous methodology and metric evaluation are published country and available online out these country unclear whether the general public any knowledge the availability evaluation report very few country communicate about their finding the one which generally conduct press conference there are also few example seminar during which the finding are shared and thought through various stakeholder public body beneficiary financial institution academic etc draw the lesson the evaluation that they feed into upcoming programme accountability seems the parliament indeed numerous country the result evaluation are sent the parliament specific parliament committee discussed dedicated session with the former prevailing over dedicated session and discussion these process are sometimes linked the budget process with the provision more funding the continuation funding the programme dependent positive evaluation result there appears scope strengthen the extent which the finding evaluation are taken into account designing new programme while large majority country seem view this logical and important step very few country have put place procedure and process ensuring that this the case most country mention only sharing evaluation report while this itself doe not guarantee that the finding evaluation report are taken into account order encourage the exchange experience how monitor and evaluate sme finance public programme one country hold periodical international evaluation conference coorganised the ministry economic development and the agency for enterprise development another country the agency for growth policy analysis requested the government arrange series seminar for the government office and various agency tasked with implementing growth policy with the objective
