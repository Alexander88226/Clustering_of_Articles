collecting and analyzing vast amount data without human intervention one factor that enabled southeast asia benefit from fintech these way been the growing availability the internet and smartphones the region the internet and social medium penetration rate have reached and respectively fig while people have bank account and over are credit card holder this situation driving the continual emergence fintech business based the use the internet and smartphones southeast asia characteristic southeast asian fintech businessessome the fintech company that have emerged southeast asia are not much different from their counterpart developed country however there are also many business with characteristic that are unique southeast asia and emerging country overall the following three characteristic can observed first many these business are being established solve problem this reflects the numerous issue that the southeast asian financial sector face founder fintech startup this area begin not thinking about what they can achieve with fintech but identifying problem and considering whether they can use fintech solve them second the underlying technology and business model utilized fintech business fig access digital system southeast asiainternet penetration ratesocial medium penetration ratesocial medium penetration rate via mobile device source are social singapore digital global overview httpswearesocialcomsg rim pacific business and industry vol xviii southeast asia were generally not developed the region but were instead imported from developed country and china southeast asian entrepreneur and business owner identify financial issue the region and scour the world for fintech technology and business model with the potential solve those issue they then integrate these technology and business model into their own business operation from another point view which relates back the first characteristic these business fintech fundamentally tool for solving problem and little importance attached where the technology originally developed whether simply rehash another technology third the fintech business southeast asia employ business model that combine both hightech and lowtech method country normally make progress gradually introducing technology stage but because emerging and developing country have fallen behind developed country they are generally able leapfrog intermediate stage and achieve rapid evolution introducing the latest technology while southeast asian fintech company adopt cuttingedge technology and business model they also retain traditional method that seem unsuited the digital age from the perspective developed country for example even situation where mobile payment service are available those service can not accessed fully from mobile device and must complemented ancillary service provided partner such small retailer local community one reason for this the fact digital business and other type business have not evolved the same pace southeast asia resulting gap that not exist developed country good example that many people have smartphones but not bank account basic necessity from developed country point viewin the following section will look fintech business that illustrate these characteristic typical fintech business southeast asia mobile payment service typical scheme mobile payment service that have emerged southeast asia are basically the same those developed country however one feature that not common developed country the availability measure that can used people who not have bank account other emerging and developing country most mobile phone are prepaid type for which call charge must paid advance user top from bank account cash through local retail outlet and convenience store many the mobile payment have feature that you can load electronic money the same way case study momo momo payment service vietnam operated the startup mservice the company launched the service after

initially mservice provided payment service using sim card but switched own mobile payment app called momo the app can used load electronic money and carry out various transaction relating electronic payment including money transfer between individual utility charge payment online shopping payment and airline ticket reservation response the current environment vietnam mservice target user base includes not only people with bank account but also people with bank account but local access bank branch atm people without bank account and even people who not own smartphones meet the need this

bank account load prepaid electronic money for use mobile payment and receive cash transferred them those who not own smartphones can have the agent use their mobile payment facility transfer fund pay utility charge their behalf currently about onehalf momo customer are user mobile payment service while the other half use agent service the company approach reflects the situation vietnam where customer need for financial service can not met solely through mobile device they even offer feature that allows user find the nearest agent using the gps function their smartphones rural area vietnam post office play important role providing financial service such remittance and payment for people who not have bank account however these service are not entirely customerfriendly for example counter normally close and remittance take day momo agent have longer operating hour than post office and remittance reach recipient instantly november mservice entered into partnership with vietnam sun corporation vinasun major local taxi operator and announced several new service one them that when boarding vinasun taxi the user will able pay with electronic money through the momo app using the smartphone scan the code provided the driver another passenger who book vinasun taxi using the vinasun app will able link with the momo app that they can pay automatically addition service content
