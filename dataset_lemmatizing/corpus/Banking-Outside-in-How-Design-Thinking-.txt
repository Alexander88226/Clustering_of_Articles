design thinking been used the banking industry around the world this section will introduce case study examine more detail firstly what kind format process design thinking adopted the actual innovation project the bank secondly what kind benefit design thinking brings the bank and lastly what are the limitation current adoption the case chosen the smart senior pilot program bank bank singapore launched may smart senior initiative launched posb fully owned subsidiary bank help the senior citizen embrace digitization and cashless payment singapore defines elderly resident those year old and above and year that account for total population million department statistic singapore this alignment the broader smart nation agenda pursued the singapore government and also the bank smart nation and digital government office this program launched bankposb partnership with the yishun riverwalk resident committee and republic polytechnic this project bank innovation management team

framework bank journey thinking framework the bank adaptation the design council double diamond design process with the four step similarly named discover define develop and delivery figure the process and tool used bank largely aligned the fivestep methodology design thinking mentioned above design thinking chosen the issue one that rooted the human behaviour habit and preference have also seen limited success with previous senior engagement project the iterative approach allows the project team iterate and test before deciding firm outcome for implementation figure bank framework source bank discover phase the team collaborated with the student from discover the need pain point and problem sixty selected senior citizen enable the student conduct the focus group effectively training and demonstration conducted the innovation management team bank help them understand indepth interview and observation technique the key finding from the user research the student focused day day lifestyle and habit the elderly their social relationship and network their financial attitude and lastly their experience digital platform and cashless payment the define phase bank and people association gathered together for ideation workshop identify the opportunity area the end the workshop the participant identified four smart value proposition smart payment smart transport smart communication and smart fitness these four smart feature will designed into card sleeve worn around the neck they observed elderly wearing similar lanyard the past and would face implementation barrier compared format they are familiar with the develop phase user testing conducted understand the four key feature were aligned what they wanted they were presented with concept board with writeups the feature different language chinese malay tamil and english and different version how the wearable device could look like see figure figure different version the proposed wearable device for experimentation source bank based the input captured during the user testing session the elderly wanted have more flexible format that could worn different way apart from form factor the respondent also gave various input the effectiveness the pedometer use case cashless payment which were all captured for subsequent consideration taking all the feedback into consideration moved into deliver phase issuing rfp request for proposal and identified partner help manufacture the device participant were selected from the yishun riverwalk district take part the threemonths pilot the selection criterion include being resident the yishun riverwalk community that launching the program being cash dependent the program would allow and understand elderly would switch cashless payment method and the behaviour would remain after the program concludes figure the smart senior package source bank the eventual package produced the vendor one that flexible and convenient with various way attaching the card sleeve see figure outcome very excited when first heard the posb smart senior program can many thing with just one device now can try using contactless payment when paying for morning cup coffee mdm morie lim teck cheo year old yishun riverwalk resident bank the smart senior pilot officially launched may education minister ong kung the threemonths pilot concluded august and provided the bank with rich opportunity understand and observe the cashless usage the elderly the outcome the pilot encouraging the active engagement observed from all elderly participant and cashless number went some highlight pilot outcome include elderly converted cashless method over the course three month step tracking popular feature that heavily utilized smart communication feature prof unpopular many elderly were opting out many elderly reverted carrying the elderly concession card instead using the wearable device offered them cheaper fare the wearable format did not reduce the fear elderly losing their card the role design thinking after the conclusion the smart senior program the innovation management team bank conducted series indepth interview with key stakeholder who participated the pilot discus the learning and takeaway from this pilot and the process journey thinking mentioned several instance strong focus customer compared the usual problem solving framework the bank where customer were rarely consulted and decision were driven business profitability and technology feasibility design thinking provided two opportunity where all the stakeholder would have engage the customer indepth way first all while the product manager from posb had year experience engaging the senior citizen and the volunteer work with their resident daily basis there were blind spot their understanding and assumption that they have formed over the year the focus group and test gave them opportunity clarify their doubt and most importantly listen the senior citizen instead coming expert solve their problem secondly the experiment also gave the team added confidence the robustness the insight and helped the product manager adjust the value proposition before launching into the market this gave the team assurance the desirability the product which absent traditional decision making process rigorous process for analysing and communicating insight while survey were conducted the past the product team bank often did not have the tool conduct more indepth analysis the data captured the channel engagement also did not afford the team such opportunity dig deeper embracing the approach design thinking the team felt that the postinterviewing process writing verbatims clustering them according theme identified and the writing insight statement much more rigorous process compared relying superficial survey data the team knew exactly which verbatim and thematic cluster contributed the insight this not only gave the sponsor greater confidence that the insight were sound but also helped the subsequent ideation process where the team had much more indepth context around the insight ideate before embracing this new way working insight were largely used loose term anything and everything could insight and the experience the person identifying the insight then became paramount ensuring good outcome the person collating the data and writing insight also need present during ideation otherwise run the risk losing precious context design thinking brought replicability the insight process which well appreciated the team and also their sponsor experiment and iteration the running experiment test value proposition completely new way working for most stakeholder the project prior smart senior the product manager posbdbs bank were exposed the concept running user acceptance testing uat which centered around user interface experience uiux and the core product value proposition itself those test were built the assumption that the product what the customer wanted which huge risk the product manger had bear the rapid iteration model introduced design thinking required the product manger make quick decision tweak for the next round helping them see difference desirability within short turnaround time with additional investment postinterview conducted with the posb product manager they mentioned that even they not adopt the whole process their next project they will ensure that they experiment and test before launching any product into the market the future limitation the case study smart senior program initiated the management bank and the yishun riverwalk with top down mandate the team given the required resource and time cocreate desired outcome the conducting interview running ideation session and conducting experiment take time causing many revert back the usual way working jumping straight potential solution based their experience the unrealistic expectation sponsor very often get into the way conducting rigorous research they would try compress certain stage the process from week day another common pain point the lack trained personal lead the team through the design thinking process only high prioritized project such smart senior got the help required and others would have wait selfserve using the tool and framework the bank addition the leadership support more robust training and support model would also help operationalize design thinking better way improving discussion and conclusion the entire customer experience design thinking enhances customer relationship and add value the value proposition bank business model illustrated the reviewed case study establishing design thinking pivotal element business strategy can strengthen the bank position ensures that customer need and expectation are addressed nevertheless embedding design thinking complex endeavour following the insight captured and experimenting not all result are going positive the first instance demostrated the smart senior program strong leadership committed change exemplified the experience bank smart senior program would key enable team learn and get better each iteration design thinking can also pave the way for innovation not only standalone bank but the entire industry illustrated the hungarian experience feher varga while the reviewed case study design thinking application bank paint promising picture how design method can fuel innovation the field still requires more rigorous holistic and systematic method address complex stakeholder relationship and incorporate very recent approach like data analytics many product and service rolled out using design thinking method also need time prove the value brings help ensure continued usage and commitment more study the asian context also need pursued the asian financial industry evolved rapidly and seen dependency western market with asia looking increasingly different will hard generalize the western trend asia moreover further study
