marcellocecifirasalkhalilleonaobrien uccie abstract the continuous increase quantity and depth regulation following the financial crisis left the financial industry dire need making compliance assessment activity more effective the field law provides model that despite being fit for the representation semantics requirement not share the approach favoured the industry which relies business vocabulary such sbvr this paper present mercury solution for representing the requirement and vocabulary contained regulatory text business policy smefriendly way for the purpose determining compliance mercury includes structured language based sbvr with rulebook containing the regulative and constitutive rule and vocabulary containing the action and factor that determine rule applicability and legal effect mercury includes xml persistence model and mapped owl ontology called firo enabling semantic application keywords law grc sbvr statutory interpretation factor fintech introduction ensuring compliance with new regulatory requirement well with existing one continues challenge herculean proportion for the international financial industry driven the proliferation and complexity the financial regulatory environment the aftermath the global financial crisis the wide acceptance the industry that traditional governance risk and compliance grc information system are deficient leading growing interest semantic technology the research the governance risk and compliance technology centre grctc complementary set project tackling the challenge for the financial industry that arise from multilayered multijurisdictional and everchanging regulation understanding regulation complex task for both nontrained human agent and machine legal expert face number challenge interpreting regulatory text including following and fleshing out reference and citation identifying delineating and disambiguating definition making sense complex sentence clarifying ambiguity resulting from legalese accounting for exception abilahoud the research presented this paper devise approach bridge the gap between the legal expertise required interpret the regulatory text and the modeling skill required build semantic knowledge base the goal foster compliance the financial sector supporting corporate lawyer risk practitioner and compliance professional their role smes making law more readily consumable and comprehensible the industry but differently from the ergo platform grosof the process translation articulated around regulatory compliance interpretation methodology rim that defines process for transforming regulatory text into representation structured english route enabling semantic application the process envisaged collaborative one involving the legal expert subject matter expert sme and the modeler semantic technology expert ste through multiple iteration the solution allows the sme represent the semantics regulatory requirement machinereadable format through smefriendly process this ensured through the use sbvr omg specification based formal logic and well known the industry sbvr requirement rewritten structured english loosely structured controlled natural language where every term used the rule sourced and specified terminological dictionary sbvr powerful instrument for modeling area business activity and for building business vocabulary van haarst but not suitable for the representation legal rule some sbvr component are not needed overcomplicate the task rule representation the logical formulation sentence and some component are lacking overcome this grctc research devised artifact called mercury composed structured english based sbvr and persisted xml schema capturing rulebook and vocabulary entry mercury represents rule statement contained regulation and describes the concept used those rule terminological dictionary the most important change that mercury brings sbvr and the object this paper different way manage the logical formulation the sbvr rule that overcomes the limitation sbvr original logical formulation representing legal interpretation the financial regulation represented for grc purpose are often very detailed containing requirement rather than highlevel legal principle general prescription therefore for their interpretation value judgment benchcapon and sartor grabmair and ashley play minor role comparison the linguistic element significant part the relation between the regulated entity fact specified the rule itself and the important concept are explicitly defined the same regulation sbvr with vocabulary and rulebook component seems best suited capture this the current phase the research doe not involve advanced rulebased reasoning but only rule representation the aim capture relevant information the regulatory requirement and able run query the resulting knowledge base perform abstract classification and reasoning rule and their regulated action detecting which rule regulate subset another rule regulated action validate data representing instance regulated action event compliant breaching one more rule mercury exploit technology from the semantic web stack the xml layer well nonsw technology sbvr and the rim relies upper layer particularly owl for advanced classification and reasoning rule and vocabulary khalil for explanation grctc mapping from sbvr owl the rest the paper structured follows section describes statutory interpretation and the issue related representation with sbvr section introduces mercury and main element and section explains model for representing regulative rule section concludes with final remark proof concept and the further step the research the semantics regulatory requirement the present paper address the law subject statutory interpretation and rule representation the concept legal interpretation highly debated legal philosophy aracziewicz consists our account determining the extension statutory term thus focus the part legal interpretation concerned with the conceptual analysis typical domestic law civil law country since inception the law community devoted notable effort modeling legal rule and regulation sergot pashke but only few them were aimed devising intermediate format for describing legal rule the legal knowledge interchange format lkif boer being first systematic attempt this direction most the research the field instead directed towards the representation legislative document the speech act rather than the provision they contain through xml language among which cite cen metalex boer and akoma ntoso vitali and zeni the present research relies akoma ntoso enhance the semantics the legal source enabling regulatory change management temporal reasoning and standard representation metadata such jurisdiction and issuing authority brien legal rule are mostly debated law relation the notion legal argumentation prakken and casebased legal reasoning see section the problem statutory interpretation relatively underrepresented law research with recent exception from the civil law tradition araszkiewicz the research showed notable result gordon setting the requirement for the representation legal rule and wyner and peter covering the automatic extraction rule from regulation exploiting nlp technique legalruleml all the desired feature capture legal regulation but doe not rely terminological dictionary like sbvr and lack specific focus compliance casebased legal reasoning legal reasoning can classified two main category abstract reasoning the relationship between rule andor the concept they express and concrete reasoning the rule applicable given fact the first type reasoning the rechtsdogmatik and typical but not exclusive civil law system and also called doctrinal legal interpretation wroblewski the second type reasoning corresponds case based legal reasoning and typical but not exclusive common law system and also called operative legal interpretation casebased legal reasoning made for very prolific research law the original purpose especially the work ashley and his scholar aleven support legal class providing way explore concept such analogy and precedent their research resulted two computer program aimed representing casebased argumentation computable way the first hypo enables comparison between precedent mean dimension characteristic the precedent are thus represented point position within gradient which are not themselves built favor one solution the case rather strengthening wakening the claim each party the dispute according the position the dimension ashley the second cato includes simplified structure dimension where particular point position are represented factor unequivocally supporting one party the case factor employed cato are unary the sense that those factor either apply given case they not apply aleven and law factor are seen mere indicator that enable argumentation and comparison without necessarily leading the promoted judicial outcome even absence reason the contrary sartor more recently research focused formal model legal argumentation with analytical concept such dimension and factor being replaced more highlevel figure such value benchcapon and sartor argumentation scheme gordon and walton and intermediate legal concept grabmair and ashley the use factor capture statutory interpretation been already discussed araszkiewicz ceci and gangemi and the research presented this paper build upon that experience sbvr the object management group omg created the semantics business vocabulary and business rule specification sbvr define business concept and rule using controlled natural language sbvr structured english sbvr meant used business people describe their business activity hence adoption grctc allows nontechnical expert smes define rule using controlled language opposed legalese sbvr composed rulebook and terminological dictionary vocabulary the rulebook contains operative rule introduced deontic modality obligatory that permitted that prohibited that and structural rule introduced alethic modality necessary that possible that impossible that these two category correspond regulative rule and constitutive rule searle the present paper focus operative rule such the following obligatory that each market operator that operates trading venue make public bid price for share all the term the sbvr rule except keywords and modality both bold the rule above are declared the sbvr vocabulary the vocabulary contains entry for noun concept underlined and verb concept verb concept include one verb symbol italic and one more verb concept role underlined the entry below covered noun concept see figure modality obligation rule vcr vcr vcr vcr vcr vcr obligatory that each market operator that operates trading venue make public bid price for share fig element sbvr rule noun concept verb symbol vcr verb concept role verb concept the letter refer the table below and figure let consider for example the following verb concept entry the vocabulary market operator operates trading venue this verb concept includes one verb symbol operates and two noun concept market operator and trading venue verb concept role each vocabulary entry contains list attribute metadata for semantic enrichment sbvr defines mean capture the semantics expressed rule semantic formulation described the sbvr specification are not representation expression meaning rather they are structure meaning the logical composition meaning although adequate the logical formulation sentence not suitable represent the composition legal rule too verbose and complex simpler model capture the semantics legal rule can more advantageous since deal with the legal nature the rule directly not abstract logical manner making sense sbvr introducing mercury order design model legal rule for compliance need define data format that the machine can use perform such type reasoning starting from what sme can expected achieve the sbvrse format the rule mercury figure regulative rule are thus presented sbvr sentence with operative modality and net verb concept connected verb concept role shared among them the verb concept used the rule represent the regulated action state affair other word are the condition the rule the example rule the following verb concept can identified verb concept role verb symbol verb concept role market operator market operator share operates make public trading venue bid price bid price statutory interpretation rulebook vocabulary regulative rule constitutive rule noun verb concept concept subject applicability condition deontic condition constitutive token constitutive type context factor grammatical complement fig the element statutory interpretation represented mercuryse constitutive rule and element are not covered the present paper each these verb concept represent abstract action that determine relevance under the rule lkif boer rule are seen qualifier and regulated action state affair qualified thing under this perspective the core semantics compliance the semantics compliance and breach can treated semantics qualified entity regulative rule qualify action compliant breaching the rule itself sbvr rule semantics specified through verb concept and the noun concept entry that correspond those verb concept role verb concept thus represent the qualified compliant breaching action and verb concept role are the link that express the semantics this qualification the next section present mercury bridge language built top sbvr provide the necessary hook for legal reasoning mercury enriches the semantics sbvr rulebook introducing the concept condition qualified verb concept mercury bridge language for regulatory requirement mercury bridge language for translating regulatory requirement machinereadable way includes two component structured natural language called mercury structured english mercuryse based sbvr presented the next section persistence model xml called mercury markup language hgml presented section action event and factor mercuryse composed rulebook and vocabulary terminological dictionary both similar their sbvr counterpart mercury extends the terminology sbvr identifying additional layer semantics the vocabulary entry thus the entry that are defined sbvr verb concept and verb concept role express abstract entity that are captured mercury under the label action and factor see figure modality obligation rule obligatory that each market operator that operates trading venue make public bid price for share fig sbvr rule with action and factor identified mercury grammatical complement are also indicated subject object definition action action abstract category event that defined arbitrarily the result the interpretation the behaviour required the rule action are expressed sbvr verb concept definition event event concrete manifestation abstract action definition factor factor generic specific entity that play role one more action contained the same rule result the interpretation the entity involved the rule factor are expressed sbvr verb concept role grammatical complement and condition for reason simplicity the present paragraph will describe mercury rule stripped deontic modality market operator that operates trading venue make public bid price for share each verb symbol italic corresponds one more verb concept depending the noun concept present verb concept role and the keywords each the verb concept contained the rule represents abstract action the sum the verb concept contained the rule constitutes the structure diagram that rule figure market operator make public bid price operates trading venue share price fig implicit ontology the sample rule sbvr structure diagram van haarst chapter box represent noun concept arrow represent verb symbol the reader will notice that some verb concept role are present more than one verb concept mercury say that some factor are present more than one action these factor could independently identify different instance the same category two different market operator two different bid price instead they could identify the same instance the same market operator must the subject action and the same bid price must the object action and the latter case for action event classified under the more general event the same instance must appear all factor for market operator category market operator relevant the statement above necessary that operates trading venue and also that make public bid price for share keywords such same and that determine the identity factor among different action rule with sbvr the logical formulation the sentence too verbose and complex being unable extract the logical formulation however mean being unable determine the relevance event action rule statement overcome this limitation mercury implement own solution expressing the logical formulation introduces grammatical complement attribute verb concept entry used describe the grammatical role that verb concept role play the sentence definition grammatical complement grammatical complement attribute factor expressing the grammatical role played the verb concept the grammatical complement mercury are subject object indirect object location time comparison value and mode with mercury every factor specified under the perspective the grammatical complement that cover for that verb concept for example subject market operator market operator share verb operates make public object trading venue bid price bid price figure show how these complement enrich the logical formulation please note that despite the example being very simple all action having the same complement verb concept can vary they can have only one factor the subject more than two and logical connector such andor can duplicate them mercury distinguishes between verb concept they appear the vocabulary and they appear the rulebook the first case they are called action while the latter they are called condition condition can seen qualified action where one more factor the action correspond factor other action keywords such that same are indicator that factor involved more than one action market operator subject subject make public object bid price object operates trading venue share subject price object fig implicit ontology the sample rule mercury formulation definition condition condition action used rule condition share the same property general action and may restrict factor specifying scope value the role play another condition grammatical complement the following section describes how mercury action factor and condition enrich the semantics regulation representing requirement mercury anatomy regulative norm according biagioli regulation can seen set provision semantics carried speech act structure performing the legal interpretation regulation mean our account describe those provision from formal logic perspective regulative norm can represented with the following formula kelsen sartor please note that formal logic use the operator forb for forbidden instead prohibited obl forb perm the first element called applicability condition gordon the second element obl forb perm often called legal effect but for the purpose the present research called deontic condition our model this element share the same structure the applicability condition with the addition deontic modality definition applicability condition condition that determines given event relevant given rule not definition deontic condition condition that determines relevant event compliesbreaches rule reasoning compliance and breach mercury rule abstract compliance represented through the verb concept contained the rule explained section sbvr verb concept constitute the action mercury central the present approach abstract characteristic are described the attribute the verb concept the mercury vocabulary action thus composed verb symbol and one more grammatical complement the action becomes condition when used deontically qualified action mercury rule sentence rule sentence includes zero more applicability condition and one deontic condition this way the abstract compliance rule can described sum condition and the way the complement these condition intertwine provides fundamental information that unlocks powerful reasoning compliance just like cato factor see section enable reasoning case law concrete event instance action can classified under the abstract condition the mercury rule using factor event relevant for the rule the rule applies the event the factor the event can classified factor the applicability condition the rule addition the factor the event can also classified factor the deontic condition the rule the event classified depending the rule deontic modality the rule obligation the event complies with the rule prohibition the event breach instead the factor the event not match all applicability condition the event classified not relevant that rule see figure concrete compliance rule thus similar matching new case the event the factor precedent the sum condition the rule because this solution attribute explicit semantics label such breach compliant relevant the action the concept factor preferable over dimension factor aleven are unary concept susceptible attribution boolean value and thus ideal represent such semantics mercury factor are represented the element the structured language verb concept role the semantic value added them given not only their actual value the vocabulary entry that term the verb concept that contains but mostly the role they play other verb concept the same rule see next section rule obligation compliance with action deontic condition applicability condition complies event event relevant not relevant event event fig relationship between rule and regulated event letter italic represent event instance action those event compose the complex event event complies with rule because match all applicability condition and and the deontic condition event relevant but have information compliance because doe not match deontic condition detecting deontic opposite see section event not relevant rule not applicable because doe not match action representing mercury rule this section describes the approach for representing operative rule mercury the approach relies list rule and terminological dictionary explain the term used them the dictionary particularly helpful managing the opentextured character statutory concept for more this topic see hart the rule first identified the source and rewritten plain english fleshing out all reference using limited set keywords express logical element each and that resolving syntactic ambiguity referring every term the rule verb noun concept the vocabulary and indicating explicitly and the beginning the rule deontic modality abilahoud despite any future implementation contrario reasoning see section the modality chosen the sme will constitute the main modality upon which more straightforward reasoning possible following example mercury rule with the deontic modality bold obligatory that each market operator that operates trading venue make public bid price for share representing the condition the rule explained section action designates the vocabulary entry the verb concept while condition designates the verb concept appears the rule condition specifies action either specifying the value some factor verb concept role specifying the role term grammatical complement that they must cover other condition the deontic condition particular kind condition describes the action that determines the compliance the rule the deontically relevant part such condition resides one more factor such deontically relevant part must highlighted the sme the rule representation allow the reasoner distinguish between applicability condition and deontic condition the part underlined the rule above market operator make public bid price identifies the deontic condition order for event classified compliant this rule factor must correspond the factor the other condition the rule deontic opposite reasoning the direct legal effect deontic statement mean detect the event that are compliant obligation that breach prohibition that are allowed permission order enable reasoning the main deontic modality not necessary distinguish between deontic and applicability condition this limited scenario such distinction only useful reason about legal relevance rule even when the information the deontic modality missing that not know the event breach complies with the rule because have information the deontic condition but know that the event relevant for the rule because match all applicability condition the distinction between applicability and deontic condition instead important enable reasoning the deontic opposite the rule define deontic opposite the obligation implied prohibition prohibition implied obligation permission legal theory the deontic opposite are known since hohfeld definition the deontic qualification obligatory and prohibited complete the sense that they determine the deontic status both the action state affair they are concerned with and the complement such action state affair hence say that the action state affair obligatory equivalent saying that prohibited and say that prohibited equivalent say that obligatory cook reason deontic opposite thus mean detect breach obligation permission and compliance prohibition order classify such event the reasoner need match them the opposite the direct deontic condition for example prohibited that each market operator that operates trading venue doe not make public bid price for share event match such deontic condition classified breach the literature concerning the interpretation statutory text using negation failure sergot and the contrario argument peczenik legal theory defines the determination those deontic opposite far from automatic araszkiewicz the process deriving deontic opposite must thus semiautomated process led the sme one the intended future development the research and not covered further the present paper mercuryml mercuryml the persistent xml model for mercury representing the vocabulary and

the present paper describes the legal framework behind the applied research performed the grc technology centre the solution devised the research mercury enabling machinereadable representation regulatory requirement smefriendly way mercury extension subset sbvr that allows the sme maintain the precision legal knowledge specific semantics and the importance the legal source when transforming the regulatory text format that allows specification the model business activity and the business vocabulary compliance sbvr and unlocks the potential semantic web technology the latter the grctc currently developing set owl ontology called firo financial industry regulatory ontology enable semantic application such classification querying and reasoning the research also devised mapping all sbvr element relevant mercury into owl facilitate the ste translating mercury rulebooks and vocabulary this mapping differs significantly from the literature and result different sbvr structure diagram than the one suggested figure van haarst chapter the reader invited refer khalil for further detail firo and the mapping more research effort are being directed towards natural language processing technique for automatic extraction requirement from legal text asooja the solution presented the present paper could applied beyond the limit description logic and owl the current phase the research however excludes rulebased reasoning capability limiting itself rule representation noted previously the principal goal the research exploit the expressive power the sbvr vocabulary enhance the semantics concept such requirement compliance breach source legal definition and context mapping such semantics from mercury legalruleml only partially possible because mercury bipartite structure rulebook vocabulary following sbvr mapping quite straightforward for condition for factor and the link they establish across condition because legalruleml lack vocabulary one may argue that mapping from the logical formulation defined sbvr the mercury model can achieved correct yet unpractical observation the extraction the legal formulation sentence not evident and the lack tooling discouraged from taking this route bypassing the logical formulation proved advantageous for both understanding the rule the sme and the ste due simplicity and mapping legal rule firo khalil the ergo platform grosof share the goal grctc research and similar approach the main difference consisting the use bridge language mercury based sbvr and the creation regulatory interpretation methodology that focus the attention the technique translation well the technology thus enabling the semiautomatic and collaborative translation process from legal theory point view the research face the issue representing statutory interpretation adopting solution coming from another area law namely from the concept factor used computational model for lecturing casebased reasoning this research therefore treat the computer not particularly brilliant legal student which doe not grasp the notion pure legal theory rechtsdogmatik but rather reason term classifying action and thing under abstract legal category proof concept the rim been conducted mifir regulation the european union two smes used the protocol transform article and into mercury the purpose the proof concept measure the time take and the size the resulting knowledge base rather than measure the capability the resulting knowledge base the two output for article were document page containing rule and vocabulary entry and document page with rule and vocabulary entry this difference caused the fact that the two smes used different structure represent some complex concept and articulated requirement this variation the output show the degree freedom that mercury allows the representation legal concept which clearly desirable the opposite would instead increase the risk inaccurate representation legal concept and loss detail which turn lead potentially costly mistake the application the law the next step for the research will involve extensive testing mercury from the point view suitability represent any kind regulatory statement the testing will also involve the user experience the supporting tool called ganesha currently under development that will accompany the sme during the process transformation legal requirement from regulatory text mercury the future the application the legal knowledge base built with mercury will extended further the semantic web stack technology past ontology into defeasible
