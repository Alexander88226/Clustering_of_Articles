international development zci zarqa chamber industry chapter one introduction the importance the study small and mediumsized enterprise smes have become the main concern for number academic and researcher across the globe for both economic and social reason government and policy maker developed well developing country have stressed the importance the smes for the economic growth researcher have shown that smes are vital for the development the economy they argued that smes are able absorb the increasing labour force generating more employment opportunity addition been indicated that smes create more exporting opportunity and have more possibility generating innovation furthermore been argued that smes are important for the success and growth the large enterprise although each economy different from another smes still play major role any country economy many way however smes particularly some the developing country are suffering from several constraint such the complexity obtaining finance and the high cost capital that are hindering not only their creation but also their development and growth nevertheless the shortage and high cost capital are not the only problem facing these firm but perhaps there are the main problem that have been the major concern for academic researcher and policy maker many smes most developing country are suffering from finance gap which mainly scarcity debt and equity finance finance gap can the unavailability either debt equity finance both great deal been written about how smes are having difficulty raising finance and how they have difficulty obtaining loan from bank especially that bank are considered the main source external finance for these smes such issue not only exist developing country but also exist many developed country for example such the particularly small and startup business study have shown that conflict exist between bank and smes mainly due information asymmetry and other reason but also some owner manager the smes are refusing have external finance from other source other than the bank even raise capital through equity finance due different perception other word the existence finance gap can debated caused not only the supplier fund bank but also the demand for fund smes the literature review smes financing reveals that the financing problem smes arise from different reason one the existence information gap asymmetric information the imperfect market which result having adverse selection and moral hazard secondly the attitude the smes owner manager towards the type finance they prefer use addition the special characteristic the smes owner manager which lack financial and managerial sophistication jordan developing country with limited natural resource like any other developing country smes play major role the economy particularly because jordan suffers from various social and economic problem such high rate unemployment and scarcity capital the unemployment rate jordan and the external debt total gdp therefore smes jordan can contribute decreasing the level poverty and unemployment the country creating different job opportunity and generating income for employee especially because most the enterprise jordan are small and medium sized additionally smes were until recently the main supplier export iraq and the west bank the favoured position given jordan the old regime iraq helped curtailing unemployment addition the substantial support for smes jordan the recent development iraq after the american invasion the country and the shaky security situation iraq presented devastating blow jordan economy particularly the sme sector furthermore the volatile situation the west bank and gaza after the oslo accord addition the recent arrival hamas and the subsequent collapse the palestinian economy have made the situation worse for jordan smes therefore jordan reassess situation and should provide department statistic jordan figure amman department statistic department statistic transitional assistance smes order for them continue their function the backbone jordan economy furthermore the manufacturing sector jordan play major role the economic development the country for example the manufacturing sector jordan had contributed gdp and the export this sector had been billion during the year moreover the manufacturing sector enterprise are classified smes the number employee definition adopted addition look the employment the manufacturing sector this compared with the agriculture sector this mean that the manufacturing sector jordan creating lot labour compared with other sector since the manufacturing sector composed mainly smes and make significant contribution jordan economy then specialized study that investigates the availability finance problem and source finance for this sector needed according the department statistic jordan large number employee have been absorbed into the manufacturing sme sector the country each year which make this sector very important different way the total number smes the manufacturing sector and addition the total number employee these smes were more than the end however the sme sector actually contracted modestly and best can viewed stagnant raising important question about future sustainability crucially research the subject indicated that jordan facing great competition accordingly smes jordan and perhaps the manufacturing sector are cross road and will therefore either continue expanding decline the number were given the chairman jordan chamber industry jordan hatem halwani during interview the number were given the chairman jordan chamber industry jordan hatem halwani during interview zarga chamber industry the small and medium enterprise jordan zarqa zarqa chamber industry department statistic department statistic amman chamber industry lanagement committee report for the year amman amman chamber industry number obtained from the

the thesis there the appendix that contains the question the semi structured interview addition the bibliography chapter two small and medium enterprise smes overview the definition small and medium enterprise smes significant number researcher from different country around the globe have shown great interest the small and medium enterprise smes sector and have gathered their effort analyse and search smes due the recognized importance this sector for economic development therefore smes have been major concern not only for the researcher but also for policy maker this growing attention the smes sector resulted many debate keasey watson and harper indicated that the debate between researcher started defining what sme and how the size the sme measured various definition for smes have been adopted different country and many case there are multiplicity definition within the same country due the diverse characteristic smes each sector and each economy keasey watson and hallberg argued that smes are known heterogeneous enterprise smes have different function and are various type which make single definition universally applicable for all smess addition curran and blackburn stated that smes perform each economic sector therefore there are standardized definition that can applied all smes addition harvie and chyelee pointed out that each economy and sector any country undergo certain stage economic and social development keasey and watson small firm management ownership finance and performance oxford blackwell publisher harper small business the third world guideline for practical assistance chichester john wiley son hallberg marketoriented strategy for small and medium scale enterprise washington international finance corporation hallberg keasey and watson curran and blackburn researching the small enterprise london sage publication harvie and chyelee east asian smes contemporary issue and development overview harvie and chyelee the role smes national economy east asia cheltenham edward elgar publishing harvie and chyelee curran and blackburn argued that many case smes are defined according quantitative method which classify sme according number employee capital asset and turnover conversely curran and blackburn stressed that other instance qualitative method are adopted define smes they pointed out that qualitative method basically relate managerial behavioural and attitude aspect that distinguish small firm from larger one addition they indicated that some case combination both quantitative and qualitative measure are combined together define smesi research the subject indicates that there are many debate defining smes some are about the qualitative method and others are about the quantitative method for example abudiab emphasized that the debate the smes definition concerned with the need classify them such way that that facilitates their study recognising their characteristic both the quantitative and qualitative definition are discussed below quantitative definition research indicated that there are many quantitative measure used define smes each definition smes differs from one country another however hallberg argued that the most common measure are the number employee and the value asset furthermore harvie and chyelee similarly stated that the number employee the measure mainly used many researcher such harper curran and blackburn harvie and chyelee identified alternative type quantitative measure define smes such value capital turnover labour intensity sale production capability financial turnover and technical measure yet each quantitative measure advantage and disadvantage although there are curran and blackburn small firm and local economic network the death the local economy london paul chapman

the arab academy for banking and financial service arabic hallberg harvie and chyelee harper curran and blackburn harvie and chyelee many quantitative measure that are adopted define smes various country still the number employee measure widely used jordan there single official definition smes the manufacturing sector like other sector doe not have approved definition each organization the country adopts own definition however the most common measure that used nearly all the definition the number employee the department statistic jordan considers the firm small they employ employee while they regard the enterprise medium they have employee firm that employ more than employee are considered large according the definition furthermore the amman chamber industry identifies the small firm the one that employ employee while the firm that provide work for employee are considered medium enterprise for the zarqa chamber industry considers the size the firm follows firm that have employee are handicraft enterprise firm that employ are small enterprise firm that have are considered medium enterprise and firm that have more than worker are considered large enterprise nevertheless there are many other definition that are adopted the different organization jordan and the foreign aid programme that come jordan support smes for example the euro jordanian action for the development enterprise ejada defines sme one that employee there are many definition across the various institution jordan however some these definition will discussed the coming chapter when these organization and programme are discussed detail moreover there are information obtained from hatem halawani chairman the jordan chamber industry ahomsi the competitiveness small and mediumsized

turkey firm that employ more than worker but than employee considered sme hallberg stressed that country vary their definition what constitute sme what considered smie one country may considered large enterprise another country the number employee measure adopted therefore this measure can criticized comparison across country needed many country there more than one quantitative measure used the same time such the total capital and the number employee measure egypt for example many definition are used different organization the country however the most widely spread measure used define smes were the number employee and the total capital special law for small enterprise egypt created that defines the small enterprise any firm that doe not have more than worker and total capital between and one million egyptian pound alsilmy stated that there single international definition for example saudi arabia the saudi tasleef bank defines startup and small enterprise one that have than worker

considered sme the manufacturing sector more than employee more than million dollar revenue and more than million dollar total asset base addition stated that for the service sector pakistan defined sme more than employee more than million dollar revenue and more than million dollar total asset base curran and blackburn stated that the method classification categorises the business follows firm with than employee are believed micro firm firm that have employee are considered small firm and firm that have employee are identified mediumsized firm however any enterprise that more than employee regarded large firm curran and blackburn claim that these definition may misleading however they remained the most popular definition used researcher and policy maker the reason that definition that are based number employee are said very simple and objective harper pointed out that this particular quantitative definition mostly used industrialized country and many policy maker prefer use this definition believing that comprehensible and easy use furthermore curran and blackburn argued that this definition which based the number employee faced lot criticism they indicated that debate have shown that defining small firm according the number employee can arbitrary sometimes alsilmy courcellelabrousse promoting sme banking ifc experience advising commercial bank north africa and the

curran and blackburn curran and blackburn curran and blackburn harper curran and blackburn curran and blackburn have argued that the number people employed firm that belongs certain sector will different than the number employee another firm another sector therefore the process defining small firm according the number employee complicated and one definition can not applied all firm due their special characteristic addition curran and blackburn have pointed out that when taking the number employee measure the size researcher should take into account the number part time employee been realized that number small firm the for example have many people employed part time only and this could therefore affect the accuracy the measure they suggested that although this definition very simple use and popular should used carefully barrow had also stressed that although the number employee measure commonly used still the most measure that can more easily criticised the other hand many country have defined the small firm according the value capital nevertheless harper stated that such measure more complicated than the number employee for different reason explained that order ass the value firm capital accurately many thing should taken into account and can not ignored one the thing that pointed out the attitude the ownermanager the small firm when she asked about the value firm study have showed that lot these ownermanagers not like declare publicly the real value their firm for personal reason and even they announce the value their firm will not accurate because most these owner manager can not differentiate between their own personal property and the capital their firm furthermore harper emphasized other thing that should considered when using the value capital measure size which the importance assessing the value the inventory machine and land building the firm and paying attention the factor that affect the value these thing such the age the machine and the building the real value the inventory and whether part sold and not cashed yet addition argued that the way these value are estimated very barrow the essence small business edinburgh pearson education harper important because each sector may use different method estimation which again make the process definition complicated and one definition can not applied all sector india for example avoid such problem they define the size the firm according the value the plant and machinery and the price for which bought this will avoid the problem discussed previously such the age the machine and building the effect inflation curran and blackburn harper and mahmood argued that there another quantitative measure that used define smes which the turnover nevertheless curran and blackburn have indicated that this measure more problem than the other measure discussed because each firm particular sector different turnover than other firm other sector due certain characteristic each firm for example barber shop will have fewer turnover than supermarket therefore different sector can not always compared each other this problem also occurs when the size the small firm measured the basis the number people employed the firm addition harper pointed out that certain firm particular those that have their sale turnover affected season make this definition not applicable for all firm research the subject indicated that debate between researcher about defining smes are endless and many other quantitative measure had been suggested and argued such labour intensity value added and technical measure nevertheless one single definition can not applied all economy sector and country qualitative definition suggested the literature that the quantitative method should replaced some alternative approach the other hand many researcher and academic agreed that single definition could applicable all firm due the various harper curran and blackburn harper mahmood harper albltagi sme financing through islamic mode finance the role islamic mode finance sme development paper two facilitating the flow fund slies the annual international conference amman may amman the arab academy for banking and financial service characteristic each enterprise each sector industry any economy keasee and watson pointed out that some firm are said small according the asset sale turnover measurement certain sector they may defined large firm another sector the number employee were taken the measure size the the importance the smes emphasized long time ago and the problem defining the small firm and how measure size were raised great number researcher therefore one the most important governmental inquiry that have focused the importance and the role the small business the bolton report the bolton committee focused defining the small firm and attempted produce qualitative definition prevent the problem and confusion measuring smes that have been mentioned therefore the bolton committee defined the small firm first economic term small firm one that relatively small share market secondly essential characteristic small firm that managed owner partowners personalized way and not through the

decision keasey and watson stated that according bolton definition firm will deemed small firm according special qualitative characteristic legally independent operated and managed ownermanager and relatively few share the market curran and blackburn the other hand indicated that although the bolton definition been used extensively been criticized over the past year therefore single definition can used alternative the other the bolton committee realized that the quantitative measure are important and can not ignored therefore keasey and watson bolton report report the committee inquiry small firm cmnd london hmso keasey and watson they have suggested quantitative definition for certain sector and switched from qualitative approach into quantitative one see table table the bolton report definition the small firm sector definition manufacturing employee retailing turnover wholesale trade turnover construction employee miningquarrying employee motor trade turnover miscellaneous service turnover road transport vehicle catering all excluding multiple and brewerymanaged pub source the bolton report curran and blackburn pointed out that other researcher such wynarczyk suggested other qualitative approach that distinguish small firm from larger one for example they stated that uncertainty innovation and evolution are three qualitative criterion that make basic distinction between large and small enterprise however these new approach did resolve the problem having one definition that applicable for all small firm hodgetts and kuratko pointed out that the united state the small business act defined small business one that independently owned and operated and not dominant field operation addition they explained that the small business administration sba authorized this act produce another definition that includes some other quantitative measure such the number employee and the sale volume turnover the sba definition small firm very important deciding the appropriate loan scheme for these firm practice curran and blackburn bolton report curran and blackburn hodgetts and kuratko effective small business management fortworth harcourt collee publisher the sba decided the upper limit the small firm using these quantitative measure each sector the economy see table table the upper limit the small firm usa according the sba classification sector definition manufacturing fewer employee employment between and size standard for the particular industry used wholesaling million million annual sale depending the line wholesaling retailing million million annual sale depending the line retailing service not exceeding million million annual sale depending the line business source hodegetts and kuratko hodgetts and kuratko pointed out that accurate definition small business will depend the industry that being analyzed and certain criterion are applicable particular industry may not another for example the size criterion employee considered defining small firm the retailing sector may not applied other sector for example hodgetts and kuratko argued that retail store are compared automobile then this criterion can not used define small firm became the automobile industry much larger scale sector therefore hodgetts and kuratko stressed that many case small business definition that are based the number employee need have more employment break down small firm with employee will have different definition than firm with employee and many case some firm have employee employee and are still considered small hence avoid confusion the committee for economic development the usa combined qualitative and quantitative measure distinguish small firm from larger one hodgetts and kuratko hodgetts and kuratko the committee for economic development summarized the main characteristic the small firm follows small firm independently managed ownermanager the owner the small firm one individual may few individual that supply the capital the firm the firm local area operation even the market not local the firm small compared with competitor the same industry can see that the small firm definition vary across country and there single global definition because each country reached particular stage development and each country own social political and cultural background however researcher believe that important know the different definition for smes across different country therefore many them have focused their effort defining smes developed and developing economy order facilitate globalization and economic integration addition the literature smes shown how are very important sector and how they have played important role the economic development many economy however curran and blackburn stated that the problem not having one regional global definition for make international comparison difficult among researcher this particular problem now facing the member especially after the development the market the problem not having one definition not only seen the industrialized country the developed economy but also problem the developing and transitional country such the east asian economy hodgetts and kuratko curran and blackburn harvie and chyelee indicated that east asian economy and some the sia pacific economic cooperation apec member country are focusing their effort the development their smes

all the country they harvie and chyelee still can not have the same classification for example enterprise classified small enterprise particular economy may considered large enterprise another country because each economy different characteristic however the role and importance smes each economy will stay significant and comparison between country worthwhile even country are said different from each other due cultural political social and economical issue the importance smes the economic development each country around the globe have similar basic characteristic but the role played smes each economy will vary due the different economic condition each country reviewing the literature smes indicated that great deal been written about the importance smes the economic development term creating job increasing export and causing innovation these issue will discussed detail the coming section the role and importance smes overview smes many country have achieved vital economic role and nowadays are still playing major part the economic development many country including east asian asiapacific economic cooperation apec and many other country around the world storeyl harvie and chyelee beaver and prince argued that the importance smes came from different point view that relate mainly the important role played smes relation employment innovation entrepreneurial ambition exporting privatesector production long term strategic planning for economic development and the success larger enterprise beaver and prince explained that many economist and researcher discussed these issue from different perspective but the potential smes contributing economic development been major topic for debate among the researcher and politician however although the role played smes different and the degree importance varies harvie and chyelee storey understanding the small business sector london international thomson business press harvie and chyelee beaver and prince management strategy and policy the small business sector critical review journal small business and enterprise development across the various sector all researcher agree the importance smes the economy the during the last year there been increase the number smes per cent and these firm nowadays are contributing significantly the economy per cent the gross domestic product gdp contributed smes and more than half the job are attributed these firm too thompson and lyden stressed the significant role played small business developed economy such the united state particularly creating job also been recognized how new product and technology were created small firm since the thompson and lyden have identified several example how innovation and product were created small firm individual people rather than large firm they gave example from the major invention the twentieth century such the airplane the helicopter catalytic oil refining oxygen steelmaking photocopying the automatic transmission power steering air conditioning the polaroid camera the zipper and dacron polyester fibre they explained that small firm are major source innovation and will continue more important than larger enterprise they are helped and assisted the government and policy maker furthermore hodgetts and kuratko indicated that the usa economy dominated small firm and small business since selfemployment been increasing approximately per cent and study have showed that this increase expected continue until small firm are the main source employment and the creator new job opportunity especially within the increasing labour force hodgetts and kuratko have focused the fact that per cent important innovation the twentieth century the united state were produced the small enterprise fact have shown that small business firm have played and continue play vital role beaver and prince beaver and prince thompson and leyden the united kingdom storey the small firm international surtev london croom helm thompson and leyden hodgetts and kuratko the usa economy hodgettts and kuratko gave example that prove the importance and the significant role played small firm they have argued follows new good and service are being introduced the market small firm small firm are important supplier not only for localized market but also for very specialized one addition small firm supply what called intermediate good that help the production other commodity small firm have the ability more flexible than larger enterprise that why they are called marketdemand shock absorber which mean the demand increase for any reason small firm can act demand shock absorber without causing tremendous increase price many case been realized that small firm buy employ renew the used capital equipment doing the output level will stay high and more job will created addition this will reduce the long run cost enter the market expand and even the risk will reduced this applies all firm important role played small firm the market that when small firm enter and exit the market they allow the capital resource flow freely and out which help the market operate efficiently the size the small firm enable them operate more flexible organizational structure than usually exists larger firm which make the passing information within the firm easier faster and costly and return more effective decision process will occur many small firm are managed their owner therefore small firm are likely suffer from the problem that arises large firm when manager have goal and motif that conflict with the owner objective lessskilled individual are most likely employed the small firm doing the small firm have benefited these worker giving them the hodgetts and kuratko hodgetts and kuratko opportunity gain experience therefore helping again creating job the unemployed and unskilled people who are heavy burden the economy the particular that were suggested hodgetts and kuratko prove the important role played small firm the and show how practice small firm are vital developed economy moreover coskun and altunisk pointed out that per cent the firm turkey are smes they added that per cent the value added and per cent the employment turkey are attributed smes addition coskun and altunisk indicated that smes turkey play many other important role the economy than the creation employment they explained that the essential raw material for the larger enterprise are supplied smes addition smes create competitive environment make the implementation new technology and production system more adaptable and can help the economy more compliant accepting the variable condition and force the market small firm and innovation great deal been written about the relationship between small enterprise and innovation and many researcher have used this point support small firm over larger one explaining how small firm are major source innovation and new technology thompson and lyden have explained why small firm are said more innovative and creative than larger enterprise they argued that first important for small technological firm order survive and keep their position the market innovative while larger firm focus their effort keeping their position the market maintaining the position their product secondly most the small technological firm are managed owner therefore motivation for these ownersmanagers innovate their own firm thirdly been said that deep specialization and intensive knowledge limit innovation therefore been coskun and altunisk management concern about issue faced turkish smes international journal entrepreneurial behavior research coskun and altunisk thompson and leyden realized that small firm are interested more technical improvement that lead innovation whereas large firm tend have specialized people with lot knowledge that lead overspecialization and this tends decrease the level their technical improvement moreover bum argued that small firm are major source innovation more efficient way than larger enterprise added that vital for small firm innovate order develop nevertheless small firm are able innovate although there are limited resource for research such capital this point also argued harper harper pointed out that study have shown that research very important for innovation particularly the industrialized country however this not the case poor country where research likely never conducted the small enterprise nevertheless harper argued that small firm individual poor country still have the potential innovate least create local employment without relying foreign import for technology the case for larger enterprise that need foreign assistance for their technology furthermore burn pointed out that according research small firm can create time more innovation per worker the larger enterprise difference between small and large enterprise beaver and prince curran and blackburn harper and bolton argued that small firm are very heterogeneous and diverse therefore researcher have faced difficulty and have been very cautious when analyzing the small firm sector curran and blackburn demonstrated that very dangerous generalize about small firm moreover because small firm many case are owned and managed the same person said extended entity the owner psychology and character similarly beaver and prince explained that human psychology behaviour and thompson and leyden burn entrepreneurship and small business london palgrave harper burn beaver and prince curran and blackburn harper bolton report curran and blackburn attitude are complicated issue but nevertheless understand the small enterprise these issue should taken into account great deal been written about the difference between small and large enterprise storey hodgetts and kuratko have criticized the famous financial and economic newspaper for neglecting small firm and only focusing larger enterprise however storey argued that this phenomenon understandable certain extent large enterprise need make information publicly available investor especially most the large company any economy are listed the stock exchange addition most the large firm most the developed economy are the main producer the private sector production therefore the interest the importance larger enterprise the economic development any country understandable nevertheless small firm must taken into account order have balance between both large and small firm the economy furthermore beaver and prince indicated that small firm and the entrepreneur that control and administer them have significant characteristic circumstance and surroundings that distinguish them from larger enterprise the model and managerial approach that are used the large enterprise can not applied small firm they added that the small firm not large one miniature small firm may occur simple organization with few employee and very clear operation process yet researcher have faced various difficulty when analyzing and studying the small firm structure defining the small firm one the major problem that were mentioned previously and this made researching small enterprise more complicated there been single definition for determining what make small firm small which make comparison between country difficult process besides storey indicated that the small firm statistic both the industrialized and the developing country are doubtful and not very accurate for example the united kingdom storey beaver and prince storey hodgetts and kuratko storey beaver and prince beaver and prince storey argued that the statistic concerning the small firm sector are uncertain some the small firm are not registered with the state authority because they are too small registered and for other reason the statistical issue concerning the small firm sector are also speculative many country around the world and this make researching the small enterprise difficult many researcher have been analyzing and studying management style and ownership small firm decide the distinctive characteristic small enterprise and determine what make small firm different compared larger one study have shown that management and ownership are important key factor that make small firm different from larger one beaver and prince explained that small firm management and ownership can not separated from each other while large firm the management and the control the firm are usually separated from ownership therefore beaver and prince have argued that the action and the motivation the owner small firm are closely related management style therefore they added that this point kept mind the relationship between the ownership and decisionmaking managerial style organizational structure culture and pattern business development can easily understood similarly beaver and prince and harper emphasise that many case the psychology and the personality the ownermanager are reflected the small firm structure and style moreover the analyst need study the small firm essential through the psychological feature the owner manager get clear picture the small firm structure the relationship between ownership and management very important issue that many researcher and academic have discussed and considered one the vital point that differentiate small firm from larger one addition help explain the special characteristic and style the small firm the bolton report presented much evidence concerning this issue pointed out that small firm are storey beaver and prince beaver and prince beaver and prince harper bolton report usually managed and controlled the owner the founder and usually more than one person involved then will family member furthermore discussed the bolton report that one the advantage being the ownermanager that human being their nature will always look after their own money more conscientiously than outsider employee who will have different goal and motif moreover stressed the bolton report that large enterprise ownership separated from management and distributed between many shareholder however small firm that are owned and managed the same individual individual are said more flexible more creative and innovative addition this explains why small firm avoid any outside source finance order stay independent also partly explains their attitude towards risk taking and why they are more exposed direct taxation addition beaver and prince and bolton pointed out that the ownermanager psychology motivation and attitude typically reflect the small firm main feature and characteristic beaver and prince have shown that small firm owner manager have continuous drive stay independent which part their psychology and character this explains why many small firm have slow growthloo furthermore bolton pointed out that many small firm manager are aware that they earn money their own enterprise relation the effort and the risk they take compared working somewhere elselol however beaver and prince and bolton explained that their aim and motivation stay totally independent rather than make money many case because this attitude and the psychology the ownermanager the firm negatively affected bolton pointed out that some owner manager small firm refused expand their business even they had the opportunity make more bolton report bolton report beaver and prince bolton report eaver and prince bolton report beaver and prince profit order stay independent this because any expansion might need some external supervision partnership and external source finance thereby jeopardizing the total independence the firm similarly wynarczyk have shown that many small firm ownermanagers not have the motive the desire either grow employ any professional management team they just want stay small and independent therefore many small firm had failed very fast nevertheless the bolton report stated that general many the small firm ownersmanagers have limited high educational qualification instead many them have skill qualification this point again focus the various difference between small and larger enterprise beaver and prince have pointed out that the managerial style small firm are different from the managerial style adopted larger enterprise and what applicable the corporate sector can not applied the small firm sector moreover beaver and prince and bolton indicated that although many case large enterprise are the outcome small firm that had grown the managerial style the larger enterprise are said rigid bureaucratic strict and very formal while small firm managerial style are said intuitive informal and more flexible furthermore beaver and prince argued that the different managerial style that result the small firm due the different characteristic and entrepreneurial skill the small firm ownermanagers are said vary according the different sector the economy the firm operating surroundings the firm motif and plan the firm age and the reason the ownership curran and blackburn observe that the small business sector complex field researcher have faced and are still facing difficulty while researching this field because heterogeneous sector and different kind people are need involved the analysis get clear picture moreover with the unstable and changeable world the research process even get more complicated bolton report wynarczyk managerial labour market small and medium sized enterprise london routledge bolton report beaver and prince beaver and prince and bolton report beaver and prince locurran and blackburn addition curran and blackburn pointed out that the ownermanagers the small firm are different from each other term age culture education social and psychological background and this also make generalization difficult addition the reason for the small firm establishment and ownership might differ from one firm another for example some firm the ownermanager might the first founder while another firm she might have inherited the firm therefore the difficulty researching small firm another issue that differentiates small and larger firm curran and blackburn also argued that larger enterprise the access for data much more flexible and easier than small enterprise because the availability documented computerbased quantitative data moreover curran and blackburn argued that unlike large firm small firm are controlled the market and not vice versa such they can not influence and control their surroundings furthermore wynarczyk have argued that large enterprise are said dependent the quality the existing management because powerful enough take immediate action and adjust itself wynarczyk and added that larger enterprise are able change their position takeover merge with another enterprise also more human and managerial resource and more influence upon the market contrast the small enterprise performance entirely dependant the quality management and market power problem and difficulty face smes reviewing the literature the problem that face smes clear that smes encounter many problem and difficulty both developing and developed country debate between researcher have identified the sort problem facing smes any country however each country different policy and different degree government intervention smes most problem are said due the characteristic the smes comparison with the larger enterprise many researcher agreed that general smes are very risky and have high level curran and blackburn curran and blackburn wynarczyk uncertainty addition researcher have attributed the problem smes the ownermanagers characteristic and attitude towards retaining independence furthermore argued that most the ownermanagers small enterprise are not sophisticated term their financial knowledge and that they generally refuse any kind help managerial and financial order keep full control their firm however many researcher and analyst have argued that many smes many country are disadvantage comparison with larger enterprise for various reason others argued that the problem are because market imperfection such information asymmetry general smes face many problem and difficulty such technological managerial financial regulatory and marketing which vary from one country another moreover many economist and researcher suggested different perception which will discussed detail the coming chapter cross indicated that small firm the had faced difficulty which are similar the difficulty encountered the medium and large enterprise however cross argued that small firm the have encountered several difficulty because their size and large enterprise were more favourable comparison smaller one added that the most common problem that face small firm raising finance small firm are encountering difficulty gaining access finance cross argued that this problem attributed the size the small firm which doe not able them provide collateral and many case small firm are newly startup project which not have any past record even future projection therefore the financial institution especially bank view these firm risky comparison the medium and large enterprise furthermore cross pointed out that large and medium sized enterprise are able raise finance from many source that can internal external result they can minimize their risk small firm are heterogeneous their type therefore financial problem may apply some the small firm but not all them depending the type and the sector moreover cross stated that financial issue may apply newly start project that contain huge amount risk due the lack collateral and bridge understanding enterprise entrepreneurship and small business london palgrave cross the united kingdom storey the small firm international survey london croom helm type business however argued that many small business such farmer the farming sector can use their land collateral for loan therefore cross suggested that address the financial problem that exist between bank and the small business people communication should improved between both party bank and business men addition pointed out that small firm the sometimes suffer from not having good premise for their work furthermore cross argued that newly start ups firm the due their size and their newness usually encountered difficulty addition other difficulty were attributed the over involvement the ownermanager the small firm and his her lack financial sophistication which make the position the small firm more risky weak and unattractive deal with from the point view the provider finance raw material and supplier service the new small firm not have any track record which make their position even worse not only receiving loan raw material and supply but also providing good and service which mean the end the small firm will suffer from the lack demand for product and service and also lack supply term finance and raw material harvie and chyelee pointed out that the complexity and problem faced smes vary according various aspect such exporting investing abroad industrial upgrading industrial structure change and developing and expanding they argued that some country smes have pivotal concern about copyright and government grant for exporting specially economy where technology highly developed however indonesia for example the smes are encountering difficulty doing business and investing overseas because they require more efficiency information experience and technical training furthermore harvie and chyelee stressed that the smes malaysia and new zealand are having difficulty obtaining loan and have unskilled employee therefore they are having difficulty maintaining the quality the production process cross cross cross cross harvie and chyelee harvie and chyelee moreover coskun and altunisk have summarized that smes turkey suffer from several problem such poor knowledge technological advance that improves the quality production and decrease the cost production addition the lack experience choosing the right premise for the firm problem besides that small firm turkey not get any help whether from governmental nongovernmental organization prepare them part the global market problem gaining access finance due the owner manager smes attitude towards the source finance available them and their lack financial and accounting knowledge argued that most manager small firm have technical skill rather than managerial skill and yet they still refuse get any help from professional saw earlier that many small firm many country are managed and controlled one person who may not very qualified for management discussed earlier turkey also suffers from marketing and managerial problem because the ownermanager issue the unqualified labour force the small firm and the lack information and international experience also pointed out that turkey smes suffer from over regulation and strict law that discourage expansion and the newly startup project although the economy each country are different from the other been recognized that smes general suffer from the same basic problem finance the most common problem that smes face both developing and developed country coskun and altunisk and this will discussed detail the next chapter addition tucker and lean explained that most the problem encountered smes are due market imperfection information asymmetry characteristic and the objective and attitude ownermanagers the small firm furthermore harvie and chyelee have pointed out that smes have difficulty dealing with their international business abroad due the lack international experience term international management shortage fund and information having reviewed the sme literature various definition from different country and talked about smes and innovation the role played smes different economy the general difference between small and large enterprise and the general problem and the common difficulty faced smes will proceed the next chapter where the small firm financing and capital structure theory will discussed

firm need the service provided the financial intermediary the financial intermediary consist financial market such the stock exchange and financial institution such bank and building society however firm capital structure vary for different reason usually because each company different dividend and debt policy which affect financing and investment decision therefore important review the difference between debt and equity financing particularly each type advantage and disadvantage that affect firm policy investment and financial decision equity capital equity capital also called share capital can include two form share common stock preferred stock each type share give holder different right for voting and receiving dividend from the firm however many corporation the large sum

business entrepreneurship and beyond new jersey prentice hall hatten debt capital unlike equity capital debt capital come many different form for instance bond debenture and note and prior claim over the company however the debtor the lender when they lend their money firm not become owner like the common stock holder therefore debtor not take part the firm voting procedure have the right interfere with the firm policy strategy debtor have the right receive regular payment usually interest their loan regardless the firm condition profit making even losing money during the period the loan firm guarantee pay the lender the original amount capital the end the loan agreement addition firm are required pay regular cash payment during the loan period the form interest usually loan are guaranteed collateral which place the lender more secure position than the stockholder the most recognizable advantage the debt capital from the firm point view that debt capital cheaper because provides the firm with tax advantage tax shield unlike equity capital other word the interest that the firm pay debt deducted from the total income the firm which reduces the income taxed therefore debt capital tax deductible equity capital not however the decision choose between debt and equity capital lie behind how investor weigh the advantage and disadvantage both fund for example many firm

administration financing for small business financial management series arnold and holmes steinhoff and burger holmes holmes with loan however raising capital issuing equity can more costly than raising capital through debt finance when firm sell share they have meet the cost associated with the process issuing security such legal brokerage and consultancy cost addition investor that are willing buy the firm share are expecting high return that will compensate them for giving their money and taking the risk hence many firm prefer take advantage the tax shield associated with debt finance that reduces the taxable income unlike dividend that are not tax deductible addition many entrepreneur prefer have more control over the firm therefore they are not willing raise more equity that creates external control over the firm any firm should have mixture debt and equity capital this mix called the capital structure firm great deal been written about the capital structure firm theory and practice and the advantage and disadvantage each type financing debt versus equity however practice thing are not that simple firm are restricted the amount they can borrow raise debt capital even the number share that can issue equity capital addition the choice between debt and equity finance should made relation three related matter potential profitability financial risk voting control longenecker moore and petty have explained that when firm want choose between debt and equity then balance between potential profitability financial risk and voting control should considered sometimes firm choose debt over equity because the higher return that firm can achieve long the rate return asset operating income total asset greater than the cost debt interest rate addition the owner return equity will increase the firm more debt this make debt more attractive than equity arnold and small business administration financing for small business financial management series arnold small business administration financing for small business financial management series holmes longenecker longenecker and however they added that firm should always pay attention the risk involved with debt finance because debt involves more risk especially thing wrong then the firm will sharp edge nevertheless the stockholder can more patient the bad day although known finance general rule that higher return involves higher risk small firm particular should careful balancing risk and return source finance for small firm like other enterprise small firm need debt and equity capital start their operation however small firm usually have certain characteristic that make the source finance available them more limited the reason behind these financial complication attributed the ownermanagers attitude the small firm research the subject indicates that small firm owner always like control and independent because most the small firm are family owned business therefore outsider are not welcomed which turn explains why some equity source are not used many smes however the attitude ownermanagers and the small firm capital structure will discussed detail the coming section now

however this type shortterm bank loan that will discussed later the bank loan section addition the most recognizable type asset based lending factoring factoring another source shortterm finance where small firm can get capital for their firm selling their account receivables another company usually finance company called the factor moreover when the factor purchase the account receivables from the small firm give the firm only per cent cash the value account receivables addition charge the firm per cent interest and service this type factoring known account receivable factoring however many

guarantee high per cent the loan that given small firm other financial institution such bank commercial bank bank are the most important source debt finance for small firm bank have different type loan for different purpose therefore loan have different period time repaid depending the purpose the loan some loan are shortterm loan that should repaid within one year these loan are usually used small firm solve their immediate cash need problem addition small firm need longterm loan that can repaid longer time usually ten year more buy asset such equipment land and building furthermore bank offer mediumterm loan small firm that can repaid between one ten year these different loan maturity give small firm more flexibility and option match their various finance need however bank may require certain level security their loan where small firm many case are obliged give collateral these type loan are called secured loan bank usually offer three basic type loan small firm line credit term loan and mortgage line credit make specific amount money available small firm when needed certain time due agreement between the small business and the bank this agreement allows the small firm withdraw the maximum amount credit any time usually one year therefore this type credit shortterm loan and many case bank not demand collateral other word unsecured loan however term loan are loan

equity assetbased lender commercial bank governmentsponsored program venture capital firm communitybased financial institution large corporation sale stock source longenecker longenecker the capital structure and financing small firm reviewing the literature there are many financial theory about the various capital structure and the financing decision firm however most the finance theory were applied and tested large corporation recently academic researcher are trying investigate whether the theory finance that were relevant large corporation are applicable small firm many researcher are interested examining the determinant the small firm capital structure and the financing behaviour the small firm owner therefore many researcher country such the usa australia and others carried out research test the financial theory that are relevant large firm can applied small and medium sized enterprise attempt ascertain the financing and capital structure small firm theory capital structure overview many theory were developed explain the capital structure and the financing behaviour firm however most these theory came after the famous hypothesis modigliani and miller the modigliani and miller theory known modiglianimiller proposition based the assumption perfect market setting where the capital structure the firm unrelated the firm value other word the value the firm unaffected debt used therefore many economist called the modigliani and miller proposition debt irrelevance proposition furthermore after relaxing the assumption perfect market and the debt irrelevance modigliani and miller first work many theory were developed which tried take into account the existence market imperfection such michaelas financial policy and capital structure choice smes empirical evidence from company panel data small business economics quan rational justification the pecking order hypothesis the choice source financing management research news quan and brealey and myers brealey and myers michaelas quan myers the capital structure puzzle the journal finance and michaelas information asymmetry agency problem tax and bankruptcy cost the real world result several theory emerged that are debt relevant however each theory argues differently and give various reason and incentive for the different level debt firm for example deangelo and masulis recognized tax and bankruptcy cost their work however the study both ross and myer focused information asymmetry existence and relation certain financing preference addition there another important work jensen and meckling where they argued about the agency problem and advanced the agency theory there are two significant theory that explain the capital structure and financing choice and the same time recognize the different market imperfection within their argument the first the static tradeoff theory and the second the pecking order theory the tradeoff theory capital structure argues that balance between the cost and benefit borrowing determines firm borrowing decision optimal debt level the cost borrowing includes bankruptcy and agency cost while the benefit borrowing includes the tax shield related the use debt according this theory the firm tradesoff the tax benefit borrowing against the cost borrowing which includes both the agency and bankruptcy cost and what called the cost financial distress the tax benefit associated when the firm borrow fund when use debt their capital structure derives from the fact that the interest paid debt are tax deductible other word interest considered cost and tax deductible this tax benefit encourages firm borrow more fund order increase the tax shield contrast dividend that are paid equity holder are not tax deductible therefore tax are considered the beneficial side debt the static tradeoff theory however the cost borrowing within the framework this theory includes bankruptcy and agency cost michaelas myers cassar and holmes capital structure and financing smes australian evidence accounting and finance brealey and myers brealey and myers cassar and holmes brealey and myers bankruptcy cost are the cost that the firm will incur the case default and insolvency the cost incurred when the perceived probability that the firm will default financing greater than zero furthermore the bankruptcy cost can direct indirect cost the direct cost bankruptcy involve the legal and administrative cost such court fee however the indirect cost bankruptcy are the liquidation cost when the firm liquidates asset will loose value addition there also the difficulty managing firm that going into liquidation due the bankruptcy cost study stiglitz have shown that firm are discouraged use debt even when other market condition are within the perfect market framework agency cost are the cost that arise from the conflict interest between the firm stockholder owner and the firm lender debt holdersloo these cost occur when the stockholder act their own selfinterest and take action that benefit them more than the debtor and not add the value the firm however they are the expense the firm lender therefore this case the debtor will want protect themselves and their right monitoring the firm and drawing strict loan covenant which will add the cost borrowing when the firm more debt according the tradeoff theory the firm will use optimal level debt capital structure after balancing the cost and benefit borrowing therefore the firm optimal debt ratio will tradeoff between the firm tax shield that the advantage borrowing against the firm cost borrowing which include the cost related bankruptcy and agency cost study myers and others cassar and holmes brealey and myers yers brealey and myers cassar and holmes brealey and myers quan oomichaelas and cassar and holmes iobrealey and myers and michaelas cassar and holmes and brealey and myers lomichaelas ocassar and holmes myers brealey and myers have supported two point within the framework the tradeoff theory one that firm which are risky unprofitable and have more intangible asset borrow and usually rely more equity financing while firm which have more opportunity high profit and tangible asset and are considered more safe will have higher target debt ratio their capital structure benefit from the tax shield and consequently maximize firm value addition another significant capital structure theory that recognizes asymmetric information within framework the pecking order theory the pecking order theory hypothesis that indicates that firm have particular order preference relative the source finance they use their capital structure the firm financing preference are follows the first preference internal source fund against external and this usually come from retained earnings and profit additional fund are needed then debt used their second preference however within this option shortterm preferred against longterm debt furthermore external fund are more needed then the firm last option will the use equity this order preference due the difference cost across the different source finance the reason behind the cost difference that believed that manager and owner insider the firm have more information about the firm than the outsider this information important and give signal indication about the firm return situation the outsider therefore these new equity holder demand higher return their investment which make certain source finance more expensive for example due the belief that insider have more information than new investor new investor will demand higher return which make the issuance new equity more expensive therefore internal fund are preferred this case the myers myers brealey and myers ocassar and holmes brealey and myers cassar and holmes brealey and myers cassar and holmes michaelas cassar and holmes general preference firm according this hypothesis that equity will issued only when debt capacity running out and financial distress threatens the relevance capital structure theory small firm most the theory capital structure were applied large enterprise and much the empirical evidence derived from large business firm data however just few study focused the capital structure and financing small business firm this because recently small business finance and capital structure been major concern research economist and policy maker many country reviewing the literature most economist have agreed that general most small firm comparison larger enterprise have higher debt ratio their capital structure and rely more shortterm debt obtained from bank their major source external finance these issue have been repeated continuously within the literature small firm financing moreover many debate and international comparison were done small firm research the reason behind the high level debt and explain why bank are the main provider external finance and why small firm use shortterm loan and not longterm loan some the debate explained this issue within the framework the capital structure theory that have already been discussed the other hand other economist have explained the reason behind capital structure smes term equity gap therefore small firm financing been discussed and analyzed from different point and various dimension many researcher were advocate the suggestion that small firm have the capital structure that relevant finance theory particularly the pecking order hypothesis brealey and myers michaelas michaelas ohamilton and fox the financing preference small firm owner international journal entrepreneurial behavior research keasy and watson small firm management ownership finance and pemformance oxford blackwell publisher and wilson committee the financing small firm interim report the committee review the functioning the financial institution cmnd london hmso that first advanced myers cosh and hughes argued that small firm owner would prefer source finance that are consistent with the pecking order hypothesis the ownermanager small firm need intrusion their firm therefore they will start with internal source finance usually personal saving for startup they will eventually use retained earnings and profit after that fund are needed then the order preference the small firm ownermanager will follows shortterm debt longterm debt and only nessacirally equity finance the last option furthermore empirical evidence based australian smes cassar and holmes support the principle that capital structure theory applicable large firm also apply smes addition they concluded that sme capital structure determinant and financing choice relate the static tradeoff theory and pecking order hypothesis that were advanced explain capital structure within the framework market imperfection mentioned previously similarly michaelas chittenden and poutziouris their work smes capital structure have shown that the capital structure theory apply most small firm another study hamilton and fox about the financing preference small firm owner new zealand shown that small firm owner follow the principle the pecking order theory where they prefer use internal source fund such personal saving and retained earnings they argued that the small firm owner always look minimize the opportunity any further intrusion into their firm therefore they concluded that the capital structure small firm reflects the desire and plan the small firm owner and doe not necessarily reflects deficiency the supply side fund conversely external source and different type finance for small firm are more limited than those available for large corporation many academic researcher have identified several reason for the limited external source finance available small firm and have tried explain the reason behind these finance gap hamilton and fox cosh and hughes size financial structure and profitability company the hughes and storey finance and the sniall firni london routledge cassar and holmes michaelas hamilton and fox many study have proved that equity gap exists for small firm and the small firm capital structure not always reflect the preference ordering the small firm owner manager what arnold referred unquoted small firm not always have access the equity market therefore they rely more personal saving retained earnings because they can not obtain longterm debt equity capital due deficiency the supplyside fund therefore loan are needed small firm owner manager will approach their family and friend the discussed previously section this finance gap recognized and been discussed since when the macmillan committee first identified what called the macmillan gap followed other governmental inquiry report such bolton and wilson report addition tamari also discussed the same issue which support the principle finance gap the capital market for small firm and reveals that small firm rely more shortterm debt and they have difficulty accessing capital market obtain longterm fund however tamari concluded that not clear whether the preference small firm what available them from the supplier fund furthermore many researcher have argued that small firm are disadvantage comparison large enterprise when they are seeking for external finance addition small firm are still unable raise equity small sum and many case can not obtain loan capital moreover they they will obtain under strict condition where collateral needed and high interest rate applieds arnold hamilton and fox arnold storey understanding the small business sector london

corporate account the france israel and japan american journal small business hamilton and fox tamari penrose the theory the growth the firm oxford basil blackwell and storey the financing difficulty faced small firm have been argued and explained economist who have either attributed them the greater risk associated when lending small firm market imperfection such information asymmetry however information asymmetry been argued different theoretical framework explain small firm finance information asymmetry bank and small firm finance many theory have argued that capital market are full imperfection one the most significant market imperfection the capital market the availability and cost information however the real world the finance market are full uncertainty furthermore not all the participant the market have the same information and the information not available without cost information asymmetry and agency problem that are fundamental the theory finance have also had great impact the provision finance small firm argued keasy and watson that the presence imperfect information made difficult and costly monitor the small firm owner and ascertain she acting their best ability asymmetric information characteristic small firm and many had argued that exists small firm more than larger firm accordingly keasy and watson argued that bank are the main source external finance small firm because bank have the ability through their economy scale cope with information asymmetry however binks and ennew because small firm owner manager have more information about their firm than the bank this information not readily accessible bank and therefore bank may reject some loan application this adverse selection another issue that may occur when bank are not sure that small firm tamari penrose and storey binks and ennew and storey binks and ennew keasy and watson michaelas keasy and watson binks and ennew owner will work their best effort therefore they need monitor their action and this moral hazard many researcher have discussed the problem adverse selection and moral hazard and their effect bank and firm relationship storey argued that when bank rejected certain firm loan application and agree others they not always know which these firm have higher expected return due lack information they may therefore choose finance the firm with the lower expected return thereby making wrong choice adverse selection furthermore firm owner attitude after obtaining loan from bank may towards taking risky project get higher return this attitude moral hazard the firm owner may have adverse effect bank these risky project fail under thesis circumstance the loss will the bank however the case success all the return and profit firm and not the bank adverse selection and moral hazard are resulting problem asymmetric information collateral the major response adverse selection and moral hazard problem therefore this explains why strict type contract and collateral are required from small firm when they want obtain loan having reviewed the literature small firm financing will proceed the next chapter look into the source finance available smes jordan binks and ennew tstorey tucker and lean storey chapter four source finance for smes jordan introduction small and mediumsized enterprise smes jordan are not formally defined the jordanian

manufacturing sector constitutes large part the economy the manufacturing industry are considered smes however smes jordan face many problem and constraint that require policy change and immediate

problem that face smes general both developing and developed country jordan the sme sector also face many problem that are generally similar other developing country reviewing the literature the main constraint that face the jordanian smes can classified under two category first financial constraint which are considered the main problem and the main objective the thesis secondly nonfinancial

the absence scientific feasibility study and business plan combined with increasing cost research indicated that general smes jordan suffer from endless technical financial managerial legal environmental and marketing problem however the main focus this study investigate the financial problem facing smes the manufacturing sector therefore significant review some the literature the general financial problem faced smes jordan before looking the source finance available smes been argued that jordan the cost finance high and there limited capital available people develop establish

suffer from finance gap when they want obtain finance from financial institution addition because small enterprise need very small loan this increase the cost lending from bank and the financial institution therefore bank are always hesitant lend smes because the associated high risk and operational cost nevertheless the important question what extent these general issue apply the smes the manufacturing sector and what are the reason behind this finance gap these issue will investigated the coming chapter source finance for smes jordan chapter three discussed the various source finance that are available for smes general however these source finance whether debt equity fund may not necessarily available jordanian smes general there are two type finance are available smes debt and

smes and some policy maker are also important although known that bank are the major source external finance sle many country they still find difficult obtain credit facility from bank because credit restriction generally speaking many developing and developed country bank require collateral from smes when they apply for loan which not always available this because the high risk involved when lending smes comparison large enterprise the case jordan bank are still working with restricted banking practice governing specifically the credit policy which turn will affect smes the most account their poor condition and risky environment addition bank jordan have excess liquidity and therefore are willing expand their work through profitable business sector but they still not have any new

addition arnson and faber had argued that open ended interview can vague and the interviewee were not familiar with this type question may make them feel hesitant their answer which will reflected negatively the respondent answer additionally the result this study can not generalized because the limited size the sample the research and the restricted data also each country own economic cultural and social background that can affect smes finance therefore the result this research can not generalized applicable other developing country robson burn introduction research method london sage publication robson robson arnson and faber openended question seitz structured interview the sample selection the research and analysis the manufacturing smes investigated the research have been randomly selected person the chamber industry jordan had selected smes randomly without knowing the purpose for bias can involved however there official definition for smes jordan therefore the selection the sample depended the chamber industry definition the chamber industry definition that adopted based the number employee the chamber industry considers the enterprise that have from employee are small enterprise and the firm that have from employee are medium enterprise whereas any firm that employ than employee are believed very small enterprise however this definition only related the chamber industry this definition adopted the chamber industry since after official committee had agreed adopt such definition any business jordan should register the chamber industry obtain licence operate therefore taking smes name and address form the chamber industry very reasonable the interviewed group covered the following category existing smes owner manager their financial manager the manufacturing sector bank manager credit officer all the operating bank jordan and people representing ngo foreign aid programme and policy maker the fieldwork taken jordan for five month the interview were composed open ended question that were derived from the literature review the open ended question each interview were divided into four main category can seen the sample copy the

provided the researcher with data and document after the interview such ejada erada and jump moreover the researcher had participated forum called for jordan that had discussed some smes and bank relationship development and the problem that face both party when dealing with each other moreover the researcher studied many startup case that went through different stage the business the case that have been analyzed involve start ups different region and governants jordan these file were studied after taking the permission erada official because such file are very private and confidential and only erada employee can look them regarding the data analysis noteworthy mention that some the interview were tape recorded however unfortunately many interviewee refused record the interview nevertheless the researcher had depended immediate reporting and analysis each interviewee including their reaction attitude and belief the data analysis included identifying the problem and issue that are related together and make immediate interpretation for each interview since this study follows qualitative research methodology aim give meaning what people express the interview therefore interpretative method utilised giving further meaning the transcribed interview because interpretive social scientist believe that social reality socially constructed and that the goal social scientist understand what meaning people give reality not determine how reality work apart from these interpretation thus interpretative method guided the analysis the interview this thesis the data analysis stage addition interpretative method content analysis also used analysing the official report official document and other material and document collected the interview process schutt argued that content analysis research method for systematically analyzing and making inference from text important part the content analysis analysis text which involves coding text the transcribed interview the text from interview coded into related subject area namely the four category mentioned above this facilitated the interpretation the text and also made possible compare the analysis result the difficulty faced during the research noteworthy mention some important note well the difficulty that were encountered during the field work follows many interviewee refused tape record the interview many respondent preferred anonymous the research document getting appointment had required major networking and connection without them the field work would never continued conducted statistic are available about smes jordan due the lack official definition which again proof the point that semi structured interview the best research method used schutt investigating the social word california pine forge press schutt schutt the process and practice research the confidentiality people especially when come finance and competition during the field work interviewee want take information more than giving keep asking about what other interviewee had said for competition reason this realized within the financial institution however the smes want give the best impression about themselves maintain their great reputation the business however the researcher the end able conduct the interview and take the needed information the sme topic jordan very new had only started when the foreign aid programme had highlighted the importance smes jordan economy and started operate jordan support the sme sector although many interviewee had argued that the sme sector jordan had been there long and many had pointed out that the economy jordan consists mainly comparison other country however this issue debatable because many definition are involved therefore depends the definition that adopted one the major difficulty faced that many people jordan still believe that smies business finance related microfinance issue there collaboration connection between the different department organization that are nowadays involved supporting the smes sector jordan this make the research very difficult for example nowadays there are many foreign programme jordan support smes however there single official umbrella that cover them all each programme related certain governmental body jordan which make research very difficult and confusing chapter six analysis the smes ownermanagers perception introduction this chapter discus the perception the sme owner manager jordan who were interviewed during the research fieldwork the semi structured interview which were conducted with smes owner from the manufacturing sector jordan revealed different opinion smes financing issue however while some area there were agreement other area there were disagreement the open ended question each

category question ass the sme owner awareness the importance the above mentioned issue the development their business and investigate their attitude and belief towards these issue addition important familiar with the smes business practice and their understanding many important principal order understand the reason behind the existence finance gap jordan there one furthermore the smes which were randomly selected are mature business ithin the industry look their year establishment will noticed that some them are quite old business and are not newly established enterprise the age seven smes range between year while three them have age that range between year see table the following question asked what would you say about the criterion that you follow when you choose your source finance the reason behind this question investigate the smes plan for their financing and know they follow certain standard that match the firm financing need they just stick their principle without any

preference for their business finance furthermore they all indicated that they use bank financing only when necessary which indicates that bank finance used only when there shortage cash financial problem addition the most common bank credit facility that are used them are short term loan overdraft and indirect credit facility such letter credit and discounted bill therefore the pecking order hypothesis that discussed the previous chapter can relate certain extent these jordanian smes therefore very important realize the mentality and the attitude the respondent and how they perceive bank financing they all think that bank are there rescuer particularly when there are financial problem reality this not the case because bank exist intermediary between depositor and borrower sme owner should more knowledgeable about the intermediary function bank they have understand and aware that order approach bank they have successful and not vice versa cosh and hughes size financial structure and profitability company the hughes and storey finance and the small firm london routledge the majority the respondent showed that they believe internal financing and many them explained that they

firne management oxford blackwell publisher ownership finance and performance ownership finance and performance generally speaking many rich businessmen prefer borrow money from bank simply because they can invest their own money other opportunity and not tying all their capital one single business however the owner attitude that described respondent can attributed the country risk and the instability the region particularly jordan therefore there nothing wrong with such attitude which involves hedging country risk holding investing the money outside jordan addition realised all the interview that the respondent always started indicating that they not have financial problem and they mention financial problem such liquidity they immediately start talking about the reputation the business and how successful they the owner the business are financial manager were interviewed see table moreover the reason behind the negative attitude towards bank loan the mentality and the background the respondent implying that borrowing money from the bank reflects unethical attitude behaviour the survey indicates that the mentality the business people jordan particularly within the sme manufacturing sector revolves around their pride and consciousness status table the position respondent and the characteristic their company respondent respondent industry year number type

finance but only when necessary credit and discounted bill prefer internal and external source finance own money overdraft and letter credit prefer external source finance which are bank bank loan loan the second question that asked which part the eligibility criterion finance category question about the collateral and the security principle the aim this question investigate the sme owner perception the principle requiring security collateral whenever they ask for loan and whether they can suggest alternative sometimes collateral becomes major obstacle many smes when they want borrow loan for different reason some people are against the principle pledging their house their asset bank while many others not have the right value collateral that required bank which turn restrain smes from any further expansion development this issue mentioned respondent and godley ross introduction bank network and small firm finance nennworks and venture capital godley and ross reading university reading the other hand for bank collateral very important affect their financing decision particularly when financing smes the main reason behind demanding collateral which been repeatedly discussed researcher and academic the existence imperfect information theory and practice information always main issue that provides reasoning behind the demand collateral bank always been discussed that the company owner have more information about their company than the bank which make the bank demand collateral cover the risk associated with this information asymmetry many case refuse the loan application therefore bank require high collateral cover the risk associated case loan default hence theory been explained that information asymmetry make bank unable differentiate between the good and bad borrower which lead demand for high collateral from all borrower including good lender this behavior known adverse selection addition bank demand high collateral because their inability observe borrower action towards the service the loan this issue known moral hazard both adverse selection and moral hazard are result information asymmetry theory been realised that bank are aware this information asymmetry therefore they demand collateral however the question that arise are are borrower aware the reason behind demanding collateral they just observe routine procedure the bank lending and additional cost borrowing the perception smes owner and banker towards the information gap will discussed later bcowling and westhead bank lending decision and small firm doe size matter international journal entrepreneurial behavior research godley and ross eurojordanian action for the development enterprise what smes should know when approaching bank amman financial support scheme salah credit collateral their type and risk amman the jordan loan guarantee corporation arabic godley and ross cowling and westhead cowling and westhead almahrouq required collateral commercial bank doe harm the small borrowing from bank comparative arab sme banking experience credit scoring collateral and credit extension paper two facilitating the flow fund smes the annual international conference amman may amman the arab academy for banking and financial service cowling and westhead practice collateral important element that affect bank lending decision for bank collateral come within the five credit element which are known the five credit that bank look when they want make financing decision these five credit element are character capacity capital condition and collateral however some bank agree that collateral important element but the other credit element which are character capacity capital and condition should affect the bank financing decision more while other bank agree that matter how the other four factor the five credit element the collateral should have significant weight the bank financing decision because cover the risk the case loan default bank vary taking risk since collateral associated with the risk the loan the borrower then the higher the risk associated with the loan the higher the level collateral required the case financing smes collateral get more complicated since collateral related customer risk and hence smes are known risky therefore the collateral demanded from smes will definitely high value there are many argument about the collateral issue people perceive thing according their belief however the following question will show the perception the smes the collateral that demanded bank jordan and what they think about such principle however the following chapter will discus the banker perception the collateral principle particularly when they want finance smes the following question asked what you think the principle requiring security collateral and what other reasonable alternative can you suggest eurojordanian action for the development enterprise salah salah salah eurojordanian action for the development enterprise eurojordanian action for the development enterprise the interview reflect that the respondent indicated that they did not experience collateral complication with their bank because they are well established business and the owner are rich and well known jordan addition they are not well known they should wealthy have good past record and long relationship with bank therefore order obtain bank loan with flexible collateral term the smes have have two more the above characteristic although some the respondent such and indicated that they have financial problem they revealed that they did not experience any problem regarding collateral issue any difficulty obtaining loan from bank because the reason just mentioned above the other hand the respondent complained and criticised the banking procedure and the high demand for collateral for example respondent and pointed out that they are not pleased with the principle requiring collateral because bank are not reasonable with their level demand such matter addition respondent and were facing collateral complication not because they did not have the characteristic the others good reputation being rich good past record and have well established firm but because they showed greater unwillingness pledge their own house they also experience unreasonable bank demand which they believe discriminatory but what really support the criticism respondent and that three respondent and also criticised the bank for similar reason but did not refer their personal experience however they expressed their opinion relation other people experience addition repeated criticism from many respondent that bank discriminate between borrower relation the level collateral demanded other word the collateral demanded bank can affected the family name which can related cultural tribal issue jordan the answer respondent and reveal that they can not tolerate the bank demand for collateral and the complicated procedure when they apply for loan they also share the same principle other respondent they deal with bank only when necessary and only when there are liquidity problem this attitude reflects the business culture and mentality sme owner jordan towards bank they not have enough financial knowledge financial acumen smes not kno exactly the reason behind the bank existence the reason behind demanding collateral jordan family reputation and tribal culture dominate the way smes behave towards bank furthermore apparent that whenever bank loan are used smes try make excuse why they are using bank loan loan are unethical therefore can not generalise that bank discriminate against smes with regard collateral and credit facility however when two party want draw contract they have have equal information therefore smes and bank must have equal information the smes are still not aware how bank operate and how they have risk averse furthermore been recognised from some the respondent answer that bank jordan sometimes lend borrower the basis their name known name lending which can reflect some discrimination against other borrower borrowing from bank only available certain famous people the country then this will constraint for any further investment and business development such issue will affect both mature company and startup therefore all people should given equal opportunity borrowing however the condition borrowing can variable according the creditworthiness each individual but within reasonable standard and without discrimination can summarise the opinion the respondent different way see table the respondent criticised the unreasonable and rigid demand the bank regarding the collateral issue jordan the other hand the respondent were nearly neutral about the collateral issue because they were reluctant talk about their own positive experience with bank however only the respondent showed optimism and support for the banking demand and requirement and explained how flexible bank are nowadays with the collateral issue table the smes attitude towards the principle collateral percentage smes attitude negative attitude and showed pessimism neutral attitude positive attitude and showed optimism the third question asked about risk management this question aim investigate the smes owner are aware the importance risk management and how managed their firm furthermore this question look into whether smes owner jordan are aware the risk involved their business and what their perception are towards risk and risk management addition the question involves the understanding what type risk and problem are faced the jordanian manufacturing smes the following question asked what doe risk management mean you and how managed your firm the response the question show smes have identified nearly the same situation risky for their business although some the respondent concentrated the most frequent problem faced each one still this doe not mean that the other problem not exist jordan hence many case each respondent mentioned more than one risky situation that face their business see table the most risky situation that were identified the respondent are the disloyalty the employee the scarcity skilled labour force liquidity problem due deferred sale the political instability the region particularly iraq and palestine high competition due the new signed free trade agreement fta the scarcity raw material around the respondent pointed out that they continuously face the problem disloyalty amongst employee this problem been mentioned repeatedly many respondent during the field work sme ownermanagers banker ngo and decision maker jordan however any discussion employee disloyalty should take into consideration that the temptation money virtually universal human weakness therefore money better salary very attractive reason for worker leave job however due lack financial and social security employee disloyalty can attributed accepting increase income matter how small addition the disloyalty employee corresponds with the continuous increase the daily demand life furthermore due the tribal culture jordan loyalty mainl seen tribal this issue becomes particularly obvious when social problem arises addition the tribal issue jordan are also seen parliament which allocation seat are given out the representative group the bedouin tribe the south the centre and the north jordan furthermore the respondent mentioned the problem absence skilled labour force scarcity worker which they perceive major risk their firm although jordan abundance university graduate for example doctor engineer and lawyer there always shortage skilled and unskilled laborer importing unskilled laborer from egypt and syria temporarily covered the shortage estimated that jordan around half million such worker who most the agricultural work force and one third the menial work the main problem remains constructing durable and strong skilled labour force spite continuous effort made the government the reason why this goal unachievable lie the following many jordanian are influenced their social background and consider menial work and craft work demeaning since would lower their social status therefore she would prefer desk job with low salary than handicraft job with high income there built problem the jordanian schooling system jordan made schooling obligatory for ten year until the pupil sixteen seventeen then pupil can choose between academic and vocational schooling however vocational education implies lower social prestige and usually those with the minimum academic achievement follow this line rarely ever bright student choose this route furthermore the brightest who follow the vocational stream can take advantage the bridging system and apply university this move them information obtained from the ministry labour jordan upper socioeconomic class resulting depriving the skilled labour force elite thereby aggravating the condescending public attitude skilled labourer with good experience are rare commodity and are sought neighbouring country and international company working the region who offer them very high salary sometimes more than twice that offered university graduate the same field while university graduate are abundance these skilled labourer are very scarce spite the intensive effort the jordanian government build this sector skilled labour force and make difficult import such labourer from sri lanka india and philippine there are still high number from these country working skilled laborer jordan this both help and risk can considered help because they offer temporary solution the shortage that jordan face and risk because there always internal external threat that may cause their sudden withdrawal this may result sudden collapse the industry employing them furthermore liquidity problem and shortage cash due deferred sale were also perceived risky situation many respondent nearly respondent mentioned liquidity problem major risk their firm many business jordan make deferred sale meaning that they will receive payment after day which give them cash flow problem addition one respondent out ten mentioned scarcity raw material risk the company however jordan major problem with this country with limited natural resource addition most the raw material are imported which increase the cost production and leaf the business with limited choice respondent viewed the new free trade agreement that had been signed many country problem that created great risk their company due the high competition the respondent pointed out that they are facing high competition from many other imported product through the free trade agreement they explained that the cost production high jordan and this make competition intense due the high quality imported product this situation leaf the local company serious risk however the smes perception the free trade agreement and the new economic reform jordan will discussed later furthermore the respondent perceived the political instability the region particularly iraq and palestine major risk their business saudi arabia gulf state and oman may appear peaceful but they have their own internal conflict whether social tribal political which may erupt anytime and make business planning uncertain people give varying risk rating these country however everyone agreement that the palestinian and the iraqi conflict represent the greatest risk business jordan before iraq imported external need from through jordan many factory were established after the first gulf war iraqiiranian war and particularly after the second gulf war kuwait invasion meet iraqi need addition iraq the only customer these factory but this changed with the fall baghdad the catastrophic end these business known everybody moreover the problem palestine aggravated the belief that solution attainable however what happens the ground increase the insecurity any business established meet palestinian need addition the attitude towards managing risk were nearly the same between smes owner manager and manager who are not owner the company they all depend their experience and knowledge manage risk their business this been clarified the nonownermanagers who were interviewed furthermore these manager explained that they were following the action and attitude the owner the company the majority the respondent showed the same attitude towards managing their risk they indicated that they depend their long experience managing their own business this called managerial competency gilmore carson and odonnell these researcher suggest that the small firm ownermanagers use their experience cope with and manage the risky situation that their business encounter gilmore small business ownermanager and their attitude risk marketing intelligence planning furthermore gilmore carson and odonnell study highlighted that there are four main risky condition faced the small firm ownermanagers these condition were related thing such the company cash flow condition the company expansion and growth going into new line work and handing over business task employee the study showed that these issue were identified risky condition small firm owner manager moreover according this study small firm ownermanagers depend their managerial experience their business and their relationship and set contact with other people control such risk therefore risk can vary from one business another depending the situation what interesting notice how many smes owner manager and this includes jordan indicate that they are also depending their experience manage their business risk can concluded from the analysis the respondent perception that smes owner the manufacturing sector jordan should pay more attention risk management addition smes owner have train themselves and their employee address various type risk guarantee their firm survival according the european agency for safety and health work not only the responsibility one person the company which usually the ownermanager the firm but also all other employee the company according their knowledge and experience any firm can face different type risk even daytoday operation since smes are more exposed risk and can affected more than bigger corporation great deal attention should paid such matter and greater emphasis placed strategic planning smes owner manager jordan gilmore gilmore gilmore european agency for safety and health work sme risk management toolkit online available from http pkrh comindex html accessed december european agency for safety and health work sme risk management toolkit table the type risk identified smes percentage type risk employee disloyalty absence skilled labour force and worker scarcity liquidity problem due deferred sale scarcity raw material political instability high

business operation the following question asked how important business plan prerequisite for obtaining finance and what you expect have business plan respondent did not find business plan important prerequisite for obtaining finance from bank for the following reason first because they not have financial problem therefore there need for bank finance business plan second although they have liquidity problem they not like deal with bank therefore they believe there need for business plan these result confirm the study berry which they argue that smes not see any motivation for having business plan because they not believe that there are any underlying reason put plan that connects their present and future business function development and process these are the risk identified the respondent according their personal experience and more than one type risk repeated many them berry financial management practice amongst smes vorkin paper series manchester metropolitan university business school these reason highlight important consideration about the attitude and the mentality sme ownermanagers towards number issue first mentioned previously they always relate bank credit finance financial problem distress second they not believe formally written business plan because they think business plan only for obtaining finance from bank and since they not deal with bank then there need have proper business plan however can not ignore the fact that they are successful firm and have been the market for long time see table addition can not ignore the possibility that they might have future plan for development but not necessarily the form business plan look back the previous risk management question many respondent depend their experience intuition and knowledge face future problem nevertheless always better for the business safety and development have detailed plan face all possible circumstance and prepared for any unpleasant surprise strategic planning desirable enable firm and business people face risky situation thus nobody can ignore the fact that business plan very important for any business burn explains that business plan the same road map this road map explains for smes ownermanagers where they are the present time where they want and how they will choosing which road take order where they want addition many researcher identify the importance business plan particularly for smes and produce various definition one the definition eurojordanian action for the development enterprise ejada the blueprint for operating your business and measuring progress addition burn highlight the importance the business plan for smes owner manager explains that enables them plan for the future their company knowing their goal and target which

enterprise burn situation more strong and appealing bank and investor however the majority the respondent did not perceive the importance business plan however respondent did stress the importance business plan not only for obtaining finance from the bank but also for managing their business important recognise that although these respondent perceived that business plan essential they did not have formal plan however they all pointed out that not that important prerequisite for obtaining finance from bank they argued that other thing such the owner past record reputation position wealth bank relationship and the company success are more important factor which affect the bank financing decision more than having business plan the light these smes attitude apparent that some respondent are aware the importance business plan but that other issue affect bank financing decision such result remind what been recognised and mentioned burn when argued about the bank point view when lending smes and how decision are affected several factor burn point out that credit officer will look the firm financial statement accompanied the business plan when financing existing business because for bank the past record essential where for start business the credit officer will look the knowledge and previous experience the ownermanager interestingly respondent perception this matter who belief the importance business plan general may related certain extent the age size and type this specific company respondent represents private shareholding company which established and employee the biggest company the sample according the number employee definition study conducted berry the financial management practice amongst smes the reveals that the age and size the company increase the application accounting and managerial finance increase the company addition interesting note that their study show that when burn burn berry berry company grows requirement for formal information becomes necessity for managing the firm therefore this study can help explaining why this type company aware and concerned about having proper business plan moreover noteworthy that only two respondent and commented what they expect see business plan respondent indicated that business plan should contain information about product service employee marketing capital and competitor addition explained that their company they have detailed business plan for their bank and for the owner the company respondent argued that business plan very important both the bank and the company because show the company awareness intention goal arrangement and present and future preparation the light the above can conclude that jordanian smes lack understanding what included business plan only respondent commented this issue although there are many professional jordan that can help business people drawing their business plan smes still not realise that business plan important their business light the above analysis can concluded that the majority the respondent believed the following first bank finance always related financial problem and always kept the last solution second bank finance used mainly the form over draft and letter credit third smes not prepare business plan prerequisite for obtaining short term loan and indirect credit facility fourth smes belief that issue are important for obtaining finance from bank such the reputation the borrower his position and the company reputation the evidence suggests that these smes not place any importance weight business plan for the management their business and rely their own managerial experience and knowledge they have strong belief that there need write their experience knowledge and managerial skill the business and the market into formal document which called business plan therefore look the direct answer the respondent the importance the business plan prerequisite for obtaining finance can conclude that the respondent not see any importance all for business plan while believe berry the importance business plan for the sake the business and not important prerequisite for obtaining finance therefore all respondent agreed that not important have business plan prerequisite for obtaining finance see table table the smes perception the importance business plan prerequisite for obtaining finance percentage smes opinion not important all neither for obtaining finance nor for the business itself not important for obtaining finance but important for the business the fifth question within the

you think the prediction cash flow future prediction past record and cash flow statement the firm affect the bank financing decision respondent agreed strongly that financial statement the prediction cash flow and past record affect the bank financing decision strongly and many them explained that past record the borrower can sometimes make the bank attitude towards collateral more flexible nevertheless although these respondent agreed strongly these issue number mentioned once again the tribal issue jordan for example respondent said well known fact that are tribal country and this thing affect the obtaining finance added that people who have strong financial position and good reputation have greater chance develop and grow their business and accomplish even greater achievement for what mentioned respondent about the tribal issue jordan this proved true the social background and the status the family the community play very important and decisive role obtaining finance from bank many instance the bank relies social connection more than collateral because the guarantee given tribal status although people may interpret the word tribal literally mean bond among important figure the family rather than the classical bonding each and every member the clan furthermore while investigating this phenomenon found case where the applicant submitted more than enough collateral but the bank still refused finance them until personal guarantee important member the family were granted however the respondent did not mention the importance these issue the concentration more name lending and the position the borrower which their opinion really affect the bank financing decision this can recognised from respondent answer which stated that bank jordan concentrate the reputation the borrower and his position the country more than anything else explained that any well known man jordan can obtain loan from bank without giving collateral this man signature would sufficient guarantee trustworthiness furthermore explained that this type company owner prefers take loan from bank rather than using their own money been realised from the answer respondent that the reputation and the position the borrower are very important and that this consideration doe affect the bank financing decision comment were made about the prediction cash flow only that the reputation and the name the borrower were always mentioned therefore can say here that name lending the main focus the other hand the respondent were very pessimistic about the bank lending procedure jordan they criticised nearly everything about bank furthermore they were displeased with the bank requirement particularly regarding the demand for collateral financial statement and other personal document addition they believed that bank are not supportive the manufacturing sector and keep complicating the procedure for borrower vital recognise the attitude mentality and the belief some the respondent particularly respondent and respondent said bank always have complicated and high requirement when come credit facility especially loan bank require audited financial statement and other confidential document such document may contain all the secret the business and this make business people more hesitant because such information may spread competitor tax collector furthermore respondent expressed the same opinion arguing that believed that bank jordan not support the manufacturing sector financially explained that very difficult obtain loan from the local bank furthermore added that bank always require unreasonable collateral and ask for many guarantor addition bank design the term the loan according their wish and not according the business cycle which add burden the borrower this ignores the fact that borrower particularly the manufacturing sector need the bank support order expand and continue their business furthermore respondent explained that most smes the manufacturing sector have liquidity problem which are due deferred sale that take from day paid cash added that they not like obtain finance from bank but there are other solution family business and they not like any outsider partner therefore order solve their liquidity problem they usually take short term loan the form overdraft facility and letter credit addition respondent added that jordan for person obtain loan from bank she have many strong relationship with well known people said everything jordan built personal relationship the more you know people different field the easier thing can done for the business argued that this reality but insisted saying that they not have any financial problem and stressed how successful their business respondent and believed that bank should support the manufacturing sector and more flexible ignoring the fact that bank are not working for social community service bank are profitmaking institution and they work intermediary between saver and lender addition bank have different point view about lending and they talk different language however these issue will discussed the coming chapter when analyse the banker perception about financing smes jordan summary the smes perception the effect the financial statement the prediction cash flow and the past record the bank financing decision are highlighted table table the smes perception the

international accounting standard even they not wish obtain finance from bank this because important for their own internal operation and management furthermore added that any company audited financial statement will attract more investor moreover said yes have audited financial statement and they are important however can see that this opinion financial manager private shareholding company which obliged disclose information publicly the jordanian law see table therefore important review article the jordanian company law order understand which type company are compelled produce audited financial statement and employ licensed accountant for preparing their account and financial statement according the regulation and law the ministry industry and trade jordan the company law obliges certain type company such public shareholding limited partnership share limited liability and private shareholding company assign one more licensed auditor therefore such company have have

register certain amount capital the ministry but working capital can triple the amount registered capital may even explain why many sme owner manager not like deal with bank expand and grow for tax purpose again these issue can related the mentality attitude background and belief many smes jordan this may also apply the smes approach and idea about the information gap jordan and could explain the main reason for the financial problem faced smes furthermore interesting note see table that the sample respondent includes five limited liability company which are obliged the company law produce

the eligibility criterion finance that bank follow when they want take financing decision addition the main target these question investigate the banker attitude and perception particularly towards financing smes question about the importance collateral cash flow statement business plan management capacity credit scoring audited statement and risk management were asked the first question that asked follows what would you say about the eligibility criterion that you follow when financing smes found previously that the respondent bank finance smes jordan see table more the point been realized from the respondent answer this question that each bank own eligibility criterion that they follow when financing smes and these criterion are based according each bank internal credit policy however all bank jordan have their internal credit policy that are drawn within the central bank jordan cbj regulation although each bank his own eligibility criterion that they follow when financing smes yet all the respondent had mentioned nearly the same thing that they usually require look when financing smes all the respondent had started answering this question saying that they study loan proposal case case according the bank internal credit policy however the majority the respondent had argued and repeated nearly the same issue that they consider when financing smes all respondent had explained that bank have have complete background about the company work and operation the past present and future addition been realized from the majority the respondent that most the thing that bank look are the feasibility study for the business the past record the history the customer the financials term the high net worth wealth the borrower which can mitigating factor the bank financing decision the future projection the adequacy cash flow repay the loan and the adequacy profitability repay the interest furthermore addition the previous thing they all had pointed out that bank also consider the collateral the risk the reason behind the loan the market demand for the business the performance the company the competition the enterprise the skill and experience the borrower the project and the good management their financing decision moreover bank look the customer integrity and creditworthiness which can accessed accessing the data base the central bank jordan cbj also the type business very important the financing decision because there are certain type business that bank not finance contradicts with the bank credit policy addition all the respondent had stated that the borrower should provide the financing bank with all the formal document such the company registration certificate working licence and the official registered name also bank require look the company financial statement for few year some the respondent bank had indicated that they prefer and require audited financial statement however audited financial statement will discussed more detail

total asset turnover sale revenue and the total amount the credit facility the company requiring the other hand some had argued that sale are the main thing that they look when they want finance sme nevertheless some the respondent had indicated that they study the loan proposal case case according the bank internal credit policy which usually involves the availability the five credit character capital capacity collateral and condition however they had concentrated more the collateral saying that even collateral come before the end still very important matter how all the other element credit are strong they had argued that the bank have reasonable amount collateral because the bank need protected against risky situation which may appear all sudden and out the borrower control addition some the respondent had explained their specific criterion that they follow when financing smes for example one respondent representing abc bank argued that the bank criterion for financing smes are follow enterprise should have than employee enterprise should have turnover not exceeding enterprise that have total equity the respondent abc explained that two the previous condition should available however she added that this the bank credit policy that had only started summary according the analysis and investigation above can concluded that all bank look nearly the same issue mentioned previously when making financing decision however the end everything will given priority and certain weight according each bank internal credit policy but been realized that the respondent did not mention the weight the priority for each mentioned issue because after all believed that each bank own internal information for their operation that can not publicized furthermore the respondent were asked about the principle requiring collateral and they suggest any reasonable alternative particularly when they deal with smes the following question were asked what you think the principle requiring security collateral and what other reasonable alternative can you suggest found that the respondent had stated that collateral extremely important principle see table addition they

degree collateral required varies among borrower and business according different thing accompanied the collateral that affect the bank financial decision such the risk the cash flow the past record the reputation the borrower experience and knowledge moreover the respondent added that the principle collateral varies among bank because each bank own internal credit policy many had argued that there one rule that applies everything therefore although collateral significant still all the respondent had argued that bank also look other essential thing because many had argued that reality thing are different particularly with smes the majority the respondent had stated that smes jordan are very risky therefore bank ask for collateral and are very strict with this principle addition many respondent had indicated that collateral can tangible asset intangible such the personal guarantee but many had argued that personal guarantee are only accepted from well known and rich people furthermore been recognized that the majority the respondent had laid extreme emphasis the importance the principle requiring collateral the reason behind that according the majority the respondent opinion that jordan there lack financial disclosure which lead information gap the respondent had explained that nearly all financial statement are prepared way that avoid tax and bank are fully aware this issue for that reason they insist requiring high amount collateral protect their right even bank did not want look collateral the first thing their financing decision but still they reality protect their right although this tax issue not right socially and economically still many people escape from tax because they believe that the tax system jordan unfair according many banker opinion therefore collateral very reasonable principle and highly required bank particularly when dealing with smes according the majority the respondent opinion collateral make bank safer particularly the existence the information gap that mentioned repeatedly all the respondent during the interview nevertheless all the respondent had agreed that the bank are mainly concerned see their loan and interest repaid therefore the cash flow the project are extremely important but the same time the bank have prepared for any default that may occur requiring reasonable amount collateral adding that the lack financial disclosure and information gap that mentioned the majority make bank more insistent collateral because the end the bank depositor right that have protected too addition some respondent had argued that most case smes not have collateral but that case some respondent had argued that they prefer make the loan through the jordan loan guarantee corporation jlgc which also proof the importance collateral bank the other hand the respondent believed that collateral important principle but there are other thing that are more important see table for example many respondent had commented this question saying that having security collateral good thing have but doe not always determine the bank will approve the loan proposal the main thing that bank look the actual cash flow therefore the actual cash flow are extremely important the bank financing decision because the end cash flow are the most important source for repaying the loan furthermore the majority the respondent had pointed out that the level collateral required the bank depends the financials the firm and whether they were audited not addition they had added that the credibility the borrower and their reputation also play major role the bank financing decision addition many respondent added that collateral good thing have but compared the financials collateral becomes important they had stated that the end the day the bank not real estate seller the bank want the loan repaid and therefore the financials and the performance the account are more important than the collateral however they added that this doe not mean that there should not collateral many respondent had added that most smes are very difficult deal with because they not have financials written number show the bank when they want obtain finance addition smes not have any strategy huge factory that are worthwhile pledged collateral can used security therefore the majority the respondent had added that from banker point view they doubt that anybody will lend smes without collateral summary been recognized according the respondent that collateral important but doe not take number one priority the bank decision making there are other important thing that bank look addition the collateral the financials past record and the customer integrity and creditworthiness come before collateral requirement when making financing decision which mean the bank asks for collateral but doe not always mean that any one who good collateral can take loan according many respondent there are other thing that matter the bank the collateral come the end extra support for the bank case default whereas the respondent did not answer this question see table nevertheless respondent did not mention any alternative collateral because from banker perspective been realized that collateral should always there but the level collateral and the priority collateral the bank decision making varies among respondent table the baker opinion the principle collateral percentage banker opinion believe that extremely important believe that important but there are other thing that are more important and are priority the bank financing decision answer addition the respondent were asked about the importance business plan prerequisite for obtaining finance and what banker expect see business plan the following question were asked how important business plan prerequisite for obtaining finance and what you expect see business plan found that the respondent had indicated that business plan very important prerequisite for obtaining finance see table however each bank own internal credit policy for making financial decision therefore from banker point view business plan essential but there are also other important thing look when making financial decision such the adequacy cash flow the past record the future projection the quality management the feasibility study the borrower credit worthiness and reputation the type project the risk and the purpose the loan therefore from bank perspective business plan always great thing have and important but reality each bank their oww format and style analysis that they depend when making financial decision hence the effect business plan the bank financing decision varies among the bank relation the internal credit policy each bank and according the weight that each bank had given business plan relation financing decision for example some the respondent had pointed out that business plan important prerequisite for obtaining finance but weighs their bank financing decision furthermore some other respondent had argued that business plan fundamental thing have and they ask for but after they have the financials the company addition many respondent had stated that business plan very important and essential for big corporation and bank requires professionally done business plan particularly the bank want finance fixed asset therefore many respondent had explained that business plan doe affect the bank financial decision because can reflect many thing about the borrower and the business the other hand the respondent had pointed out that business plan not important prerequisite for obtaining finance and doe not affect the bank financing decision see table the reason behind that many respondent had explained that jordan people are not used making dealing with the business plan therefore not that much demanded from business the bank the financial institution also few respondent had explained that business plan general important but not jordan because they had explained that region like jordan and with all the surrounding region within the middle east area very difficult predict the future for four five year which make business plan not vital for obtaining finance whereas the respondent did not comment this question see table table the banker opinion towards the business plan percentage banker opinion business plan very important prerequisite for obtaining finance business plan not important prerequisite for obtaining finance answer furthermore notable that the majority the respondent had argued that for smes the situation different because smes most the time not have business plan and they not professionally made they had argued that business plan good thing have however when talking about smes thing are different they added that smes not have the sophistication provide professional business plan with their loan proposal only few them therefore some the bank take this thing into consideration and not require from smes prerequisite for obtaining finance but some others not finance all they had added that the bank are responsible for reviewing business plan that given the borrower and not business plan for the customer because they have provide the bank with addition the majority the respondent had indicated that many small business jordan are still not aware cultured enough about the importance having business plan they had added that many smes are not sophisticated enough prepare even aware the need business plan addition some them want have business plan that prepared professionally then will cost lot and some them can not afford moreover some respondent stated that most the big corporation have the financial sophistication and provide business plan but most the small business not have such thing therefore business plan depends the type the business the size the business and the sector which explains why bank have other reason prefer large corporation over smes since found that the respondent had stated that business plan important prerequisite for obtaining finance see table for the question that related the respondent expectation what see business plan found that the respondent had commented this question while the respondent did not comment this question see table the majority the respondent had commented that the main thing that they look business plan are the profitability and growth ratio addition the future projection furthermore they had added that they expect see the prediction future sale the total time needed for repaying the loan and the main element that the feasibility study

material competitor and supplier addition they had added that they expect see the business future and marketing plan addition the financial ratio such the growth and the break even point furthermore some respondent had pointed out that they expect see the management strategic plan for least five coming year and the company product development and how will affect the company financials see table therefore some the respondent expectation were nearly the same while others were different however reasonable because they are representing different bank that have different internal credit policy table summary what bank expect see business plan percentage banker expectation expect see profitability ratio growth ratio future projection marketing and product development plan liquidity ratio fixed and variable cost time needed for repaying the loan and the indebtedness the business addition the expect see the general information about the company and the borrower term production source raw material competitor supplier and the management strategic plan comment furthermore the respondent were asked about the past record the prediction cash flow and the cash flow statement and their effect relation the financing decision the following question were asked how you think the prediction cash flow future prediction past record and the cash flow statement the firm affect your financing decision been realized that the respondent had commented the past record the cash flow statement and the future prediction separately therefore found that the respondent had stated that past record are extremely important and affect the bank financing decision tremendously see table furthermore the majority the respondent had pointed out that the past record and the financials the borrower are extremely important for the bank financing decision and they are priority over many other requirement addition many respondent had stated that bank always prefer finance business that have past record and have been the market for minimum year whereas the respondent did not comment the importance the past record see table table the banker opinion the importance the past record and effect the financing decision percentage banker opinion very important and doe affect the bank financing decision comment furthermore found that the respondent had indicated that they consider the cash flow statement very crucial and affect the bank financing decision increasingly this very reasonable because mentioned previously bank believe that the cash flow any business are important source for repaying the loan and this the main thing that bank looking for which getting their loan repaid and the interest too addition the majority the respondent had indicated that comparison with the prediction cash flow the bank are more anxious about the actual figure because bank are interested the repayment the loan and the interest mentioned previously conversely the interviewee did not comment the cash flow statement see table table the banker opinion the importance the cash flow statement and effect the financing decision percentage banker opinion extremely important and doe affect the bank financing decision comment noted that the majority the respondent had explained that their financing decision mainly affected the past record and the cash flow statement but after the credit officer the bank have made sure that the number the statement reflect the real situation the company frequent visit the enterprise addition one the main problem that bank face with smes that smes are afraid give information about their financials because they are scared that will revealed the tax collector furthermore many the smes not have proper financial statement and since bank are interested the cash flow because they are the main source for repaying the loan and the interest then bank are more cautious and hesitant when financing smes since the respondent had stated that they depend the past record and the financial statement their financing decision see table and nevertheless the respondent had shown different perception towards the projection cash flow been realized that the respondent believe the importance the future projection see table addition many respondent had stated that projection future cash flow are vital particularly the case start ups the other hand the respondent had indicated that future prediction are not that important and not affect the financing decision for various reason one the reason that were explained many respondent that the banker usually not trust completely the prediction cash flow given the customer because usually the customer are financially optimistic furthermore many respondent had pointed out interesting point which related the projection future cash flow compared the actual cash flow and past record they had explained that jordan very few people provide the bank with financial forecasting for period five year addition that many people here jordan usually take short term loan such over draft and discounted bill therefore the cash flow forecasting become important such case because the bank more interested the period the loan which very short for forecast but here come the importance the past record the borrower therefore some respondent believe past record more essential for the bank financial decision conversely the respondent did not comment this question see table table the banker opinion the importance the prediction cash flow and effect the financing decision percentage banker opinion important not important comment furthermore respondent were asked about the importance the audited financial statement relation the approval loan provision the following question asked what you think about the

when talking about smes addition even the company that have audited financial statement this doe not always mean that the bank will accept everything the audited statement without reinvestigating and double checking the statement number moreover the respondent had stated that bank love have audited financial statement and always try educate the customer having audited financial statement however they had added that nowadays there are many shop that can prepare audited financial statement for money therefore bank not really rely all the time audited financial statement their financing decision furthermore the majority the respondent had given the same reason why they can not trust financial statement even the audited one jordan they had pointed out that known fact that many company jordan prepare their financial statement way that avoids tax which mean the statement number and figure not reflect the actual situation the borrower the company therefore bank always have make sure that the number written the audited financial statement reflect the real situation the company unless the audited statement are prepared well known and licensed auditor that bank can trust and known the bank therefore can see that bank neither trust blindly audited statement nor depend entirely them their financing decision there are other thing that matter for the bank relation the loan approval therefore bank have investigate and analyze thoroughly know the real financial situation the customer before taking any financing decision the other hand the respondent had stated that audited financial statement are extremely important and play major part the bank financial decision particularly when financing big business where bank require audited financial statement from these borrower see table however audited financial statement become must when these bank deal with big and multinational corporation which involve huge amount capital and not smes addition been realized from these respondent that most the time the trusted audited financial statement are the one that belong the public shareholding company particularly the statement where prepared known auditor however bank always analyze the audited financial statement the borrower according each bank credit criterion and see the borrower eligible for the loan not according the bank credit standard the majority the bank that require audited financial statement deal more with big corporation and not although the respondent had indicted that for big corporation audited financial statement are very important still many them had stated that for smes the case different they argued that most the smes jordan not keep accounting record therefore they not have proper financials audited statement they had added for that reason information gap exists and make bank hesitant lend money for smes and they they require high amount collateral summary the majority the respondent them agreed that audited financial statement are important however all argued that when talking about smes financial statement provided the borrower can not trusted even they were audited and bank can not base their financial decision statement provided the borrower without checking personally number furthermore the respondent had added that the major problem with smes that most bank face jordan the disclosure information and the way smes present their business and financials people jordan try avoid tax making statement that not reflect the actual situation and this known fact the bank which make many the bank hesitant provide finance for smes even they they impose them high restriction and demand many collateral moreover worth mentioning the negative perception and vision the banker towards smes many respondent had drawn attention important thing which that most the smes jordan not have good knowledge financial matter therefore many them can not present their case properly the bank addition they had added that many the smes jordan not have the awareness how bank operate they still have this narrow mentality conversely the respondent did not comment all this question see table table the banker opinion the importance the audited financial statement relation the loan approval percentage banker opinion audited financial statement are generally important but are not trusted and are not vital for the loan provision audited financial statement are extremely important and vital for the bank financing decision they are must particularly when financing big corporation answer furthermore the respondent were asked about how can the reputation the borrower and his her family affect the bank financing decision relation the loan approval the following question asked how you think the reputation the borrower and their family could affect the decision making relation the provision the loan found that the respondent had commented nearly the same this question see table they had stated that bank are concerned with every single detail that relates borrower reputation they had explained that everything that may directly indirectly relate the borrower credit record ethic criminal act general attitude and behaviour can affect the bank financial decision particularly relation the loan provision addition the majority the respondent had pointed out that bank are also concerned with the credit reputation the borrower term commitment and general behaviour which also make the character the borrower very important for the bank financial decision therefore can recognized form the majority the respondent

mentioned issue are very important the bank financial decision relation the loan provision addition tremendously essential that borrower good business and personal reputation approved because the end the day the bank will establish relationship with customer which based trust and honesty therefore nearly all the respondent had explained that bank investigate the borrower ethic regarding the conduct any crime issue and regarding any action law against people which published daily the local news paper addition many respondent had added that jordan small country and through various relation with people thing can known about people and their misconduct behaviour and their general character and attitude for the credit information bank can obtain credit information about the borrower through their permitted access the central bank jordan cbj data base network yet important realize that the central bank jordan cbj report show the total amount credit that been taken borrower only above therefore any borrower that taken credit from bank total amount that below doe not appear the cbj data base report this may also increase the complication the information gap that many banker had talked about hence this can another reason why bank are hesitant finance smes particularly the small business because they can not obtain all the credit information about them since many small business obtain small amount credit which may not appear the bank during their credit investigation however the majority the respondent had stated that jordan some information can obtained only through relationship because many respondent had indicated that they believe that there information gap jordan due the lack data base thus people jordan particularly banker know each other they can gather information about their customer asking each other addition important note that big corporation are usually owned known people jordan who already have many bank competing give them loan which reduces the opportunity small business financed bank jordan nevertheless important recognize that for bank more convenient deal with large business because with large corporation the disclosure information much more available than the small business also many smes jordan are very sensitive about revealing any financial information because they are scared caught the tax collector nevertheless the respondent had indicated that they believe that the borrower credit history financial and credit net worth are very significant which turn will affect the bank financial decision more than the family name the borrower relation what some respondent had referred name lending see table other word these respondent not believe that name lending affect the bank financial decision and are more concerned with the credit related issue such the borrower financial net worth and trade reputation however these respondent had also stated that the borrower integrity and ethic are all important comparison with previously mentioned issue relation the bank financial decision and loan approval the other hand the majority the respondent had stated that many instance bank have some case name lending which mean that bank sometimes lend according the family name therefore some bank name lending known fact the country however not admitted openly all people furthermore most the respondent stated that many banker are interested certain extent the family name jordan other word financing people who come from well known family advantage some bank and may way another affect the bank financial decision positively but this not directly said during the interview only the respondent had admitted that straightforwardly whereas the other respondent had referred indirectly see table nevertheless well known that jordan tribal culture and there are certain tribe that are known the society which have power and fame therefore many people jordan are still very concerned with the family tribal image and issue result this issue make lot people committed because their family reputation and the social pressure that can exerted from the family and the same time the family itself one member misbehaved troubled therefore some people can not jeopardize their image reputation because their family name not for example paying their debt also many case people will anything repay the loan their family name will keep respectful image however this issue can not taken for granted bank conversely bank always asks for collateral and study loan proposal very well because the end they have control their risk manage their bank professionally and obey the central bank jordan cbj rule yet the respondent did not comment all this question see table table the banker opinion the borrower reputation and their family relation the loan approval percentage banker opinion believe that credit record reputation attitude are important the bank financial decision addition the family name however only admitted bluntly that there name lending and family name affect the bank financial decision positively believe that credit history character behaviour and reputation are more important than family name not believe name lending and effect the bank financing decision comment furthermore the respondent were asked they are concerned with specific managerial and entrepreneurial skill

manager become extremely critical for the bank financing decision particularly smes when most the time one man operation responsible about everything the company management finance marketing operation and employee and all the power and decision making since the bank have reliance the capability that one owner manager addition many respondent had stated that they are concerned not only with the

that the reason that make the international grant that come jordan support the smes sector comprise large number the smes the country qudah added such assistance really important the smie sector jordan furthermore qudah stated that jump started deliver their service the beginning addition qudah pointed out that jump financed from the government and the european union but the board director

furthermore the industrial smes sector had contributed the country gdp added that jordan there high budget deficit and the budget come from the running cost present most the budget deficit covered from the outside debt and grant that support jordan however these grant one point will stop therefore the establishment jump support the industrial sector and support the private sector contributing the improvement jordan economy overcome the deficit budget and develop economy qudah added that the main reason why jump concerned with the smes industrial sector because known that the industrial sector the engine for growth moreover qudah pointed out that when they had first established jump they had looked into many other experience that are the same field therefore they had benchmarked the international successful experience which were irish and tunisian one added that they had figured out that they had used the holistic approach qudah added that the holistic approach mean that the

only working with the existing business and not startup for the time being furthermore qudah had argued that the holistic approach the first concept behind the existence jump however the second concept for establishing jump support smes because qudah belief that jordan have have national organization that support smes and not keep depending the foreign aid programme and agency supporting this sector because national program sustainable program which can build institution that can deliver financial and technical support snes and this way the sustainability the service will assured what you think about the foreign aid donor programme supportl smes jordan and what would you say about the sustainability these programme relation their limited period time qudah belief that the foreign aid programme are good thing have the country however added that the disadvantage these programme supporting smes that each one them belongs different counterpart which result duplication effort and unnecessary repetition plan this the reason behind establishing jump national organization with focused target and strategic plan and for more assured sustainability support the smies jordan therefore jump created national institution that work umbrella for all the foreign aid donor programme qudah added that recently jump had discussed with the ministry planning that any foreign donor programme that come jordan support the industrial sme sector should come through jump and any new programme established support the industrial smes jump should counterpart order ensure that there are overlap

the most important financing scheme the loan guarantee scheme and new but added that are talking about the industrial sector unfortunately the loan guarantee not utilizing the industrial sector addition qudah added that the loan guarantee the jlgc not for the industrial sector also belief that there some weakness the mechanism because they ask the entrepreneur the bank and deal and finalize with the bank and then come the jordan loan guarantee corporation jlgc said are throwing the rabbit the arm the lion alone for example qudah belief that the jlgc should play more significant role supporting smes dealing with the enterprise directly and studying their case and give them the approval the guarantee and then send them the bank approved and guaranteed make powerful negotiation with bank furthermore qudah added that when first look the jlgc cover the collateral will assumed immediately that will solve the problem the collateral for the smes but unfortunately reality did not because the amount collateral required from smes stayed the same which supposed cover the loan added that the only thing that happened that the jlgc minimized the bank risk covering the the collateral but the problem the collateral smes stayed the same therefore qudah stated that they are trying jump tune that mechanism way ensure that the loan are being given the smes without the collateral complication bank jordan not approve taking the company asset collateral bank always demand pledging their personal real estate and bring personal guarantee which complicates thing more qudah added that jump the consultant prepare comprehensive development plan for the business staying the business around day this development plan can considered business plan which includes action plan for upgrading and also includes the financial ratio the project cash flow and the business income statement furthermore qudah added that jump they have two type financial grant one direct grant for the

qudah added that company had investment plan example then jump will offer this business around grant the total amount the investment plan part jump total upgrading plan for such business nowadays jump asking the company contribute the cost minimum the business financial need for further development qudah continued explaining that after making development plan and financial counseling the company where financially covered with financially from jump and from the owner the smes send the jlgc ready guaranteed the total finance that still needed for the company from the bank according agreement signed between jump and the jlgc this way qudah added that when sme the bank ask for loan will ready for better negotiation because already professional development plan made financial counseling financial grant from jump and accepted guarantee from the jlgc qudah added that jump they have technical assistance measurable evaluation and monitoring for feedback all level qudah argued that they are thinking jump coordination with the jlgc draw bilateral agreement with some bank order encourage such bank finance smes minimum collateral requirement and competitive interest rate qudah explained that they now supporting company from each sector which are now total company from various sector jordan added that they had chosen these smes according jump eligibility criterion explained that the beginning they had distributed questionnaire that match jump eligibility criterion but without the correspondent knowing and then the company that matched the eligibility criterion jump were selected from all the sector the economy what you think the idea developing specific financing institutefor smes qudah confirmed that doe not believe establishing specific financing institute for smes however argued that belief developing financing scheme within the bank themselves jordan because this way stated the bank can change their mentality towards smes and more encouraged finance smes what you think meant information gap you believe that have information gap jordan qudah pointed out that jordan there huge information gap that causing real problem argued that there are infonnation network the country the mean somebody looking for information about something somebody very hard get accurate and reliable information that can used build decision support decision making emphasized the point that there proper disclosure information about customer and that the main issue why bank are not encouraged finance smes particular explained that even the department statistic only provide around the data that they need jump for decision making what you think business angel and venture capitalist qudah argued that jordan there venture capital financing real meaning however added that required from jump provide venture capital financing but still doesnt provide the real meaning venture capital because collateral being required which doe not apply with the principle the real venture capital

and having free trade agreement with many country such many arab and european country and the then the impact tremendous added that for the arab country many like support their industry for example saudi arabia uae and kuwait these gulf country they sell their industry very cheap energy even many them are capable selling water and exporting jordan therefore our industrial firm are facing very severe competition from these country which are supporting their industry either low cost capital low cost energy and importing cheap labour from outside the gulf area for the agreement with the european country and the usa open new market for them but they have change lot their industrial norm their industrial capability the quality the product which will somehow costly the beginning for them but all those company who were able produce product the specification europe and the usa are now able export those country azar explained that can see from this angle that this blessing for jordan because will help the consumer jordan get better quality product however azar pointed out that jordan there problem the availability the raw material raw material and most the requirement industrial production have imported whether these requirement were interinediate raw material azar argued that the free trade agreement with europe and the usa that jordan made make very difficult attain the value added required for those commodity because azar belief that europe until now not actually fair with jordan added that europe not permit jordan consider the intermediate product that jordan take from other country with which already free trade agreement part the value added azar explained that did not mean the qualified industrial zone qiz because belief that qiz something for israel and belief that the qiz gimmick argued that the benefit that are achieved from the qiz are very few for jordan and product the qiz should not considered domestic export they are not said mean they are somehow transit export they had not been integrated the jordan economy the government did not help and the usa very severe against integrating them jordan because they want impose pressure the jordan industry deal with israel furthermore azar added that this not the issue because now jordan peace agreement with israel but the problem that any plant industrial firm that deal with israel will not able export most the arab country added that this true particularly the basic market for jordan like iraq and syria and some other arab country azar added that the usa very biased their free trade agreement against jordan the usa did not include the factory that are the qiz given reduction the tax the usa until these factory pas year besides added that for example somebody produce clothing outside the qiz even though jordan free trade agreement with the usa still these product will not have the reduction the custom duty the usa that given other industry that not have something similar them the qiz azar belief that there are mixed impact regarding having these new arrangement with the world economy but stated that jordan can not but accept that part the global economy not necessity much the arab weakness have common market said have had common market the arab world then thing will different from the point view that will able export them well import from them and from the capability negotiating better deal with europe and the usa and other country the world where try make free trade agreement are always the weak position because the weakness our economy however masri pointed out that generally private sector open society and open economy are vital issue for jordan and should there the future and now masri argued that since the world going that direction can not isolate ourselves the other hand tabba pointed out that some way jordan economy not ready for such agreement added that smes were not ready and some them were affected negatively tabba stated that before reaching such agreement the local industry should have been more prepared and supported from the government for example some custom exemption should made some the input material for the production process and some the raw material for the local smes addition training should given when free trade agreement are signed the local can compete fair level tabba had added that specially with the wto many business were affected negatively added that belief that revision for the condition should arranged and give our local smes break offering them indirect protection the government should study the effect such agreement many aspect particularly the local industry and not only doing them for the sake politics and globalization said can not dig deep the industry can not compete and the energy very costly have lack water there high cost production and high cost labour force and can country service nevertheless halaiqah argued that the whole argument not valid regarding that are not ready for these agreement and such agreement had affected the smes negatively according some smes owner perception not valid argued that jordan can not live isolation these day said you can not just close your door and wait added that jordan been proactive country all sector all level politically socially economically and addition indicated that because the lack resource jordan make profile country modernization and liberalization said this the strength jordan are difficult region furthermore halaiqah continued saying let analyze the agreement that jordan expluined that for example the agreement with europe did not change the trade situation added that our export from europe are within the natural growth are still importing from europe what need whether have agreement not addition halaiqah continued his argument saying that the european product are expensive because the euro and some other factor therefore jordan import mainly from europe capital good machinery car sophisticated equipment addition the grain that needed for our food fact halaiqah see that these thing not affect these small and medium industry jordan moreover halaiqah commented jordan agreement with the united state saying the whole jordan than market very small state the united state added that jordan very small market not have critical mass therefore the united state care about big country like india russia iran and china said jordan very small country mean the whole consumption jordan than state the united state also look what are importing from the united state again are not importing anything that similar the product the small and medium industry jordan halaiqah added that jordan import from the united state thing such grain machinery plane and military requirement therefore halaiqah belief that very little such import will actually harm small and medium industry jordan the other hand halaiqah added that the most important thing this argument the arab free trade area explained that jordan interest the arab market because per cent trade are with the arab country said this per cent mean that jordan have two way traffic had explained that jordan want export product the gulf country such saudi arabia any other gulf country then jordan open minded and allow two way traffic business otherwise will stuck dilemma therefore halaiqah explained that jordanian people have take the national interest this context and not the individual interest furthermore halaiqah added that have interest exporting our product addition our interest exporting our human product said many jordanian are working there just can not say want export product them but want close door the import these country this stupid and doesnt work however halaiqah belief that there point there regarding the competition explained that there competition with some the arab country especially saudi arabia and some other neighboring country that can affect the local smes for various reason explained that some the arab country the energy and the water are very cheap and there lot government subsidy while jordan such thing are expensive and increase the cost production the producer which make some them unable compete halaiqah said yes agree that there effect impact the small and medium industry but here again the national interest rather than the sector interest added that the fact that our export are growing and are recording high positive growth our export should encouragement for the local investor improve their business said think the sky the limit and there very obvious advantage and can recognized many our industry halaiqah added that when the saudi product started come jordan the local industry realized how much the saudi product are good and high quality term many thing including the packaging which excellent many the local industry had improved because such competition therefore competition good for development perhaps added that there negative impact some smes however not seriously harming the industry especially when other factor and other sector are taken into consideration for the import from country such the far east and china halaiqah argued that jordan had never signed agreement with these country said didnt sign agreement didnt give them any preferential treatment however competition there therefore have introduced some law like the protection law the national production law such law created counter any negative impact coming from the excess import these country nevertheless halaiqah the end said with country where signed agreement dont see that the argument valid but the arab agreement yes there might some little harm but had said previously two way traffic theodotou said for big corporation very good however some smes are not ready yet however some smes have benefited from the qiz need time conversely halawani added that although such agreement give great opportunity for jordanian export still such agreement had some disadvantageous effect some industry explained that such agreement result the decrease the complete removal the custom the jordanian import which had left many local industry disadvantage because they have face very high competition from these import that entered the country these agreement therefore this had left some the local industry with great challenge develop themselves technically and managerially able compete and survive which smessectors you think should targeted azar pointed out that many people would probably say the pharmaceutical industry because they have proved that they are capable penetrating many market africa asia europe and had started recently the usa therefore this sector look very promising for almasri argued for the service sector and the manufacturing moreover tabba had another opinion explained that have target the industry that have the capability employing jordanian labour decrease the level unemployment the country addition the industry that can cover the local market need and afterwards see there potential exporting industry tabba stated that the only way cover the deficit jordan balance trade start having exporting industry moreover halaiqah explained that would very difficult target one sector but belief that there are few sector which need help continued saying that after the american occupation iraq most the industry stopped exporting iraq and they suffered badly however after month they resumed exporting iraq but much lower level because the security situation and the payment method halaiqah had added that the private sector jordan still exporting iraq said exporting done through the private sector the private sector addition added think probably are doing million dollar year from the small and medium size sector think this sector hit badly the recent war iraq however explained that although the past lot industry had relied heavily the iraqi market many nowadays had managed find other market also the mechanical industry and maintenance related industry are good sector target and there great need for such sector jordan furthermore halaiqah added that there are some sector that are already saturated jordan such the down stream industry argued that such industry are managed properly they will really good halaiqah explained that the down stream industry mean the industry that are based our raw material the dead sea and other place added that the chemical and the assembly industry have great chance said assembly car auto industry will theodotou belief that should not only focus one sector however some sector like the olive oil trade industry clothing tourism and can interesting sector target jordan moreover halawani pointed out that the finance and credit programme should available for all the industry all sector and not directed only one particular sector unless there essential need prioritize because the tremendous increase the loan demand from the smes financing programme that case priority should given the industry that have the potential for exporting the industry that are collapsing what you think about the foreign aid donor programme supporting smes jordan and what would you say about the sustainabilit these programme relation their limited period time azar indicated that some them were effective certain area however azar stated that can not say generally that these programme were effective wanted them added that they are widely spread however some them are focused and these had resulted good impact the industry and are being efficient the unfocused one are just being repetition still very few these program are doing something for training such technical managerial marketing and quality control training azar explained that the chamber industry they are trying their best this matter make the local industry able compete both the international and the local market for the sustainability these programme azar pointed out those smes jordan need special attention from all aspect financially technically managerially addition tabba had indicated that the people who were able reach these programme and were aware their existence had benefited however for the sustainability these program they need stay jordan for longer period time furthermore halaiqah indicated that the donor programme generally are good added that they did help jordan industrial sector general however halalqah think that ended with story duplicity probably which there are duplication effort and the real problem were not really targeted added that sometimes every programme just want spend the money there lack coordination between these fund also sometimes there duplicity and sometimes there target all moreover halaiqah explained that tried something about this issue when minister such having umbrella which act steering committee high council for all these donor and make some job specification for each fund not have any duplication halaiqah said are not doing that hope that they are doing now should benefit from these fund the maximum halaiqah explained that lot money for consultancy for study and the high salary for the foreign consultant added that the end the day when million euro dollar are going for particular project reality only half spent development building capacity the running cost include the high salary and the research addition halaiqah explained that there should coordination between these programme use their fund efficiently also specific franiework should drawn for them for example will known that ejada targeting particular sector and jump targeting another sector and the same thing with the usaid amir programme and the japanese unit where they target various sector this way there will pool resource which efficiently used for the sustainability these programme halaiqah commented that such programme are not sustainable explained that they will finish the point when the fund are over said but hope can convince some donor refresh renew some the program light their success moreover halaiqah added that nowadays grant are not easy get and have rely our resource and our capability sustain such programme halaiqah belief that easy get any money from new donor therefore had suggested that partnership between the govemment and the private sector should built and see how these programme can sustained evaluating the successful programme and where the others went wrong addition halaiqah belief that the government should take the initiative having core unit fund and the same time the private sector again should chip into that can sustain the program for theodotou she said programme can help they are used properly halawani indicated that there are several foreign donor programme jordan that support the industrial small and medium enterprise various way added that some these programme cover the cost the consultancy service which they provide many sni different level such managerial financial technical and marketing level furthermore halawani argued that many these programme had played major role increasing the competition ability for many industrial organization that had benefited from the service these program nevertheless these programme did not give any direct financial support for smes finance for example buying machinery new production line however ejada had created programme that guarantee the loan for smes through the jlgc after realizing the decrease the bank lending rate for smes jordan for the sustainability these program halawani argued that these programme come jordan for restricted period time for that reason the government jordan had established domestic programme called the jordan upgrading modernization program jump which doe not have limited period time and offer various service for smes have you any reason believe that the government intervention could improve and enhance the access smes various source finance what forin should any government intervention take azar belief that government intervention needed added that the industry not need direct intervention their work however what are needed from the government are regulation that enable the local industry compete with the international market and responsible for the legal issue help the industry penetrate other market outside jordan addition masri stated that belief that there should basic interference the finance and not interference the business because all the finance and grant that come jordan through the government therefore when through the government mean that the government role nevertheless mash argued that the government interfere putting the proper law and law help the smes sector added that the government should give the incentive whether are talking about custom tax whether are talking about different thing said this intervention very important like they for the foreign investment and they make regulation masri added that soon they have give these small industry much more incentive and much more care they are able compete with the international investment and not affected negatively the local big company halaiqah stated that belief government intervention explained that from his experience belief that small and medium industry jordan not have the proper access cheap finance reasonable finance addition halajqah added that most smes especially the small enterprise are run people who are not influential and probably are not highly educated said they depend their arm they depend their muscle rather than their access moreover halaiqah emphasized that the government intervention extremely important nevertheless halaiqah had suggested that the government could chip some money added that could get some grant and financial assistance from donor and this facility could run the industrial development bank idb the commercial bank but according certain criterion had argued that can allocate proper fund and increase that from donor and put the commercial bank lower the interest rate and spread knowledge people that this facility extend finance certain criterion but the same time halaiqah explained that have make sure that the money channeled the right direction theodotou argued that depends how you would define government intervention she added that there are various stage that and there are several way doing that smaller economy where the government really focusing reform and really big component pushing the country forward and helping the economy making sound economic decision the government leadership level theodotou think that the government support would not considered intervention would support and encouragement that vital furthermore she said for example come this sme blueprint that actually encouraged tasked the ministry planning conjunction with the central bank and the finance committee the national agenda definitely encouragement for the government critical support the market way into realizing own potential therefore theodotou belief that the government provides the right infrastructure into the road halawani argued that the government vital role supporting the small and medium industry jordan and increasing the source finance that can available smes jordan added that mentioned previously the government had played major role establishing the jordan loan guarantee corporation jlgq and the jordan upgrading modernization programme jump furthermore halawani belief that there are still plenty thing that need developed and supported the government enhance the availability essential programme and effective tool for smes jordan what would you say about the lack official definition the countryfor smes azar pointed out that jordan depends the international classification that respect which belief not bad added that generally speaking the international specification accepted the official the government are not concerned have specific definition fro the industry particularly for smes although azar added that important have official definition the country because explained that jordan part the global world azar stated that clear definition needed particularly when the country need talk with the international organization fro example the world bank the imf the asian investment bank the european investment bank and even the islamic bank the gulf such bank and organization can offer good support and financial assistance develop the local industry way that can develop certain concept such the marketing capability and training which are very important the industry particularly country like jordan that non oil producing country jordan getting lot help nowadays for such matter but not sufficient for the purpose developing those industry and not directed properly masri argued that before talk about smes should define what are talking about because belief that what small outside jordan may considered medium large jordan vice versa went say that there clear definition jordan and the different part the country small industry amman different than small industry mafrak the north badia tabba had stated that jordan there official definition the country and this issue make for confusion and some complication belief that important have definition and include the definition the handicraft sector halaiqah stated that official definition for snes absolutely important explained that can build our plan and strategy such definition and can target where the support should theodotou said that not surprise for emerging economy like jordan she added that number other organization and number other economy have also tried define smes for example have done some research inhouse with looking and united nation definition from other country including central and western europe area all these country also have had challenge defining smes however some them have been more successful than others nevertheless jordan the definition sme pertains only the number employee however she added that most the country that they have looked for example hungary poland czech republic slovakia and slovenia most central and eastern europe this one the two criterion but there second criterion that pertains the amount sale sale local currency another key driver that show not only the number people but also the amount profit the revenue that these organization are earning she said you could have small company with two people that making much higher revenue than company with ten people that can profitable moreover theodotou indicated that the fact that there fonnal definition jordan not prevented bank creating expanding the definition into making more meaningful for their own risk capital than profitability she said most the bank that have talked have taken the number employee and they expand addition they have sort facility exposure annual revenue stream sale these are some the criterion heard may sound like hurdle but not dont think halawani agreed that there official definition for sni jordan but recently committee had been formed from the private and the public sector addition the chamber industry order decide specific and official definition for snues the country furthennore halawani argued that the lack single and official definition the country had resulted the absence clear strategy and government policy that support small and medium industry the country also the lack definition had resulted providing the smes with any exemption benefit comparison the large enterprise moreover halawani added that the lack official definition had made the foreign donor programme that support smies depend their own definition what you think meant information gap you believe that have information gap jordan azar stated that have huge information gap jordan from all aspect starting from some smes that not have financial record which make bank very hesitant give them finance and ending with gathering information data and number for academic purpose masri argued that jordan there information gap the small industry themselves added that there information gap the government organization and within the social sector there connection between the government organization about the people that they support for example which result duplication thing tabba confirmed that have information gap jordan the reason behind that that there coordination between the government organization the country for example investor want know about particular financial ratio the country the central bank jordan cbj give certain number and the department statistic give totally different number for the same thing addition the ministry finance will also have different number for the same ratio and this very confusing for the investor not knowing which organization trust and from where get the right and accurate information moreover jordan there always secrecy revealing information whether organization individual therefore the information gap make lot problem all level and from various point view theodotou belief that the gap the process the information both side smes not know where addition smes need become more sophisticated which mean smes need have track record halawani argued that the small and medium industry jordan suffers from information gap all level whether the local level the international level especially compared with the smes the more developed and industrial country your opinion what are the thing that need changed the banking credit policy develop the jordanian smes sector azar indicated that bank are the major source fund nevertheless had argued that the financial liquidity available for some company owner came from stock that they had purchased the stock exchange long time ago when the price share were very low however when the price share had increased these people who sold their share ended with good sum money finance their own business that helped them financing themselves with good portion their requirement the last few year but that doe not take the place the bank because the long term they not have any source finance for the bank that need develop the industry first azar had explained moreover added that the industry jordan need more organized financially and managerially addition the development production wise marketing wise and quality control wise establish themselves industry that can sustain existence that very important the bank deal with industry that are reliable and have potential the industry however because the information gap the bank are unable make the right judgment about the good industry therefore azar argued that need concentrate these area first make these industry more capable talking more strongly the financial institution masri suggested some solution similar what done for the housing loan argued that there could some bank one bank government organization that can make general guarantee for the bank encourage them give such loan and try make the condition the loan according the business itself the business viable and the risk are minimized they should give guarantee but the bank give such guarantee they also need guarantee halaiqah stated that the credit policy the bank not need changed because this private sector and there flexibility the law however belief that the banking sector restructure financial tool halaiqah added that the credit policy there and loan can given credible people but said have sort create something longer term halaiqah explained saying that government tool government unit government fund probably would enhance the bank take such new tool but bank have lot fund and there are lot deposit and lot money coming jordan said therefore bank are making easy money and they are lazy halaiqah stated that have come with incentive carrot enhance the bank get into such area theodotou commented this question saying that most importantly there understanding from the bank that they are thinking building their sme sale business the front office that they have the capacity the back office sustain that growth she had explained that this mean that they have have the right policy imposed including primarily credit policy addition the right policy regarding issue such how doe the process work once the customer walk into bank and the credit officer take information what happens after that how that information processed internally who touch how long doe take when doe the underwriter come help make the decision when the customer get information with regard the status their application when doe the loan hit the bank book when doe the money get dispersed and then coming the servicing the loan she added bank have make sound decision and sound decision requires sound credit policy that specific smes she said the bottom line bank are building their sme lending they need consider building enhancing their credit policy towards the particular sme need halawani argued that there are several requirement that need considered the banking credit policy regarding the development smes which are follows increase the volume the credit facility and the type credit way that match the special need and requirement the industrial sector particularly the small and medium industry decrease much possible the requirement and the level collateral required for the loan purpose suggesting considering the machinery and the industrial production line part the required collateral for loan approval study the possibility decreasing the interest rate charged the bank loan develop the consultancy and the directing facility that are done bank regarding issue such the feasibility study the work schedule and plan and the eligibility criterion for the loan provision increase the marketing level and the knowledge the credit program that are available jordan for smes moreover mentioned ali the minister planning the newspaper that some bank jordan started realise the importance smes and the advantage obtained fund are given smes therefore some bank started have plan for dealing with smes however she added that some bank still not have the willingness deal with this sector what would you say about the loan guarantee scheme jordan and what way you think these scheme could affect the competition between bank azar stated that the jlgc good thing but ability are very limited they can not guarantee large sum money masri stated that these programme are performing well nevertheless added saying that the only shortcoming that not qualified say but hear about that there good percentage the money are going study and salary highest case but the end they are doing improving and getting service develop the small sector however these are some complaint hear but dont know them nuaimat blueprint guide jordanian bank for financing smes the jordan time november for the effect bank competition masri argued that the loan guarantee programme are not affecting competition between bank because bank are getting bit hesitant give such loan since these small industry not have lot guarantee give the bank and bank not give facility without guarantee bank are not easy they always ask about guarantee and they not evaluate the prospect the work and what are the risk there they aim cover all the risk instead making study that why the start ups can not start from bank the government organization are helping this matter for example the engineer association doing lot for the engineer start such business they give loan buy equipment buy facility and halawani indicated that the industrial organization jordan particularly the small and medium enterprise face great difficulty having collateral that are needed get bank loan for that reason the loan guarantee scheme jordan were created through the jordan loan guarantee corporation jlgc where the government jordan had major contribution this establishment through the central bank jordan cbj added that the jlgc main aim guarantee certain amount loan that offered some business through the bank and the financial institution whether the loan were for the purpose expansion development the creation new project addition added that the jlgc cover the credit risk for certain export through special guarantee programme what way you you think that these scheme could affect the competition between bank halawani argued that the loan guarantee system jordan had caused increase competition between the commercial bank particularly enhancing the quality service and relatively simplifying the bank procedure addition halawani drew attention the decrease the interest rate that are charged loan the past five year added that the past five year the interest rate charged credit decreased from what would you say about the larger enterprise comparison smes jordan tabba pointed out that there are large enterprise jordan except the traditional one the phosphate and potash the international standard for large enterprise halawani pointed out that the jordanian industry that are classified large enterprise which employ more than employee are very limited jordan only the total amount the jordanian industry addition halawani added that such large enterprise are concentrated the chemical engineering clothing and pharmaceutical industry therefore comparison with the smes large enterprise jordan have higher managerial financial and marketing capability and sophistication addition large enterprise contribute for more than the domestic export that reach various international and arabic market what you think the idea developing specific financing institittefor smes tabba emphasized that would very good idea have special bank for smes nevertheless halaiqah said not sure need reinvent the wheel and not sure need specific institute extend finance the snees halaiqah had explained that have review our current situation and probably improving make more efficient therefore belief that new restructuring needed particularly regarding the role the industrial development bank idb and the government initiative furthermore halaiqah suggested establishing core fund partnership with the private sector belief that with all these initiative could probably enough therefore halaiqah doe not think need specific financing institute and doe not think the government the fund halawani argued that this very good and important idea belief that there urgent need for the establishment special financial institute that specializes providing financial and credit facility that match the special characteristic and need the smes jordan added institute that also facilitates the needed loan provision and provides the support for the sni whether these loan were for the creation new project for the development and expansion the existing project even for the rescue the collapsing industry what you think the idea the development secondary marketfor smes tabba pointed out that the smes jordan need lot support and help from all aspect secondary market good idea but added that very early talk about such thing smes still need have solid foundation for their existence and development many area before talking about secondary market the other hand halawani indicated that great idea because having secondary market for smes will develop the smes and increase volume trading and encourage various investor invest them how can seed capital available smes jordan halawani explained that seed capital can available smes through special programme from the commercial bank that can accommodate the need and the special characteristic the smes especially the early stage their establishment however bank can not this alone government support needed addition the international financial organization support and the donor programme order provide the needed facility and guarantee what would you say about advantagesidisadvantages venture capitalist and business angel relation smesfinancing halawani pointed out that there great need for establishing new source finance and financial tool for smes such venture capital and business angel that are available smes many developing country these thing can provide smes with the needed capital liquidity for establishment expansion give smes the opportunity develop having another source finance available the case jordan halawani explained that the commercial bank not have venture capital furthermore added that the industrial development bank idb had negative experience with the venture capital finance however nowadays there are some effort develop venture capital jordan summary some the policy maker argued about the main problem that face smes jordan particularly the manufacturing sector azar explained that the problem that face snihes are different from one sector another and from one business another furthermore azar emphasized very important point when commented the finance gap jordan had added that many smes are content what they have being little without any vision therefore order develop they have change their vision and mentality addition tabba indicated that jordan lack professional and skillful handicraftsmen this back the culture and mentality the society that this type work not prestigious and indicates low class that relates shame being carpenter plumber ironworker not something proud jordan but the same time all the people can not survive without them furthermore both azar and masri added that the main problem within the small industry that many them not have the marketing skill and the financial ability market themselves their product good way therefore there creativity their business because they lack strategic planning for example some the business succeeded producing certain product many them keep producing the same thing without any planning for further innovation creativity azar explained that the country there risk capital which venture capital added that when smes need loan from the bank they have give much trying convince the bank that they are able repay the loan they have give the bank high collateral such land house personal guarantee azar continued explaining that bank are not blamed because the general perspective the banking sector the country bad because the cultural mentality where many people look the bank activity against their religious belief because bank are like usurer addition the government the civil servant believe that the private sector should not make profit and doe should penalized therefore azar added that had been recognized that the income tax bank and insurance company who are supposed the agency who provide capital for the development and growth but the government and the legal system are against bank and insurance company according azar however azar explained that doe not blame the government the bank but blame the whole system the country addition the industrialist the country not have awareness and good record prove the bank that they are improving have good quality definite market this the type system that need improved regarding the managerial the marketing and the quality control also many the smes not have any financial record account record because they are trying evade tax because they are being taxed the raw material however nowadays good part the raw material being exempted but not all the past year they were paying tax everything and even now there are new tax imposed the sale which not value added tax these issue not encourage both the industry and the financier addition the government crucial situation because many people try evade tax also tabba added that most the smes jordan have major problem which are they not have the facility export jordan small market and world globalization and the vvto agreement addition the new production custom tariff smes need backed with soft loan and know what these smes are heading for their future tabba added that they want stay the same they want develop more tabba explained the reason behind these problem added that the majority the smes jordan are family enterprise which are very valuable for their owner and for their dignity most the smes carry the name and the history the family however they are very closed circuit therefore they not release any secret addition added that they not want expand develop because they not want bank any other organization because they not want reveal their secret much the sni are considered the backbone the economy jordan they still need knowledge awareness and help enable them export and part the outside market most smes the country are not connected with the internet tabba added that the new generation are trying more exposed and modernized however the new generation still need motivated and supported nevertheless tabba indicated that smes jordan face the problem the high cost production added that smes need import the raw material and because their limited work and their small industry they not get the benefit discount and offer that are given the big enterprise addition tabbaa indicated that smes jordan need training but the major problem that face smes jordan the finance issue tabba stated bluntly that the banking sector jordan not have high opinion about smes said bank not respect smes bank always complicate thing and require high collateral and ask for personal guarantee from the well known and rich people guarantee the loan for the snies addition bank not give priority for the potential success project the contrary they care more about the collateral and the guarantee therefore tabba emphasized that unfortunately there are chance for the entrepreneur start survive jordan tabba argued that sad say that even the central bank jordan cbj which supposed the father bank for all bank not playing any clear role that oblige bank deal fairly with the new entrepreneur and smes the cbj should oblige bank put different finance condition for the smes and the entrepreneur that match their need and ability which different than the ability the big enterprise jordan that have been established year ago more and are given loan trusting the name their owner tabba added that the reality about the bank jordan that they not want have headache dealing with the small industry and the entrepreneur added that bank only like deal with the big name the country that own the big corporation which are very limited group jordan said such known and rich people can obtain million jds from any bank just making phone call and signing peace paper tabba suggested that part the bank duty the country make special department for financing smes and entrepreneur added that nowadays bank have special department for the bad debt and for consumer loan with very low interest rate and comfortable installment tabba added that bank always say that they want eliminate their credit risk avoiding the financial centralization within the same corporation that are owned certain family the country however bank are still financing the same known people who own the big corporation the country this very risky especially one these big corporation collapse furthennore tabba indicated that the bank employee mentality should change towards smes and entrepreneur when they approach them for loan added that the young entrepreneur and the new graduate should supported order start their own project and not judged hisher father and family name and credit history tabba added that collaboration between the financial institution should made have role the development the country both level socially and economically tabba pointed out that jordan have imbalance several issue there are problem unemployment and poverty addition the financial ability the jordanian government are very limited but the other hand the major big bank the country have huge amount saving and have high liquidity ratio also the private sector have good sum money and fine investment hence why can not bank have some their loan directed smes and the same time continue their investment and lending the big corporation but give smes and small entrepreneur chance start grow and develop moreover tabba argued that jordan smes are very important the economic development particularly country like jordan that doe not have natural resource and have other choice but depend good educated and trained human resource therefore tabba stated that attention should paid this sector particularly from bank the bank credit policy should change support the more moreover theodotou explained that their work the fsvc related indirectly smes she added that one their key focal point their mandate help bank strengthening their relationship with smes addressing smes customer need whether through service product furthermore she added that they are the process building blueprint theodotou indicated that state best practice that can used bank course the kingdom adopt and adapt into their own strategy building the sme business relationship nevertheless theodotou emphasized key focal point which the fsvc jordan would like highlight that sni are risky default she argued that especially the younger company are riskier because they have not built the track record the business environment however she pointed out that bank can look smes from holistic perspective having the complete relationship lending which bank can earn interest fee from the loan but also they can earn fee income from having the deposit account the saving account the letter credit the treasure margin that pay the service that small company the bank therefore bank will looking the complete relationship opposed only just one two risky loan over here and other fee income the other end for that reason one the fsvc key message trying communicate and expand looking smes customer with complete relationship need that will bring for bank both fee income and interest theodotou explained that they have done year ago the sort focus group where they had talked with smes hear some their concern the main problem that have mentioned were issue related the bank when they need access finance addition smes have concern about the difficult environment collateral another key issue moreover the lack sophistication the credit officer level that translates the fact that the credit officer can not really make decision the credit officer doe not have the upper hand enough decision making capacity which she can make decision let the customer know where the process going how long will take theodotou went say that this what they have heard from smes year ago she think this begun change slightly because the specific training that happening the credit officer help them become more attuned the need the smes addition she added that the key message that heard from the banker that smes are not sophisticated enough provide appropriate financial statement the light the above can conclude that the attitude the islamic bank manager towards smes generally similar that the commercial bank but the real difference occur amongst the policy maker and the foreign aid programme manager will proceed the next chapter

emerged chapter and however noteworthy mention that the result this study can not generalized because the limited size the sample the research and the restricted data also each country own economic cultural and social background that can affect smes finance therefore the result this research can not generalized applicable other developing country the finance gap facing the manufacturing smes jordan the finance gap can either debt equity gap the interview analysis show that can not say that there debt gap jordan facing the sni however can say that there are some difficulty and high level

bank addition they believe that all the support the country whether from bank the regulator are directed the larger enterprise research finding show that policy maker believe the discrepancy between the large enterprise and the jordan because the large firm the country have higher managerial financial and marketing capability addition they are manufacturing more sophisticated and advanced which give them advantage everything furthermore found that many banker believe that large corporation particularly the public share holding company are getting the best service and facility because they are highly regulated and transparent comparison smes many respondent during the research interview had indicated that smes are very important the development jordan economy and very big part the commercial activity jordan are done the smes yet many banker and policy maker pointed out that smees jordan are not able get the best service and finance from bank these day function three thing first the lack disclosure snees all level because most the jordan have poor financial management which result various financial problem particularly mismatching maturity secondly many bank jordan prefer not deal with smes because more time consuming and difficult manage relationship with smie due the lack transparency and the end not rewarding thirdly bank consider smees very risky the effectiveness the loan guarantee scheme relation smes finance jordan the main finding show that the smes respondent had negative reaction towards the loan guarantee scheme jordan particularly towards the jordan loan guarantee corporation jlgc and believe that loan guarantee scheme are expensive complicated and more demanding than bank furthermore the research finding show that the banker had shown positive attitude towards the jordan loan guarantee corporation jlgc where had shown negative attitude towards the jlgc addition found that the banker believe that loan guarantee scheme not affect competition between bank and only the banker believe that loan guarantee scheme may create distortion however the snees respondent believe that loan guarantee scheme not affect competition between bank and only them believe doe found that many policy maker believe that need work more jordan loan guarantee scheme because they believe that the jlgc adding another layer conditionality top the condition that the bank are requiring from smes which turn complicates the thing more addition the jlgc very selective their loan and are always targeting the most secure project which not add any advantage the smees the role the foreign aid programme relation smes jordan found that the smees respondent showed negative attitude and have pessimistic vision towards the foreign aid programme that come jordan support smes and only the sni respondent revealed positive reaction conversely the main finding show that the banker had positive attitude towards the foreign aid programme supporting smes jordan revealed negative attitude towards the foreign aid programme supporting sni jordan the main finding the research show that some policy maker believe that these programme are generally good however there duplication effort and lack coordination found that there one authoritative source from the jordanian side that organizes and directs these programme avoid duplication effort therefore thing are seen not well coordinated and there collaboration between programme found that many policy maker believe that the government did not succeed until now putting one umbrella that can manage and supervise these programme get the best out them the bank eligibility criterion towards smes jordan the main finding the study show that the bank jordan finance however each bank own eligibility criterion that they follow not only when financing but also when making any financial decision each bank criterion are based internal credit policy the internal credit policy all bank jordan are drawn within the central bank jordan cbj regulation although each bank his own eligibility criterion that they follow when financing yet all the respondent had mentioned nearly the same thing that they usually require look when financing smes found that the vast majority the bank look the same thing when making financing decision bank are concerned mainly with the following the past record the finance term the high net worth wealth the borrower the adequacy cash flow repay the loan and the adequacy profitability repay the interest the feasibility study for the business the future projection the collateral the risk the reason behind the loan the market demand for the business the performance the company the competition the enterprise the skill and experience the borrower the project and the good management moreover bank look the customer integrity reputation and creditworthiness but each bank give more weight some issue than others their financing decision the research finding indicate that most bank are concerned lot about the cash flow past record and collateral more than anything else when financing smes because the end the bank want the loan and interest paid found that the bank believe that past record are very important and affect the bank financing decision the bank believe that cash flow are extremely important and affect the bank financing decision addition found that the bank believe that collateral tremendously important their financing decision the bank believe that important but there are other thing that are more important and are priority the bank financing decision found that many bank hesitate finance startup only the bank for two reason one the lack collateral secondly the unavailability track record collateral very reasonable principle jordan because the information gap existence collateral make bank safer however found hat the smes respondent showed negative attitude and pessimism regarding the principle collateral required bank many smes not have collateral are sensitive towards the collateral principle particularly when bank require the pledging personal house exert social pressure the borrower the research main finding show that bank believe that smes jordan not know how talk bank the majority the smies are not financially sophisticated and the jordanian law some the company not have have proper financial statement such the family business company and the sole proprietorship most smes are this kind but bank can not always make financing decision for these smes without proper financial statement therefore the bank that case depends the credit history these people smes owner however jordan general there lack information and information gathered through personal relationship and knowing people all around the country the research finding show that the business plan audited financial statement and the projection cash flow are important the bank from sophisticated and theoretical view but practice and generally speaking jordan these thing are either not done and people are not familiar with such the business plan they are done for tax purpose therefore not trusted such the audited financial statement and the projection cash flow although the banker believe that business plan very important prerequisite for obtaining finance still they believe that with smees they not expect see business plan found that the smees respondent not believe the importance business plan neither for obtaining finance nor for the business itself and the smes respondent believe that audited financial statement are not important addition found that the banker believe that audited financial statement are generally important but are not trusted and are not vital for the loan provision the family name very important jordan and there are case name lending but not stated directly bank found that only the banker admitted bluntly that there name lending and family name affect the bank financial decision positively noteworthy realize that bank jordan are the main source finance for addition some ngo but people still mix between smes finance and microfinance issue found that the sni respondent did not encourage the idea developing specific financing institute for smes which indicates they are satisfied with bank jordan however found that the banker did not encourage the idea and only the banker believe that great suggestion develop specific financing institute for smes equity finance and smes jordan the research main finding show that the respondent use their own money the main source equity finance and the smes respondent use their own money and their retained profit only the smes respondent use their own money and issuance stock equity capital furthermore found that all the smes respondent showed negative attitude and great surprise towards asking about their opinion towards establishing secondary market for smes such the alternative investment market aim the addition found that the banker did not believe that creating secondary market for smes good idea because smes jordan are primitive small not financially sophisticated and have huge information gap found that policy maker believe that secondary market and securitizations very important but the large corporation however within the size the smes not good idea furthermore found that all the smes respondent did not show any understanding awareness and knowledge some equity possibility that can available jordan such venture capitalist business angel convertible loan and seed capital nevertheless the banker interview analysis show that the banker stated that there are venture capital their bank and jordan for smes commented that there seed capital available jordan for smes and not have convertible loan and all believed not good idea for smes additionally found that the banker had indicated that they believe that smes source equity either their personal fund loan from family and friend both moreover found from the analysis the banker interview that the smees their personal money and smes their personal money and loan from relative and friend according the banker point view noteworthy realize from the main finding the research that jordan there mechanism for providing equity for smees but the same time there demand for from still need have solid foundation for their existence and development many area before talking about secondary market according the majority the people opinion islamic finance and smes jordan found that the banker believe that islamic finance can helpful for smes other business from religious point view and not from financial banking point view because islamic finance can only provided the licensed islamic bank jordan which are two jordan one bank called the jordan islamic bank jib and the other called the islamic international arab bank iiab therefore found that both interviewee iiab and jib had pointed out that islamic finance helpful not only for smes but part our daily life that muslim people should practise everything according the islamic shan law found that the majority the respondent had never used islamic finance before thought about the reason either because some them believe that expensive because they have not thought about although been realized during the interview that when smes owner manager were asked about islamic finance they all immediately show positive reaction and appears that many them believe principle because part the majority religion jordan moreover their business not practised however found that the development and employment fund def the borrower def borrow the base the islamic murabaha they believe the islamic principle part their religion the intervene the government relation smes finance jordan found that the banker believe government intervention however there were various suggestion this matter for example some banker believe that government intervention should indirect way the regulatory framework only order enhance the disclosure information and the level transparency they believe that the government should impose disclosure and accounting standard addition banker suggested that the government support should reducing the cost financing the snees lowering the interest rate charged smes some banker stated that the smees jordan are difficult situation and are facing lot unfair competition particularly the small business addition they added that small business jordan are facing competition from the large enterprise and even from the micro business that are smaller than them therefore the government should support this sector they had suggested that they can make some government subsidy for the small business jordan the government support should reducing the cost financing the snees lowering the interest rate charged smes but this debatable because depends the government financial situation the other hand found that the banker not believe government intervention because they believe that access finance special kind effort and bank are private sector and thing should left the market force found that the smees respondent not believe the government intervention particularly the manufacturing sector because some them believe that the government will make thing more complicated and demanding especially towards inspection and tax issue furthermore found that the smes respondent believe government intervention but should within the regulatory and legislation form making regulation more flexible and decreasing the bureaucracy level decision this percentage given the president the development and employment fund def during the interview making addition many had argued that the government intervention should the provision the infrastructure providing water land and energy lower rate for the manufacturing sector other word lowering the cost production particularly for the manufacturing sector found that many policy maker believe that government intervention should involve coordination and monitoring but not interfering with the source finance addition the interviewee doe not believe government grant and subsidiary for smes the government should act facilitator and organizer setting the plan and target addition policy maker suggested that the government should specify the tool for achieving these goal recommendation from the finding this study important point realized that jordan have information gap about the borrower which doe not encourage bank give loan smees startup even they want small amount loan therefore one the major problem that not encourage bank deal with the lack information particularly the financial disclosure because nearly all statement are prepared avoid tax information gap been discussed tremendously theory information asymmetry and how affect the bankborrower relationship because result with moral hazard and adverse selection summary found the following issue that affect the smes and their relation with the bank jordan that need some solution and recommendation financial statement given bank are not correct either for tax purpose competition people are secretive their nature they not give information the central bank jordan cbj report that accessible for bank when they want obtain information about the borrower not show credit taken borrower people and company below credit bureau jordan people guaranteeing others are not shown the cbj report therefore this study suggests some recommendation order develop the snee sector jordan and enhance the source finance available the smes establishing trusted relationship between the smes and the bank the financial institution and increase the awareness and sophistication the smes owner manager these recommendation are follows establish credit bureau solve the information gap problem make some regulation enhance information disclosure making audited financial statement obligatory for smes clarify regulation for factoring and leasing they can good source finance smes and others make more centre that increase the awareness smes the manufacturing sector more trained about how deal with bank and why bank exists convince bank treat smes differently than big corporation their need and tailor special financing tool for smes have official definition the country for smes have more attention have more source finance available for smes other than bank develop equity market for smees jordan proposed future research there are many point and question that crossed the mind during the research investigation which can interest for future research such can secondary market for smes debt equity succeed jordan the effect leasing the development the smes sector jordan the effect the wto the sme sector jordan appendix
