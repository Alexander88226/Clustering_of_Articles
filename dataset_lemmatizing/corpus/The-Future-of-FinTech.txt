explore this idea revisit work from the hutchinson andpoggio explored using neural net learn the black and scholes option pricingformula also developed merton culkin and they created data forthe assessment how deep neural net would learn this equation randomly simulatinga range call option price the data were divided into two random set one for trainingand the other for validation before passing the price the deep learning net the datawere normalized exploiting facet the blackscholes call option function that isthat the pricing function linear homogeneous neural net highly nonlinear
