bherein file ownermanagers preference for financing study singaporean sme charlton low and tim mazzarol this paper examines the finding sample small business ownermanagers from singapore and their preference for financing using conjoint design the study examined the personal characteristic the ownermanagers their strategic intent and the characteristic their firm and the trade offs they were prepared make relation control risk growth exit and financial return when seeking particular finance option from within the pecking order theory subsequent cluster and discriminant analysis found three distinct subpopulation within the sample group the builder group committed ownermanagers and group entrepreneur the builder were found most resistant relinquishing control over their business but wanted easy exit strategy and high financial return such owner tended older and more likely have been permanently employed prior starting their venture the committed ownermanagers were equivocal about surrendering equity control and had the least interest exiting the business although they also hoped for high return the entrepreneur were most willing surrender equity and were generally willing seek exit strategy order secure high return this last group found have above average education level and were more likely have worked within larger firm prior launching their own business venture although focused within singapore the study finding have implication for both ownermanagers small medium enterprise sme and policy maker most nation that seek enhance the growth potential among small business they suggest that focus entrepreneurial education may hold the key unlocking the growth potential many sme the paper concludes with recommendation for future research small business are well recognised and acknowledged vital and significant contributor the economy almost every country the small business sector represents statistically significant proportion the world economy morris brennan many country the small enterprise sector major source employment revenue generation and technology kotey meredith similarly singapore employment rate relatively high compared other asian counterpart noted that some industry small enterprise are more effective and efficient servicing than large firm kotey meredith maybe the case for singapore which had charlton low recently completed his doctor business administration the graduate school management centre for entrepreneurial management and innovation cemi the university western australia tim mazzarol associate professor the graduate school management and director the centre for entrepreneurial management and innovation cemi the university western australia uwa attracted many multi national company mnc there are many small enterprise which are able provided valueadded service the small medium enterprise sme sector within singapore key source entrepreneurship and innovation playing vital role that nation economic development lee sme comprise around percent all business establishment singapore employing percent the workforce and generating percent all gdp this similar pattern that found australia the united kingdom and the united state for example australia the small firm sector major contributor the national economy and important source employment commonwealth australia however the productivity singapore sme only about half that the nonsme establishment the large number lowproductivity sme coexists with small number more productive large local enterprise and foreign multinational company mnc the key economic challenge for singapore manage this dualistic structure that all enterprise can contribute the growth the economy this requires that concerted effort taken assist sme keep pace with the rest the economy within singapore sme defined business with than employee annual sale turnover below million fixed asset than million and with least percent equity owned singaporean spring more recently the need for sme venture overseas especially country like china and india been emphasised among the impediment overseas expansion the most important appears the problem raising finance despite the existence number government agency and assistance scheme designed assist smes singapore financing whether from public private source remains major challenge small firm when seeking expand their operation internationally for example berger and udell reported that the primary source small business funding are the ownermanager trade creditor and commercial bank they present life cycle for small business funding that begin with all funding from the ownermanager and that shift toward funding from trade credit and bank loan the firm grows and age berger and udell noted that small firm access external debt the ownermanager often required pledge personal asset support the debt because small firm information often opaque from lender perspective furthermore the small business owner are usually the majority only stakeholder the company result their entire personal and business wealth may entwined therefore important that the small business owner understands their firm gearing level and return before applying for bank facility the aim this study investigate and explore the preference ownermanagers within small firm have for various type financing venture capital debt retained profit public listing the finding from this study will provide more accurate insight into how small business ownermanagers evaluate and select financing option for their firm this research will assist the development enhanced policy within private and government agency involved the funding small medium enterprise the view ownermanagers are highly valued and will assist other small firm the singapore business community the future background sme financing the financing small business been the subject enduring academic and political debate been continuing tradition for research focus the efficiency the supply finance small firm and the potential for credit rationing finance gap berger udell wilson there comparatively little research the demand for finance and effect small firm financial structure this note for small firm these individual preference demand for finance may more powerful constraint their growth than the supply finance kotey policy measure that aim improve the supply finance the small firm sector need take account firm demand for finance alongside supply mcmahon stanger the financing decision important component business strategic planning deal with the mean acquiring resource needed realise the strategy factor which influence strategic choice small firm also determine choice financing the main source financing small entrepreneurial venture are equity supplied either the owner other investor debt obtained from financial institution and secured against fixed asset andor retained profit generated from cash flow some this funding used finance seed startup company while others are used for expansion startup are usually limited the type financing they can get like personal saving used equity personally secured subordinated debt the other hand company with proven track record have much larger choice financing alternative such bank venture capital firm public offering the characteristic small business have strong effect the ability raise fund for instance the new startup sme usually seek financing through the owner personal saving borrowing from relative and friend furthermore those business that are technology based will tend seek out funding from governmentsponsored fund and grant the sme limitation and difficulty sourcing finance because the risk adverse nature lender well moral hazard information asymmetry that arises from agency conflict between lender and entrepreneur survey undertaken with sme singapore found that more ownermanagers were concerned that bank were not extending credit readily which could affect the firm ability service their loan psb according hughes government and private sector agency have increased their supply fund the small business sector over the last decade allow small business take advantage the opportunity furthermore noted that the financial structure small business indicates that the bulk their fund are from personal saving the ownermanager and retained profit from business operation thopmson lighthouse john dunlop sheenan small business develop their financing need change getting access the most appropriate type finance key stage their growth crucial the continuing success the business while the early stage development many small business may rely internally generated financing from saving family friend and retained earnings continued growth and success invariably relies access external finance the equity finance essential start business assist existing business growth that more likely important either the very early stage business growth cycle key stage expansion small business doe not have access level equity finance they need sustain their capital structure they will have problem accessing debt finance the equity finance can sourced through friend family member private equity market business angel seed funding small business tend use self financing combined with borrowing against family home factoring and some case may have access equity finance support their business initiative for debt finance lent the provider for arranged rate return interest and includes overdraft and term loan debt will obligation entity pay specific amount money another entity peirson however some ownermanagers may prefer retained profit which are earning retained the business after dividend shareholder have been deducted this might give them better control over the company but they may have tradeoff with lower growth view among some commentator that the vast majority sme ownermanagers are unwilling raise external equity finance because the perceived loss ownership and control mason harrison overview pecking order theory the pecking order theory pot capital structure state that firm have preferred hierarchy for financing decision the highest preference use internal financing retained earnings and the effect depreciation before resorting any form external fund internal fund incur flotation cost and require additional disclosure proprietary financial information that could lead more severe market discipline and possible loss competitive advantage firm must use external fund the preference use the following order financing source debt convertible security preferred stock and common stock myers this order reflects the motivation the financial manager retain control the firm since only common stock voice management reduce the agency cost equity and avoid the seemingly inevitable negative market reaction announcement new equity issue hawawini viallet the business ownermanagers choice financial acquisition depend their willingness share ownership with investor and the status the firm industry startup growth stable these two determinant are correlated because for instance startup firm are limited seek external finance source and the ownermanagers are the only ownership the business whereas growing firm may have more choice for external finance because potential investor and lender can foresee potential earnings from these growing firm such the owner these firm are able make choice capital acquisition based whether they want dilute their equity investor not result the owner decision that weighed against the possibility and potential tradeoff the potential tradeoff are categorised into five type namely control risk growth exit and return definition control emphasised the power determine financial ownership company risk defined the possibility losing raised capital failure project business growth define the degree business progression within industry exit determine whether sell out existing business merging with another company return defined earnings received from company sale performance and investment demand for finance expected follow pecking order internal equity debt and external equity myers however frequently observed that large number small firm are averse using external equity berger udell binks hughes hughes storey whereas those firm that are unwilling use source finance the pecking order will truncated that point however supply condition restrict firm ability use particular source finance then the pecking order may operate entirely should also noted that the majority sme are unlikely attractive venture capital they lack the key ingredient intellectual property that can protected and sufficient point differentiation allow them return the investor the necessary capital gain influence ownermanager ability and willingness move down the pecking order are explored therefore this study examined the sme ownermanager perspective their preferred finance option versus their potential tradeoff the theoretical framework every economy either old the new they have one thing common for small business people all require access capital order compete and exploit opportunity the global market place know capital access the largest problem for the development minority business and pose potential challenge for small business wishing grow thus need have deeper understanding small business financial structure analysis the financial structure small business indicates that the bulk their fund are from personal saving the ownermanager and retained profit from business operation thompson lighthouse john small business also rely heavily shortterm credit supplier credit credit card and bank overdraft which renewed several time and used longterm finance davidson dutia thompson lighthouse john the proportion longterm debt the financial structure small firm relatively small with the bulk the form personal loan thompson lighthouse however there are limitation using personal equity and shortterm debt principal source finance this because inflation erodes the equity base the business over time and owner manager may not able provide additional fund meet increase working capital requirement even where growth curtailed vickery hence the growth the firm would further complicated addition their relatively high cost shortterm fund will increase the financial risk the firm the earnings from business asset particularly noncurrent asset and permanent working capital are not properly matched with interest and principal payment these fund pierson liquidity will become issue and may eventually lead insolvency undercapitalisation small business therefore associated with insufficient longterm fund finley davidson dutia the research model ownermanager preference for financing figure illustrates the research model used this study within the model the dependent variable the finance option selected within the pot hierarchy the key

capital sourcing the pecking order from retained earnings ipo there could series trade offs that they must undertake these may require change the level risk control and rate growth for example firm that chooses achieve total control the owner and grow via retained earnings will experience lower risk and high control but will probably only realise modest growth level comparison the firm that seek and secures external venture capital will trade off control for faster potential growth but will also face higher risk there are many different definition the above variable everyone from young

ownermanagers any adopt their firm methodology the study employed conjoint experimental design while the conjoint method requires greater information processing from respondent than traditional survey offer superior mean evaluating the preference respondent circumstance where there need for trading off different variable decision process the key variable were identified through focus group and personal interview and were used develop the measure this study the statistical package for the social science spss software and brettonclark conjoint analyser were used for building the questionnaire and data analysis the three method stimulus presentation most widely associated with conjoint analysis are the tradeoff fullprofile and pair wise comparison the choice between presentation method focus the assumption the extent consumer processing being performed during the conjoint task and the type estimation process being employed hair the fullprofile method selected for this questionnaire presentation the fullprofile method not flawless and face two limitation first the number factor increase the possibility information may overload the respondent second the order factor listed the stimulus card may have impact the evaluation the researcher need rotate the factor across respondent when possible minimise order effect the fullprofile method recommended where the number factor six hair whereas the study had only factor control growth exit risk and return and rotation done with sixteen profile the conjoint questionnaire presented the participant had series financing option involving some tradeoff between such key variable control risk growth exit and return each these variable briefly defined follows control the level ownership over equity the business than more than risk small moderate high risk losing raised capital within the business growth using the industry average base whether the firm growing slower higher level than the average whether about the average exit the ability and opportunity retire sellout from this business and return whether the respondent considered they had received good return reasonable return poor return for what invested into the business the participant evaluation the profile design examined face face interview each profile described set combination different level the variable control risk growth exit and return the fullprofile method accommodates both ranking and rating method the rating method selected using point scale which the respondent indicated the degree which they were likely choose that particular profile their preferred finance option and tradeoff available score for profile showed that they would never contemplate choosing score indicated that they would definitely choose existed each ownermanager interviewed confidential basis and provided additional background information their response the conjoint questionnaire the questionnaire pilot tested prior deployment the field and translated into english chinese indian tamil language and malay facilitated those participant who did not speak english their first language the response rate felt would higher not all questionnaire were english the development this survey instrument involved the translation and backtranslation the question item from english these other language and within the capability the author this been said that pilot study are likely under discussed underused and underreported prescott soeken and full report pilot study are rare the research literature lindquist muoio teijlingen different data collection methodology were used gather data such conducting focus group study and personal interview with respondent assist developing the questionnaire pretesting construct and measure figure illustrates flow chart the research procedure figure research procedure flow chart personal interview focus group conjoint questionnaire pilot study respondent review for any difficulty completion unusual result actual study total respondent conclude the research methodology started conducting pilot study before proceeding with the actual data set this allowed collected data set have validity and more reliable there total three research method used these were conjoint cluster and iii discriminant analysis the spss and brettonclark software were used the research finding sample population and data collection the target respondent for the survey were drawn from the ownermanagers singapore top sme the definition the ownermanager that they were the primary decision maker for the company with predominate control over equity they also had responsibility for the daytoday operation the business total ownermanagers were interviewed for the study after having been contacted and agreeing participate interview were undertaken over period three month subcontract data collector who were trained the researcher each respondent asked complete short paperbased questionnaire that collected demographic and other background data such personal demographic firm characteristic strategic intent and the profile that are used for the analysis the respondent were prenotified and appointment arranged for the interview the respondent were from range industry sector including retailing wholesaling transportation construction finance and insurance service which are typical the sme community found singapore upon formulating the first questionnaire pretesting done respondent the respondent were ownermanagers small medium enterprise sme the collected questionnaire pilot study were coded and tested with the spss software and brettonclark conjoint analyser software this particularly important because pilot study can timeconsuming frustrating and fraught with unanticipated problem but better deal with them before investing great deal time money and effort the full study mason zuercher this designed note any error and allow minor change made the questionnaire although ultimately amendment were made the field survey then commenced data collected coded and checked for any missing data and outlier there were total case with outlier adjusted uncompleted questionnaire leaving final useable sample for further analysis data analysis and finding the main part statistical analysis done bretton clarke conjoint analyser while the background data analysed using spss software with the collected data sample the descriptive statistic attribute level had mean and standard deviation which provided useful information for the study then calculated get the average importance the group attribute level and individual attribute level allows view and investigate whether there any need analyse clustering the data set with the variable control risk growth exit and return this give overall preference set the choicebased approach not only employ unique form presenting stimulus set rather than onebyone but also differs that directly includes interaction and must estimated the aggregate level many time the research objective create situation not handled well traditional conjoint analysis hence these alternative methodology can employed hair hence choice based conjoint technique used this study get overall preferred set for clustering technique these have been applied wide variety research problem researcher hartigan provides excellent summary the many published study reporting the result cluster analysis lastly discriminate analysis enables the splitting set observation into two more group used distinguish between two more predefined group the analysis identifies those variable that contribute most the difference between group the brettonclark conjoint analyser tested total factor variable these variable are control risk growth exit and return used identify the preferred variable the result from conjoint analyser identified five key factor consisting mainly level ownership over equity control than retgood return investment good groav growth average compared industry riskhi risk higher losing raised capital and outease ease exit from business the cluster analysis conducted and segmented the data into different group group had case group had case and group had case out the total case used the final analysis this enabled the similarity group with respective level variable cluster together with the clustering group the discriminate analysis further explored the finding showed that the group profile the least willing surrender greater than percent equity control seeking relatively easy exit from the business and most concerned over financial return than the other two group comparison the group profile average willingness surrender greater than percent equity control the least interested easy exit and seeking higher financial return lastly the group profile more willing than the other two group surrender greater than percent control over equity average ease exit and seeking above average return hence all the group could categorised follows group were named builder due their desire for high growth but unwillingness relinquish control group named committed owner manager due their desire remain within the firm and satisfied with modest growth and group named entrepreneur due their willingness take more risk and relinquish control required the group were further discriminated using the demographic firm characteristic strategic intent and business practice data the calculation mean score the various attribute and the total utility enabled get the overall preference choice financing the total utility finding show that ipo the most preferred and equity financing the least preferred will discussed greater detail the following chapter with the background data and conjoint finding this allowed the researcher have deeper understanding individual ownermanagers preference financing and trade offs however these attribute this study may lose some detail order get overall picture nevertheless this actual study allowed shed some insight small business ownersmanagers their preferred structure and finance option discussion finding the result are illustrated figure which are self explanatory with

more likely growth focused and willing explore alternative funding model group entrepreneur are attracted ipo growth and return however they might also seek debt financing option analysis the difference between these three group using discriminant analysis found that group ownermangers significantly different from the other two group their choice preference this also reflected the

satisfied with current strategy term business practice this group different from group and group most small firm and ownermanagers will never able raise all the funding they would like from their respective bank and financial institution their choice preferred finance option this crude sense there will always deficiency the funding sector which are equal the difference between the need and want for funding conclusion this research revealed three promising area study first contribution theory suggested the finding that personal characteristic show relationship with the critical attribute control risk growth exit and return however should noted that the goodness fit for strategic intent weak and noted this study other additional measure could used together with the current one also firm characteristic result reveal that the goodness fit just above average both were not taken into consideration for the conjoint analysis probably not good control variable used this study evidence from the literature review suggested that ownermanagers make decision with respect tradeoff and pecking order theory which largely emphasised larger firm whereas most firm this study are micro small and medium enterprise more advanced research tool such entrepreneurial oriented assessment eqa could used future research for screening purpose owner manager that are identified this study however with the background data and conjoint finding this allowed the researcher have deeper understanding individual ownermanagers preference financing and trade offs however these attribute this study may lose some detail order get overall picture nevertheless this actual study allowed shed some insight small business ownersmanagers their preferred structure and finance option second the finding suggested that small business owner have several cluster within group each particular group different demographic background and different preference financing most sme don grow due lack capital decision the ownermanager entrepreneur not grow noted especially the group that they should more flexible and have realistic expectation making preferred financing decision group may need educate itself with different finance option enable them understand market expectation and the criterion used establish loan group ownermanagers will not able get all the goody and avoid the baddie third the finding suggest that ownermanagers preference for financing may function personal characteristic large extent those with above average education and background that allowed them exposed how larger firm work were more likely fall into the entrepreneur group this policy implication for government and policy maker suggests that the best way enhance the growth sme might invest management education and raising more awareness among sme owner that growth must associated with realistic control risk and return trade offs sme are crucial that the singapore government initiated sme tenyear strategic plan create vibrant and resilient sme that will enhance singapore competitiveness and economic growth spring despite singapore economic success and tremendous interest local enterprise study been conducted examine the ownermanager preference for financing hence this study ownermanagers singapore sme can provide valuable insight and information for other local and foreign sme group committed ownermanagers may perhaps the most difficult and hardest push and shift their thought they are basically only interested daytoday operation want grow small business faster pace should identify the member group entrepreneur with their interest and support them with various scheme further the need exists for real tool that will explore what extent this group willing give control for various tradeoff before proceeding institute educational change hence the government may want emphasise more research for screening purpose and introduce additional education tool which promote more training management seminar ownermanagers specific cluster each sme sector this realistically allows owner manager have better choice financing decision making especially those lacking work experience large firm another possible limitation research the number attribute examined the conjoint analysis these research attribute may not comprehensive nevertheless when conducting the focus group and the research process the researcher and the focus group ownermanagers felt strongly that the variable used are the most appropriate hence there might have been minor factor left out order get better picture but seems unlikely that there are other factor that are more important than the toprating factor found this present research nevertheless the researcher done his best wherever could within his ability the research sample population interest shown this research represented fraction industrial sector singapore could have focused further produce more specific group but the greatest challenge for this research would then have been identify and contact the population interest previous research study have not examined financial company such venture capital etc and banker preference tradeoff mode lending borrower through conjoint study would add our understanding what the lender perspective and which the above market segment meet their criterion the research area scope could extended beyond the shore singapore time permit will interesting extend the research study other asian country and conduct comparative study between various southeast asia country such malaysia indonesia philippine and thailand conclude proposed that small business are fulfil the potential identified mazzarol policy and resource need realign maximise the social and economic contribution progrowth business hence together with this research study hope the finding will enable have deeper understanding and insight the ownermanager mind their preferred finance decision making the different tradeoff and individual preference some ownermanager realign the actual overall market from this study suggested that the ownermanagers preferred financing may unfulfilled shown the finding especially for group education policy maybe the area for government policy maker emphasis further and assist them providing more course for these ownermanagers small business with better market knowledge order
