the questionhowever how will impact some the most intractable issue trade nance last yearus trillion merchandise export were transported around the world ofglobal commerce requires trade nance provide liquidity and risk mitigation howeverine ciencies trade nance today mean that many application unfunded this trillion trade nance gap widest emerging market and for small and mediumsized enterprise orts address these shortfall have gained limited traction due the decentralizednature trade this paper review the design enterprise blockchains explore howchanging the architecture trade nance could impact the driver trade nance gap bygrounding our analysis the technical architecture live enterprise blockchain platformwe aim provide tangible discussion around the technology applying blockchain technology trade nance regardless the top stack application will directly impact the owof information compliance challenge and pro tability way that can contribute moreinclusive trade nance structureintroductiontrade nance reduces risk the process trade given the number party involvedintermediation enables buyer and seller transact more ciently across border currency andlanguages the transaction volume are huge trillion merchandise exportswere transported around the world across sea air rail and road world trade organization this global trade requires nancinghowever the same characteristic that make trade nance safer also introduce friction andin exibility this resulted two persistent problem the sector first trade nance isnot easily accessible everyone and every region shortfall supply have persistently pooledin frontier market and among small and mediumsized enterprise smes this directimplications for the ability emerging market capture the bene trade driven growthscalability second problem many believed that digitalization the answer the lackof visibility low pro margin and know your customer kyc concern that drive shortfallswhile digitalization changed the way individual entity trade nance process informationthese bene have not scaled globally into connected network each node the trade nancenetwork maintains own proprietary source information doe today digital documentation need checked and reentered every step the process having many erentcentralized system globally create localized data center that not interoperate with broadernetwork digital improvement nondigital infrastructure can only far fundamental reorganization the system required impactfully change trade nance enough address theshortfalls and gapsover the past two year have witnessed wholly erent solution emerge blockchaintechnology present open technology layer that enables program connect and scale thedecentralized architecture blockchain can serve better foundation for interoperation alonga global and intermediated process like trade nancetrade nance inherently decentralized trying match centralized architecture this decentralized process led the siloes and problem face today changing the structuralfoundation trade nance the technology present opportunity narrow gap unconventional way having decentralized yet trusted and secure record information shared betweenrelevant party can reduce friction while maintaining the ciencies intermediated tradein this paper take design approach explore whether blockchain could rearchitect trade nance make more inclusive this approach unusual that map the reason for trade nance gap directly the feature the technology itself our conclusion are thus independentof the speci use case they apply equally letter credit open account trade creditinsurance they are applicable jurisdiction from brazil thailandwhile public blockchains like bitcoin are the most familiar the casual reader focus thispaper enterprise blockchains the reason that private permissioned blockchains built withthe requirement company mind are most appropriate for the particular characteristic oftrade nance trade

enterprise fork adaptation public cryptocurrency codebase make the technology more suitable forcompaniescorda unique among enterprise blockchains that operates pointtopoint transaction model this meansthat only participant involved given transaction exchange data are privy the data involved thosetransaction our example each node transacts behalf their client and share only the information that isneeded complete the transaction structural feature that contribute gap first the cost verifying and checking high this isbecause each individual entity the transaction need ensure that the document

buterin doe blockchain technology have feature that can narrowtrade nance gap today trade nance architecture enables the persistence gap doe this mean that atechnology that promised rearchitect trade nance will narrow them there lot riding onthis contention and some blockchain application have focused speci cally this area while wehope that the trade nance application built blockchain platform will accomplish this goalthe sheer scope erent application make cult evaluate the potential disruption ofeach claimin this section instead looking the promise blockchain application which enormouswe look the mechanic the technology doe the technology itself have enable feature thataddress some the reason for trade nance gap risk department would agree having each node contain identical copy the entire transaction historyeven though there some technology being introducted public blockchain system address privacy concernsthe technology can too immature for enterprise addition often enterprise not want information sharedwith other party even that information encrypted grounding our analysis the technical architecture live enterprise distributed ledgerplatform aim provide tangible discussion around the technology blockchain some ofthese bene are inherently enabled the blockchain platform itself while others allow producersof application drive the bene cover the three driver from figure low pro tabilityregulatory concern and information low pro tabilitylow pro tability come from two source the bank cost processing transaction andthe expected revenue smes will naturally provide smaller expected pro their transactionvolume and frequency may expected lowthe cost and time process trade transaction can signi cant due the variety actorsand step that are involved much the cost arises from delay friction and additional ortneeded handle trade data this underpinned the fact that trade nance linear processthat heavily reliant paper document the paper documentation carried from port portalong with the cargo checked signed faxed the various party including bank with very littlevisibility the whole process any single participant manual checking time consuming andcan error prone bottleneck also occur frequently because party overall control over orvisibility into the full processdelays can have real cost implication take demurrage payable charge the owner achartered ship respect failure load discharge the ship within the agreed time thesecharges can add per container per day czajkowski which may not seem like muchbut when applied whole vessel such panamax eet ship the cost can reach per day delaythese cost are further exacerbated distant market bank which lack direct correspondentrelationships and small rms for these entity the time needed execute transaction theprevalence error and amendment and the need verify all part the transaction due tothe need establish provenance paperwork contribute low pro tabilitythere are several technical element built into enterprise blockchains that impact the costand time processing step are eliminated when relevant party maintain the same version ofthe truth having automatable process will speed step that can not eliminated bothoracles and signature multiple signature from trusted party can trigger other event ablockchain removing delay for information dependenciesblockchain feature that can address pro tability are single truth layer automatableprocesses oracle and signature multiple signature multisig all these feature lead the elimination con rmation step party can trust that theinformation that they see the same other partiesone the major cost multiplier trade transaction the passing back and forth thesame document multiple time for example there are typically step without amendment letter credit having single truth layer can potentially eliminate seven thesesteps immediatelyas one example figure illustrates the seller screen onledger letter credit transaction this snapshot the key data form that are includedin any transaction the blockchain there single source veri data that immutableas result all party can have con dence that the information the screen veri and isthe same what their counterparties see their screen the data accurate and reliable fromthe beginninghaving single source truth shared between relevant party reduces cost that are due toerrors associated with repetitive veri cation this will shorten the time nancing because itreduces information oat the time until information available and increase real time visibilityof trade faster information transfer with fewer error will reduce the additional cost associatedwith riskier tradesa second way that blockchain can address pro tability automating some step that currently have long lag time corda ows enable coordination from erent node triggerdefault not the reason that cost and pro problem default rate for trade nance are below andrecovery even then the order icc trade register the problem cost and pro tability related topaperwork and veri cation and checkingauthor calculation using pilot version letter credit cordascreenshots are from the corda letter credit demo figure status erent order shared with relevant partiessource transaction update shared state between party that are automated figure illustratesthe ows letter credit trade lifecycleoracles and third party signature are two example input blockchain that can triggeran automated process oracle agent the blockchain that provides information theparticipants one more business network they source information from real world eventsthird party data provider other blockchain activity oracle can push information abusiness network either regularly upon request and not party tradeoracles are meant provide fact business network participant figure show examplewhere electronic bill lading ebl provider act oracle trade transaction tradetransaction ownership the good change throughout the process the document title this case represented ebl allows the bearer take ownership after the good areready ship the shipper request the carrier draft bill lading the shipper exchangesthe good for the ebl from the carrier the shipper then present the ebl the advising bankin ful lment the documentary submission requirement letter credit since each ebl isassociated with unique title registry record which maintained the oracle the transfer oftitle from the shipper the advising bank only occurs after querying the oracle get con rmationof the registry record number this also introduces additional visibility into who owns the goodsthroughout the processfigure flow between node corda along trade nance lifecyclesource trusted third party may also provide signature blockchain for example dhl maysend pay out upon signature when good have arrived certain port triggering the nextprocess automatically removing friction once the physical cargo been checked and the datainput into the system automated contract could instantaneously release the fund from theseller bank the buyer bank this one example smart contract and selfexecutingtransaction this could signi cantly reduce the delay between the checking the cargo and the nal release fund figure bill lading timeline with title transfer lack information risk management source second driver trade nance rejection lack reliable information this make itdi cult for stakeholder accurately measure risk problem that compounded for smeswhere risk the result information asymmetry blockchain can improve risk managementit could enable answer question like can this sme

address root cause sme nance market gapsin addition the ability identify the legal entity participant transaction fundamentalto cient trade nance can act organizational anchor master key from whichall other information can hung corda distinguished name identify participantsto further improve transparency about network participant many solution then link legalentity identi lei lei digit alpha numeric code connected key reference information thatallows for the unique identi cation legal entity participating nancial transaction the leiveri annual basis who who who owns whom iii who owns what the bodyresponsible for administering the lei system itself regulated over central bank aroundthe worldan important bene being able organize data around entity with canonical identi ersthat are used universally across the globe that becomes possible develop map thatcharts out the history all transaction performed across all participant this becomes verypowerful tool for reducing fraud because all the party involved trade are known and havebeen validated compliance kyc concern regulatory oversight play critical role the functioning the global nancial system overtime both the diversity regulation and the size sanction have increasedthis relates the third major driver rejection for trade nance proposal kyc andmoney laundering concern the cost and complexity regulatory compliance play importantrole transaction cost the problem for trade nance that rejection are based onkyc concernsenterprise blockchains can address the uncertainty related compliance via three featuresthese include live information sharing through regulator node active regulation requiringattestations third party that have done kyc check and more data for retrospective analysisthat may facilitate more ective regulationbeyond blockchain ability enhance the reliability and ciency conducting kyc andantimoney laundering due diligence the technology can also address two related regulatory issuesthe rst uncertainty regulator because regulator only see trade after occurredtheir lack insight shift the burden vigilance onto bank the second uncertainty bank the regulatory environment complex and not harmonized each bank need satisfy erentlevels regulationblockchain feature that can address regulatory compliance are notary functionality regulator node attestation and audit trail notary agreement protects against doubleinvoicing the same statedoubleinvoicing common concern trade nance can occur error where transactionis mistakenly counted twice fraudulent setting where malicious actor intends game theprocess this requires nancial institution spend time validate all the transaction preventinstances doubleinvoicing standard chartered for example lost almost million froma fraud involving counterfeited paperwork where erent bank and trading house were holdingseparate title for the same metal china qingdao port blockchain technology the potential address some these fraudulent transaction withcorda notary ensures uniqueness invoice payment this the potential makeimportant inroad the doublespending problem because transaction represented aparticular state mathematically impossible reuse the same state more than once that isif particular invoice certain number the same asset literally can not sent two bank can only used once and the notary will enforce this while this doe not protect againstpeople creating two separate invoice with erent number bank can ensure that certain stateis only used once they are the same application live regulator oversight particular identity transactionsas regulation around trade nance continue grow the sanction for violation have alsogrown according fincen data the number suspicious activity report grew exponentiallyfrom addition market participant have generate compliance report aregular basis for submission the relevant regulator much this work still manual whichleads high overhead costsenterprise level blockchains enable the addition speci type entity into the transactionthat refer regulator node this regulator node can incorporated into the networkand enables regulator monitor transaction that occur realtime basis but doe notgive them the ability change the transaction this can reduce the need for manual regulatoryreporting and can signi cantly reduce costsfigure corda with regulator nodesource rblockchain address the cost and complexity regulatory compliance unusual waywhile existing regtech solution have focused simplifying kyc this only one part ain recent informal survey global bank repondents each had erent process for kyc supply chain nance transaction complex problem allowing regulator have direct insight into transaction the reportingprocess can become burdensome becoming incorporated into the transaction itself signature third party that have performed due diligenceon blockchain network trusted third party can attest that particular party not nefariousonboarding new corporation entity could involve the signature entity that donedue diligence more data can allow better retrospective analysis make future projectionsof criminal activityimmutability data refers the fact that state can not changed modi after hasbeen created this creates clear audit trail into the transaction historic state are stored andcan accessed will impossible tamper with data and data integrity can maintainedat all time conclusiontrade nance gap will not resolved until trade nance change this kind thinking isnot new but the technology make happen blockchain will impact how trade nance isdone will become safer faster and more secure bank and corporates move trade onto theblockchaindoes this mean that blockchain will solve the trade nance gap not alone spreadsits hard coded feature will improve the potential for trade nance more inclusive andavailable take full advantage the bene that blockchain trade nance weneed consider three question while designing top stack application can outside providerseasily contribute data doe follow reuse existing standard and contract and will improveinformation and data the year that proofofconcepts are moving into pilot and production havelearned during the design phase the problem trade nance are going much harder tosolve than they look the surface trade continues evolve become increasingly urgentthat nancial
