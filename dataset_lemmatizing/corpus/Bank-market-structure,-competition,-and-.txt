these institutional change banking system give rise major policy concern our empirical enquiry focus smes since informationbased intermediation theory diamond ramakrishnan and thakor the defines smes

european commission brussels bhattacharya and thakor stein suggests that smes are likely have many bank relationship have large corporationsfirst smes and their lender frequently belong the same socioeconomic setting which reduces information asymmetry eas monitoring and reduces costly information acquisition information about borrower this implies that opaque firm like smes find optimal borrow from one bank however hold problem arise with repeated lending from only one bank therelationship lender extract rent from the firm sharpe rajan thus limited number bank relationship optimal for smes this also reduces the probability being denied credit thakor von thadden second empirical evidence indicates that the number bank relationship increasing although not uniformly firm size petersen and rajan berger and udell houston and james ongena and smith third another reason why smes are likely maintain many bank relationship relate their typical rural location where sophisticated intermediary typically large bank not have physical presence these rural location because smes not demand diversified supply financial service ferri and messori finally smes are likely maintain relationship with larger institution the lending technology required for processing soft information well developed larger bank williamson stein berger and udell cole berger these final two argument indicate that smes have reduced pool bank obtain financing fromour crosscountry analysis also related the literature financial system architecture firstwhile staikouras and koutsomanolifillipaki and schaeck and cihak report increasing degree competition european banking system goddard guevara relatedly the literature relationship maintained local and regional bank proposes long term interaction hypothesis according which bank taking part community life share relationship various kind not solely economic bannerjee besley and coate through such relationship they can acquire information that would available outsider only cost consequently bank operating local and rural community may take advantage such information their financing activity placing them better position deal with asymmetric information and agency problem and amel simultaneously observe wave consolidation across european banking system resulting from increasing number this raise fear that consolidation decrease the number bank specialising relationship banking community bank with possibly detrimental welfare effect for local firm especially smes these firm access credit and ultimately economic growth result positive effect for the provision banking service arising from increased competition banking system may offset higher degree concentration part our empirical investigation seek answer this question because the extant literature the effect market structure and competition sme financing offer two competing theory whereas proponent the market power notion elsas boot boot and thakor ongena and smith contend that concentration decrease firm access credit advocate the information hypothesis dell ariccia and marquez petersen and rajan argue that competition improves credit availability propose that these contrasting finding may due the way competition determined empirical study that frequently proxy competition with concentration measure this assertion place our paper into growing body work beck claessens and laeven carbo schaeck and guevara indicating that concentration poor proxy for competition and that concentration and competition describe different characteristic banking systemssecond following ongena and smith who report evidence that well developed financial system with stronger protection creditor right help explain the number bank relationship also test for the effect difference legal and financial system arrangement the spirit the study motivated porta levine demirg kunt and maksimovic and beck our analysis help evaluate whether the effect uncovered ongena and smith are also valid for smes europe such development have been extensively studied for the see for instance craig and hardee berger and udell cole and berger and frame third focus europe since banking system have been undergoing significant change following the launch the single market programme transition the euro and recent enlargement while these development are aimed creating level playing field for competition european banking the banking landscape still largely influenced linguistic and cultural difference that thwart setting banking relationship across national boundary such impediment may due exogenous economic border legal origin and system supervisory and corporate governance practice political framework language and culture and endogenous economic border these are informationbased and arise from bankfirm relationship adverse selection and information sharing between intermediary buch evidence for the conjecture that linguistic minority and smaller nonfinancial firm prefer more local character the bank they business with across region provided affinito and piazza therefore also explore whether difference across european region help explain the number bank relationship the purpose our paper extend the literature bank relationship three distinct way first this research the best our knowledge the first empirical analysis the determinant the number smebank financing relationship exclusively based european data second disentangle effect from competition and concentration simultaneously consider independent effect arising from competition and concentration for smebank relationship third focus selected european region investigate the importance the socioeconomic environment for smebank financing relationship guiso point out local market condition matter they should matter the most for small firm which have difficulty raising fund distance than for large firm obtain data from the centre for business research the university cambridge regarding scope and scale the relationship between sme borrower and their bank from emiliaromagna the northeast italy bavaria the south germany and the southeastregion the these region are traditionally characterised area rich innovative smes well local and regional bank which are the main source financing for smes this dataset augmented with information financial system architecture and local market condition provides excellent setting conduct our empirical investigation the survey data can matched with local bank market data detailed further below this particularly beneficial since anticipate socioeconomic factor paralleled local financial system addition regional focus permit better accounting for information asymmetry bank are exposed when aiming establish relationship with smes four key finding emerge from our analysis adverse effect increasing consolidation for the number bank relationship maintained smes are fully offset increased competition this extent our result highlight that concentration measure not serve proxy for competition banking system factor such regional gdp growth regional population and innovative environment are positively related the number bank relationship the number bank relationship increasing the amount bank finance used and the bank play active role advising smes regulatory restriction banking activity and financing and legal obstacle decrease the probability maintaining multiple bank relationship the plan for the paper follows section briefly explains the methodology and also describes the dataset present empirical

germany question from the survey cover variety topic including the main market serviced the type finance used whether firm have used bank finance and the role that bank play moreover the questionnaire also provides detail about the nature the smes type business size employment growth and turnoversummary statistic for the survey and the other explanatory variable are presented table the make the sample with germany and italy accounting for and respectively italy show the highest incidence multibank relationship with the exhibiting the lowest our definition bank financing includes financing that intended for inter alia acquisition investment cashflow tax and for enabling the sme remain going concern excludes smes having relationship solely through having checking saving account with bank the smes the sample not use bank for their financing activity this implies that they either use other form financing such borrowing from family and friend use their own reserve for financing purpose such notion selffinancing consistent with beck who show that small firm finance lesser proportion their investment with formal source external financethe survey doe not provide actual figure for turnover rather the smes are classified into five category whereby higher value indicate greater turnover both average turnover and average number employee for all smes are greater for those that move from zero one and from one more than one bank financing relationship this line with previous study highlighting that size positively correlated with the number bank relationship petersen and rajan

cetorelli addition use the bank concentration ratio for sensitivity test provided section below disentangle the effect arising from concentration and competition include the panzar and rosse hstatistic gauge competition claessens and laeven argue that more appropriate measure for the degree competition than previously used proxy ofcompetition shaffer highlight the analytical strength and superiority the hstatistic over other measure competition since formally derived from profitmaximising equilibrium condition overcomes criticism put forward against concentration ratio that are frequently used infer competition doe not require assumption about the market the hstatistic gauge market power the extent which change factor input price translate into equilibrium revenue vesala shown that higher value signify more competition anticipate that concentration inversely related the number relationship maintained smes whereas the hstatistic expected positively related appendix present the calculation for the hstatistic regional market structure variablesregional indicator for emiliaromagna bavaria and the southeast the are retrieved from regio eurostat harmonised regional statistical database extract information regional gdp regional population and regional patent application the european patent present definition for the explanatory variable appendix for detailed overview computation the hstatistic see claessens and laeven shaffer stress that the definition banking market likely affect inference regarding competition when competition inferred from concentration ratio this due the fact that banking market small country are likely extend beyond single nation border and because large bank operate globally moreover cetorelli underscore that competition can not determined simply looking market structure since bank behaviour can only measured accurately through direct empirical analysis individual bank data office expect these variable positively impact upon the number bank financing relationship control for the nexus between smes and the business environment obtain the variable time start business and cost start business from the

relationship country with better access financial service provider offer more opportunity for smes set multiple lending relationship contrast smes can obtain fund from the stock market anticipate that well developed equity market will negatively related the number financing relationship employ turnover measure firm size expect smes maintain more financing relationship they increase size moreover detragiache have shown that larger firm may have rely multiple banking allow bank diversify firmspecific credit risk additionally firm complexity and growth opportunity are likely increase with size

information leakage competitor are more likely with multiple lender use age ass whether the year incorporation impact the number financing relationship older firm may face severe adverse selection problem when seeking finance and should more likely have access financial service they have survived the critical startup period and have generated reputational effect throughout the intervening year diamond capture organisational form and distinguish between firm type include dummy variable firm type that take the value one the sme private zero otherwise public firm will have easier access the capital market and this might impact the number bank relationship they maintain degryse and van cayseele include this variable the degree informational asymmetry varies with organisational form due

amount bank finance used employed ass how much the sme depends financing from banksto account for the bank bargain power over the borrower and the degree monitoring exerted the bank employ the variable bank role elsas this regressor provides information whether the bank seat the smes board and whether offer sale marketing technical management advice the firm distance determines whether proximity between borrower and lender any impact the number relationship given that smes are considered opaque and given that the collection soft information facilitated geographic proximity anticipate that distance will positivelyrelated the number bank relationship measure relationship strength utilize dummy variable bankterms that take the value one the sme view the term given the bank favourable zero otherwise also employ two dummy variable for bank type which take the value one the bank regional national bank respectively zero otherwise since particular sme can obtain bank financing from either regional national bank both the two bank type are not mutually exclusive and are both included the quantitative analysis bank with different organisational structure may use different lending technology produce soft information small regional bank may have comparative advantage producing soft information while bank with multilayered hierarchy may perceive this comparative disadvantage several study examine whether distance between lender and borrower been changing over time and provide contrasting result petersen and rajan cyrnak and hannan and wolken and rohde all find that distance increased whilst degryse and ongena contrast find that distance not increased resultsconcentration and competitionwe use firmlevel regression the number bank relationship firm market structure and regional and countryspecific variable the dependent variable the multibank relationship variable smes are classified having bank financing relationship having one relationship and having multiple bank financing relationship employ tobit specification because the dependent variable discretevalued and truncated the number bank relationship below one table about here table present the main result column the canonical model examine the effect concentration and competition include the hhi the hstatistic and interaction term between hhi and the hstatistic column the objective these regression specification establish whether concentration and competition capture the same characteristic banking system and hence can used interchangeably they independently affect the number bank relationship this would suggest that inappropriate proxy the degree competition banking system with measure market structure such the hhi the hhi enters column positively and significantly highlighting that smes more concentrated market are more likely engage more than one bank relationship one reason may that smes try avoid holdup problem concentrated market berger forthcoming this result however reversed once the direct measure competition the panzar and rosse hstatistic included the regression specification column only include the hstatistic gauge competition this variable enters significantly with positive sign indicating that smes maintain more bank relationship more competitive system greater competition widens the spectrum bank choose from moreover smes that might experiencing difficulty could potentially find easier develop new bank relationship more competitive environment likewise bank might also start providing better term client bid attract further business competitive environment our result contrast with farinha and the survey data not provide the precise number bank relationship beyond one this hamper the use poisson model that could otherwise used estimate the actual number lending relationship santos who not find that bank competition the region where the firm located play role decision switch from single multiple relationshipsimportantly when these two variable enter the regression simultaneously column the hhi change the sign the coefficient and retains significance this key finding persiststhroughout the remainder the paper line with previous work ongena and smith and dewatripont and maskin concentration reduces the number relationship moreover the banking market concentrated and sme existing relationship experiencing difficulty for one reason another then will harder obtain service when the number player the market limited this result aligned with the structureconductperformance scp paradigm which state that market power reduces access credit contrast competition continues positively affect the number bank relationship the result concerning hhi and the hstatistic are intuitive firm operating concentrated market can only choose between few provider financing and therefore have fewer bank relationship whereas competition increase the number bank relationship this result provides important evidence that independent effect arise from market structure and competition thus our finding suggests that competition should not proxied the degree concentration addition this result related the result craig and hardee who demonstrate that credit availability for small firm decline result consolidation banking this adverse effect however mitigated the fact that small business substitute bank financing through alternative source such capital leasing firm mortgage company and financial broker shed more light the effect attributable competition and concentration include interaction term between the hstatistic and the hhi the two variable are centered the mean this regression mitigate collinearity problem arising from correlation between the interaction term and component zou and adam centered the individual related study craig and hardee show that small business operating area dominated large bank tend hold debt than firm area with fewer large bank they interpret this result suggestive evidence for negative effect consolidation access credit centering variable involves subtracting from each observation the component part the mean that variable before constructing the interaction term component reflect the effect competition when concentration held the mean value and vice versa thus the total effect the hhi the number bank relationship depends the estimated coefficient the interaction term for instance negative coefficient for the interaction term indicates that the higher the degree competition the lower the effect concentration the number bank relationship and vice versa column show that both hstatistic and hhi retain their respective sign and level significance when the interaction term included the interaction term enters positively and significantly implying that the effect the number relationship greater more concentrated marketsvisual inspection the magnitude the coefficient for and hhi column already indicates that their respective positive and negative effect cancel out further investigate this evaluate the independent effect arising from competition and concentration using logit model with marginal effect and compute the impact increasing these two variable one percent the probability engaging additional relationship the dependent variable recoded for this test take the value zero the sme only maintains one bank financing relationship one the sme make use more than one bank relationship report marginal effect because the magnitude the change the probability setting additional lending relationship depends the initial value all the independent variable and their coefficient the result are provided appendix iii column while increasing the hhi one percent decrease the probability having additional bank relationship percent this effect more than offset increasing competition fact increasing the hstatistic one percent increase the probability having additional bank relationship percent this calculation illustrates that the adverse ramification arising from increased consolidation banking are totally offset greater competition bankingamong the control variable table find that firm age increase the number bank relationship and turnover distance and the amount bank finance used the dummy variable for bank role and bank term also enter significantly with positive sign the more influential bank the more likely the sme seek additional bank relationship this could reflect the smes awareness that the lender trying extract rent likewise firm perceive bank term favourable they increasingly establish multiple lending relationship harhoff and rting the dummy variable for national and regionalbank also enter positively and significantly doing business with regional bank increase the number bank relationship the regional bank may not able provide broad range service required the sme berger forthcoming the other hand doing business with national bank may not sufficient the sme may want retain relationship with local lender that better able process soft informationby contrast firm type ownership change and investment enter negatively and significantly table private firm are likely have more than one bank relationship when compared public firm suggesting that more opaque firm tend have bank relationship provider fund that not have access soft information will incur greater monitoring cost the negative effect ownership change may reflect bank reluctance provide service firm that change ownership and require assessment whether the new sme management able provide them with the necessary creditworthiness requirement the weakly inverse association bank relationship with investment could driven the smes concern about possible information leakagesit important acknowledge that including variable that capture competition andconcentration considerably improve upon the fit the model while the regression column only explains about percent the variation the number bank relationship the pseudo rincreases percent when both and hhi enter the regression equation simultaneously column regional and financial system characteristicsin table investigate the effect characteristic the local banking market and the wider financial system are not specifically interested the control variable constrain the subsequent discussion regional and financial system characteristic and the effect the hstatistic and the hhi table about here term access financial service measured the ratio bank branch per find that higher density branch office make easier access provider financial service the econometric test corroborate our conjecture that regional factor affect the number bank relationship higher regional gdp growth larger regional population and more regional patent are all significantly positively associated with our dependent variable smes are likely expand scope and scale when the local economy prospers and innovates this make them diversify their financing relationship moreover our result concerning regional population aligned with affinito and piazza whose result indicate that economically active local population requires wider access banking service stock market capitalizationgdp show negative and significant association with multibank relationship attribute this result the fact that smes operating environment with better developed stock market have substantial part their financial need met through equity similar result although not significant reported ongena and smith both hstatistic and hhi retain their respective sign and level significance throughout all regression table suggesting that our inference also hold when regional and financial system characteristic are accounted for institutional characteristicswe examine the effect the institutional environment and design feature the regulatory system table table about here both financing and legal obstacle are negatively related the number bank financing relationship financing obstacle increase smes are inclined have more than one bank relationship since the environment make harder develop new opportunity moreover smes with one relationship are likely prone maintain and nurture existing bank relationship anticipating that having one healthy banking relationship benefit the firm likewise legal obstacle require greater knowledge the legal environment something which smes might not have only develop over time being business given their localcommunity nature shown beck the extent which financial and legal underdevelopment constrain firm growth depends very much firm size smallest firm are consistently the most adversely affected all obstacle fact our result are aligned with the soft budget constraint hypothesis see also ongena and smith proposing that inefficient judicial system motivate firm maintain more bank relationship with respect the cost start business find that higher cost induce firm engage multiple relationship anticipated the more cost business incur towards their setup the more use financial support they will need particularly instance where they not have selffinancing the advice provided bank that have assisted smes during their setup may prove invaluable for smes similarly time start business also increase the number financing relationship this could due the fact that financing working capital spread across number lender the early stage business each lender individually may not keen committing large volume loan the startup company line with our expectation banking freedom enters positively and significantly suggesting that institutional factor conducive more open environment facilitate the establishment multiple bank relationship the hhi retains sign and level significance throughout all regression table the hstatistic also remains significant with the anticipated sign all but one specification only rendered insignificant when banking freedom controlled for thus our inference regarding concentration and competition are insensitive controlling for the institutional setting sensitivity testswe embark set robustness test investigate our result are sensitive the way competition and concentration are measured table about here also ran the regression for regional and financial system characteristic table and for the institutional environment table with the alternative measure concentration and competition obtain virtually identical result with respect the effect competition and concentration the result can obtained from the author request table present four regression column and employ alternatively computed hstatistic measure competiton this hstatistic calculated using the ratio interest revenue total asset instead the ratio total revenue total asset dependent variable see also molyneux the alternative hstatistic enters significantly with positive sign suggesting that the way calculated doe not affect the inference column and replace the hhi with the bank concentration ratio gauge the degree concentration banking system this variable frequently used study bank concentration beck the finding are not affected therefore conclude that measurement error concentration not drive our finding finally exploit the fact that out dataset only provides information the number bank relationship for zero one multiple bank relationship and test the sensitivity our result the specification the econometric model alluded section employ logit model and calculate marginal effect our finding regarding the effect competition concentration and the regional financial system and institutional characteristic are corroborated the result from this final sensitivity check are presented appendix iii concluding remarksagainst background increasing concentration and competition european banking system and marked change the regulatory environment which financial institution operate this paper seek establish the effect such change the determinant the number sme bank financing relationship three distinct european region the best our knowledge this study provides the first insight the determinant financing relationship smes europeemploying new dataset from crosssectional survey smes uncover independent effect arising from competition and concentration the number lending relationship maintained smes small and medium sized firm maintain more relationship more competitive banking system this result consistent with the market power hypothesis the literature importantly our result substantiate the assertion recent empirical work that competition and concentration describe different characteristic banking system more precisely the finding underscore that decreasing effect the number bank relationship arising from increased consolidation banking are offset increased competition furthermore this conclusion robust alternative measure competiton and concentrationour study also analysis measure that capture information the local economic environment and regarding design feature the institutional system the countrylevel that respect find that regional gdp growth regional population and stimulating local entrepreneurial environment foster the establishment multiple lending relationship whereas legal and financing obstacle are impediment multiple relationship these finding bear important policy implication particular the result imply that measure market structure such the hhi and the bank concentration ratio may inappropriate proxy for the degree competition banking reveal that both structure and conduct affect smes financing relationship opposite direction moreover the frequently raised concern among policymakers and the medium about the adverse ramification from increase ofconsolidation banking concerning the provision banking service smes not justified given that these negative effect are fully offset the increased competition banking addition thefinding that legal obstacle are impediment diversifying lending relationship indicates that policy aimed encouraging smes expand scope and scale which often requires setting additional bank relationship are bound unsuccessful legal institution are not amended accordingly finally removing barrier and obstacle that hamper setting multiple bank relationship imposed bank will enable smes develop and mature making use more sophisticated financial service thus ultimately promoting economic growth data limitation concerning the comparatively small sample size suggest that our result have taken with note caution nonetheless our finding complement growing body empirical work the banking literature suggesting that concentration and competition describe different characteristic banking system this paper can extended other direction obviously would interesting examine our hypothesis with larger crosscountry sample including developed economy another intellectually appealing avenue for future work would analyse the effect the availability venture capital and private equity sme financing and the way smes interact with their bank finally examination how different lending technology are affected concentration and competition also seems

the hstatisticwe present this appendix brief overview the panzar and rosse hstatistic that utilise gauge competition this statistic widely used empirical work test for banking competition shaffer molyneux claessens and laeven the hstatistic derived from reducedform revenue equation and measure market power the extent which change factor input price are reflected revenue assuming longrun equilibrium proportional increase factor price will mirrored equiproportional increase revenue under perfect competition under monopolistic competition however revenue increase than proportionally change input price the monopoly case increase factor input price will either not reflected revenue will tend decrease revenue the magnitude hcan interpreted the following wayh indicates monopoly equilibriumindicates monopolistic competitionindicates perfect competitionwe obtain data from bankscope and include all saving cooperative and commercial bank operating italy germany and the estimate hstatistics follow the method schaeck and cihak and split our sample into small and large bank since potential difference the way these bank compete will bias small bank often operate locally and tend face stronger competition from other small bank retail market contrast large institution compete different line business corporate and investment banking and compete globally use cutoff point million eur distinguish between small and large bank and estimate the following reducedform revenue equation crosssectionally for each one the three country therefore the magnitude the hstatistic can serve measure for the degree competition assuming that the bank face demand with constant elasticity and cobbdouglas production technology vesala this cutoff point aligned with the literature small bank europe mercieca the ratio total revenue total asset proxy for the output price loan and other service this dependent variable includes total interest revenue fee income commission incomeand other

behaviour and size ycaptures the ratio deposit deposit and money market funding the ratio net loan total asset the ratio equity total asset and capture bank size measured total balance sheet asset all variable enter the equation log the hstatistic calculated the sum the coefficient well known that the hstatistic assumes longrun equilibrium molyneux consequently perform the following analysis investigate longrun equilibrium and estimate equation with the pretax return asset dependent variableln roa the modified hstatistic the equilibrium statistic and again calculated test the equilibrium statistic using ftest this test aim establish whether input price are uncorrelated with industry return since competitive system will equalise riskadjusted rate return across bank equilibrium this hypothesis rejected the market assumed disequilibrium the result from our equilibrium test indicate that the three market under consideration are long run equilibrium appendix iii logit model with
