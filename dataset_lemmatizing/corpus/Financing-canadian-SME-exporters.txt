canadiennes this empirical paper compare access and term commercial lending between small and mediumsized exporter and nonexporter firm theory suggests that exporter firm might relatively disadvantaged this found true for new firm international new venture but difference were identified between established exporter and nonexporter firm introduction canada small and mediumsized enterprise smes comprise percent all firm that sell good and service abroad halabisky lee and parsley and sme exporter contribute far more than their proportional share job creation given such strong link between export growth and canadian economic welfare important understand the obstacle that may limit smes growth one potential barrier access financial capital the extent that exporter firm are relatively disadvantaged with respect debt financing their ability engage market development and compete internationally potentially compromised financing essential ingredient the growth and survival business however commercial lender typically treat small loan personal loan the owner the business and such loan are increasingly adjudicated through credit scoring method lender also often require security either the form collaterizable asset the business owner from loan guarantee program such the canada small business financing program for exporter both inventory and account receivable may held offshore client supplier potentially increasing exporter firm risk exposure therefore the primary goal this study examine empirically the extent which canadian sme exporter firm face disproportionate difficulty accessing debt financing from commercial lender accordingly the result described here report the analysis two related research question what extent market failure and imperfection limit access capital canadian sme exporter what the nature any such imperfection and what form remediation best suited redress such failure answer these question this paper organized follows the first part provides summary previous related research leading development the study proposition this followed outline the data and methodology employed the paper provides breakdown salient attribute canadian exporter smes empirical finding are then detailed and the paper close with discussion the finding implication and limitation the work well suggestion for future research halabisky lee and parsley report that percent all job created canada between and were attributable the percent firm that exported canadian sme exporter previous research decreasing telecommunication cost integrated transportation expanded information network and increasing globalization trade among other factor are enabling even the smallest firm export according statistic canada percent canadian smes export and average canadian sme exporter derive percent sale revenue from export the vast majority canadian firm have fewer than five employee yet approximately percent even these microfirms reported revenue from export sale the propensity export increase with the size the enterprise among firm with employee percent reported export sale one quarter company with employee exported statistic canada widely understood that goodsproducing firm are more likely export examine this belief table provides breakdown the canadian population smes north american industry classification system naics sector and exporter status true that firm the manufacturing and knowledgebased sector were especially likely exporter percent manufacturer and percent knowledgebased firm reported revenue from export sale during statistic canada the proportion exporter among service firm lower than that manufacturing table show that because the sheer size the service sector however service firm account for more than canada exporter smes with another exporter firm the retail and wholesale sector exporter the manufacturing sector represent than percent all sme exporter financing gap and canadian sme exporter conceptually the presence financing gap especially small and mediumsized enterprise been the subject extensive research and debate for the last several decade see cressy and parker for comprehensive review this literature gap the capital market have traditionally been ascribed information asymmetry typically situation where the borrower assumed hold more information about the future the enterprise than the lender parker state the case information about small firm may limited and asymmetric stacked the side the borrower the lender hazard this led many influential academic and politician claim that these problem can severe that the supply finance may disappear altogether bank argued may ration credit new enterprise strangling new dynamic and innovative future industrial giant birth for the purpose this study small and mediumsized enterprise exporter are defined business with fewer than employee and than million annual revenue that sold good service outside canada during this definition excludes nonprofit and government organization school hospital subsidiary cooperative and financing and leasing company halabisky lee and parsley report that approximately percent small business firm with employee and percent mediumsized firm employee export however this estimate drawn from statistic canada exporter registry and includes only merchandise good exporter also statistic canada exporter registry doe not count exporter establishment that export than export least one year table smes and sme exporter sector all smes total total exporter smes sector professional service wholesale and retail manufacturing other service primary transportation and warehousing other total source sme financing data initiative statistic canada survey financing small and medium enterprise firm firm according this literature oecd among others capital market gap exists among loan applicant who appear identical some receive credit while others not there are identifiable group the population that are unable obtain financing any price the presence capital market gap suggests imperfection the marketplace and may justify intervention however brierley also note that there are danger inherent intervention that are not founded clear evidence gap the absence market failure such initiative may themselves cause distortion subsidizing considerable public cost nonviable firm which are not attracting enough capital because they not offer good investment opportunity the extent that sme exporter comprise identifiable group that able obtain financing than nonexporters capital market gap may implied and intervention warranted conceptually one could argue that exporter asset structure comprise account receivable due from foreign client and inventory that may transit both situation that might arguably increase the informational asymmetry between borrower and lender and thereby contribute the concern lender that systemically ass exporter facing relatively greater risk among sme exporter subgroup particular interest that known international new venture invs invs are important because they defy the widely accepted stage theory internationalization whereby firm are thought evolve exporting after starting locally expanding regionally and nationally and only then gaining the economy scale necessary enter international trade oviatt and mcdougall and knight and cavusgil were among the first note that some small firm exported virtually from inception although rapid internationalization small firm identified early the largely overlooked researcher zahra add this discussion arguing that invs face three type liability any which can increase the risk invs potential failure and thereby reduce firm access debt financing these liability include newness and inexperience which according zahra limit access resource including financial resource size that many invs are small firm with few slack resource constraining their ability compete and foreignness invs requiring them work especially hard overcome barrier entry addition the conceptual argument that newness size and dependence foreign client may exacerbate information asymmetry there appears some suggestive empirical evidence that sme exporter may face greater difficulty accessing capital relative nonexporters recent result from the sme financing data initiative sme fdi indicate that loan application from exporter least first glance appear have been turned down more often than loan application from nonexporters although the difference turndown rate between the two category firm not statistically significant allowance for size other attribute firm made noted above exporter firm are systematically larger than nonexporters and because the larger size they ought more creditworthy hence the stated difference turndown rate may potentially understate the underlying difference once size and perhaps other factor controlled for therefore the extent which turndown rate differ after controlling for other determinant access credit remains unclear this study seek test empirically the extent which exporter smes face disproportionate access commercial loan after accounting for size and other potential determinant creditworthiness accommodate this task the following research proposition are employed framework proposition after controlling for firm size sector and other salient measure creditworthiness exporter smes experience relatively access and worse term associated with commercial loan proposition among exporter smes international new venture experience relatively access and worse term associated with commercial loan data and methodology source data data for this study were obtained from the survey financing small and medium enterprise joint initiative statistic canada finance canada and industry canada part program that seek help inform public policy through collection and analysis financing data representative the population canadian smes the sampling frame for the survey comprised enterprise drawn randomly from statistic canada business register the survey conducted between september and march and comprised two part the first part consisted computeraided telephone interview primary owner business the sampling frame this portion the survey collected extensive firm and owner demographic information well data sme financing data initiative statistic canada survey financing small and medium enterprise table addition table show that exporter were significantly more likely identify access financing barrier growth than nonexporters also survey member conducted the canadian federation independent business cfib report that disproportionate number younger highgrowth firm were among those business that were unable obtain the financing they sought bruce financing and leasing company cooperative subsidiary nonprofit organization government organization school hospital and other public sector organization are not covered this survey regarding the firm most recent application for financing eligible enterprise had gross annual revenue than million had fewer than fulltimeequivalent employee and were operational during the reference year estimate loan outcome were generated from response obtained from smes response rate percent inscope business estimate related the second part the survey financial statement information were generated from faxback response paper questionnaire obtained from the respondent sampling weight were applied compiling estimate order that individual enterprise the sample were weighted according their representation the target population methodology comparison financing experience between the two set firm exporter and nonexporters needed conducted the extent possible ceteris paribus basis controlling for those factor that are reasonable determinant financing outcome and that may also vary systematically between the two group firm accordingly essential identify and measure factor that supplier capital normally and reasonably consider their financing decision the empirical challenge determine the impact two type factor associated with access and term credit the first set factor includes those that are generally considered legitimate determinant financing decision determinant creditworthiness such owner track record firm attribute etc the other type factor that across which gap been hypothesized this study whether not firm exporter business analysis must evaluate the impact exporter propensity access credit while allowing for the effect legitimate determinant credit the first step the analysis essentially the estimation and validation the equivalent credit scoring model that provides reliable estimation the actual lending decision contained the data the approach used here estimate logistic regression model the determinant outcome term loan application and separately outcome new application for operating loan line credit based data from the survey financing small and medium enterprise this approach similar credit scoring that the dependent variable whether not loan application turned down statistically related set independent variable that reflect attribute the borrower firm ownership and measure creditworthiness therefore the scoring model derived here replication commercial lender decision based loan decision outcome revealed the survey data the second step examine the extent which the accuracy the model improved adding variable that connotes whether not firm exporter inv finding credit market gap would consistent with result that export propensity statistically and materially significant factor credit scoring model loan decision that already control for other determinant credit estimate model lender credit decision variable were identified the basis two source the first source the academic and professional literature finance textbook and bank training material have long stressed the commercial lending see for example wwwsmallbusinessfinancetipscomestablishingbusinesscredithtml according this standard determinant credit outcome include the firm ability service the loan capacity the firm reliance debt capitalization the firm sensitivity economic condition the character the principal owner and the borrower collateral addition the literature credit rationing identified potential determinant credit decision that included the firm relationship with the lender the size the borrower firm the human capital the owner and the collateral available the second source contained response the survey itself question the survey asks those respondent whose loan application were turned down identify what reason were given the business the credit supplier for refusing provide the loan the most frequent reason respondent reported were that the applicant firm had insufficient income sale revenue that the firm owner lacked the necessary track record credit history wwwsmefdigccaepicsitesmefdiprfpmensfenehtml table these two source potential criterion are synthesized table and broken down between exporter firm and nonexporters analysis loan turndown need take these factor into consideration order determine exporter and nonexporters differ after accounting for potential systemic difference the key determinant access credit shown table the sme fdi survey data allowed for measurement many the factor that influence lender credit decision inspection table suggests that some the measure these factor are likely correlated with others given this potential for collinearity appropriate use principal component analysis reduce the number variable the data stevens the use principal component analysis also allows determination the extent which the logical dimension under which the variable are categorized table hold empirically the result applying principal component analysis measure the potential lending criterion table are presented table inspection the factor solution reveals five principal component for which the eigenvalue all exceeded the principal component identified table generally correspond well with the logical dimension outlined table stevens note blind use the eigenvalue criterion can lead retaining factor which may have practical significance yet blind use the scree test might lead not retaining factor which although they account for smaller amount variance might practically significant here the first factor appears associated with the age the firm and the second factor express firm size the third factor relates lender collateral demand the fourth factor link the number account manager with whom the firm had dealt the final factor show that firm debttoasset ratio correlated with research and development intensity for these data the debttoasset ratio measured following financing and therefore correlated with the loan decision accordingly ought not used potential explanatory variable conversely intensity according the literature related export propensity doutriaux and chamberlin accordingly the variable chosen represent this factor structure were intensity collateral requirement and the number fulltimeequivalent employee table lending criterion criterion character capacity measure length relationship with financial institution year age firm year age owner year total revenue direct expense fulltimeequivalent employee total asset total equity industry sector capital condition collateral availability personal asset for collateral availability commercial asset for collateral cosignature requirement nonexporters exporter the analysis focus only formal application for term loan and new line credit also seems reasonable expect that lending criterion differ across the type loan application for example mortgage loan would arguably depend mainly the value and liquidity the underlying asset being financed likewise decision term loan and operating loan may reflect different weighting decision criterion thus the model loan outcome estimated here are specific each type loan this account for the possibility that exporter firm may face different challenge getting term loan compared with those they might face when they seek operating loan this investigation limited these two type loan because spite the large number respondent the survey there were too few exporter applicant other form debt financing permit reliable model estimation wynant and hatch noted that from borrower perspective loan application are often declined the basis initial discussion between loan account manager and potential borrower client wynant and hatch estimated that percent informal inquiry resulted perceived loan turndown and that further percent were deferred the banker until the client provided further information because information informal turndown nebulous this work considers only those application that were sufficiently formal that documentation involved for this purpose formal application were defined those which the borrower submitted documentation the lender support the request for financing this evidenced respondent answer question the survey what document were requested the credit supplier part the application process table principal component analysis lending criterion factor loading for ease interpretation loading than are suppressed variable experience

previously addition these variable binary variable corresponding industry classification were also employed first approach the logistic regression model were estimated using all the variable but with sequential deletion those variable that appeared nonsignificant percent level significance this approach resulted model that explained statistically significant proportion the variation loan turndown the leftmost column table and report for operating and term loan application respectively result the estimation the base logistic regression that seek relate turndown frequency with attribute the firm both case the model displayed statistically significant goodnessoffit measure hosmer lemeshow statistic are not significant indicating that the goodnessoffit acceptable level for insample predictive purpose the pseudorsquare measure are not high one might hope however they are reasonable for crosssectional data where data such beacon score are not available order test for possible differential access credit between exporter and nonexporters and take into account the impact earlystage firm with respect both access credit and the role invs categorical variable introduced into the analysis that connoted four type firm firm that started trading since january startup and also reported exporting these are consistent with the definition international new venture firm that started trading since january startup but did not report exporting firm that started trading prior january nonstartups and also reported exporting and firm that started trading prior january nonstartups but did not report exporting the rightmost column table and display the logistic regression model for operating and term loan application respectively when expanded the addition the categorical variable mentioned above the case operating loan the addition these variable added significantly pvalue the explanatory power the regression this implies that the likelihood being turned down for operating loan depends statistically significant extent the category specifically table show that earlystage firm those started since are significantly more likely turned down for operating loan than established firm after allowing for factor such firm size sector collateral etc specifically interpretation the exp column reveals that nonexporter startup firm are time more likely turned down for operating loan than nonexporter established firm after allowing for the other factor the model more importantly startup exporter invs are more likely have loan application rejected than nonexporter startup firm this difference statistically significant again after accounting for the determinant credit decision used here for term loan application table similar pattern identified however the difference not strong statistically with the difference turndown rate between startup exporter and other firm being significant only pvalue these result confirm that after allowing for other determinant credit decision earlystage firm face relatively greater difficulty obtaining operating loan compared with established nonexporting smes new nonexporting smes are percent more likely turned down evidence that earlystage nonexporting firm also face difficulty obtaining term loan not strong however this may understandable because term loan are often secured the asset that the loan financing among exporter smes the evidence even more compelling earlystage sme exporter are more than four time likely turned down for operating loan established firm whether the established firm are exporter not addition

source sme financing data initiative statistic canada survey financing small and medium enterprise summary discussion and conclusion the primary goal this study examine empirically the extent which canadian sme exporter firm face disproportionate difficulty accessing debt financing from commercial lender the analysis reported here indeed show that commercial lender reject application for operating loan from earlystage sme exporter unusually often earlystage nonexporting firm are approximately percent more likely have loan application turned down than established firm even after allowing for several plausible determinant creditworthiness earlystage exporter smes are more than four time likely again have application for operating loan rejected although result are not strong from statistical point view for term loan application similar pattern noted financing essential ingredient the development growth and survival business technological change and globalization have better enabled invs exploit opportunity international market however this study found that startup exporter firm are relatively disadvantaged with respect debt financing this potentially limit these firm ability engage market development and compete internationally the extent that canadian invs are financeconstrained will increasingly difficult for such firm prosper within canada relatively small home market constraint invs ability grow through export market development potentially compromise their ability contribute job creation and national prosperity brierley argues that intervention should targeted those area where market imperfection can identified this end many nation and trade association have undertaken initiative that seek redress perceived imperfection typically these involve support for financing operating loan step stimulate the formation risk capital the literature capital rationing and capital gap suggests that for market gap exist imperfection the financial marketplace must present this study found that particular category firm earlystage exporter appears face relatively greater difficulty accessing commercial loan this result consistent with but not proof financing gap according the second criterion adopted the organisation for economic cooperation and development oecd however this not definitive evidence gap because one could argue that such firm face additional risk even when compared with other startup firm earlystage exporter may perceived risky because important asset such account receivable and portion inventory may offshore and held client country from which realizing the receivables may risky however further research required investigate this point although sme fdi data have allowed new insight into the financing smes and sme exporter gap our understanding remain noted earlier future work might investigate the impact country destination export with respect lender loan decision further research also required study the impact lending decision business owner export decision what extent loan turndown decision deter business owner from exporting other area research could include further examination invs and the type financing they need grow and survive the global economy these invs are more innovative have higher expenditure activity than other smes and thus their demand for equity financing are higher although the research presented this report focused access debt subsequent study could focus the request for and potential turndown informal and formal form risk capital financing these and other research direction could explored through modification future iteration the sme fdi survey process other topic for future research pertain the interaction sme exporter prospective exporter firm and financial institution for example this study doe not and can not examine lending decision the context established firm that are seeking undertake international trade would useful understand better the role lending decision made the point that established domestic firm seek financing fund development export market would also interest understand better the extent which business borrower decide forgo exporting out belief that they may not qualify for financing also remains ascertain the difficulty and barrier financial and nonfinancial encountered established firm that are the point exporting there minimum threshold level production required for export and how might this threshold vary across type enterprise these are among the dimension for future research the finding which would help provide better information which base policy decision reference brierley the financing technologybased small firm review the literature bank england quarterly bulletin london spring bruce banking
