recognized one the most important innovation the financial and banking industry and evolving rapid speed driven part the sharing economy favorable regulation and information technology the fintech revolution the emergence fintechs company drawn much speculation about their potential disrupt incumbent financial institution and take much their earnings oshodin molla karanasios ong clayton christensen disruptive innovation theory dit one the most influential theory academic and management literature hungenberg suggests broad definition the concept innovation which say innovation refers all change process which organization transforms labor capital material and information into product service greater value christensen xiii thus addition creating new process and product innovation also includes new type business model hungenberg moreover his theory defines two different type innovation the first one sustaining innovation generates growth offering better performance existing market fact these innovation are exploited investigating the perception fintechs disruptive innovation the banking industry successfully the established player industry and not lead revolutionary change hungenberg differently disruptive innovation are usually brought the market successfully new entrant and have lower performance the traditionally most important performance criterion such functionality speed size usually manager incumbent firm are unwilling support disruptive innovation the first reason they usually not completely realize the need the firm existing and most profitable customer the second reason that they offer lower profit margin than sustaining innovation hungenberg finally not always easy apply the category disruptive and sustaining innovation practice and the reason that the term disruption relative christensen mean that even specific innovation disruptive one actor industry might sustaining another one figure disruptive innovation model source christensen this diagram the red line show how product service improve over time and the blue line show customer willing pay for performance fact contrast product performance trajectory with customer demand trajectory incumbent company introduce product service upper red line incumbent sustaining trajectory satisfy the high end the market which also the most profitable doing they miss the need the low end the market which also the least profitable segment new entrant red line entrant disruptive trajectory improve the performance their offering and move upmarket where the investigating the perception fintechs disruptive innovation the banking industry profitability higher for them too and doing this the challenge the dominance the incumbent clayton however still unclear fintech can considered disruptive sustaining innovator despite this concern necessary understand fintech company can considered part the banking industry innovative solution and service associated with fintechs startup firm incumbent financial institution such bank and technology firm such telecommunication and mobile technology company are creating new ecosystem financial service puschmann zavolokina dolata schwabe moreover needed define fintech company represent opportunity threat the banking industry some author argue that fintechs are posing threat challenge traditional institution such bank bunea kogan stolin investigating the perception fintechs disruptive innovation the banking industry research question and assumption presented the previous chapter the introduction the most recent digital development the banking industry have seen the flourishing new member mackenzie fintechs attract customer with product and service that are more userfriendly efficient transparent and automated than those currently available nowadays traditional bank have not yet exhausted the possibility for improvement along these line ebf mackenzie moreover still unclear fintech can considered disruptive

developed that will used the guideline throughout the paper the following how doe the perception fintechs the banking industry influence their strategy this perception will analyzed from short and long term perspective well from fintechs point view and banking industry expert assumption based the abovementioned research question the next section outline the assumption this study considered appropriate divide the assumption into three main group financial technology banking industry and disruptive innovation theory dit also the theoretical framework and interview design are following the same structure the assumption regarding the disruptive innovation theory dit the following not clear member operating the financial and banking industry whether fintech company represent disruptive sustaining innovation investigating the perception fintechs disruptive innovation the banking industry sentiment regarding the disruptive nature fintechs are contrasting recent financial time survey indicates that the financial service disruptive sector concerned about the potential several digitalbased technology applied financial service such blockchain big data and robotadvisers chiu however like christensen the father the disruptive innovation theory dit point out not always easy apply the category disruptive and sustaining innovation practice even people who deeply understood the theory disruptive innovation struggled use them repeatable and methodical fashion christensen this because disruption relative term christensen and raynor and even though particular innovation disruptive one player industry might sustained another for example the internet believed disruptive innovation while reality turned out sustaining nature fact the internet had sustaining impact strengthened the position the established market leader hungenberg further assumption can categorized part the banking industry section fintechs and traditional bank don know how collaborate with each other most suitable strategic alliance partnership between them are not yet defined matter fact bank face sluggish innovation process and fintechs take advantage the digital era employ customercentric solution ansari krop although bank have realized that cooperation with fintechs key approach foster innovation they struggle address the associated challenge crucial close this research gap better understand how technologydriven organization and traditional bank can cooperate with each other drasch the second assumption the banking industry section the following the relationship between traditional bank and fintech company not well defined still unclear fintechs represent challenge opportunity for traditional bank the rapid rise fintech changed the business landscape banking asking for more

short run reach this goal will needed conduct between two three interview when constructing the question used for the interview which are shown appendix the literature provided the basis for the question this done order gain response that were relevant the research question for this purpose the interview divided into three main part introduction main body and conclusion the main body subdivided microareas banking industry disruptive innovation theory dit and financial technology the approximative length will between and minute moreover pilot interview will conducted test feasibility knowledgeability clearness and length for this reason the interview can subject further modification the second step this research interview specialist working for fintechs the main aim understand how fintechs perceive themselves the market and how this perception affect their collaboration with traditional bank reach this goal will conduct between five six interview the structure the interview similar the one above and includes three main part introduction main body and conclusion the main body subdivided microareas banking industry competitor and financial technology but
