topical influencers explain each these type underneath macroinfluencers and microinfluencers macro influencers are widely recognized and are able draw brand awareness quickly they have the largest following ummenhofer example macroinfluencer would celebrity due their large fan base macroinfluencers are considered trendsetters they are able reach wide audience short space time however according haapasalmi macroinfluencers are often only successful influencing many individual impulse purchase they lack real personal connection with all their follower contrast this microinfluencers have significantly lower number follower they however maintain the same manner communication macroinfluencers kohler microinfluencers have much narrower focus topic and interest and therefore attract

obtained from qualitative case research from the angle the research question put forward the first chapter can expect good result from the sample determining whether the sample can give good response can amongst others done looking the demographic composition indeed important note that the composition the sample population play important role determining the accuracy the result first our respondent were selected from representative list well recognized and performing smes the arab world the age most our respondent between and year only two were younger this might indicate that their level experience and thus ability take decision high enough according the position they executed their company most said they had been working various other position before taking their marketing responsibility men and woman were about equally represented the sample can assume they were all capable taking the decision they were asked about and were knowledgeable about how company function given their diverse experience before assuming marketing position all respondent also had higher education degree although mostly bachelor level only only two had obtained master degree this the mena region quite normal for marketing position sme doe not prove their absolute proficiency marketing however majority the sample population stated that they held marketing accreditation and some type marketing consultation position with the sme this mean that they had some level knowledge and skill matter marketing and therefore good understanding marketing issue the number executive entry levelcustomer service representative and manager also equally represented across the sample one participant asserted that their position within the sme outside the scope the choice the interview but able answer completely and with full understanding from these demographic data can ascertained that this probably the right sample population and hence positive research outcome could expected the only negative element that only covered sample respondent also important note that our respondent mostly have positive view their employer marketer three them ranked their employer great credibility while four ranked the credibility the employer fair the awareness level most the participant rated their employer great with only few giving them fair rating the approach giving recommendation ranked good five the participant while two rated these recommendation poor the effectiveness level finally four the participant ranked their employer good with three giving them excellent rating these ranking indicate that the current marketing strategy used the sme our sample are not fully efficient also indicates the necessity look new avenue for better marketing such influencer marketing which social medium were used our sme their influencer marketing effort the most commonly used social medium site our sample twitter four the organization indeed use twitter the main social medium for their advertising facebook used two sme only and only one the sample company instagram for marketing purpose twitter marketing can our eye utilized more intensely sme but would more effective the company extends social medium use other social medium site this might explain our result though only obtained for small sample extension other social medium site can also done facebook spite the high use facebook people general and sme particular underused for marketing purpose although would enable company reach people who are not active twitter and thus would increase the efficiency the marketing process quite naturally more used for private social medium contact given the recent privacy problem facebook experienced however believe that wise for company extremely careful using marketing tool and certainly control privacy setting carefully research question influencer marketing strategy have positive effect customer acquisition sme the positive effect influencer marketing customer acquisition very specific aspect the sme marketing strategy actually looking whether using influencer marketing would effective marketing tool general should question that previously addressed with regard perception online social medium influencers most the respondent agreed that influencers marketer are likely have the best interest the consumer mind and that they will not endorse harmful product service this mean that would beneficial the organization using them communication agent the fact that influencer marketer have the best interest the organization mind indeed mean that they will work for the improved increased sale the company nevertheless our respondent stated that social medium influencers are their eye not likely make any difference term sale all making imperative for management carry out good cost benefit analysis before making decision whether engage social influencer marketing strategy not engage one participant acknowledged not sure the effectiveness influencer marketing believe this hesitation mostly based the major challenge influencer marketing face before being adopted namely finding the right influencers who are credible and reliable once this problem overcome belief the effectiveness influencer marketing grows within the sme will come back that aspect when discussing our result with respect research question section while two our participant believed influencer marketing would have the ability directly affect the acquisition new customer three the participant stated they believe online influencer marketing have only indirect effect the customer acquisition rate sme two respondent believe there effect all are unsure given that influencer marketer are not considered have negative interest and would not publicize anything that would put the organization bad light this quite surprising influencers are indeed chosen because their huge following social medium and thus their potential influence new customer try product and service they promote influencer marketing also expected have effect the expansion the private sector customer base yet their influence apparently supposed not reach that far although our respondent think advantageous use influencer marketing possible explanation might situated the fact that sme manager think too much term increased sale the major effect influencer marketing and even marketing general although clearly asked about customer acquisition influencer marketing only communication tool the follower influencers are exposed the message their influencers and might try the product out acquisition but not necessarily stay customer that case the increase sale would over somewhat longer period eventually over year the term which manager mostly think not increase all only slightly this reasoning also explains why our respondent clearly opted for indirect effect influencer marketing answer this research question moreover this asks for analysis result both the short the medium and the long term research question why smes choose social medium influencers instead other marketing tool literature indicates that the use influencer marketing often inspired the fact that these promoter product and service are lot expensive than real medium star previously used the called opinion leader moreover given the huge following social medium influencers have their effectiveness leader might number but more term result per dollar spent given however that the influence these social medium leader mostly considered indirect see previous section our research doe not directly point this type effect furthermore our research did not deep enough ask the participant about the several type influencers presumed they would not necessarily know about this scientific subdivision presented section thus did not verify whether the use microinfluencers suggested previous research could improve the perception social medium influencer marketing sme and increase use marketing tool research question which position doe influencer marketing take the overall marketing strategy smes could deduced from our interview that most our respondent believe influencer marketing effective marketing tool yet the belief based the way they perceive the role influencer marketing complete marketing program for the product and service the company they clearly stated that combination with other marketing tool and combination more than one influencer marketing tool would more effective would able cover wider range customer five our respondent believed that combining two more tool would indeed more effective the two others felt that influencer marketing could eventually effective own but are not sure these result may not surprise after all any communication effort marketing part vaster marketing mix and can not own create the marketing result full marketing plan able achieve thus influencer marketing seen complementary marketing tool within broad marketing action plan that case effectiveness believed increase exponentially and literature mentioned chapter indicates that case would become more common use probably people who not believe influencer marketing otherwise would become convinced well then and only then would also increase the awareness the existing private sector and foster innovation and entrepreneurship skill research question what are the challenge associated with influencer marketing strategy smes according most the participant the major challenge with regard influencer marketing finding reliable and credible influencer order find reliable influencer therefore the organization should carry out proper research before settling marketing influencer for their product service four the respondent felt that this the most challenging issue associated with influencer marketing moreover the fact that having successful influencer marketing campaign dependent who the influencers are mean that this very significant and even critical challenge solution might ask for help from marketing agency that are expert influencer marketing and normally have base good and reliable influencers propose these agency could also guide the company developing good influencer marketing program general using the most appropriate tool the right moment looking the credential number influencers have marketing campaign for other sme might way doing yourself using marketing agency will also increase the cost this certainly problem our respondent also mentioned second challenge good influencer marketing difficulty measuring the return investment according one the respondent also important challenge influencer marketing this make difficult for the organization determine the amount money allocated for the campaign suggestion would that the organization determines the volume sale before the use influencer marketing and compare with the volume sale after influencer marketer campaign been employed two our respondent believe that attracting the right influencers this problem would also partially solved thus linking the two challenge mentioned the interview corroboration these result important note here that conducted two more interview with the influencers confronting them with these result most the response that were obtained from these interview confirmed the information received from the interview with the respondent the smes will only indicate few important point here these interview were extremely short general can conclude that our research indicated that influencer marketing can effective and relatively cheap compared conventional method marketing however there are some challenge that are experienced and which should addressed order increase the efficiency the marketing which the selection the right influencer the use several social medium tool together and more performant way calculating the cost benefit are the most important one chapter six conclusion and recommendation conclusion and recommendation
