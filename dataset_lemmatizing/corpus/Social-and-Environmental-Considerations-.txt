integration the social and environmental pursuit into the business strategy see table however there direct relationship between the social and environmental concern the one hand and the typology the startup financing the other hand taking into account the number the investigated startup each financing stage only the firm included the category bootstrapped profitable and seed capital will analysed the vast majority the bootstrapped startup are economicdriven approx not guided environmental social reason however the social concern are time higher than the environmental one when designing the
