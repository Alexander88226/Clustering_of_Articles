bherein fileenterprise financing modeling based information asymmetry kun yang school management beijing union university prchina gltxukun buueducn information asymmetry the main problem restricted small and middlesized enterprise abstract smes financing this paper applies fuzzy comprehensive evaluation design the screening model smes order deal with the issue information asymmetry the classical screening theory stiglitzjosephe and the score method edwardialtman are used the model designing the model originally build multilevel screening system integrated the financial and nonfinancial indicator finally analysis and evaluation the screening model indicates that benefit establish new order for the investment and financing market keywordsscreening model design information asymmetry fuzzy comprehensive evaluation introduction the condition information asymmetric more and more scholar had focused the enterprise financing since especially smes size transaction cost and other factor the phenomenon poor information transparency particularly acute recent year chinese scholar had made more research depth they had reached consensus the academic community the reason difficulty for smes financing information asymmetry scholar had also made number countermeasure such advocating the development small and mediumsized financial institution from justin lin and wang xiao making full use private capital market from guo bin and wei the establishment cooperative financial institution from people bank china behalf mission improving the capital market system from wang xuanyu the development venture capital from chen naixing using the thirdparty credit information and credit mechanism from tang jianxin etc however the diversification financing method had not solved the issue information asymmetry completely the effective implementation these measure must built the basis information symmetry and transparency since the credit assessment had become the main method ass corporate credit rating estimationanalysis method had been judged the mainstream the international academic analysis the representative model were altman bankruptcy prediction model chesser creditforecasting model bathory creditanalysis model the operating assetsevaluation model however some smes accounting system and the accuracy financial data had not been satisfactory useless apply original model mechanically therefore benefit establish smes information screening system theoretical base and composition the screening model theoretical base the screening model stiglitz joseph who had won the nobel prize economics for working the issue asymmetric information had proposed screening originally his representative theory screening education and income distribution which the theoretical base for the further research stiglitz believed that there were several mechanism make enterprise private information become public information selfselection mechanism this important way access information this mechanism the enterprise had displayed the more prominent feature their own especially the system reward and punishment testing mechanism had measured the accuracy and reliability selfscreening order avoid the noise impact the screening process composition the screening model the purpose establishing screening mechanism for smes financing screening out the lowrisk financier through quality index information this condition benefit for smes extricate predicament high threshold trust discount provide good quality environment for the better enterprise the screening system had included three level fig the first level initial screening based selfselection the enterprise had showed themselves through the disclosure private information and investor could use the financial and non financial indicator implement systemic analysis the second level the noise screening the result preliminary screening wouldn accepted arbitrarily for the existence noise the enterprise were likely make use their information superiority the transmission process take accounting fraud consequently evaluation internal and external monitoring mechanism would minimize the impact noise and the noise screening necessary amendment the result initial screening the third level characteristic screening recent year the credit system had improved continued well people awareness credit accordingly should make full use these supplementary resource the screening system designing screening small and middlesized enterprise financing initial screening noise screening characteristic screening financial indicator internal monitoring mechanism allied credit system nonfinancial indicator external monitoring mechanism individual credit system figure multilevel screening system designing step screening model the basic assumption object grouping research had proved that pooling equilibrium and separate equilibrium were coexistence the balanced environment pooling equilibrium could not exist market information asymmetry different investor have different investment choice assuming that investment program for denoted information quality index denoted investment probability supposed there were only two type investment program and the selection rule the possibility and the amount investment had depended information quality index element the model based the aforementioned three major level and seven index course there were many other factor also have impact smes financing such the potential development enterprise screening cost etc had just neglected these factor this research model element determining credit risk and credit limit preliminary screening had been adopted identify credit risk and credit limit through the financial and nonfinancial indicator the research based wellknown value score method advanced edward altman had observed bankruptcy and nonbankrupt enterprise the united state and had taken financial ratio for the selection mathematical statistic finally had determined the best indicator financial ratio calculate score order measure credit risk and credit limit zxxxxx operation capital total asset retained earnings total asset ebit total asset total stockholder equity total liability revenue total asset order evaluate more objectively two nonfinancial indicator had been added denoted the management capacity subjective judgment team spirit management decisionmaking speed ability staff participate and enterprise culture denoted the growth capacity the growth rate net asset the growth rate operating profit the growth rate sale the growth rate total wage this model the seven variable value remains unchanged but new xxxxxx axweights aaaaaa would given when necessary the formula axx evaluation the internal monitoring internal control system important part corporate governance including board supervisor audit committee and the internal audit department this system could not only maintain balance the board and management management and other functional department but also improve the financial system and change the bad habit information disclosure through evaluation and supervision and the internal audit report would amend the risk degree obtaining the investment formula evaluation the external monitoring the research risk degree investment based the evaluation financial indicator the authenticity and accuracy the financial indicator essential due the relatively objective position external audit what kind conclusion that the external audit made significant reduce the noise effect the financial evaluation addition the credibility external audit should also taken into account monitoring allied credit system the multiinformationsharing system could provide the integrated credibility the enterprise which very useful for the investor evaluate the financing and operation status meanwhile necessary link personal credit system because the credit record manager important supplement smes credit model frame fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method the method using the idea fuzzy mathematics make overall evaluation the multifactor restricted object screening model smes financing axya based the fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method combined with financial and nonfinancial indicator used internal and external monitoring system amend the evaluation factor and taken the allied credit system and the credit rating index the necessary supplement the model follows bcs bcombined with formula the model can defined follows dmmj dmmcc max bii iii assumption iiii iiji selecting different value accordance with the integrity internal control system and internal audit opinion when the monitoring system sound and internal audit issued the unqualified opinion when the regulatory system inadequate internal audit issued the negative opinion selecting different value according the external audit opinion when the external auditor issued the unqualified opinion when the external auditor issued negative opinion and for weight determining the value the score allied credit system determining the value the score individual credit system respectively denoted the weight the quality index allied credit system and individual credit dsystem analysis and evaluation the screening model model analysis according the basic assumption the research had only focused two type investment program and supposed were particular denoted the maximum the index information quality denoted the minimum the index information quality denoted sme and the corresponding investment program for the process screening follows with the private information the step initial screening the calculated value greater than the threshold indicating that the enterprise had operated properly the noise screening had showed that the enterprise internal and external monitoring mechanism were efficient and the information authentic and fair few noise represented that the result first step more believable meanwhile credit rating system also had shown higher level credibility therefore the three part the screening result had proved that the best quality the information that the probability investment acquisition the highest denoted another sme and the corresponding investment program for the process screening follows initial screening the calculated value than the threshold indicating that the operating result dissatisfied the external monitoring mechanism had found that the existence more serious distortion information and ineffective oversight the problem addition credit rating system had shown lower level credibility considering the result three screening completely the index information quality the minimum that the probability investment acquisition the lowest the unsatisfactory index probably due inefficient fund management inadequate governance structure poor reputation etc worth noting that the actual situation not simple the assumption reality the financier situation would more intricate value between the range and and leading more investment program using mode reflect the result several screening the ideal program for all the score threestep screening were excellent and the most unsatisfactory program for poor performance all aspect actual practice more situation were between the range which could summarized into eight major case the table program table eight major case screening mode characteristic screening noise screening initial screening composite index note initial screening good financial condition poor financial situation noise screening little effect the noise serious effect the noise characteristic screening better credit standing worse credit standing for these case the former model still applicable and the element and step screening were unchanged the investor the model could help determine whether invest and the amount investment the financier the model could useful find their own deficiency and prescribe the right remedy order make improvement and enhance the competitiveness financing model evaluation although the smes investment and financing market the booming some smes still could not get away from the financing difficulty the reason the selection mechanism mutualtrust and mutualbenefit hadn established the information screening model had built bridge for the investor and financier great benefit solve the problem asymmetric information for the smes higher index the screening model right model first the financing cost had reduced the screening mechanism smes the higher index could try avoid adverse selection and would not have raise interest rate for financing the lower one not only return for the symmetry but also reduced the financing cost second credibility had been reflected objectively most people had the stereotype smes that the small scale company would poor credibility and low index fact plenty smes were not lack good business reputation therefore the information screening mechanism would safeguard the right those enterprise for the smes lower index the screening model relief model under the screening model chance would place all the smes had find their own deficiency and make improvement for the favor investor one hand they should enhance the credibility and reduce the default risk the other hand they should improve the corporate governance structure and make the necessary disclosure avoid reverse choice for investor the screening model dialectical model first choose transparent the reason that the investor had taken adverse selection they faced with aaaaaaaa the unknown group while under the screening model information different enterprise could quantified and compared for the more transparency information investor could make positive choice according their own need and characteristic the financing secondrisk minimization with the transparency information the choice investor would much objective and fair generally the smes higher index would win the favor investor the financier were competing improve the quality the information the probability moral hazard would decline rapidly addition the performance capacity higher index enterprise were satisfactory and the default risk would also maintained lower level conclusion application the screening model would change the original lemon market for the financier accurate and timely disclosure private information investor could better grasp the market and make objective choice due the improvement symmetric information the original adverse selection and moral hazard had been reduced probability conclusion the financing smes would enter into virtuous circle conclusion this paper the model screening smes financing much operational and innovative had not only selected the financial and nonfinancial indicator but also brought noise screening and characteristic screening the model however due the restriction industry characteristic and supervision standard necessary promote widerdepth research obtain more detailed information what will the future research work reference economics information basic
