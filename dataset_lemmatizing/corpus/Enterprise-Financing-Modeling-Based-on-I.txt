trust discount provide good quality environment better enterprise screening system included three level fig first level initial screening based selfselection enterprise showed disclosure private information investor could use financial non financial indicator implement systemic analysis second level noise screening result preliminary screening accepted arbitrarily existence noise enterprise likely make use information superiority transmission process take accounting fraud consequently evaluation internal external monitoring mechanism would minimize impact noise noise screening necessary amendment result initial screening third level characteristic screening recent year credit system improved continued well people awareness credit accordingly make full use supplementary resource

pooling equilibrium separate equilibrium coexistence balanced environment pooling equilibrium could exist market information asymmetry different investor different investment choice assuming investment program denoted information quality index denoted investment probability supposed two type investment program selection rule possibility amount investment depended information quality index element model based aforementioned three major level seven index course many factor also impact smes financing potential development enterprise screening cost etc neglected factor research model element determining credit risk credit limit preliminary screening adopted identify credit risk credit limit financial nonfinancial indicator research based wellknown value score method advanced

individual credit system respectively denoted weight quality index allied credit system individual credit dsystem analysis evaluation screening model model analysis according basic assumption research focused two type investment program supposed particular denoted maximum index information quality denoted minimum index information quality denoted sme corresponding investment program process screening follows private information step initial screening calculated value greater threshold indicating enterprise operated properly noise screening showed enterprise internal external monitoring mechanism efficient information authentic fair noise represented result first step believable meanwhile credit rating system also shown higher level credibility therefore three part screening result proved best quality information probability investment acquisition highest denoted another sme corresponding investment program process screening follows initial screening calculated value threshold indicating operating result dissatisfied external monitoring mechanism found existence serious distortion information ineffective oversight problem addition credit rating system shown lower level credibility considering result three screening completely index information quality minimum probability investment acquisition lowest unsatisfactory index probably due inefficient fund management inadequate governance structure poor reputation etc worth noting actual situation simple assumption reality financier situation would intricate value range leading investment program using mode reflect result several screening ideal program score threestep screening excellent unsatisfactory program poor performance aspect actual practice situation range could summarized eight major case table program table eight major case screening mode characteristic screening noise screening initial screening composite index note initial screening good financial condition poor financial situation noise screening little effect noise serious effect noise characteristic screening better credit standing worse credit standing case former model still applicable element step screening unchanged investor model could help determine whether invest amount investment financier model could useful find deficiency prescribe right remedy order make improvement enhance competitiveness financing model evaluation although smes investment financing market booming smes still could get away financing difficulty reason selection mechanism mutualtrust mutualbenefit established information screening model built bridge investor financier great benefit solve problem asymmetric information smes higher index screening model right model first financing cost reduced screening mechanism smes higher index could try avoid adverse selection would raise interest rate financing lower one return symmetry also reduced financing cost second credibility reflected objectively people stereotype smes small scale company would poor credibility low index fact plenty smes lack good business reputation therefore information screening mechanism would safeguard right enterprise smes lower index screening model relief model screening model chance would place smes find deficiency make improvement favor investor one hand enhance credibility reduce default risk hand improve corporate governance structure make necessary disclosure avoid reverse choice investor screening model dialectical model first choose transparent reason investor taken adverse selection faced aaaaaaaa unknown group screening model information different enterprise could quantified compared transparency information investor could make positive choice according need characteristic financing secondrisk minimization transparency information choice investor would much objective fair generally smes higher index would win favor investor financier competing improve quality information probability moral hazard would decline rapidly addition performance capacity higher index enterprise satisfactory default risk would also maintained lower level conclusion application screening model would change original lemon market financier accurate timely disclosure private information investor could better grasp market make objective choice due improvement symmetric information original adverse selection moral hazard reduced probability conclusion financing smes would enter virtuous circle conclusion paper model screening smes financing much operational innovative selected financial nonfinancial indicator also brought
