internal monitoring internal control system important part corporate governance include board supervisor audit committee internal audit department system could maintain balance board management management functional department also improve financial system change bad habit information disclosure evaluation supervision internal audit report would amend risk degree obtain investment formula evaluation external monitoring research risk degree investment base evaluation financial indicator authenticity accuracy financial indicator essential due relatively objective position external audit kind conclusion external audit make significant reduce noise effect financial evaluation addition credibility external audit also take account monitoring allied credit system multiinformationsharing system could provide integrate credibility enterprise useful investor evaluate financing operation status meanwhile necessary link personal credit system credit record manager important supplement smes credit model frame fuzzy comprehensive evaluation method method use idea fuzzy mathematics make overall evaluation multifactor restrict object screen model smes financing base fuzzy comprehensive

index information quality denote sme correspond investment program process screen follow private information step initial screen calculate value great threshold indicate enterprise operate properly noise screen show enterprise internal external monitoring mechanism efficient information authentic fair noise represent result first step believable meanwhile credit rating system also show high

initial screen calculate value less threshold indicate operating result dissatisfied external monitoring mechanism found existence serious distortion information ineffective oversight problem addition credit rating system show low level credibility consider result three screen completely index information quality minimum probability investment acquisition low unsatisfactory index probably due inefficient fund management inadequate governance structure poor reputation etc worth note actual situation simple assumption reality financier situation would intricate value range lead investment program use mode reflect result several screen ideal program score threestep screen excellent unsatisfactory program poor performance aspect actual practice situation range could summarize eight major

screen little effect noise serious effect noise characteristic screen well credit stand bad credit stand case former model still applicable element step screen unchanged investor model could help determine whether invest amount investment financier model could useful find deficiency prescribe right remedy order make improvement enhance competitiveness financing model evaluation although smes investment financing market boom smes still could get away financing difficulty reason selection mechanism mutualtrust mutualbenefit establish information screen model built bridge investor financier great benefit solve problem asymmetric information smes high index screen model right model first financing cost reduce screen mechanism smes high index could try avoid adverse selection would raise interest rate financing low one return symmetry also reduce financing cost second credibility reflect objectively people stereotype smes small scale company would poor credibility low index fact plenty smes lack good business reputation therefore information screen mechanism would safeguard right enterprise smes low index screen model relief model screen model chance would place smes find deficiency make improvement favor investor one hand enhance credibility reduce default risk hand improve corporate governance structure make necessary disclosure avoid reverse choice investor screen model dialectical model first choose transparent reason investor take adverse selection face unknown group screen model information different enterprise could quantify compare transparency information investor could make positive choice accord need characteristic financing second risk minimization transparency information choice investor would much objective fair generally smes high index would win favor investor financier compete improve quality information probability moral hazard would decline rapidly addition performance capacity high index enterprise satisfactory default risk would also maintain low level conclusion application screen model would change original lemon market financier accurate timely disclosure private information investor could well grasp market make objective choice due improvement symmetric information original adverse selection moral hazard reduce probability conclusion financing smes would enter virtuous circle conclusion paper model screen smes financing much operational innovative select financial nonfinancial indicator also brought noise screen characteristic screen model however due restriction industry characteristic supervision standard
