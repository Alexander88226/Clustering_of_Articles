bherein file international financial architecture for stability and development cryptoassets and fintech mind the gap making basel standard work for developing country thorsten beck business school emily jones university oxford peter knaack university oxford march abstract international banking regulation are developed small group financial regulator largely from advanced economy offthe shelf adoption these standard developing country particularly low and lowermiddle income country pose substantial cost and risk yet many regulator are pressing ahead with them nevertheless partly due concern about reputation and competition explain why today world globalised finance regulator can not simply ignore international standard even they are illsuited their regulatory environment propose way that the international policy community can move from minimalist harm approach actively designing international standard that are genuinely useful for low and lowermiddle income country and support financial sector development international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech challenge challenge international banking standard pose challenge for lmics and introduce requirement designed the wake the global financial crisis the basel iii reform tighten capital and macroprudential tool these reform were agreed upon the member the basel committee banking supervision hereafter basel committee representing major advanced and emerging economy basel standard are designed address financial risk emanating from large complex bank with international operation requirement liquidity while principle only member country are obliged adopt and implement basel standard many nonmember are moving implementing them out surveyed nonmember jurisdiction were implementing preparing implement aspect basel while were implementing preparing implement aspect basel iii fsi striking that regulator many low and lowermiddle income country lmics are implementing international standard even though their jurisdiction feature simpler banking system and different financial risk profile overall the available evidence suggests that while there are strong argument for strengthening the regulation bank lmics far from clear that the basel standard are the most effective approach barth and caprio the implementation basel and iii pose particular challenge for lmics financial infrastructure gap even the simpler component basel and iii presume degree financial development and the existence infrastructure that not place many lmics for instance the standardised approach credit risk under basel relies credit rating agency but many lmics not have national rating agency and the penetration global rating agency there substantial literature see for example beck beck fuchs lossemueller and witte gobat yanase and maloney griffithjones and gottschalk louis kasekende kasekende bagyenda and brownbridge murinde murinde and mlambo powell rojassuarez rojassuarez and muhammad stephanou and mendoza international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech limited the largest corporation poor match for financial stability threat basel and iii address financial risk that may little relevance the simpler financial system lmics such counterparty risk for derivative exposure liquidity mismatch arising from wholesale funding conversely they may not adequately address key macroeconomic threat financial stability lmics such volatility crossborder capital flow and large swing global commodity price human and financial resource constraint implementing basel and iii imposes significant adjustment cost onto both bank and regulator the cost derive not from regulatory stringency capital requirement most lmics are higher than basel iii but from the complexity basel rule the implementation the new global standard exacerbates regulatory resource constraint that are already significant many lmics exacerbated information asymmetry many lmics remunerative difference and brain drain the private sector already pose challenge for regulatory authority information asymmetry may exacerbated when the more complex element basel and iii are implemented widening the scope for regulatory arbitrage distorted regulatory agenda implementing basel and iii may take scarce resource away from other priority task the regulatory agency implementation basel iiiii doe not necessarily address underlying weakness the regulatory system designed international standard embody complex regulatory regime not necessarily strong one deterioration credit composition bank that implement basel and iii may have incentive shift their portfolio away from sector the economy that are key for inclusive economic development for instance higher risk weight for loan small and medium enterprise smes may not properly reflect the potential benefit diversification away from few large enterprise and may discourage financial inclusion international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech proposal why are regulator many lmics implementing international banking standard despite the challenge they pose what step can taken ensure that international banking standard are genuinely useful for low and lowermiddle income country and support financial sector development the political driver implementation recent research project led titled developing country navigating global banking standard combine crosscountry panel analysis and indepth case study eleven lmics across africa asia and latin america examined the political economy basel iiiii adoption and provides important insight into the factor that explain why why not regulator developing country adopt and implement international regulatory standard politician and regulator small developing country particularly those with nascent financial sector are often looking attract international capital maintain attain investment grade rating from international rating agency and stay good term with international financial institution like the imf our research show how this generates powerful reputational and competitive incentive that lead regulator adopt international standard even when they are illsuited their local context find that regulator developing country not merely adopt basel iiiii because these standard provide the optimal technical solution financial stability risk their jurisdiction instead regulatory decision are also driven concern about reputation and competition jones jones and zeitz find that the following factor are important driver basel iiiii adoption lmics signalling international investor incumbent politician may adopt basel standard order signal sophistication foreign investor for example ghana rwanda and kenya politician have advocated the implementation basel and iii and other international international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech financial standard part drive establish financial hub their country reassuring host regulator bank headquartered lmics may endorse basel iii part international expansion strategy they seek reassure potential host regulator that they are wellregulated home see this work nigeria where large domestic bank have championed basel iiiii adoption home they seek expand abroad their fervour been met with reluctance among regulator who fear that rapid regulatory upgrade may put weaker local bank jeopardy facilitating homehost supervision adopting international standard can facilitate crossborder coordination between supervisor vietnam for example regulator were keen adopt basel standard their country opened foreign bank ensure they had common language facilitate the supervision the foreign bank operating their jurisdiction peer learning and peer pressure even while acknowledging the shortcoming basel and iii lmic regulator often describe them international best practice the gold standard and there strong peer pressure international policy circle adopt them the west african economic and monetary union waemu for example regulator the supranational banking commission are planning ambitious adoption basel and iii with the support and encouragement technocratic peer network and the imf domestic bank however have limited crossborder exposure and show little enthusiasm for the regulatordriven embrace basel standard technical advice from the international monetary fund and the world bank play important role shaping the incentive for politician and regulator developing country while the financial stability assessment programme fsaps are designed merely evaluate the regulatory environment client country against much more basic set socalled basel core principle find evidence that fund and the bank motivate regulator lmics engage basel and iii adoption some case with explicit recommendation international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech step regulator lmics can take what step can financial regulator lmics take harness the prudential reputational and competitive benefit global banking standard while avoiding the implementation risk and challenge associated with wholesale adoption given the challenge and risk associated with implementing basel and iii regulator lmics face difficult choice and tradeoff lmic regulator are under pressure adopt the full suite international basel standard order signal regulator other jurisdiction and international investor that their bank are soundly regulated yet there are major challenge and risk associated with implementation our research highlight specific way that lmics can tailor basel implementation their domestic circumstance consider the risk overly ambitious basel iiiii implementation prioritise key financial challenge and ass what extent basel implementation may exacerbate reliance credit rating agency information asymmetry between regulator and bank and the exclusion economic sector including small and medium enterprise implement selection basel component regulatory agency outside the basel committee banking supervision are not bound rule and not subject peer review procedure regulator the financial periphery can use this freedom adapt global standard meet domestic regulatory need basel and iii are practice compendia different standard regulator can select those component that are most desirable and feasible implement component vary substantially the amount regulatory resource they require both the implementation and supervision phase regulator can identify domestic prudential need and regulatory capability first and then ass the adequacy each basel iiiii component matching those need given existing capacity international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech constraint indeed regulator nonmember country are adopting basel and iii highly selective manner regulator are more likely adopt the simpler basel standardised approach credit market and operational risk instead muchdisputed advanced approach that rely the use internal model bank figure similarly simple component basel iii such the new definition capital and the leverage ratio are more popular than complex requirement such the liquidity ratio the countercyclical buffer figure proportional rule implementation regulator can refrain from copying prudential requirement from the basel and iii rulebook they can use their intimate knowledge the domestic financial system write rule that match local circumstance better than the basel template the philippine for example regulator have adjusted the riskweights for small and medium enterprise reduce the incentive bank move away from lending these firm adjust the perimeter banking regulation regulator can adjust the perimeter banking regulation that regulation that are aligned with international standard only apply large internationally active bank and simpler although not necessarily stringent rule apply small domestic bank this approach common country belonging the basel committee castro carvalho looking modify international standard regulator should tap into the wealth knowledge among their peer while regulator many developing country look first international institution for advice they should also look strengthen mechanism for peertopeer learning international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech figure implementation basel country outside the basel committee source data from fsi survey figure implementation basel iii country outside the basel committee source data from fsi survey international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech step for the and international policy community while lmic regulator can tailor the local adoption global banking standard this not straightforward sifting through the full suite international standard and adapting them fit the local context painstaking and resourceintensive task rather than place the burden adjustment regulator lmics who face the greatest resource constraint the international community can take step ensure that international standard are designed way that support financial stability and financial sector development lmics the financial stability board world bank and imf explicitly advise country with limited international financial exposure and supervisory capacity constraint first focus reform ensure compliance with the basel core principle and only move the more advanced capital standard pace tailored their circumstance fsb world bank and imf while this advice wellintentioned fails recognise the powerful reputational and competitive incentive that regulator lmics face converge international standard even when they are illsuited their national circumstance simply telling lmic regulator politician and bank slow basel and iii implementation leaf them without way credibly signal international investor and other regulator that their bank are appropriately and effectively regulated national regulator lmics often lack the resource adapt global standard national circumstance moreover they face the risk having explain incumbent politician why the adapted rule and regulation fall short global best practice the core problem for lmics that their interest are not effectively represented when international standard are designed and the international community provides little advice how adapt basel standard for use lmics development prerogative remain the margin regulatory debate the basel committee the wake the global financial crisis there were call for international standard simplified and build proportionality into their design but little changed the basel international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech country committee set task force simplicity and comparability and implemented some recommendation such output floor for risk weight calculation using internal model but the task force paid attention implementation challenge faced developing country bcbs there have been call for the basel committee build greater proportionality into the design standard the basel accord included socalled simplified standardized approach credit risk regulatory standard that specifically designed with developing mind unfortunately the basel committee not engaged revision the standard line with basel iii even though developing country comment consultation consistently emphasized the cost complexity world bank recent proposal simplify the basel approach market risk also been criticized developing country representative still excessively complex bcbs lmics are chronically underrepresented standardsetting the membership the basel committee expanded incorporate representative from ten emerging market economy the this opened the prospect that international standard would recalibrated work wider range context yet the incumbent network wellresourced regulator from industrialized country continues dominate the regulatory debate chey walter the basel consultative group tasked with facilitating dialogue between member and nonmember but few lmics are chronically underrepresented and the group little influence over the design international standard hence international standard are not designed with lmics mind the wake the global financial crisis the asked standard setting institution ass the implication international financial standard for developing country and further open decisionmaking process the financial stability board created internal workstream the effect regulatory reform emerging market and developing economy fsb also established six regional consultative group but conversation with regulator give the impression that these group have little input into the design international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech global financial standard international standard functioning instead forum for regulator troubleshoot implementation regulator lmics have little guidance for proportional basel standard adoption and adaptation even though key stakeholder the global regulatory community have endorsed the proportionality principle implementation useful guidance for regulator lmics still lacking existing publication have analysed proportional implementation basel iii among advanced economy looked unintended consequence for emerging market member and offer advice the basel core principle but guidance how approach proportional basel iii implementation from development perspective not been compiled systematically although the financial stability institute taken important preliminary step this direction castro carvalho hohl the international financial institution not provide consistent advice regarding basel iii implementation the financial sector assessment programme fsap conducted the fund and the bank ass the financial regulatory system client country our research show that while assessor explicitly warn against hasty basel iii implementation some lmics they encourage explicitly implicitly others the bank and the fund can more encourage tailoring global standard that safeguard financial stability highlight positive case proportional nonadoption basel and iii and facilitate peer learning among developing country address these challenge there are series step that the can take ensure that the basel committee banking supervision financial stability board imf and world bank provide support lmics mandate the basel committee banking standard build proportionality into the design basel standard instead placing the burden retrofitting complex international standard regulatory agency lmics proportionality should hardwired into international standard international standard should designed that they can readily adapted for use wide range international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech financial sector all stage development research the financial stability institute hohl should expanded obtain clear understanding proportionality standard implementation this would enable lmics keep with international best practice manner that genuinely aligned with their prudential regulatory need the mandate the basel committee could broadened beyond exclusive focus financial stability recognise the importance other objective such financial sector development and financial inclusion even bringing these secondary consideration would incentivize more careful analysis internationalstandard setting jones and knaack rather than waiting see whether standard generate adverse impact developing country the basel committee could undertake ante assessment open the standardsetting process more meaningful input from lmic representative minimum the basel consultative group should include representative from lmics the basel consultative group and the fsb regional consultative group could move away from the current topdown modus operandi focusing the implementation global standard towards facilitating bottomup proposal influence their design improve the accountability standardsetting body small multilateral organisation could created audit the basel committee akin auditorgenerals national jurisdiction the independent evaluation office the imf helleiner and porter this would help ensure that the basel committee decision robustly reflect the view all member and consider implication for nonmember prevent illfated race the top among lmics towards maximum basel and iii implementation clarifying under which condition proportional nonimplementation specific basel and iii component recommended recognize the signalling function basel standard seal regulatory quality and devise complementary method ass and communicate the quality prudential financial regulation lmics international financial architecture for stability and developmentcryptoassets and fintech engage further research the repercussion basel iiiii implementation for credit allocation the real economy and for financial inclusion the financial stability institute imf and world bank could invest greater resource analysing international financial standard from the perspective lmics increasing their dialogue with regulator and making recommendation the basel committee rather than focusing way minimise the harm and challenge that international standard pose for developing country this research agenda should start from the question what regulation are
