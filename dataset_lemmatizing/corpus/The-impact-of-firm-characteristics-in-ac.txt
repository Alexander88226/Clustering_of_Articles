essential solve shortage smes cash flow financing required for smes set and enlarge their business operation new product development research and development human resource development and acquirement uptodate production equipment and technology most smes rely internal finance note since they can afford external finance easily only prioritized source become internal finance but still internal finance inadequate for smes development and profitability most smes failure access debt financing result into inadequate capital structure demirquckunt pointed out that the main source external financing for smes equity and debt shane observed that external equity from stock exchange capital market usually never exists for smes majed and sorooshian evidenced that firm characteristic note have impact capital structure and performance smes firm characteristic include attribute such firm location firm industry firm size firm age firm legal status and the availability collateral and business information the initial capital and expansion capital fund for tanzanian smes been perpetual problem even though the government still intending empower the sector lending financial institution have the capacity pull their financial resource together meet smes credit need but still they are unwilling take part finance gap still exists between the supply capability financing

developing and developed country play major role job creation competition economic enthusiasm and innovation the sector stimulates the entrepreneurial fortitude and the dissemination expertise the main recognized achievement aspect for any smes gain adequate access external source financing venkatesh nguyen the objective this study examine empirically the impact firm characteristic access finance tanzanian smes literature review theoretical framework the capital structure described the mix debt and equity that firm finance operation gitman brealey the original hypothesis capital structure originated from the modiglianimiller theorem theory the study argued that the value the firm irrelevant financing decision perfect market modigliani and miller the theory lack applicability the real world since the firm value relevant financing decision because agency cost bankruptcy cost information asymmetry and tax component that impact firm capital structure the benefit employ debt firm capital structure exists the interest debt taxdeductible thus creating tax saving for the borrower modigliani miller therefore possible reduce firm cost capital and maximize shareholder wealth employing debt tax saving make debt finance cheaper than equity finance whenever employed firm capital structure the combination inexpensive debt with relatively expensive capital equity decrease firm cost capital which the hurdle rate for investment acceptance rejection decision for project pursued must viable generate enough cash flow cover the initial cost that investment theory stipulated that firm should have debt capital structure order for firm enjoy the tax shield benefit miller modigliani scott and kraus and litzenberger point out that theoretically tax shield doe not exist because the existence financial distress cost note the utilization debt financing firm cost attached firm thereby settle legal obligation including interest and principal failure meet these legal obligation lead firm encounter liquidation and suffer the related settlement expense jensen and mecling pioneered the concept agency theory which explains the conflict arise between the shareholder manager and lender collectively known principal agent problem the conflict between stockholder and management arise when manager are not performing attain the shareholder value wwwccsenetorgijbm international journal business and management vol maximization goal literally shareholder incur cost monitor manager and influence their action which manager have make viable decision for the prosperity the firm contrast lender are united with the shareholder requesting firm performance but when firm face difficulty this unity the purpose can collapse the common goal the union between lender and shareholder take several necessary measure rescue the firm these conflict will never exist all stakeholder have the same information which rarely exist finance the presence information asymmetry could lead manager shareholder and lender have different information about the value firm and might take several year before all information revealed impact their decision stiglitz and wei stipulated that presence agency problem such asymmetric information and moral hazard can impact the access finance and thereby capital structure smes the pecking order theory state that the presence asymmetry information among the stakeholder most firm utilize optimal internal source available finance their investment before opting use debt and equity donaldson myers majluf myers smes face challenge making decision financing choice because adverse selection problem which hinder their access credit and expensive solve the problem smes cost finance their investment opportunity issuing stock stock market are higher than debt financing smes operator may decide finance their investment using either internal external source when external source priority the least risk should selected traditional tradeoff theory stipulate that firm should decide optimal capital structure option evaluating the tax saving available debt bankruptcy and agency cost debt and equity basing available information maximize firm value the firm that maintains optimal debt their capital structure minimizes the cost capital therefore tends maximize firm value despite financial distress problem exists when firm imply debt financing their capital structure smes imply debt the only choice available because insufficiency internal source and unavailability equity finance frelinghaus smes perspective debt financing obstacle exist access external financing for smes led the sector experience investment fund hence impact sector growth silva financing from internal external source are required stimulate firm profitability which the accelerator the any business expansion and stability olutunla myers pecking order theory state that during financing decision firm should prioritize internal source financing external source financing reference availability the source and cost involved the internal source financing option are not preferred choice selected financing profitable and viable project most firm because insufficient the external financing the only source rescue the sme sector tanzania the borrowed fund can invested profitable project generate additional asset that can used collateral the future when firm need external debt financing refer figure which represents diagrammatically how the accessibility finance smes can impact their performance production and market efficiencyfirm performanceaccess finance factor production constraint figure diagrammatic model representation how access finance impact firm performance thus accessibility for finance note smes predictable positively influence the ownership and control production factor land labor and capital subject the constraint note asymmetric information wwwccsenetorgijbm international journal business and management vol and high cost capital for example wage salary the cost hire labor inversely related the profitability and growth the firm increase wage salary tend force the producer incur higher production cost and otherwise hold ceteris paribus note development factor production term quality and quantity application new technology and machinery well trained and qualified personnel available smes increase productivity and through efficient and resourceful market strategy note enhance sme performance and growth access finance enables the smes acquire productive asset that can used increase productivity simultaneously reducing the unit cost production resulting economy scale decrease unit cost production tends generate increase profit olutunla and obamuyi point out that the improved firm performance ensures higher earnings increment sale volume creation employment and wealth maximization however firm performance can unattainable smes fail access debt financing support their investment opportunity empirical review firm characteristic this part present the empirical review the firm characteristic used this study introduces the variable framework arising from the literature and discus how impact debt financing smes construct relevant hypothesis tested the study and other immediate literature relevance the study location the firm berger and udell find out that the geographic closeness between lender and customer association with firm access credit the lender who are geographically proximity their customer are capable utilize soft available qualitative information establish the credibility their customer for credit quality gilbert spotted that the location the firm noticeable relationship with access the marketplace supply and other resource such capital labor and land consequently firm sited urban location may have higher possibility success than firm located rural location with access credit market and other resource fatoki and asah find out that smes located urban are successful access debt financing compared those located rural area physical closeness between lender and borrower produce improved form environmental scrutinize that aid smes access credit from lender consequently there positive relationship between firm location and access debt financing smes industry the firm the industry which firm operates doe not influence the firm capital structure directly but might indirectly through the composition and nature the firm asset hall the association that exists between industrial classification and employment debt the capital structure originated from theory which stated that industry classification substitute for business risk barbosa moraes the concept lay this theory indicate the firm operating the same business sector the environment and economic feature tend suffer the same impact face the sector which might influence earnings and growth hall hutchinson and michaelas advocated that even though particular firm feature are sensitive structural feature industry still financial strategy variable posse very important influence over industrial specific effect the firm operation abor evidenced that smes operate the agricultural industry strongest capital structure and asset structure whereby wholesale and retail industry demonstrated the weakest asset structure well debt ratio consequently hypothetically exists positive impact between the firm industry and access debt financing smes firm size the firm size crucial weight the debt proportion the capital structure the firm since real asset tend influence the accessibility long debt whenever required burkart ellingsen large firm tend well diversified their operation which influence their stability thereby size can substituted for insolvency honhyan cassar stipulated that small firm find more expensive solving problem associated information asymmetry with lender most firm tanzania operate sme sector featured with difficulty startup and growth barrier associated with shortage finance fatoki and asah find out that firm size impact smes access debt finance from commercial bank whereby small enterprise are favored large firm consequently hypothetical existence positive association between the firm size and smes access debt financing firm business information the objective financial information presented firm their user inform them different status the firm operation financial information issued firm state firm performance financial position particular point and change financial position the firm operation note the firm business wwwccsenetorgijbm international journal business and management vol information useful stakeholder making different economic and social decision the user this information include employee lender government and their agency employee supplier and other creditor customer and the general public this study evaluates why lender bank and other lending agency are interested with firm business information kitindi point out that lender use firm business information ass current and future performance the firm lender are interested know the status their loan interest and principal evaluating the firm capital structure furthermore lender use the business information decide borrower credibility whether issue extend loan not absence sufficient information lead information asymmetry and may jeopardize access credit finance sarapaivanich kotey consequently the hypothetical existence positive association between business information and access debt financing smes age the firm firm the early stage operation used experience difficulty access debt finance because informational disparity the firm start operate and grows with business performance trade which create reputation credit history credit reputation reduces the moral hazard dilemma hence create path access debt finance the longevity the firm stay operation the more persistence unpleasant economic circumstance chandler the study conducted klapper discovered that the firm with than year younger firm operation are likely rely debt financing from lender ngoc and nguyen supported the argument that younger firm face hardship and more cost accessing external financing from lender because information asymmetry consequently hypothetical existence positive relationship between firm age and access debt finance smes legal status the firm incorporation dietmar point out that firm with limited liability incorporated posse development attribute than firm with unlimited liability there are numerous aspect that clarify the relationship that exist between incorporation and access debt financing one the separation owner affair and business affair increase the commitment manager the firm goal two publication their financial statement one legal requirement make corporation openness for user know the firm status including their debt ratio and firm asset cassar found out that lender observe incorporation good indicator for firm trustworthiness and commitment operational law abor stated that the form business organization effect equity debt decision smes operation the owner limited firm have limitation answer against loss generated the corporation whereby the owner unlimited form organization sole proprietorship and partnership are liable their personal asset cover for business loss therefore limited company prefer use the equity finance their project than debt financing while unlimited form business organization sole proprietorship and partnership the only option available finance their project debt financing the study conducted coleman and cohn and fatoki and asah evidenced presence positive association between debt financing and legal formation business organization consequently proposed the existence positive relationship between incorporation and access debt financing smes firm collateral sme sector face difficulty access external finance for their investment project because lack asset pledged collateral that perspective smes fail grow due lack collateral pledge access external source finance bougheas mizen and yalcin pointed out that the requirement collateral crucial aspect for smes succeed accessibility external financing from lender coco suggested that the collateral the lender protection incase default happened borrower that perspective collateral the insurance that lender contract will honored and respected collateral solves the information asymmetry problem the evaluation investment project the worthiness the project and risk that might involved borrower well the cost related supervision borrower character barbosa and moraes and fatoki and asah suggested that operator smes have own more tangible asset that can create higher value their firm accelerate borrowing security because the higher the value asset the lower the interest rate the debt secured those asset consequently hypothetical existence strong positive relationship between collateral and access debt financing smes research methodology the empirical study focused coastal zone dar salaam northern zone arusha zanzibar unguja and southern and highlander zone mbeya united republic tanzania the study captured both qualitative and quantitative data data collection conducted through survey questionnaire comprising open and closed wwwccsenetorgijbm international journal business and management vol question the question were comprehensible and constructed easily for respondent understand and reply the question the survey conducted small team researcher and research assistant who distributed questionnaire and conducted interview with owner and manager from survey smes this study concentrated smes which are recognized the ministry industry trade and marketing tanzania chamber commerce and small industry development organization sido the population sme establish the sample size this study opted for raosoft sample size calculator note calculate the sample size the result provided raosoft minimum recommended sample size smes involved our study but were distributed because data collection limitation such non response data analysis used the statistical package for social science spss the questionnaire tested our research instrument through pilot study covering smes operator the purpose the pilot study not only identify the common problem within the designed questionnaire but also incorporate the respondent comment that enhanced the quality the questionnaire that met the purpose study statistical analysis includes pearson correlation logistic regression and descriptive statistic pearson correlation used analyze the relationship exist between the variable and access debt financing well establish the multicollinearity between variable exist multiple linear regression were used measure the relationship between the independent and dependent variable validity and reliability were guaranteed using statistician and panel expert weigh the research instrument for theoretical clarity pretesting the research instrument pilot study and depth reviewing the literature for theoretical construct and empirical conclusion relating this study result and discussion two hundred questionnaire were distributed and one hundred and sixty three returned the questionnaire were structured catch with respondent who were operating sme sector and were potentially need debt finance the study ass how the firm characteristic impact firm credit accessibility from lender tanzania correlation analysis variable correlation analysis conducted establish the degree correlation the variable intended for this study the variable are location the firm industry the firm business firm information size firm age firm collateral and incorporation establish the relationship these variable first run correlation analysis among the variable find out the association exist between the independent variable and the dependent variable well establish whether the multicollinearity problem exists among the independent variable table correlation the variable variable loan access lappl location loc industry ind size size business information binfo age age collateral collt incorporation inco correlation significant the level tailed correlation significant the level tailed the result correlation analysis show that location industry the firm size firm business information age the firm collateral and incorporation all result indicate variable are positively correlated with access debt finance result indicate that accessibility debt finance from external source tanzania positively impacted the firm location industry size age and incorporation the wwwccsenetorgijbm international journal business and management vol availability collateral and business information furthermore the correlation coefficient show that there high correlation among independent variable used this analysis and thus make understand that multicollinearity problem exists among the variable the study conducted field hypothesize that multicollineality likely problem data set the correlation coefficient between predictor greater than logistic regression analysis several approach can used researcher model metric dichotomous variable include probit logistic regression and discriminant function analysis conversely logistic regression famous approach and mostly used analyze the relationship between dichotomous dependent variable independent dichotomous variable because flexibility and strongly violation the normality assumption within model agresti logistic regression also authorizes forecast dependent variable from set predictor that may discrete dichotomous and continuous combination any these fabowale alternatively while discriminant analysis can used model dichotomous dependent variable the analysis only used with continuous predictor fabowale the nature data involved this study opted analyze our data using logistic regression establish the extent which each the variable play part firm access debt financing econometric model econometric model used hypothesize the influence firm characteristic access debt financing smes tanzania table result logistic regression variable location urban rural firm industry primary secondary tertiary quaternary firm size small medium large business information keep business information not keep business info

our expectation concerning the coefficient the variable involved this study location locjt industry indjt business information binfojt size sizejt age agejt collateral colltjt and incorporation incopjt firm carry positive sign the data for the dependent and independent variable used the regression analysis were collected from the primary data from field survey the coefficient firm location positive and statistically significant and confirms our expectation our hypothesis the odd ratio for firm situated the urban location with pvalue while for firm located rural area odd ratio with pvalue this implies that access debt financing positively related firm location firm located urban area have higher possibility access loan debt financing than firm located the rural area the coefficient industry the firm positive and statistically significant and confirms our hypothesis the odd ratio for primary firm industry note with pvalue odd ratio for secondary industry note with pvalue odd ratio for tertiary industry note with pvalue while odd ratio for quaternary industry note with pvalue this implies that access debt financing positively related firm industry whereby most the source financing prefer lending more the secondary sector while other sector left unsupported lender the coefficient size business measured the number employee confirms our hypothesis carrying positive sign and statistically significant the odd ratio for small firm with pvalue odd ratio for medium firm with pvalue while the odd ratio for large firm with pvalue result show that larger firm have higher access debt financing than smaller and medium sized firm because economy scale larger firm find easier borrow money from bank for expansion thereby enjoy the economy scale large firm manage purchase large scale material and factor production such capital equipment and machinery well employing qualified worker who will ultimately increase productivity and profitability while smes are referred risk borrower lender lender creditor bank and other source finance tend utilize financial information issued firm evaluate and forecast the future performance the firm information acquired from the firm financial statement portrays the firm forecasted financial capability and indicate whether their loan interest and principal could settled when due the odd ratio for firm that maintain financial information with pvalue while the odd ratio for the firm which not maintain financial information with pvalue the result indicates that firm which maintain business information have higher possibility access debt financing than those never maintain financial information therefore our study confirms the existence positive relationship between the availability business information and access debt financing smes the coefficient the firm age indicates positive association between access credit loan and age the firm per our hypothesis the odd ratio for firm than year younger firm with pvalue the odd ratio for firm between year with pvalue the odd ratio for firm between year with pvalue while the odd ratio for aged firm year and above with pvalue the result indicates that older firm find easier access debt financing than younger firm regarding the study result tanzanian business environment demonstrates positive relationship between access loan and age business which burden young firm whereby smes are dominant the result supported coleman and cohn finding the existence positive association between the firm employing debt with incorporation and per our hypothesis the odd ratio for limited firm with pvalue the odd ratio for the sole proprietorship and partnership note with pvalue this study find out most the firm operating sole proprietorship partnership face difficulty access the debt finance from lender because high cost and lack trust openness declared the financial statement and limited liability make limited company and corporation easy access debt financing than unlimited liability form organization partnership and sole proprietorship wwwccsenetorgijbm international journal business and management vol the availability collateral coefficient indicates positive relationship with access finance collateral decisive aspect for borrower succeed accessibility debt financing from lender the odd ratio for firm with collateral with pvalue while the odd ratio for the firm which not have collateral with pvalue the result indicate that lack collateral smes hinder their access debt financing most the firm rejected were those lack asset pledged collateral therefore our result support bougheas that collateral requirement key characteristic for smes succeed access debt finance conclusion and policy implication the study contributed our knowledge the series factor associated with the firm characteristic impact access debt financing from different external source financing tanzania the result demonstrate that there interdependence and significant relationship between the firm characteristic location industry size incorporation age size availability business information and collateral and access debt financing smes the study recommends the following one that government should formulate policy that will make source financing commercial bank finance company micro finance institution and other source relax their restrictive regulation and operation which discourage borrowing and offer more credit facility for firm especially smes two government should support the smes sector guaranteeing from financial institution smes third government through central bank should either create strategy stimulate commercial bank increase their lending towards smes sector fourth the government authorize special capital from central bank commercial bank purposely lend smes since commercial bank are the giant player the lending industry fifth the government should establish bank deal with debt financing for smes sector sixth smes operator have start saving and invests more tangible asset pledged collateral acquire external finance limitation this study the study considers mainly internal factor and left behind other sensitive external factor which may also effect lending smes the study conducted barbosa and moraes revealed that external factor have contributed impact the access credit firm moreover this study concentrated the demand side access debt financing tanzanian smes while supplier debt finance lender were not involved more contribution could discovered create bridge between tanzanian smes and lender all party were involved another study could conducted ass the credit gap smes the supplier side lender could provide additional result assist policy maker solving financing deficit tanzanian smes finally the data did not permit involve other the noticeable feature political and socioeconomic variable which possibly might impact smes access debt financing because these variable are difficult captured
