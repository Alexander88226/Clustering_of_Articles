see long term planning and preparation key issue too early generalize our finding first all our result have limited external validity used small sample accountant and banker and our sample taken only the netherlands can generalize for europe canada replication other country and canada needed generalize these finding bretonmiller literature study also likely have bias which might account for the emphasis preparation and planning publishing consultantspractisioners are mostly usa citizen the usa known have lower threshold for venture and private capital external party participating business transfer may demand better planning and preparation ability our finding suggest that the relatively easy surveyed planning and preparation transfer could very limited value for future research
