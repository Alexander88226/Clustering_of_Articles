cultural dimension united kingdom united state venture capital world economic forum introduction you have serve financial market reimagine how money can managed and moved because there going more change the next five year financial service than happened the past dan schulman ceo paypal the five classical function the financial sector are making and receiving payment saving invest consume later borrowing able consume invest now the insurance risk and advice all the above nowadays all these five dimension know new wave technological initiative which accelerating change the global financial landscape this emerging wave called fintech financial technology and can defined financial solution based information technology douglas keke pollari the application these technology may businesstoconsumer businesstobusiness and are often found application for mobile device such mpesa and paypal documented the literature review the fintech industry experienced substantial growth recent year led fierce competition but also cooperation with financial incumbent revolutionising financial service and product but what drive the formation fintech startup previous study have focused specific fintech sector such crowdfunding behaviour burtch home bias crowdfunding lin viswanathan the success crowdfunded venture mollick although these study offer insight into the success specific fintech sector only one study that explains the startup rate fintech company industry can found haddad and hornuf investigated the economic and technological determinant fintech startup they find that fintech company are more likely formed country that have welldeveloped economy and where venture capital available other than the aforementioned paper very little research tried explain the startup rate fintech company general there are however indication that cultural variable are related high innovation and high growth entrepreneurship and therefore possibly also startup rate frese rauch zhao try fill this scientific lacuna building theory based germonpr toon lefevre jenten cultural dimension personality trait and use correlation with entrepreneurship and innovation link and predict the possible explanatory power culture for the emergence startup formation the fintech industry contribute literature replicating study fintech startup and exploring the impact culture startup rate bettis argue that replication study are critical for building body research knowledge replication study for fintech startup particularly relevant due the extremely limited research that been done due the nature our research topic test the robustness the finding haddad and hornuf different model and added different dimension measuring crosscountry cultural value finally also examine interaction between cultural dimension explain fintech startup rate our result indicate that culture maymay not impact startup rate emerging sector and could therefore relevant for research this field the following section this paper will discus literature review fintech and culture and influence entrepreneurship innovation and investment the introduction our hypothesizes the description our variable and data the descriptive and regression result summary our contribution and implicationsgermonpr toon lefevre jenten literature review the literature review start showing the relevance the fintech industry and growth recent year the second section culture explained using hofstede cultural dimension this section also review literature that link cultural dimension with entrepreneurship and innovation because personality trait can linked culture the third section review the relationship between the big five personality trait and entrepreneurship firm performance and innovation the next section describes the relationship between the big five and hofstede cultural dimension which required formulate hypothesis based both measure finally the fifth section review literature which relates the link between investment young venture and cultural dimension fintech several force are driving the interest fintech the one hand technology allow the creation new product and service these technology may bring costsavings incumbent easily give market entrant access profitable market keke the other hand customer behaviour and demand are also changing consumer adopt new technology more quickly than before and they demand more convenience and immediacy pollari the adaptation mobile device and digital platform allows fintech company easily access market and respond consumer demand australia for example the alternative financing market for fintech company increased from million dollar over million dollar pollari business developing exploiting financial technology may compete against collaborate with financial incumbent the entity developing new financial technology collaboration with financial incumbent are not always independent organisation but may owned financial institution one the reason new venture are able attract considerable customer base are the declining level trust major financial institution pollari argues that review community give customer more objective opinion service provider product than information major financial institution that they distribute themselves possible germonpr toon lefevre jenten shortcoming service incumbent are therefore more easily discovered customer who will look for alternative service provider stewart and rjens also argue that bank are embracing fintech due the promise higher revenue stream personalisation offer and consumer service improvement regulator also recognize the importance the fintech industry nowadays more than twenty country try support the sector with mechanism called regulatory sandbox this framework set allow small scale live testing innovation private firm controlled environment operating under special exemption allowance other limited time bound exception under the financial sector regulator supervision these sandbox are established promote competition and efficiency financial service market through innovation jenik lauer the goal reduce the time and cost getting innovation the market sandbox also the objective improve access finance for startup reducing the risk the product service client adoption and increasing the return capital investment ernst young within the fintech sector there are several market which competition can arise haddad and hornuf find that financing far the most important segment the emerging fintech market followed payment asset management loyalty program risk management exchange and regulatory technology the fintech sector can also divided into other segment wef report also the payment investment management and insurance category but add digital banking and market infrastructure category additionally financing split into lending and equity crowdfunding segment based these two paper consider the following fintech category insurance fintech category asset investment management financing lending definition service related investment and portfolio management such roboadvice financial stock exchange service wealth management personal financial management apps software service and platform that facilitate project venture financing for example crowdfunding equity crowdlending microcredit and factoring solution other initiative like fintech innovation hub fintech accelerator are also common mechanism that support financial innovative company germonpr toon lefevre jenten insurance loyalty programme payment digital banking regulatory technology others insurance related service spot insurance usagedriven insurance insurance contract management and brokerage service well claim and risk management service application providing reward for brand loyalty giving customer advanced access new product special sale coupon free merchandise banking service and innovative payment solution such mobile payment system ewallets service based technology the context regulatory monitoring reporting and compliance benefiting the finance industry other service innovative background service like authorization service other technical advancement classified under other business activity fintech startup the fintech industry experienced significant growth during the last few year leading extensive access finance according the dealroom data base the invested amount fintech increased from billion and billion euro and respectively least billion euro europe alone the large increase partly driven the size the deal draganov reported megarounds larger than million euro using the dealroom data base kpmg also confirms that the sector characterized megadeals invested billion dollar art financial and billion dollar worldpay the fintech industry belonged the top three sector which most investment were made exitwise the fintech segment rank the third largest sector europe with exit value least billion euro this increase from billion euro when the sector with the highest value venture capital exit recent growth the fintech industry been documented literature well the high growth fintech associated with more investment the sector haddad hornuf find that welldeveloped economy and capital market allow entrepreneur more easily finance their business and have higher demand for fintech service such asset management secondly they hypothesized that fintech startup are more frequent country where latest technology and supporting infrastructure are prevalent haddad hornuf only find result that support the need for latest technology their sample without the but variable measuring supporting infrastructure are found significant their entire sample these variable include the amount secure internet server and mobile telephone subscription thirdly haddad hornuf germonpr toon lefevre jenten hypothesize that fintech startup occur more frequently country with fragile banking sector the author find significant coefficient for variable measuring regulation but not for soundness bank partially supporting their hypothesis their final hypothesis argues that the size the labour market and more benevolent regulation regarding labour credit and business condition and bankruptcy law lead more fintech startup haddad hornuf find positive significant coefficient for regulation and strength legal right supporting their theory other aspect that positively impact the startup rate this sector are related the use information technology available labour force benevolent regulation and the degree which company find easier obtain credit some scholar even argue that venture capital investment fintech are becoming inefficient cumming schwienbacher they find that fintech company are more likely receive equity financing country without major financial centre which due differential enforcement banking rule the differential enforcement originates from economy scale prudential supervision that can achieved country with major financial centre cumming and schwienbacher also find that fintech company have higher probability fail country without major financial centre this possibly due higher entrepreneurial risktaking resulting from weaker regulation the same author also find that fintech deal are likely acquired after the financial crisis and that they have higher likelihood liquidated however showed that market valuation fintech sector have quadrupled since the crisis haddad and hornuf declare that this happened because various reason such lack confidence bank especially country that suffered extensively the financial crisis increased cost debt traditional banking product and the frequent exemption for fintechs from regulation due differential enforcement the more strict banking rule koetter blaseg cumming and schwienbacher argue that there exuberance venture capital investment fintech which described hot industry the investment data the fintech sector and the literature thus point increase interest the sector the success some application such mpesa mobile money transfer service demonstrate that fintech application can bring true added value economy germonpr toon lefevre jenten and participant research exploring driver fintech venture creation may consequently unveil pathway facilitate startup rate and indirectly stimulate economy the given number startup depends upon the entrepreneur that nation can draw from their population and source financing that entrepreneur can obtain pollari overall young venture typically rely heavily love money and venture capital obtain financing for their growth and commercialization thus order conduct research regarding fintech startup variable that influence entrepreneurship and the availability financing must taken into consideration although both entrepreneurship and venture capital have been extensively studied there consensus about the impact culture fintech startup startup general cultural dimension innovation and entrepreneurship numerous study have examined the impact cultural variable entrepreneurial activity thornton frese rauch zhao these have indicated that culture may impact entrepreneurship and new firm formation rate davidsson and wiklund argue that culture influence the psychological characteristic individual population increasing decreasing the supply entrepreneur the result their study suggest that cultural variation impact new firm formation rate frese rauch and zhao argue that culture affect entrepreneurial activity through the behaviour inherent specific culture and through formal institution they call these view respectively the national culturepersonal valuesentrepreneurial behaviour model and the cultureinstitutionentrepreneurship model frese rauch and zhao find that entrepreneurial activity can some extent explained cultural variable this study mostly focus the relation between cultural dimension and personality trait entrepreneurship and innovation additionally the literature review will take possible relationship between culture and investment behaviour also taken into account researcher have primarily used hofstede culture dimension hofstede bond study the relation between culture and entrepreneurship and innovation the fintech sector emerging market using technology bring innovative solution client innovation germonpr toon lefevre jenten therefore relevant and may help explain startup rate indirectly through the degree which personality are associated with innovation furthermore innovation also important because described critical factor distinguish between entrepreneur and small business owner carland there are several data set that describe culture with different dimension such the schwartz globe and world value survey aggarwal this study will make use hofstede cultural dimension which are available the data set and seem mostly used empirical research according hadwick the group researcher that analysis crosscultural theme other primary academic field like finance will mainly focus the main construct hofstede rather than the more complex finding the globe study the reason that the hofstede dimension are somewhat with regard culture the lingua franca for reviewer the following section this paper will discus the cultural dimension and their correlation with personality trait entrepreneurship innovation and investment new firm hofstede cultural dimension are based population employee multinational corporation ibm defines culture broad pattern thinking feeling and acting hofstede this collective programming the mind allows make distinction one group people from another these distinction can have impact institution which are product dominant cultural value system hofstede institution can stimulate obstruct startup rate because they comprise economic political and contractual rule zahra hofstede identified four cultural dimension that are widely used research these dimension describe culture the national level and may explain variable across nation using different inquiry the rockeach value survey taken different population and correlation analysis hofstede and bond find that the same dimension can identified initially four cultural dimension were uncovered several year later fifth dimension added after chinese value survey because the fifth cultural dimension longterm orientation added only year after the first four dimension not lot study cover this dimension sixth dimension indulgence added hofstede cultural dimension because only added recently there even literature found that connects this dimension with entrepreneurship innovation financing moreover not included the data set and germonpr toon lefevre jenten not used the data analysis this paper consequently indulgence will not reviewed the literature review power distance the first cultural dimension power distance described the extent which powerful member institution and organization accept that power distributed unequally and the amount authority person over others people with authority society high power distance are expected courageous capable socially recognized imaginative they tend control lot resource which are not easily accessible for others parent culture with highpower distance would also put higher value child obedience and student politeness hofstede regarding entrepreneurship and the power distance dimension there seems negative relationship bogatyreva find that power distance negative moderating effect entrepreneurial intention entrepreneurial action entrepreneurial intention often used research because intention are good predictor planned behaviour such entrepreneurship krueger ozgen argues that social inequality and the localization resource the hand few prevent individual with entrepreneurial intention from commencing venture according rusu low power distance society can associated with more entrepreneurial mindset because these society would support high independence and autonomy study mitchell studied conceptualized script dimension which were afterwards used examine the venture creation decision arrangement script are related having contact resource and asset that are necessary create new venture mitchell find that power distance moderate the relationship between arrangement script and the venture creation decision this study therefore also indicates that culture may have impact venture creation another theory formulated sim nmoya argues that nation high power distance ought more entrepreneurial they theorise that there need for independence which can not satisfied when working employee organisation with autocratic leadership greater economic independence could achieved working for one own germonpr toon lefevre jenten account and eliminating the risk being dismissed employee therefore these individual will seek greater independence trying start their own venture however sim nmoya did not find evidence support their own theory other empirical result also contradict the positive relation between power distance and support the first theory that link higher power distance with lower entrepreneurial action society high power distance also are inclined change power distribution hofstede this detrimental for the innovation opportunity that arise because tushman find that innovation tends alter the distribution power organisation the change power distribution occurs when the person generating the innovative idea were originally lower the hierarchy knight note that the chance for success innovative idea decrease dramatically the person generating the idea not the person who get run with champion shane later find support that power distance negatively related with innovation measured per caput number trademark the result were only statistically significant for and not for data from given the age the study possible that the role the power distance variable changed over time later study bukowski rudnicki examine the effect culture national innovation rate which measured patent application the author also find negative relationship between power distance and rate innovation the negative relationship however only significant one the six dependent variable that were used proxy for innovation power distance thus seems weakly related innovation rate through time however noteworthy that this cultural dimension seems negatively related both innovation and entrepreneurship prior study individualism collectivism the second dimension individualism versus collectivism reflects the degree which individual depend upon themselves and their immediate family culture that lean more towards collectivism have high sense loyalty towards the group collectivities that they belong hofstede find that individualism correlated variety enjoyment life and pleasure people individualistic culture therefore value freedom autonomy and individual interest they have preference for acting their own interest rather than that larger group which they belong germonpr toon lefevre jenten literature individualism reveals different theory with regard relationship with entrepreneurship mitchell find that individualism significant moderating effect the relationship between arrangement script and the venture creation decision their result not formulate positive negative relation with individualism but they provide further support that culture may influence entrepreneurship across culture other research indicates that individualism associated with higher entrepreneurial activity due the focus materialistic achievement whereas collectivistic culture exhibit more group conformity hofstede gupta study mueller and thomas the likelihood entrepreneurial orientation found positively correlated with culture that score higher individualism shane find indication that there might positive relationship between individualism and the rate innovation across country mueller and thomas also find more support that there positive and significant coefficient between individualism and innovative orientation measured the jackson personality inventory manual jpi thirdly bukowski and rudnicki also confirm that individualism may predictor innovation rate population that are more inclined towards individualism thus seem have higher chance creating startup and bringing innovation for techrelated sector older research linked the motivation hightech entrepreneur japan with the drive for selfactualization which can associated with personal achievement and individualism ray turpin other author however have argued that negatively correlated with entrepreneurship tiessen argues that entrepreneurship may group effort and therefore linked with the collectivist side the cultural dimension this based clan culture within organisation which trust and commitment move individual serve the group interest the intimate tie between member these organisation allow resource stretched through efficient internal communication and the lack the need monitor contingent agreement between worker and the company tiessen overall the consensus seems point positive relationship between individualism and both entrepreneurship and innovation rate individualism germonpr toon lefevre jenten masculinity femininity the third cultural dimension related the choice social sex role and effect people selfconcepts hofstede the two opposing pole are masculinity and femininity masculine society value money and success whereas the dominant value feminine society are the quality life and care for others femininity associated with social justice selfcontrolled versus macho behaviour masculine culture and selfrespect population scoring higher femininity have stronger belief service and intuition the feminine pole also described more modest whereas masculinity rather assertive and competitive hofstede mccrae bogatyreva argue that individual society scoring high masculinity give the value their career more weight than the value family interest compared society scoring high femininity starting venture usually timeconsuming process entrepreneur consequently tend count more working hour than employee when individual spend more time work there time left build relationship bogatyreva find that entrepreneurial intention translated into higher chance starting venture for individual scoring higher masculinity regarding innovation shane did not find that this cultural dimension explanatory power the united state sample more recently bukowski rudnicki also did not find any support for hypothesis claiming that masculinity related national innovation rate their sample country uncertainty avoidance the fourth cultural dimension uncertainty avoidance also related politeness and obedience culture scoring high uncertainty avoidance construct institution and belief that impede the creation ambiguous situation these culture also require high level obedience and politeness that the structure organization can held intact the population country characterised low uncertainty avoidance index tend attach high value selfrespect inner harmony and capability individual country high uncertainty avoidance are characterised greater fear failure and lower level ambition they try minimize uncertainty applying strict rule and law shinnar germonpr toon lefevre jenten kreiser examined the relationship between cultural value and risk taking within smes they find that both risk taking and proactiveness are negatively related uncertainty avoidance suggesting that this cultural dimension negative relation with entrepreneurial trait entrepreneur have shown higher propensity for risktaking prior research stewart decisionmaking venture involves assessing and taking risk due uncertain outcome individual that are uncomfortable with uncertainty thus may likely start business study wennekers looked the rate business ownership and the cultural dimension they find that the effect uncertainty avoidance changed over time from push effect high uncertainty avoidance the rate business ownership pull towards entrepreneurship climate low uncertainty avoidance baum push hypothesis argues that individual dissatisfied with climate high uncertainty avoidance are pushed towards selfemployment reducing uncertainty related labour condition wennekers argue that individual low uncertainty avoidance society are pulled towards selfemployment because these individual attach higher utility the reward selfemployment later study uncertainty avoidance also found negatively correlated with starting new venture the model that predicts entrepreneurial action that bogatyreva constructed the uncertainty avoidance variable found negative significant variable top this main effect this cultural dimension also negative moderating effect the relationship between entrepreneurial intention and the formation new venture the finding kreiser mentioned above may help explain the finding bogateyreva moreover shinnar argue that individual low uncertainty avoidance society tend engage more analysing entrepreneurial activity opposed culture high uncertainty avoidance where entrepreneurial career may socially discouraged two important characteristic that guide individual towards entrepreneurship are risktaking and tolerance for ambiguity shane because culture scoring high uncertainty avoidance try avoid ambiguity and uncertainty seems logical that individual these culture are likely embark new activity moreover earlier research shane provided support that innovation higher population where individual are more tolerant towards risk and change and have higher uncertainty acceptance innovative orientation however not found germonpr toon lefevre jenten dependent the uncertainty avoidance dimension mueller thomas bukowski and rudnicki also find inconclusive result for the predictive power uncertainty avoidance measure innovation due lack more recent study regarding innovation and uncertainty avoidance difficult formulate relation between the two also possible that this cultural dimension may not impact the innovative orientation the population but that doe impact the execution new idea this the case then uncertainty avoidance could indeed negatively related the formation new venture longterm orientation later fifth cultural dimension uncovered longterm versus shortterm orientation following the result that people way thinking might culturally constrained bond and hofstede argue that their own thinking also might constrained hofstede minkov hofstede questionnaire and bond adapted version the rockeach value survey which examine cultural difference were both developed western culture they asked themselves what extent this responsible for the correlation their result and whether relevant question had been omitted new questionnaire developed chinese colleague the chinese value survey which found new cultural dimension that strongly correlated with economic growth one side the new dimension combined the value persistence and thrift and the other side combined personal stability tradition and focus the present and the past hofstede introduced the fifth cultural dimension respectively longterm and shortterm orientation longterm oriented culture child learn thrift tenacity and not expect immediate gratification their desire hofstede minkov hofstede and minkov argue that working value these culture are honesty learning adaptiveness accountability and selfdiscipline owner manager and worker share the same aspiration and people invest lifelong personal network shortterm oriented culture norm require people respect social code and seen stable individual people these culture also seem sensitive social trend consumption immediate need for gratification and want protect their face main work value shortterm oriented culture are freedom right achievement and thinking for oneself hofstede and minkov argue that manager and worker are two different psychological camp personal loyalty vary with business need germonpr toon lefevre jenten regarding longterm orientation bogatyreva hypothesize that culture scoring high this cultural dimension should more likely translate entrepreneurial intention into entrepreneurial action their reasoning that individual longterm orientation culture have higher propensity plan and are better prepared wait for entrepreneurial reward additionally the positive relationship between innovation and longterm orientation bukowski rudnicki may support their hypothesis the result bogatyreva however not provide support for their theory the cultural variable longterm orientation main effect not found significant their regression predicting the start new venture the interaction term consisting entrepreneurial intention and longterm orientation are significant but negative indicating negative moderating relationship bogatyreva believe that individual shortterm oriented culture are hesitant commence venture they value quick result the next section literature that further link the previously described dimension with personal trait will reviewed the section will also include review correlation between certain personal trait and entrepreneurship innovation certain trait associated with culture are correlated with more entrepreneurship innovation this may indicate that cultural dimension help explain fintech startup through personality dimension more prevalent one culture than the other personality trait innovation and entrepreneurship there are indication that entrepreneur display certain trait stewart rauch frese that distinct them from other individual country who not embark business venture these trait may more pronounced certain culture than others leading population with more individual that would seem capable starting successful venture because fintech startup are the result entrepreneurship predictor entrepreneurship are discussed this section therefore explaining variable entrepreneurial intention that can linked with culture are relevant for this study personality are considered consist several trait based these dimension personality entrepreneurial profile may defined because certain personality trait can related cultural dimension germonpr toon lefevre jenten hofstede mccrae entrepreneurial profile could more common within certain culture additional aspect entrepreneurship that may related personality trait innovation marcati out all theory that construct set personality trait the fivefactor theory goldberg seems the most validated benetmart nez john and most widely applied empirical research this theory describes the following five trait openness conscientiousness extraversion agreeableness and neuroticism they are also referred the big five the ocean acronym this chapter one hand the big five are explained and they are linked entrepreneurship using two study firstly metaanalysis zhao verified potential relationship between the big five and entrepreneurial intention entrepreneurial performance secondly wang tested the mediating effect selfefficacy the relationship between the big five and entrepreneurial intention among agricultural student the latter study added the review because more recent and different data their study wang use conviction and preparation account for entrepreneurial intention the other hand the big five are also linked innovation marcati define specific innovation the predisposition among the first adopt innovation specific domain their study link innovativeness with personality trait based questionnaire answered entrepreneur openness experience openness experience defines the extent which individual are intellectually curious seek new experience and explore novel idea zhao seibert people scoring high this trait could described creative innovative and untraditional these characteristic ought improve the odds entrepreneurship schumpeter individual low openness experience may more conventional unanalytical and narrow interest zhao seibert the metaanalysis performed zhao show that the coefficient openness experience positively related entrepreneurial intention the coefficient openness also positively related firm performance but confidence interval includes zero zero included the interval mean that there possibly relation between openness and firm performance the author thus find evidence relation between openness experience germonpr toon lefevre jenten and firm performance wang find that openness predicts entrepreneurial intention through selfefficacy additionally statistical result suggest that openness direct effect the conviction become entrepreneur openness thus seems positively related entrepreneurial intention but can not significantly related firm performance openness experience also found positively related innovation marcati people high this personal trait should therefore more capable creating venture innovative market such the fintech sector conscientiousness conscientiousness describes value that seem occur more frequently with ambitious individual indicates the degree which one persistent hardworking and motivated goal achievement zhao seibert this dimension proven good personality predictor the ability work hard barrick mount and could regarded composition achievement motivation and dependability mount barrick literature suggests that value such achievement motivation are correlated entrepreneurship because individual feel that performance due their own effort rather than other factor mcclelland the metaanalysis zhao find support for this theory because conscientiousness found positively related entrepreneurial intention wang also find that conscientiousness can predict entrepreneurial intention but through the effect selfefficacy just like openness experience zhao find positive relationship between conscientiousness and firm performance but confidence interval contains zero therefore conscientiousness also positively related entrepreneurial intention but also can not significantly related firm performance regarding innovation marcati find negative significant correlation with conscientiousness individual high conscientiousness may consequently aspire entrepreneurial ambition but may not sufficiently inclined adopt innovative technology start fintech venture extraversion extraversion describes energetic talkative enthusiastic assertive and dominant people costa mccrae more introverted individual that score low this trait are more reserved quiet germonpr toon lefevre jenten and independent zhao seibert find that entrepreneur score higher extraversion than manager which suggests that extraversion positively correlated entrepreneurship they argue that trait related extraversion are important for entrepreneur who need convince stakeholder invest business with them additionally they argue that extraversion promotes social interaction with employee entrepreneur who are talkative and enthusiastic may improve human relation work and enhance team performance the study zhao provides support for positive relationship between extraversion and performance wang also find indirect relationship between extraversion and entrepreneurial intention supporting the previously mentioned argument finally extraversion also positively related innovation marcati individual high this personality dimension therefore ought more likely and capable start fintech venture agreeableness agreeableness indicates which degree individual are trusting forgiving caring altruistic and even gullible individual scoring high agreeableness have preference for positive interpersonal relationship whereas individual the opposite side the scale are more manipulative selfcentred and suspicious costa mccrae zhao and seibert argue that high agreeableness may inhibit the willingness drive hard bargain look out for one own selfinterest and the ability manipulate others for one own interest these characteristic are probably helpful venture creation and success later zhao hypothesised that agreeableness would negatively related entrepreneurial intention they argue that people high agreeableness are more interested career social work teaching than business because those occupation allow them work for the benefit others the confidence interval predicting entrepreneurial intention contains zero the study zhao they consequently find support for relationship between agreeableness and entrepreneurial intention wang however find indirect relationship between agreeableness and entrepreneurial intention agreeableness therefore the first personality dimension for which clear relationship with entrepreneurial intention exists for firm performance zhao also did not find sufficient study examine the relation with agreeableness this dimension found negatively related the adaptation innovation marcati germonpr toon lefevre jenten agreeableness thus doe not seem promote innovative entrepreneurial action which required for fintech startup neuroticism neuroticism represents the emotional stability individual the low end this scale emotionally stable individual scoring high neuroticism are characterised negative emotion such anxiety hostility impulsiveness vulnerability and selfconsciousness costa mccrae emotionally stable individual ought more calm selfconfident even tempered and relaxed zhao seibert because entrepreneur and young venture are likely deal with uncertainty and consequently stressing environment individual acting these environment ought emotionally stable this theory supported zhao who find positive relationship between emotional stability and the intention become entrepreneur however for this personality dimension wang did not find relation with entrepreneurial intention based the metaanalysis zhao and the study wang the effect neuroticism entrepreneurial intention thus remains inconclusive interestingly zhao find that neuroticism negatively related firm growth and profitability which proxy for firm performance this may indicate that more calm and selfconfident individual can make better decision regarding firm operation and strategy marcati found significant correlation between neuroticism and specific innovation the following table summarizes the expected correlation between personality trait and entrepreneurial intention firm performance and innovative behaviour openness experience and extraversion seem beneficial trait posse when one start venture conscientiousness and agreeableness seem positively related entrepreneurial intention but negatively the adaptation new innovation these two trait therefore may not increase the likelihood successful venturing emerging market where new technology are key diversify from incumbent and competitor neuroticism negatively related both entrepreneurial intention and firm performance and thus unlikely stimulate startup formation and success germonpr toon lefevre jenten big dimension zhao wang firm performance innovation sufficient data significant correlation personality trait and cultural dimension the previous section personality trait were linked entrepreneurial and innovative behaviour which could influence fintech startup rate hofstede and mccrae studied the degree which these personality trait can associated with cultural dimension they argue that mean level personality trait population may give rise different cultural practice institution hofstede and mccrae did not include the longterm orientation their study because score were only available for out the country used measure the other four dimension additionally the ltodimension only positively with extraversion but the correlation extraversion with individualism stronger adding longterm orientation added value the analysis longterm orientation also too strongly correlated with individualism hofstede mccrae found the following zeroorder correlation between the cultural dimension and the big five ibm culture dimension ind pdi significance level the remainder the article hofstede and mccrae each offer model which dimension culture explain mean level trait and vice versa however interesting note that individualism only strongly and positively correlated with extraversion germonpr toon lefevre jenten hofstede stepwise regression includes gross national product per caput proxy for wealth control variable this variable predicts phenomenon better than culture the explanation from cultural dimension considered probably redundant this the case for power distance predictor conscientiousness hofstede mccrae argue that prosperity allows people behave conscientiously more wastefully stepwise regression big score against cultural dimension across country cumulative adj predictor criterion neuroticism extraversion openness experience agreeableness conscientiousness ind pdi pdi the variance neuroticism which appears negatively correlated with entrepreneurial intention and innovation could partly explained uncertainty avoidance and masculinity hofstede found study that link uncertainty avoidance with stress anxiety and expression emotion masculinity associated with higher neuroticism because cultural femininity focus relationship people and quality life which are more conducive for emotional stability extraversion mostly explained the individualism dimension hofstede hofstede mccrae argues that collectivism correlated with expertise duty and security which suggest more introverted behaviour femininity also explains extraversion this possibly because individual need display extraverted behaviour build relationship which are important for people scoring high femininity openness experience positively correlated with masculinity and uncertainty avoidance but negatively with power distance culture low power distance tend stimulate independent exploration hofstede show that low power distance country obtained more noble prize support this theory hofstede germonpr toon lefevre jenten mccrae hofstede mccrae proposes two hypothesis which support his claim that personality trait may among the cause culturallevel difference firstly the selective migration hypothesis argues that individual move and out group find environment where they fit best population high power distance could for example explained highly introverted individual who more easily tolerate the restricted access position leadership secondly the reverse causation hypothesis suggests that culture shaped the aggregate personality trait member hofstede mccrae consequently value system and institution are seen social adaptation the psychological environment represented the distribution personality trait stepwise regression culture score against big score across country criterion predictor cumulative adj uncertainty avoidance power distance individualism masculinity the combined effect neuroticism and low agreeableness lead group people who generally are tense and irritable hofstede mccrae decision these group would potential source conflict they adopt rule and develop institution avoid this individualism associated with freer social interaction and the inclination make new social contact these behavioural action are more associated with extravert which consequently found predict individualism introverted individual rather tend stick tight group which are familiar people such family colleague power distance associated with introversion and conscientiousness because natural leader which are few due high level introversion can easily rise position authority individual are conscientious this scenario and would therefore accept the dominance leader leading stable and productive system hofstede mccrae hofstede mccrae find real reason why neuroticism openness would are positively associated with masculinity germonpr toon lefevre jenten cultural dimension and venture investment another factor that impact the amount startup company across different nation the availability capital that can invested fintech startup haddad and hornuf find that access venture capital important factor facilitate the startup fintech venture they state that access venture capital not equally available every region the world indicating geographical difference possibly originating from cultural difference literature linking culture and capital investment young business very scarce this possibly due the fact that the venture capital market seem nationally based and the relevance culture probably low wright wright argue that venture capitalist would restricted from investing abroad due cultural difference and geographical distance and zahra argue that venture capital activity lower culture high uncertainty avoidance because risky activity require higher risk premium and investor high uncertainty society are likely enter into these risky activity their result support this theory with significant negative coefficient for uncertainty avoidance predicting the number investment new firm later cumming report negative and statistically significant impact uncertainty avoidance the amount cleantech venture capital deal they attribute this relationship lower openness venture capitalist towards risk taking and new idea high uncertainty avoidance country perry also find that new venture investment are influenced this cultural dimension they report that individual with high degree uncertainty avoidance are likely invest family member venture perry hypothesize that society characterised high uncertainty avoidance strive make the future predictable these society investment new venture would perceived too risky versus investment established company their test support this hypothesis providing further support for negative expected relationship between uncertainty avoidance and investment new venture there are indication that collectivism also negatively associated with the number startup that are being invested and zahra hypothesize that collectivist orientation weakens germonpr toon lefevre jenten the positive impact formal institutional development venture capital activity they argue that the collectivist orientation would limit the development institution confine venture capitalist deal flow those connected their existing network and exclude potential new unknown venture capitalist from joining the network and zahra find that the collectivism coefficient negative and significant predicting fewer investment new firm and supporting their hypothesis perry studied the effect ingroup collectivism the likelihood investment new venture begun family member globe ingroup collectivism refers the degree which individual express pride loyalty and cohesiveness their group this definition corresponds with hofstede collectivism dimension perry find negative significant coefficient which implies that not only venture capital investment but also investment made earlier stage financers seem negatively affected culture that are highly collectivist this cultural dimension thus may also influence the financing before venture capital required for further growth financing hypothesis explore the impact the cultural dimension fintech startup build this section our hypothesis around the five hofstede dimension and three indispensable factor for venture creation entrepreneurship innovation and access financing the literature review gave insight into different contradicting theory regarding the first cultural dimension power distance and entrepreneurship the lack consensus suggests that this cultural dimension own will not impact the fintech startup potential manner for this dimension influence the startup rate fintech venture through ownership idea and innovation this based knight theory that the chance success innovative idea increase with the degree ownership that individual can take for nation scoring low power distance the acceptance unequal distribution power inherent and the possibility take ownership may higher individual might therefore have more incentive pursue innovative idea that may bring new fintech service product moreover individual these society may have access resource more easily and quickly low power distance culture and can consequently execute idea more easily and quickly finally power distance germonpr toon lefevre jenten also found negatively related the adaptation innovative technology marcati and entrepreneurial intention through negative correlation with extraversion zhao wang hofstede mccrae building the ownership theory and the relation power distance with extraversion hypothesise the following hypothesis fintech startup occur more frequently country that score low the power distance variable hofstede argued that the population country scoring high individualism tend more autonomous and attach more value freedom and individual interest rather than the interest group they pertain additionally successful entrepreneurship can bring great reward for entrepreneur the literature review found that individualistic culture may have more interest materialistic achievement against whereas there seems propensity collectivist culture towards conformity the population individualistic country may thus more motivated pursue the creation venture additionally individual high individualism country may more confident and believe that they can make successfully start venture mueller thomas argue that individualistic culture foster entrepreneurial value which promote selfreliance and independent action opposed collectivistic culture they find that individualism positive and significant predictor for internal locus control locus control measure what degree individual believe that external factor around them drive event their life internal locus control indicates the belief that one can control event this theory supported the relation extraversion with individualism hofstede mccrae because extraversion associated with higher entrepreneurial intention and adaptation new technology zhao wang marcati innovation therefore seems positively related individualism the freedom and autonomy that are correlated individualism may spur individual think creatively and execute new idea the combined positive influence individualism entrepreneurial trait intention and innovation suggests that fintech startup rate are positively correlated with individualism germonpr toon lefevre jenten hypothesis fintech startup are more likely occur country that score high the individualism cultural dimension culture that score high the masculinity dimension ought have population that are more ambitious because they value money and success more than people culture that score low masculinity however hofstede and mccrae show that the correlation masculinity with personality trait the strongest with neuroticism and positive relation neuroticism negatively related both entrepreneurial intention and firm performance additionally femininity associated with agreeableness and building good relationship with people this may benefit relationship with both internal and external stakeholder masculinity should thus lead fewer successful startup given expected relation with personality trait the financing side the competitive aspect combined with machoism may lead more risktaking behaviour strive the best this could have positive impact available financing fund manager more masculine culture could more easily persuaded invest risky business with high potential resulting higher count backed fintech startup because don find conclusive answer the literature review and think that the feminine pole also advantage for startup creation hypothesize that masculinity will have predictive power hypothesis fintech startup rate can not predicted the masculinity dimension the fourth cultural dimension uncertainty avoidance hand hand with greater fear failure and ambition which aren beneficial for entrepreneurship bogatyreva argue that individual society low uncertainty avoidance are also more comfortable unstructured situation and find supporting result for their theory start venture technology related sector the company and entrepreneur will have bear risk and tolerant ambiguity risk can originate from the potentially fierce competition against incumbent and other fintech company entrepreneur the sector should thus proactive and ambitious additionally hofstede and mccrae find positive relation between uncertainty avoidance and the neuroticism personality trait neuroticism negatively related both entrepreneurial germonpr toon lefevre jenten intention zhao and the adaptation new innovation marcati finally the negative relationship between uncertainty avoidance and investment venture capitalist zahra family venture financing perry suggest that early stage financing harder obtain culture high uncertainty avoidance therefore expect that country that score higher the uncertainty avoidance index see fewer fintech startup formation due smaller supply entrepreneur which may inclined adopt innovation and access financing hypothesis fintech startup occur more frequently country that score low the uncertainty avoidance index because fintech company highly depend their technology and innovation value that characterize longterm oriented culture ought more beneficial for the creation these company than their shortterm counterpart longterm working value that may particularly stimulating for fintech entrepreneur are learning planning and adaptiveness these value are important for acquiring knowledge and using that knowledge create more relevant product service environment nation where these value are prevalent may consequently stimulate the search for new alternative product within the financial technology market additionally the importance thrift and tenacity pursue goal are also expected positively correlated with entrepreneurial characteristic value associated with shortterm orientation the other hand may detrimental for entrepreneurial success the immediate need for gratification and spending norm could for example lead population that lower tendency apply bootstrapping whereas the opposite would true for culture the other side the spectrum national longterm orientation should thus stimulate the application knowledge the creation innovative product service therefore hypothesize the following hypothesis fintech startup occur more frequently country with longterm orientation the effect high individualism may strengthened culture low uncertainty avoidance because this combination ought make entrepreneur more comfortable dynamic germonpr toon lefevre jenten ambiguous environment ambitious individual who take initiative are comfortable ambiguous situation and that have high degree independence should more predisposed for fintech entrepreneurship than their ambitious counterpart who prefer risky working environment therefore introduce the following hypothesis with interaction between individualism and uncertainty avoidance hypothesis fintech startup are more likely occur country that score high the individualism and low the uncertainty avoidance cultural dimension because growing business requires patience and longterm planning argue that there may interaction effect individualism and longterm orientation previously mentioned that people individualistic culture tend attach more value materialistic achievement these individual are more able learn and use knowledge reach their goal they may more inclined start venture trying obtain higher wealth this relation may enhanced culture high longterm orientation because investment manager may more inclined educated and think the long term more pragmatic approach hypothesis fintech startup are more likely occur country that score high the individualism and high the longterm orientation cultural dimension methodology the platform used gather data for our dependent variable the dealroom database help investor corporates and local government discover and track innovative company collecting data across all investment stage from seed late growthstage total the database hold information about company from which startup and corporate investor across the entire globe the database information about fintech startup company worldwide the sample haddad and hornuf restructured dealroom finding fintechs this remarkably higher than the fintech startup formation found their sample using crunchbase result dealroom used instead crunchbase because collect more data about fintech company and financing germonpr toon lefevre jenten retrieved the data about fintech startup march collaboration with dimitrios kolokas from vlerick business school our sample consists country over the period until and includes crosscountry data without any income geographical restriction filter see appendix table for list country used our data however information not included because possible that some the dealroom data obtained with time lag research the impact culture the fintech startup data the two dependent variable new fintech and new vcbacked fintech retrieved from dealroom this sample consisting panel data observation per dependent variable are collected the variable new fintech describes the number fintech startup formation given year and country and our main dependent variable the second measure defines the number the previously mentioned new fintech startup given year and country that currently are were backed venture capitalist from seed late growth stage the second measure will used robustness check our research total new fintech formation which vcbacked started the post financial crisis period controlled for survivorship bias excluding the hidden filter closed dealroom result our analysis also take into account startup that are longer operational today but that were launched during the period line with the statistical method used research york and lenox dushnitsky and haddad and hornuf also apply random effect model for our regression analysis however the dependent variable are count variable and thus normalized through natural logarithm the random effect model take into account the clustering observation country level affirming that dispersion varies randomly from cluster cluster rao incorporates random crosscountry specific effect into the relationship between the expected number fintechs independent variable and mediator also include set year dummy account for the unobserved effect time the number fintech startup for the independent variable data about the cultural factor power distance individualism masculinity uncertainty avoidance and longterm orientation collected from the database all mentioned transformation variable are executed calculating the with the observed value the variable germonpr toon lefevre jenten hofstede insight and checked with the most recent data provided professor geert hofstede not only the main effect but also interaction effect these dimension named ind and ind lto will researched test the aforementioned hypothesis the quantified score the five hofstede dimension are given range consequently multiple mediator are included our data set control for several factor that will affect the number fintech startup formation these variable are lagged for one year predict the effect the dependent variable for the period there are several database consulted collect this data mentioned literature haddad and hornuf proved that several factor will positively negatively impact the number fintech formation the author not link this with cultural trait and the appropriate variable which control for factor other than culture however include one model named model which replicate the study haddad and hornuf but with adding the cultural dimension furthermore built second model named model following the method used the paper frese rauch and zhao beside culture they distinguish two variable that are important predict earlystage highinnovation entrepreneurship model first specify the control variable for model replicating the significant variable research about the emergence fintech startup formation from haddad and hornuf test the impact welldeveloped economy and capital market included several variable firstly control for the general development financial inclusion capital market the natural logarithm the variable deposit gdp introduced the deposit gdp variable retrieved from the version the imf international financial statistic using demand time and saving deposit deposit money bank share gdp research show that country where the availability financial product and service higher with deposit gdp used proxy will not only aid economic development and poverty alleviation but will also help enhance financial stability han melecky the variable deposit gdp not included calculated using the following deflation method ftpet ftpet gdptpat where demand time and saving deposit endof period cpi and average annual cpi germonpr toon lefevre jenten the research haddad and hornuf insert this variable because believe that good proxy indicate strong economy furthermore evaluate the development the venture capital market the measure availability used mediator the variable measured the world economic forum global competitiveness index and answer the question your country how easy for entrepreneur with innovative but risky project find venture capital extremely difficult extremely easy thereafter the natural logarithm gdp per caput measure the prosperity certain country and collected from the world development indicator database according research from durham higher level gdp per caput should lead more growing capital market furthermore haidar prof that the level investor protection matter for economic growth country with better protection tend grow faster than those with poor investor protection control for this effect included the

from the survey the world economic forum global competitiveness report this survey the following question asked your country how easy obtain bank loan with only good business plan and collateral extremely difficult extremely easy the effect the availability the latest technology fintech startup measured the logtransformation the variable secure internet server mobile subscription and availability latest technology the first variable measure the number distinct publiclytrusted server using encryption technology per one million people composed information from the netcraft secure server survey and population data from the world bank the mediator mobile subscription show how mobile cellular subscription per people vary country the indicator includes the number postpaid subscription and active prepaid account that germonpr toon lefevre jenten have been used during the last three month and applies all mobile cellular subscription that offer voice communication retrieved from the world telecommunicationict development report and database the international telecommunication union the third variable availability latest technology constructed answer from the survey question the global competitiveness report the world bank your country what extent are the latest technology available not all great extent furthermore need check for the effect market regulation and labour force fintech startup formation the variable credit market regulation labour market regulation business regulation and strength legal right represent the market regulation for country specific year the first three variable are collected from the fraser institute database and give score zero ten high rating indicates that country have control over market force and allow the

moreover the strength legal right index measure the degree which collateral and bankruptcy law protect the right borrower and lender and thus facilitate lending the index range from with higher score indicating that these law are better designed expand access credit this data collected from the doing business project the world bank finally the labour force variable measured using the world development indicator database and transformed natural logarithm comprises the total people from least year age who supply labour for the production good and service during specified period the variable includes people who are currently employed but also people who are unemployed but seeking work and firsttime jobseekers are included the general efficiency the legal system country may affect entrepreneurship for this reason introduce the variable rule law this measure provides perception the extent which agent have confidence and will abide the rule society and particularly the quality contract enforcement property right the police and the court well the likelihood crime and violence higher value indicate better legal system the worldwide governance indicator project the world bank collected this data haddad and hornuf also germonpr toon lefevre jenten control for entrepreneurial environment total number new startup formation their research indicated literature assume that the cultural dimension can used proxy for this variable and for this reason don insert this variable our research model for the mediator model inserted variable that coincide with those used the work frese rauch and zhao about crosscountry difference entrepreneurial activity concern two variable that have been discussed the above outline model the first one gdp per caput used proxy for national wealth the different country secondly the variable business regulation inserted institutional variable controlling the presence and goodnatured strictness entrepreneurial law particular country all variable both model are explained and referenced source appendix table descriptives summary statistic concerning the summary statistic the dependent variable remarkable that over all observation average around twentythree fintech startup per country are launched during the period and that average approximately eight these twentythree fintech startup are backed venture capitalist this prof that the fintech startup market highly financed through vcfunds the importance investing fintechs becomes clear kpmg biannual analysis investment fintech sector this report show that the growing

several ratio are calculated interpret the importance the fintech startup over the entire vcbacked includes seed capital and investment early and late germonpr toon lefevre jenten startup market panel considers the number fintechs per year panel certifies the twenty largest fintech supplier and panel summarizes the sample per continent panel notice increasing trend fintech startup formation from until this corresponds with the analysis haddad and hornuf which they declare upsurge fintech formation after the financial crisis from onwards the number fintech formation decreased until fintech startup were founded comparison with which the period with the maximum financial technology startup formation the same evolution recognized for the total startup formation over the sample period the only difference that total number startup started decreasing from and not however deducted from the ratio the fintech with the total startup market the presence the fintech industry the largest when the startup market consisted fintech corporation the reason for this proportional higher decline the total startup company when compared the indicated decrease the aggregated amount fintech company furthermore the activity fintech startup investigated important mention that according research kpmg and innovate finance both deal and invested fund fintech startup are still increasing every year with china the united state and the united kingdom the most important country measured invested capital the collected data about financing only take into account company that are backed from early late growth stage and disregard whether they are financed one more one multiple financing round and neither the size the deal taken into account using these variable possible measure how many company have financed their project with capital during the startup phase this ratio vcbacked fintech startup over total fintech startup doe not vary much over the entire sample period however the highest percentage date from and when venture capitalist backed approximately all launched fintechs the proportion the vcbacked fintechs over all vcbacked corporation the most noticeable general over the

analysed later this work nevertheless want research the impact the most extreme case the fintech startup market and financing after the absolute number fintech startup introduced two ratio which control for the difference country size for example brazil more than million inhabitant and sweden around million but the amount fintechs raised average similar both country result the fintech startup are hotter industry sweden with fintechs per million inhabitant than brazil where the average only fintechs population data per country divided one million retrieved from the world bank check for this effect the first section about the power distance index show that fintech startup formation mainly occur country with the lowest score which average fintechs are founded with fintech startup per million caput this remarkably higher than highest quarter score which report average fintechs and only fintech per million caput the main driver the lowpdi score sample israel where approximately fintech company are set per one million people according hofstede insight israeli strongly believe decentralized germonpr toon lefevre jenten power with independency equal right accessible superior and empowerment core value report deloitte describes israel fintech landscape and concludes that israel becoming fintech hub line with silicon valley singapore and london the core reason are the innovative disruptive entrepreneurial culture which encourages experimentation and embrace failure and substantial government support deloitte furthermore the absolute fintech activity somewhat similar between the country split however vcbacked fintech startup company per million inhabitant are more common low pdi country the individualism cultural factor place the majority country the low side this dimension although comparing the fintech activity both category obvious that fintech startup formation are more widespread individualistic country with average fintechs against fintechs and controlled for size fintech per million people against the and are responsible for the largest effect child the are taught from early age think for themselves and how they can uniquely contribute society the society also loosely knit which people look after themselves american are accustomed business with people they not know and display initiative the corporate world hofstede insight together with australia canada the netherlands and italy six out the twenty largest fintech supplier are represented the individualism dimension upper level also seems that vcbacked fintech startup can found more selfreliant society furthermore the third section about the masculinity dimension only small part the total sample show high masculine feminine score the average number financial technology startup absolute figure and per million caput higher more feminine country noticeable that the highest ratio per million inhabitant for lithuania small eastern european country with only million inhabitant fintech per million caput know tender culture where standing out the crowd not admirable and where people are motivated because they just what they like the presence venture capitalist the fintech market are slightly higher the low masculinity country controlled for population all fintech startup are financed private equity player country low masculinity against for country high masculinity score germonpr toon lefevre jenten about uncertainty avoidance only two country have remarkable low value for this dimension the average the fintech startup these country singapore and denmark about four fintechs per one million people higher than the average the risk averse country both country are wellknown society risk taker that prefer change and challenge furthermore seems that vcbacked fintechs are also more present these low uncertainty avoidance country the last caption table panel describes the longterm orientation dimension can deducted that fintech entrepreneurship more common pragmatic country these country like germany and china report high number fintech startup formation but these are both country with enormous population when controlled for number fintech startup per one million people another easteuropean country estonia report fintechs during according hofstede insight estonian show ability adapt easily other condition and have tenacity achieving result for example the longterm vision the country becomes clear the eestonia service offered the government the amount fintech startup financed venture capitalist highest for the ltorientated country average and controlled for population almost four out ten fintech startup had venture capital injection comparison with for country that report the lowest score this dimension moreover table appendix describes the univariate statistic the variable after listwise deletion missing data point bivariate statistic table appendix describes the pearson correlation the data set recognize that this simple empirical relation between dependent and independent variable doe not directly indicate the concept causation extraneous variable called spurious factor may also intervene the relationship between the dependent and independent variable the effect refers estonian governmental organization that facilitates citizen interaction such government service voting tax education through the use electronic solution for example voting done with application robustness check the spearman rho obtained for measuring covariation between variable with ordinal distribution and the scale dependent variable similar correlation were found germonpr toon lefevre jenten the most plausible factor based prior research and the particular context fintech startup researched the following chapter however several pattern the correlation are worth mentioning furthermore the lagged variable and the cultural factor which are rooted from country related tradition satisfy the condition temporal precedence van ven the covariation between the dependent and independent variable are all significant first all power distance index negatively correlated with the new fintech startup formation this line with the assumption hypothesis that nation with low score the pdi stand for more ownership and thus following knight theory more fintech startup moreover strong positive relationship between individualism and the number fintechs recognized result higher level individualism might lead upwards tendency fintech startup formation this may support our second hypothesis which assumed that the positive influence individualism entrepreneurial trait motivation and innovation will upwards affect the number fintech startup formation hypothesis suggests that neither lower nor higher value the masculinity dimension are linked with the dependent variable this may not affirmed the correlation matrix which shown that this cultural dimension relates positively however weak with the dependent variable concerning the fourth hypothesis uncertainty avoidance negatively correlated with the number fintech startup line with bogatyreva this may elucidate that entrepreneur starting technology related sector need more comfortable unstructured situation for the longterm orientation dimension the pearson correlation coefficient show positive relationship stated the last hypothesis about the main effect can suggested that longterm working value may stimulate entrepreneur start fintech venture interesting mention that different finding can also encountered with respect our own correlation and those the work haddad and hornuf for the replicated variable that will used model compared both correlation matrix while acknowledging the aforementioned limitation about correlation and causation line with their finding find that the variable describing the development the economy and capital market are positively correlated with the dependent variable for the ease access loan variable measuring the effect the soundness the financial system positive correlation both sample can germonpr toon lefevre jenten found considering the availability the latest technology and infrastructure can said that the variable secure internet server and availability latest technology are both sample positively correlated with the number fintech startup difference can found for the variable mobile telephone subscription but with very weak and insignificant correlation can concluded that this variable doe not covariate with the number fintech startup formation both case moreover the measure describing the impact market regulation and labour force the fintech startup show similar and positive correlation our research and that haddad and hornuf overall can thus concluded that analogous covariation for the corresponding measure between both sample were found and that those bivariate relationship are line with three out four hypothesis the paper haddad and hornuf about the welldeveloped capital market latest technology and infrastructure regulation and labour market although the variable ease access loan show correlation which opposite the assumption that fintech startup occur more country with more fragile financial sector this might indicate that fintech and traditional financial service can complement haddad hornuf both control variable that will applied model show significant and positive correlation with the number fintech startup formation this may indicate that country with higher gdp that provide richer environment for venture embrace more highquality entrepreneurship than country with medium lowgdp moreover the higher value the variable business regulation may point out that country with more adaptive institutional condition may support entrepreneurial activity frese rauch zhao germonpr toon lefevre jenten cultural determinant fintech startup order analyse the impact cultural dimension the number fintech startup formation implemented multivariate analysis our longitudinal data for the two aforementioned model this chapter will test the hypothesis and determine whether culture impact fintech startup formation therefore specify six different regression for both model the first five regression research the main effect each dimension separately the amount fintech startup the integral and thus sixth model includes all cultural dimension along with the specified interaction term the independent variable mentioned the methodology this study proposes the following random effect regression which indicates the separate country country after listwise

tested the lagrange multiplier test and indicates that the random effect able deal with the heterogeneity better than pooled ols model breusch pagan the hausman test evaluates whether not the

fixed effect model with demeaned variable not applicable for this study because the timeinvariant character the independent variable what follows the regression result are discussed for both model also test and report the lagrange multiplier test called the breuschpagan test and hausman test prove that the random effect regression robustness check for multicollinearity the variance inflation

robustness the result checked replicating both model with the dependent variable new vcbacked fintech model the first model including all six regression reported table panel with panel robustness check the appendix order research the first five hypothesis the main effect the individual cultural dimension investigated the last regression includes two interaction term testing hypothesis and all regression indicate that the use random effect model appropriate general the result all six regression show relatively uniform picture display that the majority hofstede cultural dimension are not direct predictor the prevalence fintech startup formation society taken into account socalled spurious factor that are significant according haddad and hornuf regarding pdi find significant relationship between the power distance index and the number fintech startup formation this doe not support hypothesis which assumes negative relationship between these variable because the ownership theory and the relation between power distance and extraversion for individualism table show that the relation between this dimension and the number fintech startup positive and significant this line with the expected combined effect individualism entrepreneurial trait intention and innovation described hypothesis the result therefore indicates that more fintech startup formation emerge the country during the sample period they are proven more individualistic and extravert this big five trait strongly correlated with the individualism dimension furthermore find evidence that more masculine value should lead increase decrease fintech formation this line with hypothesis which argue that either value linked the masculine and feminine pole the dimension can advantage for startup creation moreover uncertainty avoidance not statistically related the number fintech formation during the period the assumption hypothesis that fewer fintech formation emerge due smaller supply entrepreneur high uacountries therefore doe not hold similar result were found for the lto dimension although high scale value indicate pragmatic society can not confirm hypothesis thus germonpr toon lefevre jenten the positive effect that the application modern knowledge way prepare for the future should have the number new fintech venture stay out finally the effect both interaction term the column full also not significant indicating that the combination being more individualistic and riskaverse more pragmatic doe not indicate that country will know upsurge number fintech startup venture comparing our result with those haddad and hornuf find some conflicting result overall also discover positive significant link between gdp per caput and fintech startup formation the following year addition higher investor protection index positively related with new fintech startup the next year country with this kind optimized legal protection which present financial hub such silicon valley london singapore lead logically towards more investor which can explain the positive relation between both variable knowing that nowadays private equity player invest large amount fintech venture though indicated use this variable proxy for the welldeveloped economy trying find support for the assumption that fintech startup occur more country welldeveloped economy and capital market both variable are line with the result haddad and hornuf and indicate that fintech formation take place welldeveloped economy however haddad and hornuf report strong and positive relationship between financing and the dependent variable but don find direct statistical support between our variable availability and the number fintech startup formation this result may explained because the variable our research measure the availability capital answer ordinal scale crossnational survey the measure the work haddad and hornuf gauge the total amount funding all startup excluding the fintech startup while our measure doe not take into account the absolute amount venture capital available over all startup venture for example high value for our variable availability are found for hong kong and malaysia but the invested amount certainly higher the and compared the former mentioned region hong kong and malaysia also don immediately show high number fintech startup when compared the and consequently our sample show evidence that the presence new technology supporting infrastructure should impact the number startup formation the fintech industry germonpr toon lefevre jenten this not line with haddad and hornuf that find support that more fintech formation are launched country were secure internet server mobile telephone subscription the latest technology are emphatically more available concerning their hypothesis about the frailty the financial system haddad and hornuf included several variable like the soundness bank investment profile and the ease access loan the latter found significant and thus included our research comparing our result with theirs negative relationship between the dependent and this variable found this multivariate analysis easier access corporate credit yeart linked frail financial system lead not directly towards upward trend fintech startup formation yeart assumed haddad and hornuf larger and more varied supply labour signalling probable higher number talent and entrepreneurship significant and positively related the number fintech startup the following year the regulation index our sample contradiction with haddad and hornuf split into three variable for our sample table show that higher credit market index positively related the number new beginning fintech venture the next year accordingly haddad and hornuf demonstrate that individual are more likely have entrepreneurial ambition with supportive regulatory regime this case benevolent credit market should lead more entrepreneurial activity the fintech sector both variable are line with the hypothesis haddad and hornuf indicating that fintech startup occur more frequently country with benevolent regulation and larger labour market the robustness check panel appendix show that the individualism dimension statistical positive impact anymore when the dependent variable filtered for fintech startup that are were vcbacked the presence venture capitalist country take thus the feature being more entrepreneurial through individualism away this can explained the fact that large financial ecosystem lot private equity player provide huge amount capital but these financial ecosystem indicate that higher amount backed fintech startup not naturally linked with high individualism dimension concerning the mediator similar the variable soundness bank measure the

the result find statistical support for hypothesis ind and hypothesis masc the one hand but reject hypothesis pdi hypothesis hypothesis lto and hypothesis interaction the other hand even use mediator important predict earlystage highinnovation entrepreneurship can not find any evidence that all mentioned cultural dimension hofstede are linked with more entrepreneurship the fintech sector this can explained hofstede conclusion that gnp gdp our sample per caput variable predicts phenomenon better than culture the explanation from cultural dimension considered redundant mentioned literature hofstede proved this his sample with only gnp per caput mediator individualism the sole exception with strong significant impact the number fintech startup the assumption that the population germonpr

benevolent strictness business law particular country one should think that better corporate regulation and legislation determine individual choice leading towards more entrepreneurship but empirical evidence found for this relationship with regard the fintech industry the robustness check panel appendix show result that are mainly line with those panel there can deducted that the individualism dimension still statistical positive impact when the dependent variable filtered for fintech startup that are were vcbacked checking for vcbacked company only also indicates significant negative impact the amount startup the fintech sector this result support the assumed negative relationship between uncertainty avoidance and vcinvestment and can explained the lower openness towards risk

considerable different culture and associated institution between group region using nation score cultural dimension variance culture and other variable may eliminated consequently potential present impact culture may not have been found due the nature the data secondly possible that cultural dimension interact with other variable that are not present the data set high education level could for example provide individual with more knowledge that can applied develop fintech service this variable could interact with longterm orientation and lead more wellthought out business plan with viable innovative technology another example the presence sandbox which stimulate the creation fintech startup this variable omitted the model this study and should preferably included future research another limitation that may hide the impact culture the startup rate the dataset although add many country possible there are few country included that score low power distance masculinity uncertainty avoidance for these dimension the amount country the low category represent than all nation this indicates that the variance these cultural dimension may low and reduces the possibility use them explaining variable particularly power distance and uncertainty avoidance illustrate how concentrated the value some cultural dimension can the aggregated proportion nation scoring mediumlow and

definitely more present financial centre however fintech globally recognized strong emerging market and belongs the top three sector which invested the main scope this paper discover the impact hofstede cultural dimension fintech startup rate during over crosscountry sample using two model find limited support for this because only the main effect individualism seems robust positive predictor the startup the individualism dimension may explain the higher rate through association with entrepreneurial intention entrepreneurial trait such extraversion and adaptation innovation furthermore our research also show that the genderrelated cultural dimension masculinity show impact fintech formation and line with the inconclusive literature about masculinity and entrepreneurship the other cultural dimension did not show significant coefficient resulting the rejection their corresponding hypothesis the sole exception significant negative effect uncertainty avoidance over the sample vcbacked fintech formation this conclusion line with those and zahra cumming moreover the tested moderating effect between individualism and uncertainty avoidance longterm orientation seems have effect fintech startup rate general can conclude that culture thus appear play role explaining startup rate the fintech sector the structure the study also allowed partly replicate the model haddad and hornuf and confirm their finding our result are mostly line with their result and show positive impact welldeveloped economy larger labour market and benevolent regulation the amount fintech startup could however not find support that the appearance fintech startup more common country that dispose the newest technology and associated supporting infrastructure available consequently our sample can not confirm the hypothesis that the frailty the financial sector influence fintech startup rate germonpr toon lefevre jenten reference aggarwal faccio guedhami kwok culture
