service the market the user perception and the provider fintech service the study focus analysing potential anticompetitive factor and their impact both the fintech ecosystem whole and concrete service category the area fintech still very young and constantly evolving this why established case practice how deal with competition concern not yet been developed and official decision competition authority have still emerge the fintech service fintech service offer significant potential benefit european consumer such cost reduction improvement efficiency greater transparency and contribution the goal financial inclusion fintech come revolutionise the way which traditional financial service provider work and interact with their customer changing the dominant paradigm which traditional financial service are provided resulting significant disruption given the rapid evolution fintech service there consensus standard classification this study the following category are proposed which encompass the fintech service currently provided banking deposit and lending payment transfer and forex digital currency wealth and asset management personal finance insurtech and enabling technology and infrastructure the fintech market the difficulty defining the exact scope fintech service make challenging quantify the size the current and potential market additional difficulty the complexity differentiating fintech service provided traditional firm the financial sector from other service result there are estimate turnover for fintech service considering all the service analysed this study whole europe the moment the fintech user some source estimate that the average percentage digitally active consumer using fintech service europe the and spain are the country with the highest share fintech user with and respectively germany with the third european country above the global average globally fintech service related payment and transfer showed the highest penetration among user followed insurance saving and investment financial planning and borrowing fintech considered have enormous potential improving financial inclusion fintech service have the capacity providing more easily accessible and affordable financial service large mass the population and small and mediumsized enterprise smes especially the area credit and payment policy department economic and scientific policy besides financial inclusion surprise that improving user experience the heart the conceptual design fintech service fact european expressed their willingness switch their financial service provider doe not offer advanced technology service product unlike what happens with other digitalised service digital skill and access technology are not the only factor influencing the penetration fintech service trust key element all financial service and equally fintech the fintech provider according the crunchbase database there are more than fintech service provider the world the rank number service provider after the with more than fintech company enabler company are the most frequent followed provider banking service the level investment the sector provides good overview the relevance fintech service different region the lead the ranking accounting for some usd billion total investment followed far china the and india shown figure the excluding the rank accounting for usd billion european company including the are smaller with larger number microenterprises with than employee european fintech company excluding the are also younger with average age year compared the and india the and the the percentage fintech company that have been acquired much higher than other market suggests that currently market exit startup fintech company the mainly happens through acquisition company europe are likely acquired larger firm complement their current offering this fact lead the need for close monitoring the acquiring firm avoid anticompetitive behaviour have also analysed the relationship between the acquiring company and the acquired company and concluded there strong geographical endogamy european company are acquired european company and company are mainly acquired company competition issue the fintech sector most the potential competition issue the fintech sector described throughout the study have not occurred have not been detected competition authority far thus the discussion about the competition problem still hypothetical however necessary analyse where competition concern may arise and how they should addressed they may materialise the future the application competition instrument analyse potential anticompetitive behaviour the fintech sector face several challenge the most relevant being the difficulty applying these traditional instrument the new market phenomenon such market definition and assessment market power traditional indicator such market share price profit margin fail explain the economic relationship between offer and demand the provision fintech service missing stable market any analysis competition bound tentative since competition challenge could unfold different direction depending what turn out the decisive factor that provides competitive advantage competition issue the area financial technology fintech commonality fintech competition challenge servicebyservice approach based the business model each service category been used explain the competition issue this should not obscure the fact however that there are strong commonality fintech competition challenge that beyond particular service operator common competition challenge have been analysed taking into account two perspective the supplyside perspective with two category technology that have great influence explaining competition challenge online platform and the intensive use data the demandside perspective which refers the way user access and operate fintech technology and their behaviour and perception fintech technology mean deliver financial service the use multisided online platform provide fintech service implies that the definition the relevant market can not undertaken following traditional model built the premise pipeline business where value generated the supplier product service the case platform the value large part generated the user the other side the second competition challenge resulting from the combination platform dynamic and user perception and behaviour the generation network effect fintech platform are not regulated financial trading platform and therefore the challenge arising from network effect need assessed competition challenge these challenge include the risk that multisided network effect enable large platform insulated from competition from smaller platform with fewer participant and can create barrier entry other factor may play that modulate the intensity and feature the network effect and their influence the potential competition issue particularly relevant whether user tend choose only one provider single homing several provider multihoming network effect increase with the intensity use and the singlehoming nature the platform interoperability another potential anticompetitive factor related platform active pursuit noninteroperability can act deterrence with anticompetitive effect access the market difficult costly standardisation also play relevant role the field competition between fintech provider standardisation lower entry cost and price andor allows firm compete more core part the service then positive effect however standardisation may also result oligopoly where provider may take the opportunity agree feature the service split the market between them access data may become another competition issue the fintech ecosystem therefore the role data establish competitive advantage need borne mind one the element involved assessing the competitive position the company resulting from merger control over unique data trove resulting from the combination datasets from multiple source should also one the main factor considered when assessing potentially anticompetitive behaviour they can result for example exclusionary conduct when not allowing competitor access data the conclusion exclusive contract the incumbent control over particularly valuable dataset create network contract that forecloses competition tying and bundling service leveraging the firm position and imposing the use other service explained section policy department economic and scientific policy computer algorithm themselves may also result anticompetitive practice they may way that promotes express and tacit collusion because they can learn themselves and conclude that the best way maximise profit develop collusive practice specific competition issue each fintech category banking the main obstacle for the development competitive market not due existing anticompetitive behaviour the market but lack clear regulatory standard banking platform market are primarily multihome and not have high intensity use potential anticompetitive factor might not have real impact competition this stage payment transfer and forex payment are the fintech service that competition authority are paying the most attention relevant concern that could lead diminishing competition the provision payment service include access critical asset such data and mobile near field communication nfc chip and the use incumbency position gained offline engage exclusionary conduct towards competitor digital currency the market for digital currency characterised competition between currency intercryptocurrency market and competition between exchange intracryptocurrency market while each submarket namely mining exchange wallet and payment subject diverse dynamic which may result different competition issue there are also common factor among them one the most relevant the presence network effect another potential anticompetitive factor the standardisation distributed ledger technology dlt and other technical protocol private public consortium agreement relation technical standard may affect the market entry have impact current cost denial access the gateway traditional banking activity such payment system for bank account transfer card processor scheme also potential anticompetitive behaviour the arrival permissioned cryptocurrencies promoted bank even central bank will reshape the current competition level the cryptocurrency market broadening the number competitor however the market power bank traditional banking service might used limit competition the cryptocurrency market through preemptive acquisition predatory pricing scheme wealth and asset management the potential competition challenge this area involve the fee policy different service provider the blurring boundary between different type service information advisory management and the implication the use algorithm the last one issue that look more promising from competition policy perspective the effect the use algorithm the provision fintech wealth management service mixed the one hand there are procompetitive effect such increased transparency both price and quality variable well more efficient development product and service the other hand there are also risk for competition such the potential role algorithm facilitating factor for coordination and collusion algorithmic collusion competition issue the area financial technology fintech personal finance management competition issue regarding digital personal finance management pfm service arise mainly the field customer data access insurance access customer data and the impact algorithm pricing strategy are the main factor that can lead anticompetitive practice the standardisation private blockchains might also create barrier entry the standardisation process lack the required transparency enabling technology and infrastructure there are specific competition concern technology such dlts artificial intelligence and data analytics apart from the common one standardisation network effect access data there are some specific niche cybersecurity technology where market concentration and potential competition concern might occur the advanced cloud service market dominated small number big tech company and furthermore the barrier for new actor access this market are huge conclusion the current state the market for fintech service generally too fluid reach firm conclusion the existence competition challenge that need the deployment competition tool largescale basis the special role regulation the field financial service sends message caution about the appropriateness competition policy tool the preferred mean address every challenge fintech service part the digital economy share potential competition challenge with other digital business mainly those derived from the provision service through digital platform and the access customer data thus the remark regarding competition the digital environment remain valid the fintech ecosystem policy department economic and scientific policy the fintech market fintech financial service provided revolutionise the way which traditional financial service provider work and interact with their customer technology have come key finding through fintech provider include three type stakeholder newcomer the sector such startup offering new service product traditional financial service provider incumbent and technological company that develop tool service and product the field competition issue affecting fintech service depend the specific characteristic each service fintech service have been categorised follows banking payment transfer and forex digital currency wealth and asset management pfm insurtech and enabling technology and infrastructure there clear classification the fintech sector the blurred definition the fintech concept make difficult quantify the size the current and potential market fintech can play relevant role improving financial inclusion providing more accessible and affordable financial service current user also expect receive better and more efficient financial service with the benefit digitisation there underlying tension between improving accessibility and usability financial service through technology and assuring consumer trust which essential for the functioning and stability the financial system the the most relevant player among fintech service provider followed the within the the far the largest contributor fintech accounting for all company china and india are also becoming relevant actor mature and developed market fintech company tend smaller and more focused providing added value existing financial service mature financial market such china and india fintech startup average receive much higher level financing and often become listed company suggesting that these firm are filling the existing gap becoming relevant provider financial service themselves there strong geographic endogamy acquisition fintech service suggesting that specificity the market regulation availably service and consumer profile make difficult for fintech company provide their service global scale the european financial context fintech service offer significant potential benefit european consumer such cost reduction efficiency improvement better adaptation customer preference greater transparency and contribution the goal financial inclusion fintech european parliament competition issue the area financial technology fintech service also provide crossborder financial service between member state and extend financing and investment alternative european business and household furthermore fintech service may also contribute the achievement some the most relevant european union objective such the digital single market the action plan for consumer financial service and the capital market union these service also provide innovation the market bringing about the application new business model and technology financial service fintech disruptive and innovative service fintech adoption provides major impact the financial industry lowering barrier entry eliminating physical branch and large organisational structure disintermediating the current value chain introducing new business model based platform and sharing economy and providing more efficient provision service for decade the financial industry massively used information and communication technology ict all internal process backend more recently with the emergence the internet ict have enabled bank offer online service their customer both from fixed and mobile device january european adult used internet banking doubling since when only with substantial difference across age country and education level fintech come revolutionise the way which traditional financial service provider work and interact with their customer changing the dominant paradigm with which traditional financial service are provided resulting real disruption term applicable business model and potentially growing market share this the case for example loan where asset loan are traditionally financed the bank balance sheet through their own capital and liability deposit and wholesale financing the new scenario consists the disintermediation these activity mean peertopeer lending platform which the asset and liability disappear from the balance sheet the new fintech company and their work becomes the intermediation between lender investing every individual loan borrowed they use very novel credit scoring technique based big data social crowdscoring the appearance this new type intermediation been accompanied some country the regulation alternative financing allowing the emergence new fintech lending company more recently with the entry into force the new payment service directive psd fintech service provider will able start developing new hitherto unknown model based the online platform business model fintech provider enable the european commission european commission eurostat eurostat internet banking particularly popular among year old with using this facility the use internet banking tends increase line with the education level the user while only those with low education use ebanking those with high education use this service among member state internet banking most common denmark where people aged said they were using and the netherlands followed the other nordic country finland and sweden the lowest share were registered bulgaria and romania than those between the age and use internet banking greece and cyprus crowdfundinghub european commission european commission payment service psd directive httpseceuropaeuinfolawpaymentservicespsddirectiveeuen policy department economic and scientific policy disintermediation banking activity with respect their client offering financial product without being bank providing standard banking service linking their platform their customer bank account such the origination payment transfer likewise thanks psd fintech company operating under the concept pfm aggregator can act the financial portal for their client adding and processing customer banking data that they can offer thirdparty financial product company can this mean accessing the information and data contained each client bank account this way the financial asset and liability the client their loan and deposit will remain within financial institution and client will have need accede these institution because they will always interact with them through their fintech service provider such pfms this sense pfm act trusted and independent manager client finance without being part any bank having any commercial dependence them this end fintech provider must negotiate their application programming interface apis with customer bank and determine the price for use along with establishing appropriate cybersecurity measure another significant segment financial business being disrupted fintech the financial advice investment provide customer through tool known roboadvisors these roboadvisors supply investment advice particular the activity asset allocation portfolio selection asset investment fund and the execution and liquidation order all automated and online way substituting the staff the traditional entity the client would normally refer the roboadvisors employ sophisticated algorithm even with for these task order offer real time solution other innovation with relevant impact the financial sector are the new cryptocurrencies like bitcoin which are digital currency that operate decentralised way mean technology like blockchain and without participation supervision any central bank institution these cryptocurrencies offer technological and operational paradigm that are source disruption for the entire sector including monetary policy and financial stability all these disruptive and innovative application utilise new and emerging technology among which those stand out are cloud computing biometrics digital identity blockchain cybersecurity regtech internet thing iot augmented reality etc these technology are being developed used the financial sector three type stakeholder newcomer the sector that are mainly startup offering service product that have both financial and technological background traditional financial service provider incumbent such bank insurer broker and technological company that develop tool service and product for the financial sector that enable the provision fintech service allow the company provide these service themselves this environment new agent particularly tech startup are generally able offer financial service for lower cost and higher efficiency than the incumbent due the lack legacy infrastructure organisation and the ability better take advantage innovation also generally understood that they can offer better user experience which pose significant challenge other agent especially traditional financial service provider the traditional financial sector restructuring itself after the financial crisis the financial sector face two simultaneous change predominantly from the point view incumbent the change provoked the financial crisis and consequence competition issue the area financial technology fintech restructuring business and balance sheet well the new regulation oriented prevent future crisis and limit their effect the whole economy and the need adapt business model the fintech revolution through digital transformation the traditional business model these change have resulted relevant challenge for stakeholder particularly incumbent for instance the european central bank ecb point out the challenge faced european bank are low profitability the impact digitalisation low interest rate dealing with overcapacity and fragmentation cleaning their nonperforming loan stronger regulation and the brexit process oliver wyman also identifies the agenda for european bank consisting the following key action responding changing buying behaviour related digital opportunity upgrading legacy system and process financial resource efficiency consolidation opportunity building workforce skill and offering solution social challenge the banking sector still restructuring itself after the financial crisis the european banking federation ebf report that the number credit institution the consistently fallen for the past eight year row and last year the number bank decreased bank from total decline germany home more than all the bank the concentration could increase the efficiency and scale european bank this open new opportunity new entrant not affected the same rule incumbent still nowadays the banking sector seems too large for new fintech company capture just small fraction banking business managing huge financial asset for all the participating member any economy the ebf report the end the total amount deposit liability held bank amounted eur trillion which drop from the previous year moreover the total value outstanding loan from bank amounted eur trillion increase increasing bank adoption fintech and digital transformation open innovation ecosystem the ebf point out there wide and enthusiastic adoption the online and mobile banking and payment service among customer this trend reduced the importance widespread physical bank branch network according ebf during the country european credit institution continued experience contraction their main infrastructure and human resource which trend the previous year reduction their branch compared and reduction their workforce compared all incumbent have now embarked digital transformation process the following priority are often cited regarding engagement this digital transformation process adopting new information technology architecture and technology biometric cloud big data offering excellent customer experience increasing digital sale developing new business model stimulating more innovative workforce and working lautenschl ger oliver wyman european banking federation european banking federation the decline leaded the netherlands germany austria ireland italy hungary france and spain european banking federation european banking federation policy department economic and scientific policy agile organisation taking cybersecurity the highest executive level taking advantage the psd challenge and either collaborating with taking over the fintech startup part their strategic initiative many european incumbent bank are developing fintech ecosystem under the paradigm open innovation which combine technology customer and regulatory compliance around innovation and business model this paradigm involves bank meeting with startup and learning from them about their technology business model methodology and culture this open innovation ecosystem the startup and the bank agree develop test and trial all with the required regulatory compliance using the bank data and client proof concept determine the future the financial industry other incumbent have venture capital instrument invest fintech startup besides other direct participation the capital new fintech firm also big tech company are investing fintech and greater amount since they not face the same risk compliance issue traditional financial provider challenger bank and neobanks banking service the fintech innovation also manifest with the rise the socalled challenger bank and neobanks which are becoming global movement according the consultancy kpmg challenger bank can established firm most likely midsize specialist that seek compete with larger institution neobanks tend newer completely digital mobile but there some overlap both innovative type bank have common ground they both use new technology platform without carrying inefficient and oldfashioned legacy system cumbersome organisational structure and large branch base challenger bank are popping worldwide and they constitute potential opportunity for faster increase the provision crossborder banking service across europe they can also tool for financial inclusion they not require deploying physical branch and are hampered regulation due the fact that they not provide full range financial service kpmg report besides the phenomenon with atom bank monzo and starling bank there are more than challenger bank everywhere germany fidor bank solaris bank and are the known challenger bank case spain there are challenger bank backed incumbent bank like openbank from santander bank and imaginbank from caixabank big tech company asia have launched their challenger bank like china mybank from alibaba group and webank backed tencent fintech service competition issue affecting the provision fintech service depend the specific characteristic each service therefore the first step analysing competition issue categorise the fintech service the existing literature this topic proposes several categorisation however given the rapid evolution fintech service there consensus standard classification caplain some the best challenger bank and neobanks are arising the attracting big capital investment either coming from venture capital like goodwater capital incumbent bank bbva according crunchbase since their respective launching date atom bank raised gbp million monzo pulled total gbp million and starling bank obtained usd million competition issue the

between the available figure highlight the difficulty aggregating relevant data fintech service and reiterates the difficulty defining the market and delimiting the service which refers dorfleitner hornuf schmitt weber dbk competition issue the area financial technology fintech the consultancy estimate that the average fintech adoption rate there consensus that china and india are the country with the highest share user with over half their connected population using fintech service china and india have large tech savvy but financially underserved population those country other emerging region fintech service are granting access financial service million people who would otherwise excluded the case china different factor favour the explosion fintech service very high rate internet and mobile penetration massive adoption ecommerce and closed and protected domestic market and economy have been the breeding ground for the development fintech the first target digital financial service were smes and individual underserved traditional financial provider followed growing middle class with need regarding wealth and management investment private banking and insurance chinese big tech such alibaba and tencent are also taking advantage great network effect these technological provider have access big data from customer mainly from ecommerce and social medium service which are used personalise fintech service and improve efficiency additionally expected that the chinese social credit system national reputation system providing rating for every business and citizen will place opening new opportunity for fintech india two important government initiative have boosted the development digital financial service one initiative called aadhaar launched allowed the indian adult population identified digital mean using biometric technology the second initiative the demonetisation policy put into place pulled out the and indian rupee inr bank note and gave decisive stimulus digital transaction europe the and spain are the country with the highest adoption rate fintech with and respectively germany with the third european country above the global average france and the netherlands have adoption rate ireland and belgium and luxemburg these estimation include fintech service from both new entrant nontraditional financial firm and traditional financial firm payment and transfer are globally the fintech service with the highest penetration among user followed insurance saving and investment financial planning and borrowing general digital disruption seems have affected corporate banking lesser extent compared retail banking the time and effort required change financial service provider for business seems one the reason fintech provider also tend solve issue specific the corporate banking business and therefore present themselves more potential collaborator driver for innovation than real threat understood adoption rate refers the average percentage digitally active consumer using fintech service data refers market analysed including australia canada hong kong singapore the the ireland belgium and luxembourg brazil china france germany india japan mexico the netherlands south africa south korea spain and switzerland according data from india and china had adoption rate and respectively capgemini quantifies the percentage customer using financial service the year from nontraditional firm above both case mittal lloyd grealish policy department economic and scientific policy alternative provider this also the case for insurance where insurtech service provider are mainly focused the step the value chain closer the user such sale and distribution but have not yet clearly threatened the risk carrier business however the lack clear definition what fintech service exactly are raise doubt about the real penetration these service estimate made consultant such capgemini use very general concept related digital service the widespread use digital technology all area professional and personal sphere undoubtedly been key driver for the adoption fintech which user are basically looking for two thing easier access financial service some country even just access and better user experience fintech considered have enormous potential improving financial inclusion fintech service have the capacity provide more accessible and affordable financial service larger mass the population and smes especially credit and payment for instance many country where large rural population have traditionally been underserved incumbent these population can now covered digitaloriented provider poor access more traditional financial service fact one the reason explaining the boost fintech service china and india figure show the percentage people above year old holding account financial institution selected country and the this indicator also includes those having mobile account figure percentage people who have account bank

finland portugal the country with the highest penetration atm followed the united kingdom croatia germany austria and spain contrast finland sweden lithuania the netherlands and the czech republic are the country with the lowest atm penetration the regarding the number commercial bank branch the ratio high luxemburg spain and bulgaria followed italy and portugal these country along with malta france cyprus and croatia are above the average unit per however shown the graph most country are around below the average data not available for finland and belgium have the lowest penetration commercial bank branch besides financial inclusion surprise that improving user experience the heart fintech service conception current user increasingly expect receive better and more efficient financial service result the benefit digitisation fact european expressed their willingness switch their financial service provider did not offer advanced technology service product result the traditional loyalty that characterised financial service provider been affected the penetration fintech service fujitsu policy department economic and scientific policy the special eurobarometer financial product and service for the year showed that the previous five year only european had changed financial provider with car insurance and bank account being the product have most likely changed the main reason for not changing are satisfaction with the current provider not having considered changing the hassle changing and the limited potential benefit changing not surprising that younger and more techsavvy user are more willing use fintech service according the consultancy capgemini younger user are time more likely use fintech service than older user and techsavvy user are twice likely nontech savvy user make use these service however unlike what happens with other digitalised service digital skill and access technology are not the only major factor influencing the penetration fintech service trust key element all financial service and the same fintech user still trust traditional firm more than newcomer which are only trusted one out four user traditional firm are perceived providing higher security quality service and transparency while nontraditional company are seen offering better value for money and better efficiency this reflects the underlying strain within fintech service between improving the accessibility and usability financial service through technology and securing consumer trust which essential for the functioning and stability the financial system the european fintech provider have analysed european fintech provider and compared them with provider from other relevant region with the goal assessing whether the market supply composition and structure may suggest the existence potential competition concern the analysis made using the crunchbase data base which provides information about the world most innovative company analyse the industry structure acquisition and investment specific sector described annex the first challenge this analysis delineate the fintech ecosystem itself the crunchbase database provides total company worldwide that are labelled fintech company after conducting careful assessment those company the data showed that company although defined themselves fintech not clearly engage activity

negligible the competition issue the area financial technology fintech figure percentage money raised regioncountries funding stage within the note description the funding stage used can found annex source compiled iclaves based crunchbase better understanding the expected evolution fintech supplier region can obtained analysing whether new fintech company are acquired third party whether these company public market dynamic characterised acquisition suggest that incumbent are incorporating new product service developed startup into their portfolio while market more characterised company going public suggest that new entrant are consolidating financial service provider themselves the and the the percentage fintech company that have been acquired much higher than other market shown figure contrast china and india the percentage company that end listed the stock exchange much higher can seen figure this trend very relevant from competition perspective suggests that market exit the startup fintech company the mainly happens through acquisition also mean that other company from different sector enter the fintech market via acquisition which lead the need for qualified merger control company europe are likely acquired larger firm complement their current offering china however show very low percentage firm acquired and instead the largest percentage initial public offering ipo company this suggests that significant number fintech company china are likely grow and become relevant stakeholder the financial sector themselves policy department economic and scientific policy figure percentage company acquisition status within the regioncountries source compiled iclaves based crunchbase figure percentage ipo company within the regioncountries source compiled iclaves based crunchbase competition issue the area financial technology fintech have also analysed the relationship between the acquiring company and the acquired company the first conclusion that there strong geographical endogamy european company are acquired european company and company are mainly acquired company shown figure and figure respectively the number asian company being acquired very low seen figure this endogamy suggests that the specificity the market diverse regulatory approach level and quality the service available and consumer profilespreferences make difficult for fintech company provide their service outside their local market globalisation the fintech market happening rather low scale another insight that market concentration doe not seem taking place usually the acquiring company only acquire one fintech company there are only few case the company acquiring more than one fintech company figure network graph acquisition note europe the category acquired company refers

acquired fintech company financial company mainly acquire fintech company providing banking pfm wealth management payment insurance and enabling service fintech company mainly acquire enabler company followed payment and wealth management provider technology firm end acquiring enabler company and payment service provider the result can seen figure worldwide and figure this finding suggests that the level crossservices between the technology and financial sector still low company the financial sector acquire mainly fintech company providing financial service while technologyrelated company tend acquire fintech company that offer enabling technology the only exception fintech company payment transfer and forex service for which technology company seems more interested figure webplot acquired company service category and sector the acquiring company worldwide source compiled iclaves based crunchbase policy department economic and scientific policy figure webplot acquired company

they are intended promote financial inclusion while mature market they focus improving user experience fostering better and more efficient innovative financial service taking advantage the benefit digitisation the supplier behave accordingly underserved market bigger company are likely arise with the goal becoming relevant new player contrast more mature market startup fintech company are likely complement the existing offering many case through acquisition process after analysing the market and the supply structure have not seen any clear symptom competition problem however fintech service are still their inception stage and the medium and long term the situation might change what clear particularly the more developed region like the that there underlying tension between improving the accessibility and usability financial service through technology and assuring consumer trust which can not easily achieved technology this tension echo the balance between maximising efficiency and promoting innovation the one hand and guaranteeing system stability and consumer protection the other shown figure this balance usually sought mean prudential regulation particularly banking service such lending bank for international settlement competition issue the area financial technology fintech figure the underlying tension fintech service accessibility trust financial inclusion improved user experience innovation securitystability system trust source iclaves summarise the previous analysis fintech service can seen financial activity which provide added value mean digital technology shown section fintech service can offered different type company seems more appropriate talk about service rather than fintech company what generally called fintech company actually company that provides exclusively fintech service the minimum criterion define fintech service are the following technologydriven financial service which provides new solution new business model alternative what already exists the financial sector and offer significant added value any the stakeholder involved the value chain mainly the consumer for the purpose the following analysis consider the following classification different fintech service banking payment transfer and forex digital currency wealth asset management personal finance management insurance and enabling technology and infrastructure the classification been already defined section described detail annex policy department economic and scientific policy competition issue the fintech sector key finding fintech service are constantly evolving and the application competition instrument analyse potential anticompetitive behaviour face several challenge analysis the dynamic within the new webbased business model the best way ass traditional competition concept such market definition and market dominance competition challenge caused fintech can characterised according multidimensional approach from supplyside perspective there are two technologyrelated reason that can explain competition challenge provision service through online platform and the intensive use data from the demandside perspective competition challenge depend iii the access and operation the technology the user and the user perception and behaviour result the combination platform technology and the access and operation user interoperability and can standardisation user perception and behaviour help identify challenge such the definition relevant market and the role network effect source market power competition concern related the intensive use data and technology related technology such algorithm and may lead interoperability concern exclusion user price discrimination practice tying and bundling and even tacit collusion fintech service are characterised the confluence startup large financial institution and large tech company relevant competitor the diversity origin approach and potential source competitive advantage mean that the state the different market flux this context difficult identify advantage and source power that are durable throughout time competitionrelated pattern should carefully analysed before considering them anticompetitive behaviour have seen the previous chapter the provision fintech service constantly evolving blurring the boundary established the traditional financial sector such scenario which present commonality with other market the digital economy the application competition instrument analyse potential anticompetitive behaviour face several challenge the most relevant being the difficulty applying traditional competition law instrument ass competition issue this rather new and innovative market segment describing the relevant market defining the market power for type service and analysing anticompetitive behaviour and their root cause have already seen the difficulty clearly defining fintech service and therefore describing the relevant fintech market for instance the european commission itself left the mobile payment market definition open several competition decision moreover the assessment market power can not solely rely commission decision the merger case and for involved company please see the list commission decision the list reference the end this study competition issue the area financial technology fintech traditional indicator such market share price profit margin these indicator fail explain the economic relationship between supply and demand the provision fintech service given that some these service are offered zero price are provided through multisided platform with several stakeholder intertwined response these challenge study commissioned the european parliament proposed new way better ass the market definition and dominance service the digital economy well potential anticompetitive behaviour the study suggests starting with analysing the new webbased business model allows better account for interdependency between multiple platform and the interaction between firm conduct and market boundary the study also proposes adopting cautious approach when assessing competition issue given the blurred boundary digital market and relying sectorial regulation competition instrument and even the selfregulation digital agent this combined approach been followed order ass the competition issue the diverse category service within the fintech ecosystem they are all part the digital economy although each category service present different feature that can lead concrete competition issue they also share common characteristic from both the supply and demandside perspective therefore prior the specific description each category service the common feature and their potential impact competition analysed the following discussion potential competition concern both those common all service category and those identified for specific one should deemed hypothetical analysis given that most those competition concern have not occurred have not been detected competition authority far depending how the diverse market within the fintech ecosystem evolve however these concern could become real competition issue the midterm stakeholder competition authority politician regulator should aware their implication the supply demand fintech explanatory matrix the rationale the explanatory matrix the market description chapter illustrates the extremely broad landscape user operator service and strategy well the sector state flux missing stable market any analysis competition bound tentative since competition challenge could unfold different direction depending what turn out the decisive factor that provides competitive advantage the technology side the user side this make systematisation effort necessary for least two important reason first having overall classification competition challenge necessary order place each them proper context thus one them becomes cause concern would easier understand reason the instrument that could employed for correcting and the side effect that the use those instrument could have other competition challenge second this study easily recognisable category market activity the different category fintech service provided and competition problem organise european parliament european parliament however shown above the area payment service there have already been couple decision the european commission merger case for further analysis see section below policy department economic and scientific policy the analysis this enhances clarity and offer more robust structure field characterised fluidity bearing mind the advantage respecting more commonly accepted structure term the category activity and competition problem the study identifies common pattern that emerge across different category activity some factor cut across service and make more challenging classify them activity competition problem other word using servicebyservice approach make the explanation more accessible and highlight the problem that may particularly acute specific field payment this should not however hide the fact that there are strong commonality fintech competition challenge that beyond particular service operator considering this classification that try offer general and comprehensive view fintech broader competition concern need take two step first need use category that beyond specific service second need illustrate fintech unique feature the extent that they are not fully captured financial service classical category this will make possible not only understand the competition challenge that are present the service they stand today but also anticipate the challenge that may arise the future accomplish the goal explaining fintech competition challenge the following explanatory matrix proposed the matrix classifies fintech competition challenge pursuant two perspective the industry side supplyside which based the type technology that characterises the service and the demandside which primarily focus the perspective the user when approaching the technology and the service rendered the matrix also show the category problem that fall outside the scope competition policy the grey box outside the table and need addressed other policy tool but are still related competition figure the supplydemand

demandside user the idea the matrix focus element that help explain fintech existing potential competition challenge regardless the specific type service activity these element are related the feature the technology used provide the service supplyside and the user interaction with the technology and the service demandside the specific feature both perspective supplyside technology and demandside user and their implication competition issue will addressed more detail chapter from supplyside perspective there are two technologyrelated category that help explain competition challenge fintech the first platform technology this encompasses the service that are provided through online platform technology that put party contact with other party with matching need requirement platform create unique dynamic the way the service defined involving three side the two party that are matched and the platform operator these dynamic also affect the way market power achieved and maintained the second supplyside category data the intensive use datadriven technology for rendering financial service tends raise common group competition challenge this stem from the fact that data source competitive advantage and one that difficult match measure replicate substitute this help understand the importance issue such access data the impact algorithm classifying user from demandside perspective important differentiate two category the first one refers the access and operation the technology this perspective focus the technology accessibility and compatibility with other technology feature and standardisation well functioning how sort out user and devise specific price and condition sale the second demandside category user perception and behaviour focus how the user view the technology mean deliver service how they perceive the service itself and the pattern service usage these two dimension supplyside and demandside provide more general and stable classification fintech competition challenge which not dependent category traditional financial service traditional competition problem this classification help identify the source competition challenge and also help distinguish those challenge that fall completely partially outside the realm competition policy preliminary list common competition challenge based the matrix explanatory category starting the upperleft corner the matrix looking platform technology supplyside from the perspective access and operation demandside one can identify the issue interoperability challenge competition this problem arises when the lack interoperability between two technology used incumbent artificial barrier entry for newcomer the same combination help explain the opposite problem when the standardisation required facilitate interoperability becomes source noncompetitive behaviour because firm lack the incentive innovate and differentiate moving the upperright corner the matrix looking platform technology using the perspective user perception and behaviour help identifying challenge such the definition the relevant market well the role network effect source market power the problem the relevant market whether certain service must considered substitute partly determined the presence platform technology but differs from case case depending how user perceive and use the platform this policy department economic and scientific policy turn result certain pattern use and intensity use which help understand whether network effect the specific case are strong also can give rise durable market power and unassailable competitive position focus the use dataintensive technology supplyside and consider them from the perspective the access the technology and operation demandside bottomleft corner the matrix the same problem interoperability can arise this time combined with the issue portability data the impact datadriven technology being able sort out user also relevant concern although the use datadriven technology help gain predictive accuracy the risk use carry out unfair exclusion user price discrimination moving the bottomright part the matrix the clearest challenge the role access and processing data source market power which can give rise unassailable competitive position this relevant detect unlawful collusion abuse concentration datadriven industry this general concern important assessing other challenge such the relevance crossusage datasets the way which large operator with competitive advantage one activity big tech company can use privileged access data obtained that activity leverage position the provision other service such fintech service the same reasoning applies the case practice such tying and bundling industry where there are established player with market power another challenge lie the risk exclusionary conduct towards competitor refusing access customer data for example exploiting user need consent when access open however another challenge lie the role algorithm especially technology promoting tacit collusion the matrix allows for second type distinction between the challenge that can addressed with competition law instrument and those that are excluded from scope the grey box outside the matrix for example access technology can conditioned barrier entry arising not from action incumbent but from regulatory requirement licensing and prudential rule they are too stringent not harmonised conduct consisting exclusion unfair treatment user may issue for consumer protection likewise from perspective user perception and behaviour the user awareness the service they are subscribing and thus the determination the relevant market interchangeable service can depend the transparency with which those service are marketed this turn may determined disclosure requirement which form part investor protection rule security market finally how certain technology are allowed use the user data not depend competition rule but data protection rule all those case aspect with critical impact the sector competitive structure and competition issue fall outside the control competition authority while they fall outside the matrix visualise them related factor order stress the need for holistic approach where competition policy and tool are not seen used isolation assessing competition challenge this environment daunting task not only because competition policy tool sit the crossroad complex policy environment but also due the current state the market fintech service unlike other field where market are wellestablished and the relevant player and their feature are wellknown fintech service are characterised the confluence startup large financial see section competition issue the area financial technology fintech institution and large tech company relevant competitor the diversity origin approach and potential source competitive advantage mean that the state the different market flux this mean that firm may swiftly change their portfolio service depending the activity that they consider similar and susceptible offering synergy which again may depend the type company the same time user are relatively new and slowly getting used the different offer for these type service this mean that their perception which offer are comparable and which service are substitute constant change this context difficult identify advantage and source market power that are durable throughout time even talk about incumbent the case strategy being constant change and market power being contestable and contested the default option should caution the following section describe the business model set out for each service category and the concrete competition issue that might arise between the stakeholder involved banking business model replication offline model deposit service and innovation lending service the business model for the provision fintech service related deposit tend replicate those used offline while adding some improved feature fintech bank usually operate aggregator financial service which can provided itself thirdparties through apis trying improve customer experience increasing interaction transparency usability and even fun they seek empower customer giving more information and involving them the decisionmaking process related their financial choice order adopt customercentric approach access customer data becomes essential the main business model relies the maturity transformation traditional key function bank wherein they borrow shortterm and lend longterm earning the difference between long and shortterm rate the most innovative business model within the banking category are related lending service almost all them exploit two key concept the digital economy multisided platform and crowdsourcing they are known lending marketplace lending see section drechsler savov schnabl policy department economic and scientific policy figure marketplace lending model scheme lending platformborrowers individual company provision fundsrepaymentlenders individualsinstitutions client account source bank for international settlement the process start when borrower either individual company mostly smes applies for loan the platform the platform ass the credit risk the borrower based the credit information provided and approves denies the application the application approved published the platform and lender individual investor institutional fund can choose fund the loan when the loan completely funded the fund are transferred the borrower and they begin repay the loan the platform revenue come from interest income and fee charged the transaction party several variation this basic model coexist the market regarding the method used calculate the interest rate the borrower fix the maximum interest rate they are willing pay out the platform set out interest rate based the credit information borrower and lender negotiate the interest rate etc determine how the loan are generated help lender select the loan they want fund among others the platform often provide advice the lender with the aim reducing risk diversifying their investment over several loan another widespread lending model that try respond the regulatory constraint that the previous one face several country the socalled notary model this model the platform only intermediate between borrower and lender while bank generates the loan that the platform allocates the lending platform can also generate the loan and keep them their own balance sheet balance sheet fintech lending model unlike the former model the platform retains credit risk and often requires credit facility securitisations order fund origination there are also hybrid model composite lending that combine the bank for international settlement bank for international settlement department the treasury competition issue the area financial technology fintech scalability and efficiency the marketplace lending model and the stability and viability the balance sheet lending model the equity crowdfunding model provides funding business mostly earlystage company exchange for share the company the equity crowdfunding platform ass the risk borrower and help them look for potential investor the platform charge fee the borrower for using service and the investor for providing detailed information the company who seek funding similar the marketplace lending there are some variation this basic model for instance some equity crowdfunding platform allow investor put down their money and have invested according the criterion the deal team that platform the investor have neither the option select nor the option opt out concrete project other platform the deal team selects several project that are pooled the platform and the investor can choose what project they want fund competition issue the business process regulatory disparity and market power big tech company marketplace lending face several challenge that could hinder the creation competitive market where user both lender and borrower could benefit from the innovative business model described section term efficiency reduced timing lower fee etc from the lender side and financial inclusion from the borrower side the most relevant one the diverse regulatory approach that lending platform must comply with operate different jurisdiction the bank for international settlement state there are internationally agreed financial regulatory standard policy for fintech credit lending some country have decided apply the existing regulatory framework regarding licensing and prudential rule while others have enacted specific regulation for marketplace lending the disparity the national regulatory approach may hamper the creation transnational marketplace lending platform recent study the bank for international settlement recognised that existing fintech company are developing mainly within individual jurisdiction however some service were provided across border relegated disintermediated new bank this could increase the need for coordination and cooperation both between jurisdiction well across sector regulatory disparity between national jurisdiction could also affect competition the fintech lending market they may become barrier entry for new player these new player would need divert investment from innovation order adapt their solution the concrete requirement each national jurisdiction this regulatory barrier competition been addressed the european commission recent fintech action plan regulation marketplace lending platform aim controlling financial risk and protecting consumer both lender and borrower from inappropriate behaviour regulatory burden however can somehow blur the main benefit this model which are efficiency which allows access funding with lower cost provided timelier manner than traditional financial instrument and the digital inclusion those collective that face difficulty when come accessing credit lowincome individual smes etc therefore necessary find the right balance between regulation and bank for international settlement symptom the strong geographical endogamy when acquiring fintech company described section bank for international settlement bank for international settlement european commission policy department economic and scientific policy innovation help foster the development marketplace lending service while protecting consumer right and financial stability the lending service provided digital platform can longer considered pure service given the growing presence institutional investor they may leverage their market power the offline lending service market create their own digital platform sell loan avoiding investing other platform and thus limiting the competition from the technology side the same approach might used the big digital company they might also leverage their market power financialrelated sector such ecommerce enter the marketplace lending service taking advantage the customer data they already have they may for instance develop more accurate credit scoring tool and thus offer loan with lower interest rate and lower fee leading strategy predatory pricing they might also offer rebate buy product the user take out loan from their own digital platform although important cautious defining those behaviour anticompetitive they are two example potential competition issue that could occur the field marketplace lending service none them been noticed far europe payment transfer and forex business model fintech provider are entering the whole payment chain payment service show certain particularity that make them more attractive for fintech provider financial incumbent tend outsource payment and technologyrelated service payment habit have evolved lot recent year and new payment need are emerging recent technological advance are especially suitable for payment service dlts fintechrelated technology allows for the achievement economy scale provide more efficient payment service term price speed and security make easier meet the customer need and improve customer experience when using payment service these service provide customer with different payment method favouring the financial inclusion people with limited access traditional payment service fintech provider are leveraging these driver position themselves relevant actor several stage the payment chain according the bank for international settlement the payment chain can structured five stage pretransaction authorisation clearing settlement and posttransaction the pretransaction stage involves the activity required create the initial infrastructure provide payment service the authorisation stage refers the process and activity that enable payment transaction authorised and approved before can completed the clearing stage includes process reconcile payment order between the final payer and the beneficiary the settlement stage refers the effective money exchange between transaction party posting credit and debit their account finally see for instance the amazon lending business strategy httpsmarketrealistcomacloselookatamazonslendingbusiness the low interest rate amazon can offer merchant and shopper thanks the knowledge that amazon about them might prevent other lending platform can compete the sme lending market bank for international settlement bank for international settlement bank for international settlement

international settlement the business model implemented within the payment landscape depend the stage they are focused the type customer they are aimed and the type collaboration that exists with the bank taking into consideration these three criterion the bank for international settlement classifies the payment service provider into four category which can assimilated into the main business model frontend provider they usually focus their activity the pretransaction authorisation and posttransaction stage acting intermediary between user payment system both payer and payee and traditional provider clearing and settlement service they can establish direct access the clearing and settlement network they can gain access through intermediary bank payment initiation service provider pisp

defining payment market and the access critical asset payment service compose the fintech category that competition authority are paying most attention recent year some competition case have been analysed the european competition authority the case have referred merger acquisition and mostly joint venture between incumbent andor technology company provide new payment tool ewallets mobile payment competition authority have cleared all the case far recognising there are sufficient alternative issuer payment service the national market where the new service intend operate the analysis the european commission decision competition case related payment service mostly mobile payment system and digital wallet highlight the difficulty applying traditional competition tool the first step begin analysing anticompetitive behaviour the product market definition highly complex task due continuously evolving landscape where boundary between service are blurring recent decision summarised this issue the mcommerce decision the european commission considered that online and offline mobile payment were not likely part the same relevant product market while the commission concluded that the situation see commission decision reference the analysis the fintech provider section have found that the fintech company providing financial service that have been acquired technology company are mainly those related payment commission decision case biteteletelia lietuvajv policy department economic and scientific policy could evolve the short medium term ultimately left the product market definition open with regard the substitutability remoteonline mobile payment and other type remoteonline payment the commission concluded that they may belong different product market but ultimately also left the product market definition open that respect the commission reached similar conclusion relation the mobile proximityoffline payment and existing proximityoffline payment solution merely defining the product market within the field payment service challenge the subsequent assessment the market share order identify dominant position even more difficult another relevant issue for competition the provision payment service the access critical asset such data and mobile nfc chip access customer data essential when payment service provider process transaction between payer and payee all the stage involved the provision the service require information from both side blocking hampering access customer data can prevent the provision these service new entrant thus limiting competition this issue been addressed the through the psd directive obliging incumbent open access customer data and allow thirdparties initiate and manage payment behalf such customer although there been controversy between the involved stakeholder incumbent and fintech startup regarding the regulatory technical standard rts defined the european banking authority eba strong customer authentication see box the psd directive represents relevant step enhancing competition the provision payment service box the impact competition the process drafting the regulatory technical standard rts strong customer authentication under the article the psd directive entrusted the eba with the task developing the rts strong customer authentication and common and secure communication according the requirement laid down article the eba published the draft rts february according the manifesto signed european fintech company and association the rts banned secure proven technology such direct

with blurred boundary which hinder the assessment market share pricing policy etc competition issue the area financial technology fintech assessment competition challenge and the use competition instrument key finding multisided market such fintech platform imply that the definition the relevant market can not undertaken following traditional model built the premise pipeline business where value generated the supplier product service fintech platform are not regulated financial trading platform and therefore the challenge arising from network effect need assessed competition challenge network effect enable large platform insulated from competition from smaller platform with fewer participant and can create barrier entry yet network effect are not indicative per the existence competition problem that need addressed active pursuit noninteroperability the provision fintech service can act deterrent with anticompetitive effect access the market difficult costly can even cause

bidimensional classification platformbased technology platformbased technology have specific feature that have attracted the attention the european commission from the perspective competition policy but also consumer policy and other field and they have also been explored national competition authority general platform are twosided multisided market where platform operator brings user together facilitate interaction such exchange information commercial transaction some distinguish between marketmakers which bring together two distinct group that are interested trading audience maker which match advertiser audience and demand coordinator which coordinate the necessary infrastructure for the system clear payment platform fintech service are linked with the access information comparison website and commercial transaction the case crowdfunding crowdlending the latter also generally fit within the category marketmakers whilst the former belong that audiencemakers some operator payment service could characterised demand coordinator although strictly speaking they not coordinate demand themselves but rather clearing unlike more linear business model platform one group user delivers value another group and vice versa doing they create value for the platform itself this fluidity interaction and the need adopt multisided perspective mean that platform can pose unique competition challenge due multisided character the relevant market can not defined following traditional model built the premise pipeline business where value generated the supplier product service this cause

problem that are characteristic dataintensive technology with problem involving the technology typically platform technology used gather the data from user perspective the field data technology the

anticompetitive conduct for example the conclusion exclusive contract tying and bundling service the incumbent control over particularly valuable dataset create network contract that forecloses competition leverage position and impose the use other service these consideration raise two other source concern from opposite angle one the risk that incumbent could manipulate user behaviour not make data available competitor and the other exclusionary conduct incumbent can exploit the need user consent restrict competitor access customer data the case payment service bank are obliged recent rule facilitate access customer data psps including fintech company described section the practice screenscrapping however prohibited see box psps can not access data from the customer payment account beyond those explicitly authorised the customer this mean that bank may confront their customer with the possibility choose consent access their data unfavourable term that customer refuse and competitor are excluded another way create lockin user preventing competitor access data may put obstacle data portability that user are incapable migrating their profile from one service provider different one incumbent would have incentive present obstacle data portability necessary part the service ensure quality and security and user could persuaded the need for more intensive use order receive better service this turn may make the system more closed important stress that competition rule themselves may insufficient ensure that incumbent are not insulated from competition under competition rule refusal access only constitutes anticompetitive conduct case essential facility indispensable product service these concept are quite restrictive and may not apply datasets for

interdependency between operator the aforementioned challenge are identifiable problem related user behaviour and the data resulting from yet these are intimately related with the challenge identifiable from perspective the user access and operation the technology since data source market power incumbent have incentive make difficult for others introducing obstacle access and use the

identify the instance where there may overlap between competition tool and other tool and thus might have solved other instrument which lie beyond the scope competition policy beginning with the top right corner fintech service based platform technology supplyside the challenge defining the relevant market and network effect are largely determined the demandside factor user perception about the substitutability between different service and user behaviour intensity use singlehome multihome use such factor can addressed through competition policy tool but also noncompetition policy tool user perception certain service can depend the transparency the provider which turn depends the disclosure duty applicable service provider likewise these duty can influence user behaviour more complex disclosure protocol can foster intensity use and singlehoming however these are investor protection provision which impose certain duty financial intermediary such mifid comparable regulation moving the top left corner the matrix and thus still within the field platform technology user access and operation the technology depend entry cost yet major part entry cost related regulatory requirement they impose burden operator conversely their absence creates situation uncertainty and unpredictability rule payment service for example stipulate licensing process but provide certain safeguard that must respected and which customer can take for granted when accessing the service mandatory rule can also require the compatibility and interoperability between different type service like financial market rule impose the interoperability trading clearing and settlement service all these element however are part licensing and regulatory requirement and not belong the field competition law

clearly the authority radar shown the recurring presence payment operator competition case fintech payment service technology are platformbased and databased and such exhibit the kind challenge expected from each them furthermore due their greater frequency use payment service are more prone intensive singlehome model and are large source data for behavioural pattern that can used the payment service provider lever position firm with established position the market for payment service have greater incentive lockin customer and use payment service the entry point offer other service tailored customer need this influence the type competition challenge that can already observed those that may still incipient and those that may expected the nottoodistant future the first type issue considered from the perspective user perception and behaviour market definition addition this another relevant challenge the dynamic market power being both platformbased and databased there are different channel which operator can acquire enhance market power one further fostering intensive singlehome use pattern the other even more evident channel using customer data lever the competitor position including the crossusage datasets offer other service through tying and bundling this could the case for large technology company and large financial company this risk seems greater the case large tech company whose advanced data technology look suited entrench their position payment service large tech company face important competitive pressure from large financial company but once they

interesting interplay between regulatory and competition rule regarding data access the key policy that act countervailing weight the need promote competition are the need promote security and protect

subject degree concentration similar the mining market this requires careful monitoring development such vertical horizontal integration process well exclusionary conduct towards other cryptocurrencies their player wealth and asset management study the field wealth and asset management service show that the potentially troublesome issue from competition perspective concern the fee policy different service provider which seem adamantly high the blurring the boundary between different type service information advisory management and the implication the use algorithm the explanatory matrix these are issue primarily related the interaction between dataintensive technology and the user perception and behaviour from the normative perspective the decision tree however the main difficulty lie the initial question whether and what extent these are competition issue which might not should not addressed via regulatory tool the first example the high fee charged advisory service closely related the user lack awareness fee structure and mechanism and their inability compare which consequence the lack transparency the field lack transparency and conflict interest fee structure however hardly new issue created fintech pure competition issue the subject some the more important modification the regime applicable financial intermediary resulting from mifid which considered the reception fee commission one the key element determining whether investment advice can considered independent the second example the blurring the line between information advisory and

they are contracting and the risk involved the issue that look more promising from competition policy perspective the impact algorithm which from descriptive perspective result from the dataintensive nature the technology and cut across user perspective perception and behaviour and the operation the technology the effect the use algorithm the provision fintech wealth management service are mixed the one hand there are procompetitive effect such increased transparency both price and quality variable well more efficient development product and service the other hand there are risk that can arise such the potential role algorithm facilitating factor for coordination and collusion algorithmic collusion these effect were discussed earlier the presence and impact such algorithm still uncertain and need monitored closely albeit algorithm raise genuine competition concern unclear the respective role that competition tool and regulatory tool may have this field the concept market manipulation for example long established one the pillar the regime market abuse which includes inter alia situation where the entity engaged the manipulation seek secure dominant position over the supply demand likely have the effect fixing directly indirectly purchase sale price create other unfair trading condition market abuse rule which are mostly applicable post enforcement setting however are not the only regulatory rule involved mifid introduced specific rule algorithmic trading which try ensure that firm using have proper builtin safeguard and that there are sufficient mechanism place identify order and mitigate disruption thus from both ante prevention and post enforcement perspective would appear that despite the conduct feature european banking authority see european commission european commission see european commission see article seq directive june alternative investment fund manager regulation june money market fund the core the rule the distinction between different type fund which present different type risk most notably constant net asset value cnav fund which are prone run way similar bank and the imposition restriction eligible asset and diversification risk management and other procedure fund that wish marketed with certain designation towards investor thus the rule address what arguably issue financial stability with investor protection measure oecd oecd see section article regulation april market abuse market abuse regulation mar article mar article mifid competition issue the area financial technology fintech placing squarely within the field competition policy financial regulation coopted the field this coopting may justified reason the specialty the market and the expertise the supervisory institution simply pathdependency issue more natural add market manipulation the set rule that regulate insider trading these factor lead conclude that the field wealth and investment management there are number relevant regulatory issue with impact competition that the presence algorithm raise genuine competition concern but that the use competition tool may still unwarranted for reason sector specificity personal finance management the field pfm closely linked some the issue already discussed the field payment fintech firm wishing gain access customer data often provide service personal financial management which why they need access personal data the first place denial access financial incumbent such large bank pose clear competition challenge well the use technology incumbent such large technology company their position psps offer other service the former kind challenge being currently addressed way regulatory initiative while the latter still potential but not imminent threat the extent that the line between pfm and wealth management begin blur the same type concern the role algorithm may arise this case furthermore the presence algorithm this field can also lead phenomenon financial exclusion data technology are used unfair discriminatory manner shutting off certain user from certain service offering them unfair condition the relatively low penetration and intensity use this type service however doe not make the exclusion from them pressing source concern although this could change they become the norm personal financial management furthermore unclear how competition policy tool rather than for instance consumer protection tool may the more appropriate instrument deal with the issue insurance even the type service offered are different from wealth management the use dataintensive technology increase the supplyside similarity which also increase the likelihood that the same type competition issue may arise the insurance sector however been relatively recent latecomer the digital age which why the effect algorithm collusive potentially collusive strategy may come with time lag large insurance company are still slow adopt new technology and large technology firm are not interested entering the field leaving all competitive pressure newcomer that still need build size and reputation given that the position incumbent insurance firm strong the field insurtech service could witness the kind competition challenge observed field such payment which primarily concern interoperability and standardisation new nimbler company may provide equivalent service lower cost large insurance firm have strong incentive create artificial barrier entry thus competition authority should particularly attentive agreement information see section federal trade commission willis tower watson ralph policy department economic and scientific policy exchange that are limited established company agreement standardise technology blockchain standardisation agreement these concern however far away are probable and closer monitoring the sector needed the fact that the impact dataintensive technology the insurance sector still early stage evolution also render speculative any exercise allocate the response the challenge between regulation and competition tool however possible anticipate that the two would need consistent with each other and advance parallel fashion for example the question what blockchain technology the design smart insurance contract would considered legitimate need answer from the perspective competition determine acceptable standardisation technique prudential regulation ass risk and consumer protection the same time competition authority need vigilant about the risk that incumbent firm may use fintech exploit their already existing data trove andor engage exclusionary conduct enabling technology and infrastructure our analysis lead conclude that most market fintech service enabling technology and infrastructure dlts and data analytics well cybersecurity pose competition concern with many provider competing fragmented market the only cause for concern the market advanced cloud service which characterised high entry cost due the need for significant investment and the dominance restricted number big tech company since the portfolio service offered quite fluid and largely commoditised there present concern anticompetitive behaviour important however closely monitor the service offered aid the effort defining the relevant market which far remains the main challenge blockchain network can divided into public blockchains where anybody can join the network the main example bitcoin and private blockchains with restricted access known participant eiopa see section competition issue the area financial technology fintech conclusion the assessment key finding technology important potential disrupt established market and unleash procompetitive force lowering barrier entry therefore the role anticompetitive factor need weighed against the role procompetitive force before making assessment current effort the policy level should primarily focus research and close monitoring market development both descriptive and normative tool are proposed anticipate ass and manage competition issue they occur the response the challenge may lie regulatory measure noncompetition measure follow hybrid approach depending several factor such the type service and the maturity the existing market any financial regulatory reform should take into account competition consideration from the beginning both framework regulatory and competition should work more coordinated effort ensure the healthy evolution the fintech ecosystem general overview and analytical tool the type service that can offered the type player that can compete offer them the way which those service can offered the word that best defines the current state fintech service change new technology strongly affect this make any attempt prognosis tentative best and sends message caution policymakers technology important potential disrupt established market and unleash procompetitive force lowering barrier entry making easier for new player compete which itself positive therefore the role anticompetitive factor need weighed against the role procompetitive force before making assessment current effort the policy level should primarily focus research and close monitoring market development this seems the approach the european commission the eba whose fintech action plan are characterised effort understand explore monitor broker private sector solution instead proposal regulate intervene the study both descriptive explanatory matrix and normative competition policy decision tree analysis ass real potential competition risk the current message caution not obstacle for having adequate tool place gauge the impact market development competition they occur the role regulation the current state the market for fintech service generally too fluid reach firm conclusion the existence competition challenge the special role regulation see section and policy department economic and scientific policy the field financial service sends message caution about the appropriateness competition policy tool the preferred mean address those challenge financial regulation one the primary entry barrier for these service but also the primary source legal certainty all market operator regardless whether they demand more regulation tend ask for more stable legal framework for fintech service which they see one the major competitive challenge while being competition issue can not addressed mean competition tool the conclusion that the initial response these challenge may lie regulatory measure rather than competition measure shared for number different service such bankinglending wealth and asset management and insurance others such service related digital currency pfm are still even earlier stage where the need for regulation being assessed some case the conclusion may mixed this the case for the use algorithm wealth and asset management the use algorithm can give rise genuine competition challenge such collusive behaviour primarily and abuse dominant position potentially case where trading and investment regulated activity financial market even competition concern tend captured financial regulation through the rule market abuse for example the role competition policy some service offer example pure regulatory problem problem that despite their characterisation competition problem can addressed through regulatory noncompetition measure other case show that the opposite may also true that regulatory problem addressed regulatory provision may nonetheless aided through the use competition policy tool this the case payment service which also the field where the action market incumbent are subject more scrutiny the lowering barrier entry facilitating access data been policy decision implemented through regulation such psd which better suited than competition tool stipulate the mean and condition which such access may granted the recent activity competition authority against large financial institution for behaviour suggesting denial access such data however suggests that competition tool may deployed deterrent for firm that use customer consent the interoperability technology block competitor access this type hybridity the tool used address competition problem should not surprise field like payment service thanks the presence platform dynamic payment service offer the clearer field for the crystallisation some the competition concern that have been identified the proposed explanatory tool authority need particularly alert market development which may suggest that large technology company large financial company could using payment service lockin customer and tie and bundle other service while refusing access other competitor the current level competition the fintech ecosystem doe not suggest the need for any urgent change regarding the competition policy tool yet since fintech competition challenge are explained the feature the technology used deliver them platform and dataintensive technology broader perspective those technology could justify such change larger scale not only focused fintech service for instance report the challenge digital market the german commission monopoly proposed change competition legal tool these proposal included monopolkommission competition issue the area financial technology fintech modification the threshold for notification merger control procedure take into account the large purchase price agreed tech company acquisition competitor which may predict future incumbency gain the study also proposes reform procedural rule avoid the use commitment procedure when the subject the investigation commit undertake certain action meet the concern competition authority give closure case whose assessment may vary due change market circumstance the need for such profound change may seem more justified the focus placed service such search engine social network where there stable market with large incumbent and contestability rather than fintech service where the market more fluid competition consideration regulatory policy reform the above analysis strike balance between the opportunity using existing modified competition tool address fintech competition challenge and the need let the industry evolve the state the industry doe not justify own largescale deployment reform competition tool competition authority should vigilant case the market develops some the potential competition threat described this study and they should ready use competition tool even aid goal already enshrined regulatory rule the above also lead one final conclusion the fintech ecosystem show the need for more symbiotic relation between regulatory and competition framework which presently insufficient fintech payment banking wealth and asset management financial advice goal such financial stability and confidence consumer protection data protection need work seamlessly with the protection competition unclear how the current framework ensures the level coordination that would necessary minimise friction the commission fintech action plan generally vague about how competition consideration will incorporated the reform process with only one explicit reference the need ensure that standardisation for interoperability purpose procompetitive effect the eba fintech roadmap more explicit and only refers the need promote equal competition and relationship with technological neutrality would desirable that the plan for future regulatory development could provide clearer vision how competition consideration will incorporated into the process and whether the voice competition authority will somehow present both framework are work seamlessly coordination need present from their inception consistency should sought the solution envisaged for say access data transparency towards customer both regulatory and competition framework were reformed reflect the need more flexible approach where situation can more quickly reassessed considering market development such reform should consistent with each other this respect fintech could used example the greater need incorporate competition approach into financial regulation this present first stage harmonisation prompted the need achieve the single market but the financial crisis hit and financial stability took centre stage competition consideration became present fintech offer fertile ground reopen the dialogue between regulatory and competition goal principle and framework which could help rebalance
