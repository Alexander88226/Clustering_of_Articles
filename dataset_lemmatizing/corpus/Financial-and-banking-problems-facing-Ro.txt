strategic area such agriculture and rural development considered sector with banking risk compared large financial institution that are often slowed down old process and inert culture startup are able promoting more radical innovation fintech gained significant attraction recent year global investment multiplied reaching investment volume over billion looking global spending which estimated billion for including hardware software domestic and external service the advantage obvious loan represent major subsector fintech thus total investment fintech went into consumer lending and business lending corporate credit company include zopa credit club and sofi while company such ondeck marketinvoice lend especially small business addition debt financing online crowdfunding platform such seeder crowdcube ourcrowd link company and investor who want help finance small business newly created business providing form equity also bank transfer service provided bank and broker were the only mean available make money transfer before fintech supplier appeared company like worldremit kantox currencyfair offer international money transfer and currency exchange service that involve advance technology leading faster and cheaper solution mobile payment enable people make mobile personal mobile transaction company such mpesa kenya ecocash zimbabwe are responding the current challenge notably term innovation mobile phone payment this technology aim revolutionize the very concept money itself encounter trading platform where fintech capital market provider have grown popularity for platform like etoro retail investor can provide information and invest directly range recent year the businesstobusiness segment the virtual space received increased attention the year come the potential can significantly increase this segment with new type revenuegenerating activity that still have remains unexploited fintech the potential become important player financing small business appropriate funding access remains one the most important ingredient for the success smes over the past few year growing number business product and model have emerged thus meeting the need small business prefiguring paradigm shift finance for small business that time financial technology provided the nucleus innovation with potential for significant growth access finance for small business while the limit are sometimes fluid five key product for financing small business are highlighted peertopeer loan funding trader and ecommerce invoicing financing financing the supply chain trade finance together using these solution can have enormous positive effect the balance sheet smes leaving smaller business more cash better working capital management and more stable and secure funding peertopeer loan this type loan introduced with the first platform launched the peertopeer market becoming global marketplace with multitude customized and with high estimated growth rate general the credit market refers the practice lending money borrower without going through traditional financial intermediary such bank fintech solution lender the market aim provide innovative solution that bank can not this due number factor that determine their model operation first the unsecured loan the most common form lending the market far such there required warranty small business especially benefit from this especially the service sector often such business have fairly stable cash flow but real collateral and bank can borrow these condition secondly market creditor are not funded classic and much regulated financing process for money depositor contrast fintech financial service source come from fund from retail institutional investor with increased risk appetite these are fintech main financier third market creditor apply innovation credit based innovation and scoring item such model are heavily based data use semiautomatic risk assessment method and stimulate nontraditional data point source may range from online business rating such yelp linkedin social network satellite data ass the level wealth particular area this allows credit risk assessment bank not traditionally develop innovation especially market with limited credit office information unlike the consumer market loan however always involve certain degree human decision the fourth factor given the fact that fintech supplier operate with reduced operational configuration without maintaining certain branch activity and staffing make underwriting decision they can therefore lend competitive rate incur credit loss certain level and with high risk potential for which they have subscribed overview the market compared total bank lending smes with market over trillion dollar while sme lending the market still limited size and scope globally market lending for billion billion outstanding borrowing volume recorded the country with the largest sme lending volume term volume include china the united state and the united kingdom since china been the largest country with volume loan issued through creditor the market based estimate the market lending volume exceeded yuan rmb million chinese renminbi billion the number platform the market rising impressive number platform compared only the number these platform being over the united state reported over billion new loan for smes through fintech market platform while volume over billion been reached among the most relevant platform since mention ondeck billion can capital billion kabbage million merchant cash capital million and strategic funding million this leaf significant potential untapped according estimate morgan stanley and goldman sachs market lending smes through fintech technology would about billion usd annual sme loan billion dollar can reached which will account for the total sme loan issue the market more fragmented with over different operating platform among the finest operator mention ratesetter million and lendinvest million existing infrastructure often prerequisite for market model work especially for fintech model this includes payment existence and banking infrastructure which all player need use also the technical infrastructure such the basic one namely the internet mobile connectivity particularly necessary especially for the fintech business model alternatively and outside the official banking system mobile moneylaundering solution such mobilemoney romania and kenya are slowly gaining market share however far they have not reached mature scale financing small business result market lending now offer bank and nonbank solution relation total nonbank corporation informal microenterprises the availability bank borrower analysis data another requirement for the lending market data may come from credit bureau sme balance sheet electronic accounting system many case market creditor will have mobilize data from alternative data source such mobile social medium and behavioral model however classical analysis data still preferred typically more data available specifically risk assessment and interest rate cut and can offered differently depending each type client far financial regulation concerned fintech platform many jurisdiction initially started operate gray area given that the legislation market lending not yet place this usually corresponds critical threshold where innovation from too small taken into account too big ignore however order for fintech accepted the market three central actor are needed firstly there must number wellmaintained platform and appropriate operating system general the existence larger number platform will help spread awareness among borrower and increase competition improvement can also made including lower operating cost better customer service such video tip wider range loan product increasing competition will force lender offer more competitive price similarly the classical lending market perceived interest rate have declined considerably recent year manta secondly private equity provider are needed provide sufficient funding for sustainable sme development globally institutional investor hold billion financial asset under management which may sufficient close the sme financing gap more than time investor need aware and trust the existing form credit the market preferably investor should invest not only loan but also invest higher amount invest for longer period time for example blackstone had committed million lent prosper victoria park capital announced will invest million euro through zencap european platform however many such institutional creditor need high level expected return their investment and the risk they take the expected result may vary with yield ranging from more than per year therefore critical challenge for many fintech company supplier provide sufficient attractive return for these investor while the borrower side they need more competitive than bank with low historical refinancing rate third debtor small business must willing address the lending market their search for funding this requires both awareness the availability market finance and knowledge how access them since smes not see that managing finance actually their force many never start looking for new information and instead rely their bank advice even the bank decline their credit demand recent survey showed most smes that did not get credit from their bank never came any other source therefore active involvement education and information credit market such available funding source which are needed fund their work must actively involved beyond awareness and knowledge smes must also have the confidence use this new financial market source funding process facilitator can help player interact perfectly optimizing the investment process intermediary party can help bring extra liquidity the market some innovative firm address the financial problem through sme education the american company nerdwallet aim provide highquality online content alternative source for consumer and small business rank based google search the reason for this that many small business start their financial tracking activity based web search thirdparty service provider facilitate the process and increase integration kyc and security provider help verify user identity data aggregator yodlee synchronize with user financial data from different source and integrate with bank account information from different financial institution with data easily accessible cooperation and partnership can help increase market access for creditor this can take many form partnership between bank and platform royal bank scotland and circle finance moreover the integrated cooperation between institutional investor and platform respectively the bank assumes substantial amount capital lent the platform already goldman sachs provided significant portion million credit facility for ondeck smes secondary market for sme lending can help create additional investment demand the ability resell credit allows investor get out their investment before maturity some company already have second trading platform for the loan they have created one the most advanced secondary market china where the secondary trading volume march reached almost onethird all new market lending financial securitization market allow structured risk transfer and pooling credit the european union the specific objective stimulating sme securitization managed through certain program such the sme initiative program with common funding being instrument the european investment bank eib and the european investment fund eif which aim stimulate smes finance granting partial loan for the risk smes however most current solution are adapted the bank level through interim securitization however for large commercial bank obtaining liquidity secondary market now challenging for example the amount guarantee for securitized smes under the european investment fund eif credit enhancement program with than one billion euro year finally most the current european proposal are mainly adapted high quality securitization however this approach may again exclude the most creditintensive segment smes that have access the bank bank with the best possible rating based traditional bank rating criterion however this instrument embedded ongoing initiative redeem the sme securitization market could continue and stimulate the growth rate loan the sme market systemic inherent risk may unpredictable the recent loan default credit default swap creates market with interest for sme failure similar the financial crisis country where withdrawal all time guaranteed investor for example china this could possible and would trigger unpredictable vicious circle platform need sell loan provide liquidity declining market similar that bank some extent this noticed during the collapse china summer capital market platform provided trading facility which had closed support market condition remedy third party insurance that provide security but case major disturbance insurance provider may fall finally hedge fund have recently begun take leveraged investment and buy loan the market thus increasing the risk from systemic perspective china the development the fintech market been made precisely because the more relaxed regime data confidentiality this allowed alibaba rely their data million consumer extend their loan offer small business however can not ruled out that implicitly china could adopt stricter privacy and data security measure the future perspective and trend the current market lending landscape expected change significantly the coming year the consolidation market creditor expected moreover expected internationalize the player recently ondeck entered the canadian and australian market however while common data and technology platform can usually easily transferred new market divergence regulatory requirement and different customer behavior limit the speed expansion over time another formalization the industry also expected from our point view industrial cluster such the peertopeer financing association the need formed banking response new challenge the same time bank have become very aware the opportunity financial technology and challenge their traditional business model lending small business according industry survey august bank respondent said their lending small business danger some bank will try again increase sme lending order capture some the available market share well fargo for example launched widespread well fargo work initiative place billion dollar new small business loan until internally bank will have further streamline process for make small business lending more costeffective bank china built credit facility especially for small business loan with the standardization internal process result only four level management are involved approving loan compared level previously and sometimes took several month process loan application now only take average four business day this way more than smes have already been served the same time implicit level remained comparable credit for larger business others will track internal innovation and evolve under online model and under the umbrella their licensed banking service june goldman sachs announced the launch online platform for lending small business funding provided the bank the new york state branch instead pursuing internal development bank can also directly acquire market creditor keep technology the team practice often called rapid adaptation still hard predict where the industry heading the next few year however estimate are significant change the market landscape for loan small business are certainly expected ideally with positive effect them manta the new role public institution national and local international level few industry are regulated the financial industry the question whether and how quickly fintech player can replace traditional business model therefore critically depends the role that regulator government and international organization choose play these actor however are biased situation while fintech tremendous potential improve the situation for small business and entrepreneur regulatory authority must also maintain their mandate covering country where government institution seem have found constructive path the middle the the financial conduct authority fca positioned leader prospective exercise establish the best framework support fintech while developing competitive and solid banking industry looking east china recently issued comprehensive guideline for fintech development differentiated market that allows both existing operator and fintech startup function order for all stakeholder benefit from the positive benefit that fintech industry can generate key objective and principle are essential for fintech regulator government and player basic principle for fintech company while supporting action regulator and government are critical fintech company also need contribute their share creating collaborative environment compliance fintech must always comply with the strictest standard available this will not only prevent costly adjustment their business model later will also signal the desire cooperate with regulator the company that found out this prosper creditor the security and exchange commission found that prosper dependent borrower issued credit note that were security that had been sold without registration applicable exemption the action stop and quit the letter november that effectively stopped prosper with all the money borrowed and asked the company fully relaunch business which finally succeeding setting precedent for many fintech player manta organization regulator often criticize fragmentation from the fintech landscape whom call want talk about peer loan said the executive director regulatory body complains some vertical the industry began organized national level meanwhile the the finance association ppfa become credible partner player and conversation for civil servant ppfa represents over the peertopeer loan market including consumer lending business crediting and billing membership base includes all major national player such funding center lendinvest marketinvoice
