herein file financing constraint smes developing country evidence determinant and solution thorsten beck first draft april this draft may abstract this paper survey empirical research that show that small and medium enterprise smes are more constrained financing and other institutional obstacle than large enterprise exacerbated the weakness the financial system many developing country use the concept the access possibility frontier explain how difficulty managing risk and transaction cost involved sme lending make financial institution and market reluctant reach out this group enterprise especially developing country discus different policy and reform that can entice financial institution and market lend smes and comment the role the government institution building providing the regulatory framework and undertake marketfriendly activist policy however also point pitfall government involvement sme financing keywords small and mediumsize enterprise business environment financing constraint jel classification world bank development research group this paper based joint research with asl demirg kunt and augusto torre and benefited from the insight many colleague prepared for promote entrepreneurship would like thank conference participant and leora klapper for helpful comment and suggestion and edward elhussainy for excellent research assistance this paper finding interpretation and conclusion are entirely those the author and not necessarily represent the view the world bank executive director the country they represent the kdi conference financing innovationoriented business introduction small and medium enterprise account for large share enterprise and large share overall employment the private sector most economy employment enterprise with employee constitutes over total employment manufacturing many country figure which justifies the statement that smes are the emerging private sector poor country and thus form the base for private sectorled growth hallberg crosscountry evidence however also show that small and medium enterprise are more constrained their operation and growth than large enterprise and access financial service feature importantly among the constraint ayyagari demirg kunt and maksimovic this paper summarizes recent empirical evidence smes financing constraint and pattern while offering broad crosscountry comparison should noted that this paper focus mainly developing and emerging market offer conceptual framework understand why financial institution most country are reluctant reach out these enterprise and discus different policy and reform that can increase smes access external finance based this framework the paper discus government role enhancing access finance ranging from institution building over providing regulatory framework marketfriendly activist policy while the same time noting potential pitfall government attempt enhance smes access credit policy effort targeted smes have often been justified with argument that smes are engine innovation and growth they help reduce poverty they are more laborintensive but iii they are constrained institutional and market failure while countrylevel and microeconomic study have not provided conclusive evidence see biggs for overview these argument recent crosscountry evidence doe not support the claim that country with larger share smes the manufacturing sector grow faster see their poverty rate fall faster beck demirg kunt and levine specifically there doe not seem any robust relationship between the share small medium large enterprise and economic development the other hand crosscountry research pointed the institutional and business environment which enterprise operate important factor for economic development the business environment includes among other element welldefined property right both between private party and protection against government expropriation effective contract enforcement competitive product labor and capital maker and legal framework that allows for relatively easy entry and exit enterprise klapper laeven and rajan show how different element the business environment affect economic growth through the entry new firm specifically high firm registration cost hamper new firm creation and growth while property right protection and regulation fostering access finance are conducive firm creation and growth the effect policy might also explain the absence robust relationship between the size the sme sector and growth comparison between italy and the illustrates the one hand italy high registration cost and many old inefficient and slow growing smes while the with low entry barrier firm that enter lower scale than italy but grow more rapidly figure taking together this implies the policy focus shifting away from sizeoriented policy towards policy that level the playing field between firm different size and allow for entry new enterprise while small firm suffer more from financing and other constraint than large firm not size itself that justifies intervention but rather the potential small firm grow into medium and large enterprise and contribute the economy and the fact that institutional and market failure create uneven playing field between firm different size will argue below the focus should therefore both reform the business environment that affect all enterprise and foster entrepreneurship klapper and quesadadelgado but also policy that can help smes overcome financing constraint particular their firm size and risk the focus should subsidy small enterprise per the remainder this paper structured follows section summarizes recent empirical evidence smes financing constraint and pattern section offer conceptual framework understand why financial institution are reluctant reach out smes section this framework discus policy overcome these constraint and section discus detail government role section concludes smes financing constraint the evidence access and cost finance often ranked one most constraining feature the business environment smes figure specifically the cost finance rated over small and medium enterprise major growth constraint sample mostly developing country more than any other characteristic the business environment including tax rate and macroeconomic instability also rated many smes major growth constraint access finance rated major constraint around small and medium enterprise similar proportion economic policy uncertainty and corruption further financing one the few characteristic the business environment that together with crime and political instability robustly this section build beck and demirg kunt linked firm growth while other feature have most indirect effect firm growth ayyagari demirg kunt and maksimovic small firm consistently report higher financing obstacle than medium and large enterprise beck demirg kunt laeven and maksimovic smaller younger and domestic opposed foreignowned enterprise report higher financing obstacle even after controlling for other firm characteristic the relationship not only statistically but also economically significant the probability that small firm list financing major obstacle opposed moderate minor obstacle compared for mediumsize firm and for large firm the higher financing obstacle reported small compared large firm are also reflected financing pattern figure while small firm finance than ten percent their investment need with bank finance large firm finance more than with bank credit large firm have similar through not strong advantage trade credit and development finance while small firm seem finance larger investment with equity and informal finance compared large firm small firm also finance significantly larger share their new investment with internal resource than large firm further small firm are likely use bank finance and other source external finance figure while large firm use bank finance finance new investment only small firm small firm not only report higher financing obstacle they are also more adversely affected these obstacle shown figure small firm financing obstacle have almost twice the effect their growth that large firm financing obstacle beck demirg kunt and maksimovic the difference between small and large firm least big even bigger for some the specific financing obstacle such collateral requirement bank paperwork interest rate payment the need for special connection and bank lack lending resource also the lack access specific form financing such export leasing and longterm finance significantly more constraining for small firm growth than for large firm growth quasinatural experimental evidence confirms the importance credit constraint for firm growth banerjee and duflo analyze detailed loan information indian smes before and after they became eligible for directed subsidized lending program and find that the additional credit resulted proportional increase sale rather than substitution for other nonsubsidized credit indicating that these firm were credit constrained before receiving subsidized credit similarly zia find that small nonlisted and nongroup firm pakistan reduce their sale after they become ineligible for subsidized export credit indicating the existence credit constraint contrast large listed and group firm not reduce their sale after losing access subsidized credit should stressed that this evidence doe not support subsidized credit mean alleviate small firm credit constraint topic which will return below but they show that small firm are constrained their lack access external finance recent research also show the importance the business environment for firm financing constraint and pattern beck demirg kunt laeven and maksimovic show that institutional development measured very broadly the most robust countrycharacteristic predicting crosscountry variation firm financing obstacle even after controlling for crosscountry difference gdp per caput firm country with higher level institutional development report significantly lower financing obstacle than firm country with developed institution the positive effect financial and institutional development can also observed the use external finance better protection property right increase external financing small firm significantly more than doe for large firm particularly due the differential impact bank and supplier finance beck demirg kunt and maksimovic financial and institutional development help create level playing field between small and large firm while the lack effective financial system explains the phenomenon the missing middle observed many developing country beck demirg kunt and maksimovic show that the effect growth obstacle firm growth smaller country with betterdeveloped financial and legal system the effect financial and legal development the constraintsgrowth relationship significantly stronger for small firm than for large firm financial and institutional development thus help close the gap between small and large firm this also confirmed more detailed country comparison for example sleuwaegen and goedhuys show that smaller firm grow relatively faster germany than ivoire while the opposite hold for large firm using crossindustry crosscountry data for country and industry the manufacturing sector beck demirg kunt laeven and levine show that financial development exerts disproportionately large positive effect the growth industry that are naturally composed more small firm their result suggest that the furniture industry industry with many small firm should grow per annum faster than the spinning industry industry with relatively few small firm canada country with well developed financial system than india which low level financial development since the average industry growth rate their sample this relatively large effect this suggests that financial market development help small firm more than large firm overcome financial market friction thus leading more level playing field between firm different size the constraining effect financial and institutional underdevelopment also show distorted size distribution kumar rajan and zingales find that the average size firm human capitalintensive and intensive industry larger country with better property right and patent protection similarly beck demirg kunt and maksimovic show cross country sample that large firm firm that are most likely able choose the boundary the firm are larger country with betterdeveloped financial and legal system finally aghion fally and scarpetta find for sample european country that financial development enhances new firm entry sector that depend more heavily external finance and that the smallest size firm benefit the most term higher entry from higher financial development they also show that financial development promotes the postentry growth firm sector that depend more external finance these result suggest that agency problem between outside investor and corporate insider keep firm smaller country with weak legal and financial system firm thus stay smaller country with underdeveloped financial and legal system the other hand access financial service can help new entrepreneur survive beyond the first year evidence from bosnia show demirg kunt klapper and panos and can help enterprise innovate faster rate ayyagari demirg kunt and maksimovic smes financing constraint conceptual framework the empirical evidence that financing constraint and access external finance are inversely correlated with firm size match theoretical model that use fixed transaction cost and information asymmetry and the resulting agency problem basis for financial market friction see levine for overview the following will build this theoretical literature and the empirical evidence derive conceptual framework explaining smes financing constraint and thus set the basis for the policy discussion the next section transaction cost and information asymmetry drive the variation access finance across firm different size take first transaction cost fixed transaction cost credit assessment processing and monitoring result decreasing unit cost the size the loan increase these fixed transaction cost exist the transaction client institution and even financial system level assessing individual loan request entail cost that are least partially independent the loan amount maintaining client relationship over time and across different financial product including loan deposit and saving service implies cost that are partly orthogonal the number and amount financial transaction with the client the level the financial institution fixed cost range from brickandmortar branch installation over computer system legal service and are again partly independent the number client the size their loan fixed cost might even arise the financial system level the form regulatory cost and the cost payment and settlement system which are point independent the number transaction client and institution the system this section build beck and torre these fixed transaction cost drive wedge between funding cost financial institution and the lending rate they charge borrower world uncertain return investment higher transaction cost and the resulting higher lending cost can increase the likelihood that borrower can not pay due too high repayment burden rather than increasing the interest rate the market clearing rate financial institution might ration lower interest rate than the market equilibrium rate because higher interest rate would lead lower expected repayment williamson high transaction cost therefore not only increase the cost borrowing but can also restrict access external finance for some borrower group while transaction cost are restraining for all borrower there are argument that they are even more constraining for small and medium enterprise their diverse characteristic and their relative opaqueness increase assessment and monitoring cost unlike other credit category such consumer credit mortgage lending sme lending still considered highcost lending product more specifically unlike other lending product that can reduced simple transaction sme lending often still depends heavily relationship between borrower and lender berger and udell addition transaction cost the outreach small and medium enterprise constrained default risk default risk can either borrowerspecific systemic the following will focus the borrowerspecific risk and more specifically risk arising from asymmetric information between borrower and lender the debtor privy information about her project her effort and the lender may only secure this information prohibitively high cost this can lead two different source risk adverse selection and moral hazard adverse selection refers difficulty choosing good credit risk exante while moral hazard refers the inability the lender effectively enforcing the agreed credit contract expost although such risk can compensated increasing the interest rate this would increase adverse selection and moral hazard the interest rate rise this will attract riskier borrower the pool and will entice borrower undertake riskier project with higher probability default the impossibility use interest rate screening technology entices lender use noninterest screening device such collateral warrant assessment based audited information ultimate consequence however lender will ration credit rather than allow the interest rate rise the marketclearing level first shown stiglitz and wei illustrate the nonlinear relationship between interest rate and credit supply due transaction cost and agency problem figure plot the nominal interest rate and the return for the lender world with cost and risk the two would identical illustrated the line world transaction cost and agency problem however there increasing wedge between nominal interest rate and return increase there higher default probability and the return the lender therefore increase decreasing rate similarly increase the borrower pool becomes riskier which again result higher default probability eventually the marginal benefit interest rate increase due higher revenue equal the marginal cost due higher default and higher nominal interest rate the return the lender decrease the case transaction cost sme lending more affected the inability manage risk than other lending product compared large firm smes are commonly more opaque likely able post collateral and often not have audited financial statement that allow better picture the enterprise and projected profit these feature the sme lending market make the curve figure flatter and the flexion point lower than other lending market lender must develop loan technology that enable them choose such smes that for any given lending interest rate will yield the highest riskadjusted expected net return select such debtor the creditor must compare the allin cost lending different debtorsprojects the difference expected return capacity pay across such debtorsprojects that the lender considers equally risky and iii the difference risk and willingness pay across such debtorsprojects that the lender considers equal expected return capacity pay the scope for optimization that the lender will have managing lending cost and risk will constrained state variable such the contractual and informational framework macroeconomic environment technology and other characteristic the business environment which both lender and borrower operate such physical infrastructure crime and political instability these state variable are not only outside the reach lender action but neither can they changed the shortrun policy maker the weaker these state variable the flatter the curve figure and the the maneuvering room for credit supply optimization given the constraint prudent lender will rather not offer loan higher interest rate she not reasonably sure her ability appropriately measure cost sort out risk for given expected return and identify expected return for given risk however there also the possibility that lender will not maximize their lending opportunity smes given the state variable the other extreme lender might act imprudently and lend more smes than sustainable under the current state variable using the concept state variable allows define the access possibility frontier for sme lending rationed equilibrium the maximum share viable loan applicant that could served financial institution prudently given the existing state variable derive the frontier and thus the bankable share loan applicant have take into account both demand and supply side factor while holding the state variable constant the demand for loanable fund positive function expected return investible project and negative function the lending interest rate and voluntary selfexclusion enabling debtor seek resource for risky project that they would not undertake with their own money the option borrow give rise the problem adverse selection and moral hazard discussed above which can result imprudently high loan demand while the loan supply thus positive function the nominal lending interest rate this relationship nonlinear and might turn negative beyond threshold lender will thus not satisfy all the loan demand but rather ration interest rate below the marketclearing rate this inevitable cost prudence world uncertainty and agency problem some good debtor have left out order minimize the set bad debtor that are let statistical term this the tradeoff between type and type error the access possibility frontier however not timeinvariant the example technology show the increasing use lending reduces processing cost and while derive the access possibility frontier for sme lending this concept can also applied other lending product and market see beck and torre for more detailed discussion thus overall transaction cost related lending but can also improve risk management through the introduction credit scoring berger frame and miller frame padhi and woosley frame srinivasan and woosley given cost and risk and demandside constraint can use the access possibility frontier identify several type access credit problem first type access problem demandoriginated and consists too low number loan applicant simply because selfexclusion resulting from cultural barrier financial illiteracy alternatively there could lack profitable investment project the economy that deserve financing based their expected return second type access problem can arise due supply suboptimization that lead credit market settling point below the access possibility frontier this can reflect for instance regulatory distortion insufficient contestability that cause lender not fully exploit all the outreach opportunity given the state variable third and very different access problem associated with excess access that equilibrium above the access possibility frontier with loan being granted larger share loan applicant than prudently warranted given the lending interest rate and the state variable final access problem consists too low prudent access possibility frontier due deficiency state variable compared country with similar level economic development each these access problem call for different policy the first type problem call for demandside measure that educate and encourage the healthy use financial product smes problem profitable investment project the other hand addressed through nonfinancial sector policy and primarily not problem access finance the second problem call for intervention and policy that encourage financial institution maximize outreach smes given the contractual and macroeconomic environment while the third problem call for restraining measure the final set policy are general reform the business environment and institutional framework that are not specific the sme lending market will discus these different policy the next section smes financing constraint policy the access possibility frontier derived the previous section allows discus different policy alleviate smes financing constraint specifically will distinguish between marketdeveloping policy that will help push out the frontier marketenabling policy that push incumbent and new financial institution towards the existing frontier and marketharnessing policy that prevent the financial system move beyond the frontier towards point financial fragility let discus each turn market developing policy aim improving the state variable and include reform the contractual and informational framework and macroeconomic performance discussed above while these reform are not specific the sme lending market they will help level the playing field between small and large enterprise the result such reform can take longtime nevertheless they are indispensable order for the financial system reach higher sustainable equilibrium and able provide smes with the necessary financial service commercially viable manner high lending interest rate may reflect doubt about fiscal solvency and history asset confiscation inflation volatility and will often associated with crowding out private investment due the absorption the government large share society financial saving this crowding out will especially hurt small and medium enterprise that unlike large and multinational enterprise not have recourse alternative finance provider under such circumstance the appropriate policy foster access credit would those that aim enhancing the resiliency fiscal solvency and establishing credible record low and stable inflation shallow credit market with low access may also result from major shortfall the contractual and informational framework beck and levine the appropriate policy this case would span wide range from titling land property the upgrading law affecting collateral repossession execution guarantee from the modernization corporate reorganization and bankruptcy proceeding improvement the functioning the judiciary from raising accounting and disclosure standard establishing the appropriate legal framework and right incentive for the development credit registry change the state variable involve change fundamental institution and can take long time materialize the extent that financial system operating below the possibility frontier there room for marketenabling policy that may foster the broadening access even the absence perceptible change state variable where the lack profitable creditdeserving investment project the main problem nonfinancial sector policy are called for where the main reason for being below the possibility frontier the demand problem selfexclusion the appropriate policy would emphasize raising financial literacy more likely the main problem reside with suboptimization credit supply contrast wider range policy option can considered starting with competition policy while theory and some empirical work suggest that market power might entice bank invest longterm relationship with small and opaque enterprise they know that they can regain the initial investment the relationship later stage petersen and rajan bonaccorsi patti and dell ariccia other empirical paper point the healthy effect competition availability lending smes cetorelli and strahan beck demirg kunt and maksimovic complicating the debate that market structure for example measured concentration ratio not the same competitiveness which also influenced the segmentation and contestability market claessens and laeven further state variable such the contractual and informational framework can influence the competitiveness financial system through the ability transfer collateral easily from one lender another and the ability smes build reputation capital through credit registry there mixed evidence concerning the effect foreign bank entry sme lending the one hand firmsurvey evidence suggests that firm report lower financing obstacle country with higher share foreign bank finding that hold across different size group firm clarke cull and martinez peria this positive effect can direct indirect one foreign bank can bring the necessary knowhow and scale introduce new transaction lending technique competing with domestic bank for large corporate client they can also force domestic bank down market cater smes haas and naaborg the other hand banklevel information from specific country suggests that foreign bank are likely lend small and opaque company than domestic bank mian gormley any see berger for overview positive effect foreign bank entry sme lending seems more indirect than direct regulatory policy can important push the system towards the frontier sme lending regulatory framework that enable leasing and factoring traditional sme lending product have featured prominently the agenda leasing attractive financing tool for smes based the cash flow the financed asset such machinery vehicle rather than reputation the enterprise the asset base the enterprise often includes tax advantage and allows for easier recovery the correct legal framework place factoring the discounting sale receivables attractive for small supplier large creditworthy buyer doe not rely information about the borrower but rather the obligor klapper both leasing and factoring rely legal framework governing these transaction but rely lesser extent the contractual framework country that they can help push financial system towards the frontier sme lending even this frontier low both transaction form can also benefit lot from electronic registration system and electronic security law which will allow electronic processing and therefore reduction transaction cost klapper loan classification and provisioning rule can also affect smes access finance through reliance collateral than forwardlooking assessment payment performance further adasme majnoni and uribe show that sme lending might require more provisioning but capital given that the distribution loss from small loan skewed than that for large loan another regulatory issue the equal taxation financial product that are offered different financial institution thus creating competitive even playing field third group policy which define marketharnessing try prevent the financial system from moving unsustainable equilibrium beyond the frontier due imprudent lending such imprudent lending binge can arise from the same competition that marketenabling policy try foster not accompanied proper defined regulatory and supervisory framework indiscriminate free entry for new deposittaking credit institution the intensification competition among incumbent institution can lead widespread fragility especially the context implicit explicit government guarantee poor accounting and disclosure practice deficient early warning system and prompt corrective action regime and dysfunctional failure resolution framework marketharnessing policy therefore aim keeping bank incentive take aggressive risk check through mix measure aimed strengthening market and supervisory discipline the absence too generous deposit insurance implicit explicit and disclosure and transparency requirement give large creditor and depositor incentive and possibility monitor and discipline bank addition market signal the form deposit interest rate yield subordinated debt equity price publicly listed bank moving response risk taking and performance bank provide additional information bank supervisor and should coupled with effective official intervention into institution that the market identified weak summarizing policy maker have strike fine balance between marketenabling policy that push financial institution towards the frontier and market harnessing policy that prevent them from moving beyond the frontier with the balance varying from country country smes financing constraint the role government the different policy discussed the previous section seem call for important role the government the smeaccess finance debate but what exactly government role still subject discussion while research been able identify which government intervention have not worked over the past decade the sme lending market researcher are still struggling define exactly which policy can work under which circumstance there tradeoff between market failure and government failure the tendency remedy market failure through government intervention which then turn can lead government failure the following will discus different area government intervention but would like emphasize that this area still being researched with standard answer for all country and market and predesigned policy package ready taken off the shelf what work one country might not work others contextsensitive approach that take into account country circumstance therefore called for honohan and beck where government intervention involved the strength governance arrangement might important factor taken into account least controversial the role government providing the contractual and informational framework and ensuring stable macroeconomic environment government the natural provider key institution such legislation and court system similarly given the government monopoly over the issue monetary instrument ensuring macroeconomic stability natural government task discussed above through these policy that the government can help push outwards the access possibility frontier and ensure longterm sustainable increase smes access finance while these business environment reform not focus specifically smes they help close the gap between firm different size and level the playing field through these policy the government help develop market that can then used financial institution reach out smes however these market are not always used and the financial system likely settle equilibrium below the frontier which raise the question government involvement ensuring that the system move towards the frontier already discussed marketenabling policy such providing regulatory framework for leasing and factoring and fostering competition some these policy might require more active government involvement improving the informational framework through the introduction credit information bureau specific area where government might have step while bank might interested establishing system share negative information incumbent financial institution might interested sharing positive information the other hand positive information sharing allows smes build reputation collateral and thus foster competition overcoming bank opposition share positive information can enhance the contestability financial system and might area where government have take proactive role beyond targeting competition per government can also try produce movement towards the possibility frontier addressing hindrance such coordination failure first mover disincentive and obstacle risk distribution and sharing while not easy define general term given their variety these government intervention tend share common feature creating incentive for private lender and investor step without unduly shifting risk and cost the government torre gozzi and schmukler three example illustrate this approach one the creation nafin mexican development bank internetbased market which allows small supplier use their receivable from large creditworthy buyer receive working capital financing klapper another example the chilean program fogape promote lending smes via the auctioning partial government guarantee benavente galetovic and sanhueza finally the mexican development fund fira brokered variety structured finance package finance agricultural production shrimp corn realign credit risk with the pattern information between financial institution and different participant the supply chain these agricultural product torre gozzi and schmukler while intriguing example not for sure whether risk really not being shifted government and taxpayer through such intervention and whether these intervention have sunset clause that will allow the government withdraw once engagement not needed anymore there are also governance concern stemming from government intervention private market finally from political economy viewpoint such scheme might take away the pressure implement the longterm institution building that necessary push out the frontier and expand sme lending sustainably the longterm partial credit guarantee pcg scheme feature prominently among marketactivist policy while they also exist private basis government and donor have been aggressively pushing for their establishment overcome the limited access bank credit smes face providing guarantee such scheme can help overcome the lack collateral most smes but issue appropriate pricing funding and the institutional structure are important while such scheme could run selfsustainable basis they often involve significant subsidy and contingent fiscal liability cover loss while difficult compute such cost exante even more difficult measure the benefit which would partially captured additionality the share borrower that would not have gained access finance were not for the pcg even more accurate measure would the extent which borrower that would have gotten access credit world without market friction could access the credit market due pgcs minus the extent which borrower gained access through the pcg that would not have gotten access frictionfree world ultimately the cost any government intervention take into account the return each dollar taxpayer money such intervention compared other intervention including intervention outside the financial sector while the government often doe not intervene directly the market the case most pcg scheme credit assessment and monitoring still left with the bank the past forty year have seen many example marketsubstituting policy foster sme lending with the result balance tipping heavily into the negative such policy include directed credit often combined with interest rate subsidy and the establishment development finance institution focused sme lending these policy share the for overview the literature pcgs see world bank problem all governmentmanaged financial sector program the tradeoff between commercial and social goal result high loss and nonsustainability many these program undercutting market condition result crowding out private provider even where the latter would willing enter due change the general business environment due technological advance political subversion these program often lead corruption and channeling fund political crony specific electoral group cole dinc khwaja and mian conclusion this paper surveyed empirical research smes financing constraint and pattern conceptual framework showed that transaction cost and asymmetric information between borrower and lender are the driving factor explaining the limited access external finance many smes developing well developed economy this conceptual framework allowed distinguish between marketdeveloping policy such reforming the contractual and informational framework marketenabling policy such fostering competition and providing regulatory framework for leasing and factoring and marketharnessing policy such the financial safety net that prevent imprudent lending boom and bust government important role reforming the institutional environment providing regulatory framework and fostering competition international experience however shown the widespread failure governmentowned managed financial institution focusing specific borrower group directed lending program clear the role government intervening through activist policy such credit guarantee scheme there broad research agenda going forward better understand smes financing need developing and emerging economy first important better understand sme lending practice financial institution and identify best practice even more important however understand how these practice depend the business environment which the financial institution operate effort are under way using banklevel survey and interview torre martinez peria and schmukler beck demirg kunt and martinez peria second while have focused mainly the banking system driven the observation that bank still constitute the largest component financial system the financial system most developing and emerging market the role nonbank financial institution and financial market both the debt and the equity side explored more detail third the role technology expanding smes access financial service been little explored while the introduction credit scoring been shown expand sme lending the not clear whether this technology can easily applied developing country miller and rojas enabling more costeffective consumer lending technological advance such credit scoring alternative delivery channel such electronic mobile finance might push lender out the sme lending market thus even exacerbating smes financing constraint fourth case study marketfriendly activist government intervention have been undertaken but more rigorous impact evaluation necessary such been started for microfinance institution world bank finally future research will also try understand better the impact the institutional structure funding and pricing partial credit guarantee
