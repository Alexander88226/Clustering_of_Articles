audretsch johnson loweman numerous author from academic and professional world designate smes generator both economic growth and overall social development audretsch klepper world bank group mcmillan woodruff the discussion the relevant literature related the access smes finance well investment finance particular importance krasniqi according beck the smes access and cost finance quite often characterized major difficulty the extent percent should also stressed that the small firm come with more difficulty loan since they encounter higher transaction cost and higher premium risk for they are more fragile and they offer lower collateral beck audretsch and elston also stress that small firm confronted higher financial difficulty than large one similar conclusion can found among other author who have worked this direction beck oliveira fortunato brinckmann find that small firm have higher limitation access external source financing than bigger firm and thus they become more dependent internal fund for financing their investment need major obstacle financial market the access finance smes also the asymmetry information thus based zhao one from the major difficulty for accessing finance the asymmetry information among lender and debtor for instance borrower have private information the firm that lender not posse because their small size short history and inconsistent accounting data the issue asymmetric information for smes becomes more serious deakins ebrd pissardies klapper difficulty this kind are expressed also among smes kosovo one from the last country transition spite the fact that the sme sector kosovo relatively new constitutes all the firm thus representing huge potential for generation new job and for economic development the country based data the world bank the major obstacle the development smes kosovo access bank loan only investment made smes are financed through bank loan and above investment are financed from private source world bank wwwccsenetorgijef international journal economics and finance vol objective this work empirically investigate the role and importance the firm and entrepreneurship characteristic that influence the investment growth through debt finance loan kosovo therefore the research question this study how doe the investment growth impact the performance smes discussing the firm and entrepreneurship characteristic the investment growth smes kosovo the organization the work following part one discus the context the research part two the theoretical aspect and the summary literature part three provide the research methodology and model part four contains the result and empirical finding and part five deal with the conclusion theory and literature review until now there single and unique theoretical model that explains the financing smes which influence the performance investment their growth and development the theoretical principle underlying capital structure can generally describes term the static trade off theory modigliani and miller the pecking order theory myers majluf managerial theory investment marri baumol agency theory jensen and meckling and extended stiglitz and wei according neoclassical theory investment which affirms the attitude the irrelevance the capital structure for the value the firm internal and external source financing are perfect substitute the world the perfect functioning the market the choice between financing through capital debt irrelevant therefore the cost capital and the market value the firm are independent from the value the firm modigliani miller the theory based the following premise there are tax there are transaction cost there are bankruptcy cost the equal cost debt for company and for investor symmetrical information the market there influence debt the profit the company before interest and taxation modigliani and miller modify their theory introducing the tax profit this case the value the firm positively related debt after introducing the tax profit their analysis they ascertain that the financial leverage increase the value the firm since the interest decrease the tax base deduced from the business profit and therefore have saving which have the value the interest from this ascertainment the value the firm grows bigger the financial leverage increase which mean that the highest value the firm achieved the burden debt becomes this way the firm attains absolute advantage given that defended from tax scott emphasizes that tax shield doe not exist reality because distress cost debt lead legal obligation pay interest and principal firm can not meet debt obligation forced bankruptcy incurs associated cost fatoki asah this theory fact doe not take into the consideration all the other factor such the cost the bankruptcy the firm the cost the agency the impact debt profit the asymmetry information and therefore this theory challenged other theory harris raviv thus the static trade off theory which based the theory and complementary except saving from the tax profit incorporates into the discussion also the cost bankruptcy such judicial tax attorney cost administrative cost and also the agency cost the firm manager damage the interest the creditor working the interest shareholder and this can reduce the value the firm jensen and meckling this theory fact the dominant theory regarding the determination the financial structure the firm and founded the premise that the firm that chooses how much will financed from debt and how much from the capital balancing the cost profit according this theory the optimal level the structure capital the one which equates the profit and cost from debt according pecking order theory the firm initially prefers internal source financing external one and regarding external source they prefer debt capital donaldson thus initially have the use accumulated profit amortization debt and finally the equity capital according this theory the firm finance their investment requirement based hierarchic order this can direct also existence the asymmetry information between manager insider and investor outsider result this manager have more information then investor myers majluf based the agency theory stiglitz and wei present the problem that consequence asymmetrical information occur between manager and shareholder one hand and the problem among shareholder manager and creditor the other they argue that only smes know the real financial structure their own the real strength their investment project and the tendency for settling the debt and therefore the firm posse superior private information mazanai fatoki wwwccsenetorgijef international journal economics and finance vol hypothesis business plan according guffey the business plan necessary requirement the beginning business and used important element acquire financial support during application banking institution guffey increase the level skill those who are looking for credit the compilation business plan will increase their opportunity have properly prepared documentation and have clear idea the course their business according maziku the asymmetric information between the debtseeking smes and the bank reflected the incapability the majority smes provide consistent financial data and real business plan which increase the operational cost during the decision making for permitting the loan the bank maziku thus the business plan doe not have impact only reduction operational cost but also key instrument the decision making regarding the use banking loan the firm zhang madura this valid particularly for startup business therefore the following hypothesis generated smes which have business plan are more likely use bank loan than smes without written business plan the growth the firm the growth smes depends the level investment the growth smes can measured different way including the growth sale profit number employee mcperson measure this variable through the growth the number employee the ability smes grow depends large measure from their potential invest the restructuring and innovation all these investment require capital that they require access finance mazanai fatoki according ganbold research the world bank one among the key difficulty the growth the firm access financial service which reflects economic growth employment generation and reduction poverty the developing country ganbold based the theory firm growth jovanovic new enterprise grow faster which mean that these have invest more therefore the following hypothesis generated smes that grow faster invest more than those with low level growth gender the professional literature there are contradictory opinion regarding the impact that gender the owner the firm into the access finance while group thinker assert that gender the owner impact into the capital structure the firm the other group denies this ascertaining that gender doesn have any impact into the determination the capital structure one hand abor argues that business owned female owner use the debt loan for different reason including discrimination and aversion risk watson emphasize that key factor determining the capital structure business owned female owner their propensity towards not accepting risk from the desire keep thing under control female client are more hesitant seek loan since they feel discriminated and discouraged kon storey the other hand coleman find that there important difference the use debt banking loan between female and male owner and that gender not important predictor the financial leverage the firm whereas irving and scott analyzing smes and based the questionare prepared barclays bank the most surprising way ascertain that female have easier access finance then male therefore based the finding reported above the following hypothesis generated the male owner firm are more likely use bank loan then the female owner firm source financing the larger participation investment finance from internal source smes increase the probability for acquiring bank loan since the internal source carry the opportunity cost financing the project thus smes provide higher level trust bank since the case failure the unexpected burden fall smes themselves their research conducted country oecd japelli and pagano ascertain that bank don finance the property value any these country but they that with certain coeficient loanproperty this not equal for all the country and differs from country country starting from the minimum financing turkey and greece denmark wwwccsenetorgijef international journal economics and finance vol credit arguing influence between education ownersmanagers and access thus author lee and ratti and ahn report negative relationship between debt and investment this relationship stronger among smaller firm the debt loan grows the cash flow increasingly used for settling the loan and interest consequently firm fulfill their obligation creditor with more difficulty and the other hand the possibility for new investment reduced therefore the following hypothesis generated the higher the internal source smes the higher probability acquire bank loan for investment finance education education one the important factor that influence the growth the firm therefore the high level human capital education and experience positive impact the growth the firm the owner the firm who are young age and low level education are more active using the external source financing spite the fact that higher education reduces the fear for refusing the loan the meantime the owner more mature age and with higher education the called wiser one can found interested for external source financing vos therefore the majority owner smes prefer keep the control and not apply for external capital curran jarvis thus the internal capital the major source financing the smes haynes rand find also negative that ownersmanagers with higher education can understand easier that their requirement for credit can refused therefore these ownersmanagers are for this reason discouraged and hesitate apply for loan their study new firm hartarska and gonzales vega find that education doe not have important role the decisionmaking the bank for lending therefore the following hypothesis generated ownersmanagers with high level education use bank loan for financing the investment requirement methodology source data the organization data gathering from the questionnaire
