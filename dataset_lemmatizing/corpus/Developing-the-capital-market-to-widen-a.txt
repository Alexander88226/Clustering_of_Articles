report for presentation the wrapup meeting consultantsresearch institute asean research group which will held february hanoi vietnam content executive summary introduction sme financing and measure fill the financing gap sme financing through government program and the banking sector sme financing through capital market iii sme financing through the capital market the korean experience smes the korean economy overview sme financing korea public support for sme financing sme financing through bank sme financing through stock and bond market active utilization the pcbo program venture capital korea implication from the korean experience and policy recommendation implication from the korean experience policy recommendation reference executive summary sme financing and financing gap smes consist firm varying widely size and characteristic namely from very small startup firm infant stage development established smes already listed the stock market course the major source financing for smes differ depending their current stage growth and development however agreed that most smes heavily depend upon bank loan and generally experience financing gap even developed country this financing gap often defined the difference between the demand for fund smes and the supply fund occurs because various reason some argue that the fundamental reason behind smes lack access fund can found their peculiar characteristic while others argue that smes suffer from financing gap because market imperfection the supply side reality smes face financing gap probably because combination reason originating from both the supply and demand side this financing gap for smes most prominent capital market financing and most country including developed one have problem sme financing through capital market sme financing through capital market obstacle with regard sme financing move away from bank intermediation towards funding the capital market long been considered longterm objective many country the region successful this approach would address the chronic lack longterm credit available smes this promising move however many hurdle until full implementation the first hurdle overcome having adequately developed capital market term depth and liquidity second smes essence have relatively high credit risk while smes have high growth potential they are also more vulnerable sudden change the economic and competitive environment third there exists severe information asymmetry this segment enterprise smes corporate information often nonexistent come with very high access cost many economy the region fourth sme financing inherently associated with higher unit cost when compared with that large corporation the relatively smaller size funding well higher information and monitoring cost lead higher implementation cost per deal when processing finance capital market sme financing capital market the korean experience issuance pcbos the korean government introduced the primary collateralized bond obligation pcbo program order smooth out liquidity constraint and support smes started the pcbo program expanded include venture firm pcbo type assetbacked security with newlyissued corporate bond the underlying asset smes issue new corporate bond and sell them special purpose vehicle spv underlying asset the spv then issue the cbo based the pool smes newlyissued corporate bond and sell the cbo investor the market credit enhancement provided through various channel including bank and credit guarantee fund the spv issue both senior and junior tranche bond with senior tranche usually aaa grade pcbos offer more fundraising opportunity smes that have low credit rating fact the distinguishing feature the pcbo program lie facilitating the issuance corporate bond help finance smes because pcbos pool bond with different level risk the overall risk default decrease because pcbos are issued through strict surveillance credit rating agency they are relatively safe and fairly attractive investment furthermore pcbos can offer higher yield than general corporate bond mezzanine tranche investor short pcbos can useful instrument that can resolve the credit mismatch problem that exists between investor and smes thus filling the financing gap smes venture capital the venture investment consists three stage fundraising investment and exit most investor may invest smes directly indirectly through investment fund made venture capital company ipo the stock market and are the most widely used exit method the central and local government korea are the largest investor venture capital company fundraising comprising the total fundraising while other business entity come second with the total fundraising compared the and europe where pension fund and institutional investor take the largest share total investment venture company the government play larger role the korean venture capital market for the exit strategy venture investment the kosdaq been key factor the success venture capital company the main exit channel for investment are common the where almost venture investment chooses exit method while the remaining chooses pursue ipo korea venture capital investment depends ipo the kosdaq and take only the korean government used directly invest venture investment fund before the government fostering venture company drive announced addition the government investment resource were quite decentralized with various government body administering different part the process the government needed stable and unified source venture investment result the korea fund fund kfof established contrast with the previous system where the government directly chose the recipient company well determined the amount fund the fund fund fof system allows fund manager evaluate select and distribute capital number fund kff expected play significant role making the venture capital market more transparent and efficient policy recommendation smes with high growth potential especially hightechnology sector have played important role raising productivity and maintaining competitiveness recent year smes especially innovative earlystage smes can not find the financing they need their brilliant idea will never developed product matter how great their potential therefore government and policymakers not only have focus the development and growth the capital market itself but also search for mean overcome the obstacle inherent smes order facilitate active sme financing through capital market building credible sme information sharing system for both bond and equity market providing access credible corporate information smes important task that will ease information asymmetry start policymakers should search for way utilize the information about smes currently scattered around the banking sector credit guarantee scheme and other existing government program well common commercial credit program once aggregated this collective data base will have higher chance providing more credible information and easier access potential investor the government must take the initiative and play major role this data collection process addition credit information individual consumer already available through the public credit registry andor private credit bureau will also play significant role easing information asymmetry the sme sector the credit assessment smes often heavily depends individual namely the owner andor manager the company this especially common for smaller company facilitating sme financing through bond market the case corporate bond issuance pooling group smes may provide plausible solution the inherently higher credit risk and transaction cost associated with sme financing individual company sme exposed high credit risk however once enough smes with various degree risk exposure economic cycle are pooled together the basket smes whole may have credit risk low enough attractive debt market investor the problem higher transaction cost will resolved with the sufficient size the deal the deal structured with the number tranche with credit enhancement the lower tranche the base potential investor will broadened with different level risk preference another indirect way tapping into sme financing via the debt capital market liquidate bank loan asset the market the securitization bank sme loan the capital market will turn provide larger buffer for bank increase the amount loan thus raising the total volume fund supplied smes this assetbacked securitization often called collateralized loan obligation clo merit investor because they can share the monitoring cost with bank from the bank point view they can share the credit risk exposure with debt market investor fostering venture capital market for the equity market fostering venture capital and providing incentivecompatible environment throughout the whole activity cycle venture capitalist are the first priority during the search phase credible information sharing system and network the technology and business assessment industry will play critical role once equity investment put into place the next step for the venture capitalist take active role raising corporate value through cooperation with the management team the company thus appropriate route must provided for the venture capitalist participate the management the portfolio firm through the legal framework the customary practice the market lastly there should viable number exit strategy for the venture capitalist the more diverse exit strategy there are the higher the probability venture capitalist success sum creating and providing favorable environment throughout the entire investment process for venture capitalist from entry exit are the key factor support stable growth the venture capital market cooperation and coordination between public and private sector the government role crucial alleviating sme financing gap the capital market however should noted that the government role necessary but not sufficient condition for building stable source funding through capital market for smes without active participation from the private sector and investor the whole endeavor can not success this sense the government should put more focus identifying specific sector smes that are faced with the most severe financing gap and then construct investorfriendly incentivecompatible and efficient market infrastructure order promote more active participation from the private sector the korean experience venture capital market good example joint effort between public and private sector although the korean government still play large role the venture capital market put forth continuous effort promote more participation from the private sector due deregulation more financial institution are expected participate the market considering the establishment the kfof and the removal constraint investment from bank and insurance company the government trying construct investorfriendly and incentivecompatible market infrastructure rather than directly intervene the market the use private expertise hiring private fund manager for the management the kfof and subfunds will also improve fund performance and raise market standard introduction firm draw their financing from variety source general firm financing source can divided into two group namely the informal sector and the formal sector the informal sector includes internal saving retained earnings and borrowing from family friend and individual money lender the other hand formal sector finance consists loan from institutional lender such bank financing company and saving bank and financing from capital market through issuance security such bond and equity most startup company depend heavily financing from the informal sector firm grows into stable stage development access financing from the formal sector widens starting with loan from institutional lender from the perspective all firm economy only small portion firm have access financing from capital market small and mediumsized enterprise hereafter smes which are the main focus this study consist firm varying widely size and characteristic namely from very small startup firm infant stage development established smes already listed the stock market course the major source financing for smes differ depending their current stage growth and development however agreed that most smes generally experience financing gap even developed country this financing gap often defined the difference between the demand for fund smes and the supply fund occurs because various reason some argue that the fundamental reason behind smes lack access fund can found their peculiar characteristic such information asymmetry and economic uncertainty others argue that smes suffer from financing gap because market imperfection the supply side either the channel financing nonexistent there severe shortage fund that segment the market reality smes face financing gap probably because combination reason originating from both the supply and demand side matter the true underlining cause the fact remains that there significant gap sme financing that give firm ground for the government and public sector fill this financing gap most country including developed one have problem sme financing through capital market which the main focus this study one the fundamental reason behind this lack financing the fact that smes general have relatively higher risk their business compared large corporation moreover financial instrument related smes the capital market are often illiquid partly because the total amount the instrument itself relatively small and because the investor base with matching risk profile the market shallow this sense important construct efficient capital market and the government can play large role constructing the infrastructure necessary for efficient capital market this study introduces the korean experience utilizing capital market sme financing chapter contains general description sme financing tool chapter iii introduces the korean experience sme financing through capital market chapter discus the implication the korean experience sme financing and concludes the study with policy recommendation for sme financing through capital market cid sme financing and measure fill the financing gap the overall sme financing gap particularly prevalent developing country oecd survey report that many nonoecd country have widespread shortage financing for all category smes although smes play important role economic growth and employment most them are denied any access formal financial market the other hand oecd country not report any generalized sme financing gap they reported financing gap primarily equity financing and even then the gap may concentrated certain sector such startup and hightech firm since oecd country have competitive financial market not hard for smes get loan from bank because bank regard sme finance attractive line business fact many bank have developed tool such credit scoring model and other sophisticated technique discriminate between highrisk and lowrisk borrower thus reducing the risk lending smes figure there financing gap where the gap proportion indicate the share country the survey with reply that they have financing gap oecd countriesnonoecd economy gapdebtequity note many case debt oecd country this problem limited subset smes mostly startup and very young firm data based the response oecd and nonoecd economy source oecd sme and entrepreneurship financing survey most country commercial bank are the main source sme financing however heavy reliance bank loan mean longterm financing not desirable for smes bank loan are provided rollover basis with short maturity smes may face failure rollover for the maturing loan when bank have liquidity problem hence the funding source smes need diversified capital market where sme longterm financing available the market welldeveloped figure source financing for eubased smes banksleasingrenting companiespublic institutionssupporting investmentprivate investorsprivate financingcompanies other than bank venture capital companiesotherdkna source eos gallup europe sme access finance flash eurobarometer october upon the request the european commission directorategeneral enterprise and industry smes can issue bond equity the capital market but hard for smes issue bond because they can not find investor interested bond with low credit rating order alleviate this problem structured financing method can used smes also have problem with equity financing their equity are neither liquid nor attractive investor because they are usually not listed exchange the venture capital industry important sme equity financing because specialized this area and technique deal with the risk although most oecd country not have widespread sme financing gap the oecd report say that they have problem innovative sme financing they represent higher risk than traditional smes large firm market failure likely innovative sme financing when compared other sector hence why government program for equity capital are likely directed toward innovative sme equity financing figure oecd country government sme financing program total source oecd the sme financing gap figure nonoecd economy government sme financing program total source oecd the sme financing gap sme financing through government program and the banking sector direct intervention effort the government remedy the financing gap take the form grant tax break and the establishment governmentfunded intermediary specializing smes the most common commercial credit program initiated the government and public sector many country for smes includes among others interest subsidy credit guarantee insurance scheme loan quota and export financing currently for most developing and developed economy the banking sector arguably represents the most important source external financing for smes bank offer wide range short medium and lesser extent long term loan well various supplementary financing instrument such trade credit export financing factoring and discounting since advanced country have competitive financial market bank have developed effective technique deal with sme finance bank those country find sme finance attractive business because they increase their revenue from fee for service rather than from interest loan however many bank emerging market are stateowned and significant share total credit often allocated targeted sector under government program there may also interest rate ceiling that make difficult price credit smes based the risk lending smes addition the banking system under government guarantee because government are reluctant have their bank fail under these circumstance likely that bank operate their loan smes inefficiently although bank financing the most widespread funding source for smes bank financing problem during period high liquidity and credit risk country doe not have enough tool mitigate these risk bank are reluctant lend smes likely that bank will avoid additional lending rollover existing loan smes when these risk are prevalent since they not have financial instrument such credit derivative alleviate these risk bank have choice but reduce lending high risk borrower smes without enough collateral guarantee hence smes may not utilize bank financing recession which ironically when they need the fund the most addition prospective innovative smes ismes may not draw funding from bank regular basis their potential not properly evaluated because ismes usually have negative cash flow untried business model and high risk traditional bank financing limited relevance those company this case risk capital through equity and quasiequity product such mezzanine finance and hybrid product are more useful investor these product can assume high risk but also seek large reward hence there are limitation isme financing through bank and market failure likely isme financing government intervention and deep capital market are absent sme financing through capital market with regard sme financing move away from bank intermediation towards funding the capital market long been considered longterm objective and various effort have been made many country the region successful this approach would address the chronic lack longterm credit available smes this promising move however many hurdle overcome until implemented the first hurdle having adequately developed capital market term depth and liquidity only small group country the region met this prerequisite but their current stage development and relative size vary widely even within the group itself even with sufficient number investor and liquidity the capital market readily available there still exists series hurdle overcome order facilitate smes financing through capital market first smes essence have relatively high credit risk one hand they have high growth potential but also are more vulnerable sudden change the economic and competitive environment second there exists severe information asymmetry this segment enterprise general some degree information asymmetry inevitable and always exists with respect financial industry and market the smes case however extreme smes corporate information often nonexistent come with very high access cost many economy the region third sme financing inherently associated with higher unit cost when compared with that large corporation the relatively smaller size funding well higher information cost lead higher implementation cost per deal when processing finance capital market higher monitoring cost also put additional burden investor once funding closed the market therefore government and policymakers not only have focus the development and growth the capital market itself but also search for mean overcome the obstacle inherent smes order facilitate active sme financing through capital market however the oecd report that lending program currently take the largest part all government program for sme financing most country for both bond and equity market providing access credible corporate information smes important task that will ease information asymmetry start policymakers should search for way utilize the information about smes currently scattered around the banking sector credit guarantee scheme and other existing government program well common commercial credit program once aggregated this collective data base will have higher chance providing more credible information and easier access potential investor the government must take the initiative and play major role this data collection process since building sme information sharing system may not commercially viable the private sector addition credit information individual consumer which already available through the public credit registry andor private credit bureau will also play significant role easing information asymmetry the sme sector the credit assessment smes often heavily depends individual namely the owner andor manager the company this especially common for smaller company this respect the challenge establishing consumer information sharing system must become priority such system not already available the economy with respect the inherently higher credit risk and transaction cost there are several mean combination mean alleviate the problem the case corporate bond issuance pooling group smes may plausible solution lowering credit risk and transaction cost individual company sme exposed high credit risk however once enough smes with various degree credit risk exposure economic cycle are pooled together the basket smes whole may have low enough credit risk attractive debt market investor the problem higher transaction cost will resolved with the sufficient size the deal the deal structured with the number tranche with credit enhancement the lower tranche the base potential investor will broadened with different level risk preference there are many way providing credit enhancement structured debt instrument deal bank insurance company other private financial institution and public credit guarantee company can offer credit line guarantee the lower tranche the deal thus the smes themselves can retain the equity tranche order enhance the credit rating the higher tranche such structured deal generally known collateralized bond obligation cbos the composition portfolio company one the key success factor another indirect way tapping into sme financing via the debt capital market liquidate bank loan asset the market the securitization bank sme loan the capital market will turn provide larger buffer for bank increase the amount their loan thus raising the total volume fund supplied smes this assetbacked securitization often called collateralized loan obligation clo merit investor because they can share the monitoring cost with bank from the bank point view they can share the credit risk exposure with debt market investor for the equity market fostering venture capital and providing incentivecompatible environment throughout the whole activity cycle venture capitalist are the first priority from the perspective venture capitalist identifying company with growth potential important first step during this phase credible information sharing system smoothly functioning infrastructure and network the technology and business assessment industry will play critical role once equity investment put into place the next step for the venture capitalist take active role raising corporate value through cooperation with the management team the company this process realizing corporate potential and upgrading firm value crucial for the success investment thus appropriate route must provided for the venture capitalist participate the management the portfolio firm through the legal and regulatory framework the customary practice the market lastly there should viable number exit strategy for the venture capitalist whether through initial public offering the stock market acquisition strategic investor merger among venture firm proven track record must shown the market the more diverse exit strategy there are the higher the probability venture capitalist success the evidence success accumulates more fund will flow into the market sum creating and providing favorable environment throughout the entire investment process for venture capitalist from entry exit are the key factor support stable growth the venture capital market oecd country have more refined customized government program equity capital financing they are more likely target program region industry stage firm development than nonoecd country figure targeting government program for equity capital programme targeted atexpansion capitalprogrammes

financing gap cid sme financing through the capital market the korean experience smes the korean economy smes are economic sector whose activity have major effect the korean economy term total number enterprise employment rate and export statistic the end smes korea numbered more than million and accounted for all enterprise with hiring smes increasing with each year they accounted for total employment korea export have also steadily increased with smes holding over total korean export percentage valued billion the end table iii smes ratio total number employment and export year number enterprise employment export note indicates rate increase yearoveryear source small and mediumsized business administration smba unit since the asian financial crisis the korean government tried pursue economic growth that led smes rather than large company that have traditionally been main driving force behind korea economic growth the knowledgebased industry grows and seen important industry for the next generation smes contribution the economy are growing addition smes have created relatively stable employment despite large company conservative stance employment after the crisis global competition becomes more fierce the sme playing more prominent role driving further economic growth producing new technology overview sme financing korea though smes play important role the korean economy they often have difficulty securing financing reason for this lack funding include high transaction cost and credit risk well information asymmetry and shortage collateral most korean smes heavily depend bank loan for more than their total funding while bank loan have steadily increased financing from the capital market decreased because smes can hardly acquire investmentgrade credit rating that satisfy investor demand smes use policy funding and credit guarantee program their major financing source usually with the share credit guarantee program around total funding figure iii source financing for korean smes the manufacturing sector unit equity corporate bondsforeign borrowingprivate debt nonbank financialinstitutions policy loan bank source korea federation small and medium business public support for sme financing there are two representative government program that support sme financing credit guarantee scheme and policy loan credit guarantee scheme have been used alleviate credit risk imposed loan smes the credit guarantee program korea began with the establishment the korea credit guarantee fund kodit hereafter order reduce the possibility market failure sme financing due information asymmetry high transaction cost and lack collateral currently there are three credit guarantee agency korea kodit the korea technology credit guarantee fund kibo hereafter and the local credit guarantee foundation lcgf prospective smes can get payment guarantee from these agency which provide them with access bank loan credit guarantee had increased significantly late and early overcome the credit squeeze and economic recession due the asian financial crisis the total outstanding balance credit guarantee amounted trillion won from trillion won this respect seems that credit guarantee were used stimulate sme financing during economic downturn however some credit guarantee overlapped between kodit and kibo which accounted for most about the total outstanding balance credit guarantee korea addition although they are supposed efficiently allocated smes with highgrowth potential but collateral there may excessive supply credit guarantee smes with relatively high credit rating for these reason the korean government doe not tend increase the size credit guarantee indefinitely after technology assessment kibo credit guarantee are channeled into earlystage venture company and innobiz since smes with high credit rating can easily draw loan from bank due the government emphasis the efficient allocation rather than the size credit guarantee the amount recent outstanding balance credit guarantee decreasing figure iii outstanding balance credit guarantee unit trillion krw unit outstanding balance left outstanding balancegdp right source national assembly budget office another government program help sme financing policy loan funded the central and local government these loan are provided smes interest rate lower than the market rate through bank small business corporation sbcs the objective this program are twofold the first promote equipment investment restructuring and commercialization new technology the second assist startup activity most which are hardly financed through private market arrangement because the anticipated return not meet market expectation although the anticipated return are low the program justified the social and economic benefit from the loan there are various government sector that raise fund for sme policy loan the small and medium business administration smba among others the largest funding source for these loan policy loan are allocated smes they meet the requirement for the loan for example loan from the ministry information and communication are only allowed fund for technology commercialization purpose the multimedia communication semiconductor and other industry table iii government sector assistance sme funding small and medium business administration other ministry unit billion won amountshareamountshareamountshare amountshare note other ministry include the ministry information and communication ministry commerce industry and energy ministry labor etc source special committee smes the bank that are able provide policy loan are chosen fair competition however there may several bank that can manage policy loan with the same purpose this case smes choose get their policy loan from bank whose requirement they meet currently the industrial bank korea ibk governmentowned bank the largest channel for providing policy loan ibk bank specializing sme financing whose ratio sme loan total loan higher than since the interest margin policy loan low and all the cost imposed the policy loan are taken bank commercial bank not actively participate policy loan market however ibk actively participates the market due their large customer base their many year expertise dealing with policy loan and the benefit from crossselling even with the low margin and high cost policy loan sme financing through bank bank significantly extended their lending smes after the asian financial crisis such that the total amount sme lending trillion won september more than double that trillion won due the decrease large company demand for bank loan bank competitively extended their lending smes the ratio sme lending total business lending september from the total sale revenue smes positive relationship with the total loan smes the ratio sme loan sme sale revenue increased from notably total loan smes have grown faster than total sale revenue smes the recent growth sme lending mainly due the lowered delinquency ratio sme lending enhanced risk management technique and the spillover effect from decreased household loan figure iii sme financing through bank sme lendingtotal business lending left total lending right total business lending right sme lending right trillion won source financial supervisory service with the increase sme lending bank smes especially small office home office soho can get bank loan easier than before this because bank have developed technique choose smes with low risk however risk management for sme loan stressed ismes especially those the early stage may not benefit from the increase sme lending this because there still uncertainty associated with these company and bank often can not diversify the risk associated with them sme financing through stock and bond market generally speaking smes funding from capital market korea currently not active since the total amount large company and smes funding arkets korea unit lion bilthrough stock and bond market decreased large firm especially did not actively issue stock bond over this same period despite the downward trend large company funding through capital market smes funding size take only the total size the share smes funding through capital market rise from january november but this still small term size table iii sme funding through stock and bond equity large compansmes total corporate bond large company smes total note indicates share out the total fundraising through stock bond market source financial supervisory service won the share smes funding the stock market increased significantly reaching from however this increase mainly accounted for the significant decrease large company funding through the stock market hence there been significant increase the absolute size smes funding through the stock market interestingly the reverse situation occurred the share smes funding out total funding through the stock market decreased from the end over the period from january november although the share sme financing through the stock market recently decreased the absolute size increased significantly from trillion won trillion won smes financing through the stock market peaked recording trillion won but smes stock issue have decreased due the increased credit risk from the venture bubble bursting the end smes have negligible role the korean corporate bond market the size total corporate bond issue decreased from and the share smes financing the bond market only the end although the proportion increased from january november the size still negligible another reason behind the decrease smes financing the bond market the inefficiency trading from the total size bond issue the usual trading unit the bond market billion won but the total size sme bond issue about billion won trader must perform relatively large number trade order have certain amount sme bond because they are issued smaller unit hence there incentive hold sme bond ceteris paribus the supply side investmentgrade smes have not had difficulty recently drawing money from bank since there been competition for lending between bank they can finance low interest rate from bank another reason why smes have difficulty the corporate bond market the inactive highyield bond market most sme bond are highyield bond with high credit risk hence smes financing from the bond market not expected active the future unless there active highyield bond market active utilization the pcbo program background corporate bond were issued heavily before and right after the financial crisis korea and these bond started mature from the second half but only small number large corporation were able raise fund through issuing corporate bond and commercial paper the postcrisis capital market paralyzed because any trust between investor volatile corporate bond market virtually eliminated bank undergoing governmentled restructuring process the time were also hesitant make new loan the corporate sector result concern were raised over the possibility company who were rolling over their debt going bankrupt and creating another financial crisis accordance with the tightening money and capital market the korean government introduced the primary collateralized bond obligation pcbo program order smooth out liquidity constraint and support smes started the pcbo program expanded include venture firm basic scheme pcbo pcbo type assetbacked security with newlyissued corporate bond the underlying asset smes issue new corporate bond and sell them special purpose vehicle spv special purpose company spc underlying asset the spv then issue the cbo based the smes newlyissued corporate bond and sell the cbo investor the market the spv contract with the originator manage own asset credit enhancement provided through various channel including bank and credit guarantee fund the spv issue both senior and junior tranche bond with senior tranche usually aaa grade figure iii basic structure pcbo issuance the process pcbo program follows selection company and underlying asset credit rating and enhancement selection spv trustee and reinforcement liquidity bond redemption the first stage selection company very important because relation credit rating the credit risk the entire portfolio depends the underlying asset that comprise the portfolio second the credit rating based risk default and cash flow the portfolio credit enhancement provided mainly sbc bank credit guarantee fund such kodit and kibo without such credit enhancement the amount senior bond that can issued with aaa rating would limited only small portion the total value the underlying asset usually the total value depending the average credit quality the pool however with credit enhancement this proportion jump substantially include major part over the total value the underlying asset third trustee the spv will reinforce liquidity and supervise cash flow protect the investor finally the process the pcbo scheme over when the issued bond are redeemed pcbos offer more fundraising opportunity smes that have low credit rating fact the distinguishing feature the pcbo program lie facilitating the issuance corporate bond help finance smes because pcbos pool bond with different level risk the overall risk default decrease because pcbos are issued through strict surveillance credit rating agency they are relatively safe and fairly attractive investment furthermore pcbos can offer higher yield than general corporate bond mezzanine tranche investor short pcbos can useful instrument that can resolve the credit mismatch problem that exist between investor and smes thus filling the financing gap smes ariations pcbo the first pcbo program launched sbc sbc pooled billion won worth new corporate bond issued smes credit enhancement provided the korea housing bank the form liquidity facility sbc provided additional enhancement repurchasing the subordinate junior tranche the amount billion won the senior tranche worth billion won sold investor the market figure iii basic scheme first pcbo program sbc july the korean government introduced special guarantee program applicable pcbo issuance and started use credit guarantee fund namely kodit and kibo with credit enhancement the form credit guarantee provided kodit kibo the percentage total value the senior tranche the pcbo deal went thus maximizing funding efficiency the program institutional investor prefer pcbos with credit guarantee from kodit kibo because the credit rating guaranteed bond are more stable than those without guarantee figure iii pcbo program with credit guarantee sbc cooperation with domestic security company led issuance crossborder pcbo korean smes participated the pcbo issuance japan the amount billion yen credit guarantee were provided the industrial bank korea ibk and the japan bank for international cooperation jbic dual spc structure used and the subordinate tranche the cbo issued the domestic spc purchased sbc providing additional credit enhancement the senior tranche the cbo acquired the foreign spc established japan and then distributed investor the japanese market figure iii crossborder pcbo issuance with dual spcs structure current status pcbo korea august the first kodit guaranteed pcbo issued amounting trillion won pooling smes credit rating these company ranged from bbb senior bond higher than grade accounted for the total amount issuance trillion won order stabilize the widening financing gap and pcbos were issued the amount and trillion won respectively but the corporate bond market stabilizes the amount pcbo issuance been decreasing also the ratio pcbo total corporate bond and fallen the early stage people insisted that government intervention could distort the market but the pcbo program contributed the economic rebound many company figure iii total amount pcbo issuance billion won source financial supervisory service figure iii ratio pcbo issuance corporate bond and bsp corporate bond source financial supervisory service according report kodit the pcbo program supplied total trillion won

venture capital korea historical overview venture capital industry korea established the kibo technology advancing capital corporation ktac korea first venture capital company while not actively involved the venture capital market the ktac had start commercializing the research product the korea institute science and technology kist however the role technology became more prominent economy worldwide the early the korean venture capital industry became much more active result the korean government established the korea technology development corporation ktdc meet this growing need this move then followed cooperation between the korean government the international financing corporation the asian development bank and various korean investment company coestablish the korea development investment corporation kdic two year later the korea development bank created the korea technology and finance company ktfc which renamed korea technology and banking ktb later merging into the korea industry leasing company after this initial stage growth the early the korean venture capital industry grew more quickly the mids when the small and medium enterprise startup supporting law and newtechnology business financing supporting law were put into effect may and december respectively from these two piece legislation dichotomy korean venture capital company born small and medium enterprise startup financing company smesfcs established the small and medium enterprise startup supporting law and newtechnology business financing company nbfcs based the newtechnology business financing supporting law venture capital company usually invest company making investment fund and then assuming partnership role over the fund currently the main resource for venture investment fund are the government pension fund financial company and private company the second stage the venture capital industry development began with the aforementioned law and the birth easily accessible market for unlisted stock april this market became the korea association security dealer automated quotation kosdaq which provided venture firm with liquidity for their stock also provided venture capital company with exit strategy from their equity investment the korean government need recovery after the asian financial crisis realized the importance information technology and thus introduced the special measure law for fostering venture business acknowledging the importance venture firm driving economic growth the law provides certified venture firm with various benefit such tax exemption credit guarantee and policy loan fortunately the korean government effort vitalize this sector coincided with the worldwide boom investment venture capital firm increased dramatically until the venture bubble burst new investment venture company through venture capital firm and investment fund amounted more than trillion won the venture capital industry then saw decline investment until the government announced fostering venture company policy december the policy abolished the ceiling performance fee general partner previously and established the korea fund fund kfof when the policy announced new investment totaled billion won since the policy announcement new investment venture capital company and venture investment fund steadily increased reaching more than trillion won for the first time since the venture bubble had burst current status venture investment venture capital company and their fund venture investment consists three stage fundraising investment and exit most investor invest smes directly indirectly through investment fund made venture capital company the case indirect investment venture capital company make venture investment fund and then operates the fund general partner other investor can participate the venture investment fund limited partner with the fund raised the manages the fund and performs the investment when venture investment accomplishes purpose initial public offering ipo the stock market and merger and acquisition are most widely used exit method figure iii structure equity investment smes company cid smesfc cid nbfc angel investment cid individual cid angel fund investor cid bank cid kcgf cid pef fundraising stage investment fund other investor cid government including korea fof cid pension fund cid financial institution sme mentioned earlier the central and local government korea provide the capital for smesfcs fund they are the largest investor smesfcs fundraising contributing the total fundraising while other business entity come second with the total fundraising compared the and europe where pension fund and institutional investor take the largest share total investment venture company the government play larger role the korean venture capital market the lack institutional investor partly due legal restriction bank insurance company and mutual saving bank providing capital venture investment fund bank and insurance company could not provide more than the capital for venture investment fund without the financial supervisory service permission additionally mutual saving bank were prohibited from investing these fund table iii composition investor smesfcs investment fund central local government business institutional investor smesfcs pension fund individual foreigner source the korea venture capital association theory institutional investor such bank and insurance company were able actively provide capital venture fund then soundness the venture capital market would

venture capital market becoming more transparent recovers from deep recession furthermore this alternative market will attract more attention highrisk highreturn investment instrument overall market condition improve korea fund fund the korean government used directly invest venture investment fund before the government fostering venture company drive announced the government worried about diminishing venture capital investment and realized that many venture fund were dissolved from addition the government investment resource were quite decentralized with various government body administering different part the process the government needed stable and unified source venture investment result the korea fund fund kfof established contrast with the previous system where the government directly chose the recipient company well determined the amount fund the fund fund fof system allows fund manager evaluate select and distribute capital number fund figure iii structure fund fund investor investor investor fund fund subfund subfund subfund venture company venture company venture company venture company venture company venture company the fof structure four advantage over the previous system first the scheme meet public interest and operates more efficiently since the resource each government sector are combined and managed experienced manager investment tends more profitable and better managed than when under government control however the kfof not completely independent from government influence since the kfof created under revised special measure law for fostering venture business public fund whose capital raised mainly the government organization with some government tie the kfof should allocate portion asset subfunds for public purpose for example can allocate large portion asset subfunds that focus investment earlystage venture firm that have not attracted private venture capital company second the fund may protect the venture capital market when the economy recession nature venture capital company search for highrisk but highreturn investment opportunity when risk are prevalent the market venture capital firm like most investor will pursue more relatively stable investment this case there herding behavior certain sector with good profit expectation other benefit this fund can instead support other growing sector important for future economic growth therefore the kfof can play role revitalizing the market during time economic contraction third the venture capital market will become more transparent because there are high standard for the selection and management subfunds since the fund will select subfunds with good track record subfunds have incentive efficiently manage their asset fourth the kfof will stable investment source venture firm raising trillion won over five year expected that the kfof will create new venture capital ranging from billion won each year figure iii government sme financing through

and experienced manager will redirect these resource into number fund since private venture investment fund not actively invest earlystage venture firm that have relatively higher risk the kfof will then allocate more resource fund whose investment mainly focus firm than three year old march the kfof already invested total billion won and plan increase investment billion won table iii investment korea fund fund year venture investment fund which the kfof invested volume venture investment which fund the kfof invested bil won investment kfof bil won total source korean small and medium business administration expected that the korea fund fund will continue play important role the venture capital market the kfof will consistently provide fund time economic expansion contraction fact the kfof may even encourage institutional investor participate the venture capital market during recession actively invests and give off positive signal investor this the kfof currently early stage should become reputable selecting subfunds and venture capital company thereby accumulating good track record later their movement may influence other investor decision making process when deciding whether not invest during recession since the government already plan provide funding for the kfof will become stable source fund the venture capital market cid implication from the korean experience and policy recommendation implication from the korean experience sme financing korea heavily dependent bank loan other country the korean government used government program provide bank loan smes via credit guarantee scheme and policy loan both program facilitate smes acquiring bank loan which they can not otherwise get due lack collateral and low credit rating from the korean experience important set target within the sme sector such earlystage company with technology which will benefit from the aforementioned program otherwise smes that not need government support may benefit from the program much effort been put into making sme financing through capital market easy korea except the where the junk bond market developed company with poor credit rating have difficulty issuing corporate bond most country unless the highyield bond market welldeveloped hard find investor highyield bond however company with poor credit rating were able issue corporate bond after the introduction the pcbo program korea pcbos made these instrument attractive investor because the overall risk default decrease when pcbos pool bond with different level risk the korean venture capital industry experienced many challenge after the venture bubble burst however the government continued rehabilitation effort have kept this market steadily growing since before the bubble burst venture capital company invested venture company without strict technology assessment and monitoring standard after experiencing hard time they are currently investing venture company through careful inspection monitoring and evaluation process since venture investment highrisk highreturn investment should made carefully with expertise when the government try strengthen financial support certain venture industry sector such earlystage innovative smes public fund the korea fund fund can used effectively also public fund can act safeguard for the venture capital market during recession the fund wellmanaged can contribute the development venture capital market although the korean government still play large role the venture capital market put forth continuous effort promote growth due deregulation more financial institution are expected participate the venture capital market considering the establishment the kfof and the removal constraint investment from bank and insurance company seems that the government trying construct investorfriendly and incentive compatible market infrastructure rather than directly intervene the market smes with high growth potential especially those hightechnology sector have played important role raising productivity and maintaining competitiveness recent year smes especially innovative earlystage smes can not find the financing they need their brilliant idea will never developed into product matter how great their potential hence the economy will lose potential growth since smes are not knowledgeable about the various financing tool available important build environment where they can easily access capital market building infrastructure for sme financing through capital market such public fund and other financial instrument seems more efficient than directly financing smes policy recommendation the main difficulty removing the financing gap sme financing information asymmetry there were information sharing system financial institution could provide fund smes more efficiently more prospective smes will get fund from financial institution hence would more helpful the long run for government help build information sharing mechanism rather than assisting smes directly policymakers should search for way use information about smes currently scattered around the banking sector credit guarantee scheme other existing government program and common commercial credit program the collective data base would provide potential investor with easilyaccessible and credible information about various smes nevertheless there exist smes such ismes that still can not get fund from financial institution because they have uncertainty naturally associated with their business this case funding supposed supplied through capital market government can help smes secure capital market financing several way although individual company exposed high credit risk once smes with various degree risk exposure are pooled together the basket smes whole may have credit risk low enough attractive debt market investor government may provide credit guarantee program the pooled product and sell the product investor more efficiently government credit guarantee program can used efficiently direct bank loan smes well broaden the range investor capital market however the program should focused smes that have high growth potential but can not find appropriate source funding government should also try construct favorable environment from entry exit for venture capital investment the venture capital industry vulnerable unfavorable economic situation hence there should enough investor raise sufficient fund addition there are various exit channel for venture capitalist they will have more incentive invest early stage venture company with high risk therefore the government should try build constructive environment where the venture capital industry can invest smes with high potential but high risk government may consider legal coordination stimulate venture capital investment sme sector with high potential government should use private resource efficiently one example the public fund fund such korea fund fund and european investment fund eif government invests smes directly there may moral hazard because smes know the government can not withdraw their support for political reason also professional the private sector have more expertise the financial sector because financial product are constantly changing and always developing therefore more efficient use the private sector allocate public fund there should coordination between government program and private funding although the government role important building stable source sme funding effort mitigate the sme financing gap can not successful without active participation the private sector and investor for this reason government continuous effort facilitate more participation from the private sector needed addition the government should focus identifying the specific sector smes that are faced with the most severe financing gap the capital market for example smes with high credit rating can easily get funding from the private sector but they can also use government program that have benefit such low interest rate this the case the resource are not distributed efficiently they can easily get public fund result their high credit rating this sense the government should focus assisting prospective smes that can not easily access fund normally available private financial market reference kang empirical evaluation the government
