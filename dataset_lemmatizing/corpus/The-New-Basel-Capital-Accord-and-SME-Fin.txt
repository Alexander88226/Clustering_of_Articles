industry member that the likely high capital charge would discourage bank from granting loan small and mediumsized enterprise smes thereby triggering shortage finance for this sector thought that this situation would damage the economy since smes which are known the most important source growth and employment creation the already suffer from financing problem these concern were partially assuaged when the basel committee introduced more favourable treatment sme portfolio under pillar based empirical evidence suggesting that smes have lower default correlation than large enterprise this finding turn suggests that the lower the default correlation among smes the fewer the number firm this sector that are affected the same macroeconomic factor and the more the default related idiosyncratic firmspecific risk nevertheless the more risksensitive pricing introduced the internal ratingsbased approach under pillar basel will certainly entail variation capital adequacy depending upon the individual quality the sme indeed poorquality lowrated sme will force the bank hold more regulatory capital compared highquality highly rated sme this situation doe not curtail loan financing for smes

and illustrates how this system work practice finally concludes with the key measure that should taken bank smes and public policymakers improve sme financing the new rating culture the conclusion the study are summarised below the evolution sme financing bank despite the slowdown the overall growth rate bank lending smes the past few year reflecting the weak economic cycle reduced demand and more selective lending bank europe seem see real growth opportunity the sme lending sector parallel although smes have access variety financing source including leasing factoring and trade credit they rely heavily bank financing nevertheless several constraint continue hinder sme financing line with firm natural growth cycle according bank the lack equity the high credit risk the paucity collateral and poor information about the firm constitute the main obstacle granting finance smes other constraint that play role the assessment loan application such poor entrepreneurial capacity business performance and uncertain development prospect are felt equally important their them and today bank financing requires large amount financial and strategic information that ought provided smes reduce the information deficit between lender faced with implementing the requirement basel worldwide and the new capital requirement directive crd the bank are expected require even more and better quality information the new regulatory rule have introduced more stringent requirement counter the growing concern risk the and global level this step doe not imply credit rationing instead requires bank view their business more sophisticated and risksensitive manner consequence smes need understand these regulatory change they will impact their financing condition certain degree not necessarily reducing their credit facility but rendering the whole process more risksensitive and contingent upon the individual quality the borrower the future shape decisionmaking for bank credit bank derive credit rating and thus the probability default associated with the borrower through four stage the new basel capital accord and sme financing iii iii the gathering historical quantitative and qualitative information analysis the individual factor the specification and estimation the model and the determination the rating and the associated probability default the first stage accurate and relevant quantitative and qualitative data are collected the quantitative data mainly extracted from financial statement include performance leverage debt coverage liquidity growth productivity size and other macroeconomic and political factor well detailed and precise business plan the qualitative data include the profile the enterprise the development prospect the industry the reputationexperienceability the entrepreneur and hisher past credit history the ownership and governance structure the management quality account receivable and the availability collateral and guarantee etc these data are traditionally required when smes ask for loan under the current basel regulation the accord with the implementation basel and the transposition the crd into national law from the end bank will ask for even more information this information must clear focused complete more structured and timely the decision grant credit will highly conditional the individual quality the borrower formally the new banking regulation will have more impact the second third and fourth stage deriving rating indeed the information submitted will interpreted using statistical model that extract more decisionrelevant information for rating and probability default this enhances the bank ability identify potential future default crosssubsidisation between highquality and poorquality borrower will longer allowed addition expected that the current trend towards collateralised lending mean mitigate credit risk and allow the calculation recovery rate likely rise practical effect basel and the crd sme financing the new banking capital rule will directly affect three component the cost credit smes follows the administrativeoperational cost resulting from process initiate and manage loan portfolio may increase owing the use more sophisticated require greater investment human resource and infrastructure undertake data riskmanagement tool that rym ayadi collection database maintenance and adequate modelling for example the rule will also have impact the cost risk composed the cost capital which the opportunity cost resulting from the fact that bank need regulatory and risk capital cover loan exposure finally there will effect the risk premium which linked the probability default the borrower the exposure default and the lossgiven default the impact the new banking regulatory rule the cost risk and the risk premium not straightforward since will largely depend the risk characteristic the borrower the more risksensitive pricing introduced the new rule through the internal ratingsbased approach will entail certain variation capital adequacy which ultimately related the individual quality the borrower poorquality borrower will force lender hold more regulatory capital compared with betterquality borrower but this doe not reduce loan financing the role bank and the key success factor for better financing relationship between bank and smes enhanced transparency structured dialogue openness and communication are the cornerstone effective cooperation between bank and smes these principle will ensure successful financing relationship bank should not hesitate play their role and increase transparency with their customer showing them how rating impact their credit term communication should not limited the reason for not granting bank loan withdrawing existing line credit rather should built upon mutual trust between bank and smes bank procedure including individual rating risk assessment and factor for downgrading upgrading credit risk need more transparent smes disclosing the key element the risk assessment process necessary allow loan applicant understand bank decision rejection acceptance improved worsening financing condition etc the meantime explaining the overall detailed riskassessment process should not create extra burden for the bank since the extra cost mobilising additional human resource could passed the smes the new basel capital accord and sme financing notable however that the application different internal rating methodology the foundation versus the advanced internal rating approach will imply different rating for the same quality borrower the disclosure individual rating loan applicant may result competitive disadvantage for those bank that should normally rewarded for their use the most sophisticated internal model rate credit risk and detect potentially bad borrower although the key element disclosed should clearly defined not necessary this stage explicitly regulate the disclosure rating loan applicant nonlegislative code conduct between bank and smes should suffice establish framework that set out the principle for ratingprocess disclosure for banking and sme association the role smes and the practical action they can take improve their financing condition the step that smes need take are obviously expected even greater than bank smes need aware the changing banking environment indeed this awareness will increase their ability identify better financing option when applying for loan from internal ratingsbased bank enterprise need signal creditworthiness providing clear focused complete wellstructured and timely quantitative and qualitative information this information the key running the internal rating system properly company that are wellmanaged adequately leveraged equity ratio and that provide such information will position obtain good rating and consequently better credit condition practice smes must provide timely relevant and precise financial data and demonstrate financial performance needed lender assign yearly rating delayed submission financial and performance data seen warning signal many bank internal rating system usually lead downgrading creditworthiness and therefore price increase loan offer the refusal new loan improve the factor that are considered important the rating process such cashflow stabilisation and generation company accounting control and management method rym ayadi the equity base giving preference retained earnings over distributed profit consolidation the business development strategy strategic thinking among manager term business prospect and marketsectoractivity analysis external communication with stakeholder provision adequate guarantee and collateral attention given some aspect the business that may have been neglected far establishment recovery procedure case distress scenario take more active measure increase equity finance and consider alternative financing source bank such leasing factoring other mean that could offer good response smes the role public policymakers intervene when necessary important continue improving the relationship between bank and smes term better rating culture developing nonlegislative framework that set out the principle define the minimum criterion for rating disclosure moreover since stronger equity base indicator better creditworthiness important ensure greater access equity finance and offer more tax incentive use retained earnings increase the equity base finally the legislative effort combat habitual late payment and thus stabilise cash flow should continue and reinforced introduction widely accepted that the sme sector play central role promoting employment growth and innovation europe therefore very important ensure that financing condition for smes are not overly tight because more stringent capital rule particularly when they already have difficulty accessing finance capital market given their limited size and reputation smes number country have expressed concern about the likely impact that the european version the new basel capital accord basel and the capital requirement directive crd could have their access credit and the related cost that this may entail this context useful start with brief history the treatment sme financing under basel july the basel committee agreed grant loan smes under special and more favourable treatment framework according the current basel and crd proposal sme funding the bank using either the standardised internal ratingsbased irb approach will general given lower capital requirement than loan larger firm the capital saving which may high result from the application reduction mechanism discount factor that corrects the asset risk weight the basis the borrower size allowing this special regime the basel committee finally put end the long and heated debate that had flared particularly across europe after the release the second consultation paper january the firmsize adjustment factor algorithm that modifies the asset correlation reverse proportion the sme size rym ayadi theory the smes concern should have disappeared after they were accorded this preferential regulatory capital treatment practice however the new capital accord introduced very riskselective approach indeed the more risk borrower entail the higher the capital charge will other word sme that good business plan but inadequate equity and volatile cashflows will accrue higher cost credit these concern still have some foundation little known about the immediate implication new regulation when they are first introduced these concern may alleviated however becoming informed about the new regulation likely implication and the way which bank will use ass sme creditworthiness rating system internal this study discus the main characteristic the sme sector europe and provides analysis what basel mean for smes and impact their credit financing condition also present detailed look how bank formulate internal rating system and illustrates how this system work practice finally concludes with the key measure that should taken bank smes and public policymakers improve sme financing the new rating culture some recommendation are also given the course the analysis not only for smes accommodate the new rating culture but also addressed the competent authority ensure that the new rule not jeopardise the sme sector and turn the european economy overview the sme sector europe smes play key role the european economy they are essential source job and they foster innovation and growth therefore crucial ensure that they have access credit several financing source are available them but banking credit traditionally been and will continue the chief source their funding nevertheless smes continue suffer from position weakness when applying for loan european definition sme the european commission began develop definition sme the demand for harmonised definition

relatively unfavourable term there are two type collateral the collateral that involves pledged asset owned the firm these may include account receivable andor inventory referred assetbased lending and the collateral that involve pledging asset owned outside the firm typically asset belonging the firm owner the monitoring receivables and inventory may also produce valuable information about firm future performance well information about the value the collateral which can used part overall relationship that may lead more favourable credit term the future guarantee give the lender general recourse against the asset the principle owner other party issuing the guarantee guarantee similar pledge outside personal collateral but differs two important way first broader claim than the pledge personal collateral since the liability the guarantor not limited any specific asset second guarantee weaker claim than pledge collateral against any given set asset since guarantee doe not involve specific term that prevent these asset from being sold consumed specialised finance company also play key role providing debt financing smes leasing involves lease contract agreement between the owner the asset the lessor and the user the asset the lessee which conveys the user the right use the asset return for number specified payment over the agreed period time leasing simply way the new basel capital accord and sme financing acquiring asset without paying cash taking out loan using other form financing for many smes leasing attractive because free cash that would otherwise tied fixed asset and would not available finance working capital moreover leasing company usually not require collateral hence environment where access capital may difficult owing lack financial visibility and collateral leasing may provide useful complement substitute traditional bank financing factoring involves the purchase discount the account receivable firm third party known factor the case factoring the underlying asset sold the factor which mean that the event the borrower becomes insolvent the underlying asset the factored account receivable not part the bankrupted estate obviously factoring relationship the credit primarily based the quality the underlying account not the quality the borrower financial institution and other finance intermediary often put considerable weight the financial

evaluated using modern creditcoring technique when long credit history pledgeable asset and personal data are available use and structure sme financing europe higher equity share within sme could reduce the risk investment and provide firm with wider access external finance according the european commission among the different external financing source those most frequently used are overdraft bank loan leasing and factoring other source include external investor and subvention nevertheless the majority european smes depend strongly bank financing through bank loan and overdraft the

commission italy portugal spain general overdraft offer shortterm lending that can used very short notice without any notice period all although they are more expensive than bank loan they are often preferred enterprise because their higher flexibility bank typically charge for overdraft when there explicit agreement the threshold this rate could jump even higher when exceeding the agreed amount bank loan have longer maturity and their charge depend the interest rate the environment low interest rate and inflation experienced over the past few year the economic and monetary union emu have brought down the rate for bank loan this mean that smes can obtain medium and longterm bank loan rate that vary between which above the interbank rate term banking relationship several member state

finance implies equally strong need for collateral secure access loan for healthy business the main constraint sme financing bank traditionally smes seem have suffered problem when looking for external financing for them the cost borrowing interest rate and charge important issue despite the steady decline interest rate the euro area during the past few year external finance tends more expensive for smaller firm than for large one the fixed cost lending administrative cost the cost collecting information and the risk premium are not proportional the size the loan see wagenvoort rym ayadi according the ensr survey the respondent were dissatisfied with their bank because they considered the interest rate too high them thought that bank charge were far too high and were dissatisfied with their bank service some expert attribute the high lending cost lack competition among lender certain region which enables them charge interest rate that are excess what the underlying credit risk requires small business are usually dependent small local bank because their local knowledge and experience which turn strengthens the bankfirm relationship and contributes reducing information asymmetry but the other hand this tends create market power allowing possible extraction the surplus from smes illustrate the financing constraint facing smes the result survey

depends the sme size previously noted table equity share vary between and europe france belgium and portugal for example equity financing more prevalent but still represents onethird the total balance sheet this variation primarily result heterogeneous tax law among the member state which may more favourable some country such belgium and favourable others such germany high credit risk when launching new business innovative project the entrepreneur normally better informed about the project risk than those financing this may prevent lender from observing the real nature the borrower influencing the borrower strategic behaviour after the credit released result the lender could voluntarily raise the risk premium loan see annex properly manage risk which translates into higher interest rate for borrower this situation may trigger adverseselection effect that encourages riskier behaviour owing the moral hazard principle which turn enhances the probability default and may encourage credit rationing indeed the borrower may suffer from credit rationing they may not able obtain much credit they want even though they are willing pay the interest rate set their lender meet extra condition ensure their solvability view the upcoming regulatory change for european bank basel and the crd the proper management credit risk will even more important than today hence bank will rely more sophisticated riskmanagement technique and extensive information commonly known that tax regime the and ireland are more favourable the establishment smes but data the average rate equity financing were available government many country are aware the negative effect that credit rationing sme growth and have undertaken initiative address the perceived funding gap their national economy these include investing loan and equity guarantee scheme venture capital trust grant equity investment and other programme the theoretical literature credit rationing result asymmetric information initiated stiglitz wei rym ayadi the borrower derive the probability default and other risk parameter availability adequate collateral bank inclined ask for collateral reduce the loan loss the event default for sme however providing collateral not always easy task especially the type that protects the lender for the amount risk taken this situation may explain why and those smes employing between employee and between employee respectively are not able access bank loan according the ensr survey larger one they face informational opacity small firm are considered more vulnerable than rigorous reporting requirement owing their age and their short credit history indeed unlike larger firm small firm not enter into contract that are publicly visible and widely reported the press contract with their labour force their supplier and their customer are generally kept private addition small business not issue traded security that are continuously priced public market nor they have audited financial statement that can shared with any provider outside finance some familyowned business for example are very reluctant report strategic sometimes considered confidential information such business structure growth opportunity strategic orientation and even ownership structure result small firm are often unable convey their status credible way and have more difficulty building reputation signal their high quality borrower the inherent characteristic and weakness smes term size and limited access capital market feed their informational opacity which may prevent easy access source finance and some case make financial contracting problematic necessary define what kind asset are acceptable collateral from the bank point view the most common form collateral real estate either owned the business privately owned the entrepreneur may also happen that smes assign private personal saving book bank collateral other asset such account receivable inventory fixed asset could serve collateral they fulfil specific condition smes generally lack sufficient collateral yet even collateral available economic slowdown may have negative effect value european commission the new basel capital accord and sme financing according the observatory european smes european commission the availability information basic condition for granting loan small and mediumsized enterprise but the evidence show that bank only receive balance sheet and the profit and loss account from about twothirds their sme client more sophisticated document such budget for the next few year financial plan cashflow forecast information inventory unpaid invoice qualitative information are seldom provided generally the provision all the information required perquisite extend loan overdraft yet some improvement the information flow have been observed comparison with few year ago smes are becoming more proactive and they more readily deliver their financial statement and inform their bank about major development their business nevertheless the information provided smes sophisticated and wellstructured validated compared with the information provided large enterprise small firm usually have small accounting department none all the entrepreneur themselves may lack financial administrative skill are involved daytoday business matter that the document required the bank are often neglected entrepreneur should overcome these weakness before the implementation the new crd europe indeed providing balance sheet and profit and loss account will standard requirement for all enterprise europe order have access banking finance explore the list obstacle smes financing conducted direct interview with banking expert according them the four factor mentioned above are not the only factor that impede the granting loan poor business performance lack entrepreneurial skill and uncertain development prospect are shown equally important the first these poor business performance can indicated low equity ratio insufficient cashflow and liquidity problem the latter two problem can exacerbated late payment well bad credit management some these obstacle are assessed being prevalent many bank are not willing provide extend credit line even the sme can offer enough collateral for some existing client the reduction current credit facility more likely happen than complete withdrawal all facility extended the firm this reduction essentially consequence the bank assessment the risk profile the firm the extension rym ayadi existing credit line smes might become more difficult result the more stringent regulatory condition the new capital requirement rule based the analysis above can concluded that although alternative financing source such leasing factoring and trade credit exist smes rely heavily bank financing but bank financing requires large volume financial and strategic information that ought provided smes reduce the information gap between the borrower and lender the face the new requirement basel globally and the new crd the bank will have reconsider their traditional approach further the new rule introduce stricter requirement counter growing concern about risk the european and global level smes need understand these regulatory change they will have some impact their financing condition not necessarily reducing their credit facility but rendering the whole process more risksensitive and dependent the individual quality the borrower the next section address capital regulation more detail with indepth discussion basel and the crd the basel capital accord the crd and sme financing many question arise when speaking about capital regulation what capital why bank need hold capital conduct their business what the role capital banking how much capital are bank required hold and how capital requirement for bank impact sme financing condition why are bank required hold regulatory capital history shown the grim reality banking industry tainted with worldwide failure and fiasco arising from error risk management thus the objective capital regulation always been very simple reduce the number bank failure sufficient capital must therefore for example not too long ago the oldest merchant bank baring also known the queen bank went bankrupt result the embezzling action single trader based small office singapore and the incapacity the riskmanagement team avoid the worst consequence this story one among several the new basel capital accord and sme financing maintained provide cushion absorb loss that would otherwise cause the failure bank see box box what capital regulatory context the regulatory context capital defined twotiered basis tier capital core capital includes stock issue shareholder equity and disclosed reserve disclosed reserve can the form loanloss reserve set aside cushion future loss and smooth out income volatility tier capital supplementary capital includes perpetual security unrealised gain investment security hybrid capital instrument mandatory convertible longterm subordinated debt with maturity greater than five year and hidden reserve such excess allowance for loss loan and lease the total tier capital limited maximum the total tier capital the proposal the basel committee banking supervision also provided for third tier capital consisting shortterm unsecured subordinated debt that can only used for meeting marketrisk capital requirement source among the risk that bank must manage credit risk fundamentally the most important particularly when bank mostly focus retail and corporate activity including lending small and mediumsized enterprise credit risk the risk loss due the failure the counterparties meet their obligation stated loan contract bank must also manage other type risk such market risk when manages security and bond balance sheet and operational risk when relies heavily information technology and human resource definition market risk the risk loss owing change market price such equity price interest exchange rate operational risk the risk loss resulting from inadequate failed internal process person system from external event consequence bank that manages these risk required hold capital referred capital requirement the capital adequacy ratio limit leverage and provide buffer against unexpected loss the retention sufficient capital decrease the likelihood bank becoming insolvent and reduces the negative impact bank failure through loss absorption and increased public confidence nevertheless high capital rym ayadi adequacy ratio not guarantee the bank soundness particularly the risk being taken are high the bank mismanaged therefore supervisor consider bank capital adequacy the context broader set factor but the bottom line that capital important indicator bank general condition and signal capital market and minimum capital requirement are one the essential supervisory instrument many case higher capital requirement could prove necessary for bank loan higher risk client time recession for example the management credit risk for these type loan may turn out difficult and undoubtedly the primary source bank loss basel and shortcoming the basel capital accord basel the current international framework capital adequacy adopted group central bank and other national supervisory authority working within the basel committee banking supervision bcbs the accord set out detail for measuring capital adequacy and the minimum standard for implementation into the national law the member country december the basel accord two fundamental objective namely strengthen the soundness and the stability the international banking system creating common minimum capital adequacy requirement for internationally active bank set aside capital cushion for the amount risk taken and the bcbs created within the bank international settlement basel the committee brought together bank supervisor from the country belgium canada france germany italy japan luxembourg the netherlands spain sweden switzerland the and the respond the myriad bank failure that undermined financial stability the formal authority rather objective develop broad supervisory standard and promote best practice the expectation that each country will implement the standard the way most appropriate circumstance agreement are developed consensus but decision about which part the agreement implement and how are left each nation regulatory authority see ibid the new basel capital accord and sme financing create level playing field among international bank establishing that the framework should fair and consistent application bank different country the original framework assessed capital mainly relation credit risk and addressed other risk such market risk liquidity risk and operational risk only implicitly effectively loaded all regulatory capital requirement into measure credit risk specifically the capital framework requires bank hold capital known regulatory capital through the combination equity loanloss reserve subordinated debt and some other instrument equal least all the riskweighted asset rwa such loan and security and assetequivalent offbalancesheet exposure such loan commitment standby letter credit and obligation derivative contract their portfolio this defines common measure solvency known the cooke ratio see box the assignment risk weight based the perceived credit quality individual obligor and each offbalancesheet exposure converted equivalent amount asset and then weighted accordingly four broad category capital charge are set the basel accord government exposure with oecd country receive creditrisk capital charge oecd bank and nonoecd government receive capital charge which corresponds risk weight mortgage receive capital charge which corresponds risk weight and other remaining exposure such those other bank and all corporation including smes receive capital charge which corresponds risk

credit conversion factor the different type offbalancesheet asset that they can then treated onbalancesheet item amendment the capital accord incorporate market risk bcbs january rym ayadi requirement include riskbased capital adequacy for market risk the trading book the bank box how calculate minimum capital requirement according the basel capital accord capital adequacy for onbalancesheet

total riskweighted asset which form the denominator the cooke ratio finally the required capital for the bank must equal least the total riskweighted asset the bank portfolio for example unsecured loan nonbank entity requires risk weight table the riskweighted asset therefore minimum capital requirement result rwa rwa source basel served purpose promoting financial stability and providing equitable basis for competition among internationally active bank since inception undoubtedly throughout the numerous turbulent market event during the past decade bank failure such the baring collapse basel provided the needed stability among the new basel capital accord and sme financing these bank strengthening the capital base the international financial system nevertheless spite success basel seen suffer from many shortcoming inadequacy mainly triggered major innovation the banking industry and advance riskmanagement technique discussed below the first limitation basel related the overly simplified approach inherent architecture indeed previously explained the use only four broad credit riskweighting category for capital charge doe not provide enough granularity the measurement distinction different level credit risk embedded banking portfolio especially address the activity the most complex organisation this limited differentiation among degree risk mean that calculated capital ratio are often uninformative and may provide misleading information about bank capital adequacy relative real risk example suppose bank portfolio different quality borrower this bank required hold capital adequacy overall portfolio irregardless the quality borrower which turn mean that better quality investment grade borrower not rewarded bank with better term loan policy better rate and more access loan financing second the most obvious limitation which result the limited differentiation among degree risk the creation incentive for bank engage gaming through regulatory arbitrage provided asset securitisation and some other innovative financial vehicle including credit derivative the general idea behind these new instrument allow bank trade their credit risk exposure order transfer the risk other financial actor the market other word thanks these new instrument bank tend trade exposure for whatever regulatory capital requirement higher than what the market requires example residential mortgage are type asset that bank securitise large volume because they believe the required regulatory capital greater than market economic capital see box consequence asset securitisation the accord minimum capital requirement ineffective tool hold capital against the real risk taken through asset securitisation bank have been able significantly lower their credit riskbased capital requirement without reducing the actual credit risk embedded their banking portfolio third onesizefitsall approach risk management not adequate for bank different level complexity determining minimum capital rendered rym ayadi requirement nor doe provide them with enough incentive improve riskmanagement technique moreover the accord give very little attention creditrisk mitigation despite the rapid expansion credit derivative riskmanagement tool during the past decade the current accord doe not recognise offset the banking book through creditrisk mitigation technique covering collateral guarantee credit derivative and onbalancesheet netting finally with the exception the amendment extend capital adequacy market risk the accord focused primarily creditrisk capital requirement and did not keep pace with banking industry development indeed over the past year bank have extensively used the technological advance information technology improve their riskmanagement far more that cover comprehensive range risk outside credit and market risk technique and function box what economic capital economic capital bank own estimate the capital needed support risktaking activity represents the emerging best practice for measuring and reporting all kind risk across financial organisation called economic because measure risk term economic reality called capital because part the measurement process involves converting risk distribution the amount capital that required support the risk line with the institution target financial strength credit rating economic capital framework allows banking institution drive return equity discipline into individual transaction decision through riskbased pricing riskbased pricing can key competitive differentiator indeed the bank that use riskbased pricing are able cherry pick the most profitable loan through aggressive pricing those not using this technique will accumulate disproportionate share underpriced and higherrisk loan leading global bank that have embraced the economic capital framework include abn amro deutsche bank bank ireland barclays banken and ing according survey industry view undertaken the capital group the bcbs january collateral and guarantee are the most widely used creditrisk mitigation technique the new basel capital accord and sme financing basel new era risk management since the bcbs been engaged revision process the capital accord published the second consultation paper the third consultation paper improved the previous version the accord and june the new basel capital accord basel formally released the application the new accord will gradual from yearend until yearend the committee explicitly stated that the standardised and the irb approach for credit risk and the basic and standardised approach for operational risk remain scheduled for the end the advanced irb approach for credit risk and the advanced measurement approach for operational risk will deferred until the end order provide additional time for supervisor and the industry develop consistent and reliable method implementation the new basel capital accord introduces evolutionary and flexible approach banking supervision which reflects the rapid progress and sophistication banking practice and riskmanagement technique aligning regulation and supervision with these technique the new capital framework not only provides strong incentive for bank continue improving their internal riskmanagement capability but also give the necessary tool supervisor enable them react any emerging matter that occurs and thus reduces the regulatory arbitrage opportunity that the existing rule create indeed basel introduces number new aspect the regulation and supervision bank structured around three mutually reinforcing pillar pillar minimum capital requirement pillar supervisory review and pillar market discipline pillar measuring credit and operational risk for capital requirement the computation the minimum supervisory capital under the first pillar will based the sum the capital requirement originating from credit risk market risk and operational risk see box rym ayadi box the capital ratio under basel regulatory capital riskweighted asset measure revised minimum required capital ratio minimum unchanged credit risk exposure measure revised market risk exposure measure unchanged operational risk exposure explicit measure added the minimum supervisory capital which the main novelty the first pillar are the variety approach for estimating the standardised approach and the irb approach the foundation and the advanced irb approach the standardised approach the risk weight will based rating that provided external credit assessment institution other institution accepted national supervisor such export credit agency the irb approach the rating produced internally bank riskmanagement system include measuring credit risk under the standardised approach the standardised approach the amount capital required unsecured loan private firm now fixed cent could decrease increase cent based the rating issued the socalled external credit assessment institution ecai bank will allowed use the rating more than one ecai but some precise rule will prevent any opportunistic cherrypicking behaviour thus bank will not allowed choose for each customer the rating source assigning the most favourable judgement thereby reducing the total amount regulatory capital the risk category broken down the ecai will correspond different risk weight process known mapping better rating type aaaaa will bring about lower weight the computation riskweighted asset moreover basel different category counterparties nonfinancial firm state bank will receive different set coefficient this summarised table where rating standard and poor are used sample scale the description the standardised and other basel approach been drawn from ayadi resti corporate sovereign bank bank based their country incorporation retail table risk weight the standardised approach aaa aaa bbb bbb bbb from according national supervisor residential mortgage commercial real estate mortgage note rating standard and poor have been used sample scale source ayadi resti woleb detarnu eud tsap rym ayadi quite intuitive although the table may look complex first glance meaning row indicate the different class borrower identified basel corporates sovereign entity bank small firm and individual labelled retail plus some specific facility column report the various rating risk category that can assigned counterparty combining row and column one see that for example loan aaarated nonfinancial company will translate into riskweighted asset and will therefore lead capital requirement other word the unweighted exposure similarly facility offered sovereign state with rating lower than will give rise riskweighted exposure hence requiring capital coverage the face value the last two column warrant some brief clarification first unrated exposure where ecaiissued rating available will usually weighted the present accord this likely apply most european nonfinancial firm although some them will have access better treatment included the retail portfolio explained below second pastdue loan towards the bank where delay more than day occurred any payment will usually weighted like the worstrated class payment delay could signal that the borrower experiencing solvency problem measuring credit risk under the irb approach bank chooses and allowed the national supervisor create own rating system instead depending external agency the capital against each credit exposure will function five basic risk parameter probability default the default probability for borrower over oneyear period also known the expected default frequency starting point the measurement the definition default general the default event arises from the nonpayment principal interest commonly admitted that default occurs payment past due day these type loan are characterised nonperforming loss given default lgd the expected amount loss facility provided the borrower when she default determine lgd the new basel capital accord and sme financing bank must able identify the borrower who defaulted the exposure outstanding the time default and the amount and timing repayment ultimately received addition private information the borrower and the availability collateral could serve develop the lgd estimate exposure default ead the amount the borrower owes the time default the ead the sum the current utilisation expressed percentage the total commitment and the loan equivalent which the additional utilisation percentage the unused commitment remaining maturity the exposure raise the possibility that the original probability default need revised and possibly increased finally there the degree diversification and correlation rho the credit portfolio which the exposure belongs the expected loss simple multiplication pdlgdead conjunction with the maturity estimate the exposure and the diversification coefficient rho these risk parameter are used determine capital for both economic capital and basel regulatory capital model risk weight and thus capital requirement would determined combination bank providing the quantitative input and the supervisor providing the formula the detail for calculating capital charge could vary somewhat according the type exposure sovereign corporate retail etc there are two irb approach the foundation and the advanced the difference between the two that the former would require the bank determine only each loan probability default and the supervisor would provide the other risk input under the latter the bank would determine all the risk parameter internally based estimation and procedure validated the supervisor the choice operating under either the two approach would required meet minimum qualifying criterion based the comprehensiveness and integrity the bank internal capability for assessing the risk input relevant for each approach table present more detail the estimationcomputation the abovementioned risk factor factor lgd meaning probability that the borrower unwilling unable pay loss rate the event default ead exposure default table risk factor included the irb approach computation the foundation approach the must computed over oneyear risk horizon accounting for possible deterioration the borrower creditworthiness the medium long term computation the advanced approach the lgd fixed for all senior unsecured exposure this value must raised for subordinated exposure but can adjusted downwards when some recognised collateral pledged against the loan when the collateral eligible financial instrument the lgd can reduced down based the value the collateral and system regulatory haircut three type nonfinancial collateral are also accepted receivables real estate commercial and residential and other collateral including physical capital but excluding any asset acquired the bank result loan default these nonfinancial collateral may drive the lgd down for receivables and real estate ead computed current exposure plus undrawn irrevocable commitment offbalance sheet exposure will have converted into credit equivalent mean standard creditconversion factor bank will allowed use their own estimate lgds provided that they can persuade supervisor that their model are conceptually sound and consistent with their past experience lgds will have assessed economic sense rather than from mere accounting perspective when measuring recovery rate all relevant factor that may reduce the final economic value the recovered part the exposure must taken into account this includes the discount effect associated with the time elapsed between the emergence the default and the actual recovery but also the various direct and indirect administrative cost associated with collecting the exposure bank will allowed use their own estimate ead provided that they can persuade supervisor that their model are conceptually sound and consistent with their past experience the new basel capital accord and sme financing maturity conventionally set two and half year maturity must computed zerorate financial duration and will capped five year maturity shorter than one year will allowed only very specific case rather high correlation used for loan highlyrated large nonfinancial firm the socalled corporate portfolio this owing the fact that such company are supposed fail mainly because systemic shock that tend hit all obligors the same time the correlation grows lower from the borrower rating worsens this case fact idiosyncratic factor are thought the main driver behind default risk the two extreme value seen above and are scaled down towards and respectively when the borrower turnover than million this because small firm too are supposed affected mainly idiosyncratic risk correlation grow even thinner for highlyrated borrower and for lowrating counterparties the case loan individual and small firm included the retail portfolio for the socalled qualifying revolvingretail exposure mainly credit card and overdraft issued very high interest rate the correlation coefficient for high and lowquality borrower range from finally fixed correlation used the case residential mortgage maturity time maturity the loan correlation correlation between the change the value the asset any two borrower the loan portfolio source ayadi resti rym ayadi measuring operational risk under pillar the new capital requirement will not limited credit risk considerable amount capital will have held against operational risk operational risk defined the risk that flaw bank own system human resource well external event may cause unexpected loss such those related mass litigation fraud natural catastrophe measure operational risk three approach are provided the accord the basic indicator approach the standardised approach and the advanced measurement approach under the basic indicator approach bank are required hold capital cushion against operational risk equal their total gross income measured threeyear moving average this just reflects the fact that larger bank are subject higher amount risk since they are expected have higher gross income under the standardised approach note that this not any way related the standardised approach credit risk the bank gross income split among eight business line corporate finance trading and sale payment and settlement commercial banking agency service retail banking asset management and retail brokerage for the first three line which are supposed more exposed operational risk the coefficient raised symmetrically lowered for the last three line which are thought risky the advanced measurement approach designed more sensitive operational risk and intended for internationally active bank that have significant exposure operational risk seek build bank rapidly developing internal assessment technique and would allow bank use their own method for assessing their exposure long these method are judged supervisor sufficiently comprehensive and systematic see the new basel capital accord and sme financing pillar supervisory review the supervisory review process carried out national authority will play key role under the new accord prompting bank develop refine and make better use riskmeasurement technique this second pillar will translate into four main line action the national regulator will check that the bank riskmanagement system comply with the specification included the first pillar the accord such transparency integrity and consistency the internal rating system evaluate risk that fall under the provision the first pillar but which may imperfectly estimated computation formula for example the correlation and concentration effect included the new accord through set standard value may not appropriate for individual bank ass risk not included under the first pillar the interestrate risk originated the different maturity mix asset and liability and evaluate how the economic cycle could affect the bank future capital adequacy such effect will have estimated though stress test simulating how the bank capital requirement would change recession were occur the prudential supervision process regulator will verify that each bank sound system place ass own capital need and sensible strategy ensure that capital remains adequate the future review and validate such system taking appropriate step whenever not fully satisfactory impose capital requirement above and beyond the regulatory minimum stated the first pillar necessary and act quick and timely manner asking for prompt corrective action prevent the bank capital from falling below the minimum threshold suggested risk profile pillar market discipline the third pillar aim providing the market participant particularly the bank stakeholder with all the relevant information that may help them rym ayadi ass the risk profile bank they will then able discipline bank operating with inadequate capital endowment ineffective riskmanagement system both generally perceived step bank are therefore required release set minimum data both quantitative capital adequacy measure and the main aggregate which capital computation based and qualitative riskassessment methodology and related organisational process bank disclosure the internal rating system provided for distinct portfolio including sme portfolio increase transparency nevertheless the degree transparency and disclosure not precisely defined and there still vast room for manoeuvre more specifically nothing said about disclosing the rating the criterion used for specific borrower the transparency requirement the third pillar not apply any exclusive confidential information that made known the bank competitor could decrease the value the bank reduce competitive advantage forward rule the information required the third pillar must released every six month every year for qualitative data concerning the bank credit policy reporting and management system every quarter for quantitative data capital ratio and related aggregate implementation basel europe the european level the new basel framework provided substantial background revise the proposal for the crd july proposal for updated capital requirement directive published mainly kept the same provision introduced the basel text some variation were introduced however accommodate the european context the new directive adopted the european parliament september although originally required applied internationally active bank the crd will target all credit

pursuit the business credit institution and directive eec march the capital adequacy european commission firm and credit institution investment the new basel capital accord and sme financing the original basel framework gradual implementation from january for the simplest approach and january for the most advanced one the scope application the new directive highly challenging since should appropriate for small mediumsized and large bank well investment firm the ground that they carry out similar activity and risk order smooth the transition the new regulatory framework such large population financial institution varying size and sophistication and make risksensitivity achievable all them the commission introduced some flexible europeanspecific solution the proposed rollout rule for the irb approach will allow credit institution move different business line and exposure class the foundation the advanced irb approach during reasonable timeframe art the revised directive small and mediumsized bank will allowed partial use the irb approach for some exposure combined with continued use the standardised approach for exposure sovereign and financial institution art the revised directive preferential treatment lower capital charge compared with the basel original text will accorded private equity and venture capital investment when they are considered sufficiently diversified annex and annex vii the revised directive covered bond will also given special treatment annex the revised directive small investment firm will exempt from the new operational risk charge

with the national institute for economic and social research prepare the study the request formulated the european council minister meeting barcelona march rym ayadi the study concluded that the rule would have positive impact the new rule europe financial institution corporates and smes for the time being difficult make exhaustive evaluation the effect the new crd but first glance more risksensitive calibration and more obvious linkage between bank own riskmanagement and mitigation technique along with regulatory capital requirement may provide natural incentive for bank implement the most sophisticated tool manage their risk nevertheless important proceed with costbenefit analysis particularly for small and mediumsized bank that may may not have the necessary resource implement such onerous tool moreover these cost are passed consumer and smes their financing condition may deteriorate and this turn would adversely impact their growth how basel and the crd define and treat smes under basel and the crd smes are defined company with annual turnover than million the annual turnover criterion can substituted total asset the discretion the national supervisor within the sme category there additional distinction between corporate and retail smes first smes are treated the corporate asset class when the total annual sale are than million and total exposure bank greater than million discount factor that can reach introduced correct the asset risk weight the basis the borrower size second sme loan below exposure size million can treated the retail

portfolio european commission see art the new crd proposal the firmsize adjustment factor algorithm that modifies the asset correlation reverse proportion the sme size bank considered the retail definition arbitrary rather conservative and unable reflect how they determine retail and corporate exposure boundary this provision encourages bank treat many client possible under the retail approach the new basel capital accord and sme financing first glance obvious that the definition adopted the basel committee different from that the european commission consequence the different focus each had the basel and crd definition only considers the annual turnover and the size the exposure irregardless the number employee the total balance sheet the sme what matter managing the risk the

the crd smes will assessed under the three approach for bank that choose rate their risk exposure under the standardised approach smes that are treated corporate borrower will receive risk weight

weight see annex the crd explained previously the capital charge highquality loan sme rated aaa risk weighted asset multiplied the original leading total other word the unweighted exposure contrast lowquality loan sme will give rise capital charge which the unweighted exposure the new basel capital accord and sme financing the treatment secured loan for smes received particular attention two case when the loan are secured commercial real estate principle they will receive risk weight nevertheless national supervisor will allowed assign reduced risk weight for the market value the mortgagelending value when two supervisory test are fulfilled when the loan are secured mortgage residential property they will receive risk weight any unsecured exposure will have risk weight the treatment loan that are past due for more than day will receive risk weight finally exposure associated with investment venture capital firm and private equity will assigned risk weight for some case national supervisor will apply risk weight and such exposure under the irb approach two alternative are offered bank according whether they use the foundation the advanced irb rate their sme portfolio some difference exist depending upon whether the sme treated corporate retail borrower when sme treated corporate obligor under the foundation irb approach risk weight depends the the lgd and the firm size the lgd for uncollateralised position set and the loan and explicitly subordinated retail exposure are exposure that comply with the criterion laid down art the directive proposal these two test are the loss resulting from commercial realestate lending the market value and the mortgagelending value must not exceed the outstanding loan given year and overall loss resulting from commercial realestate lending must not exceed the outstanding loan given year this subject the discretion competent authority per annex section the crd see annex vii the crd subordinated loan facility that expressly subordinated another facility national discretion supervisor may choose employ wider rym ayadi the level lgd may however reduced depending the collateral eligible financial collateral and receivables and commercial and residential real estate will receive lgd and respectively the formula are given annex under the advanced approach the bank allowed estimate the risk parameter sme exposure further the internal estimate lgd may lead lower capital requirement collateral exists for uncollateralised position the advanced approach may lead higher capital requirement the lgd not limited for ead and maturity the internal estimate may vary across bank and lead higher lower capital charge when sme fulfils the qualifying criterion treated retail exposure bank must provide own estimate the underlying risk component irrespective whether applying the foundation the advanced irb approach the risk weight depends the estimate the lgd and ead this would theoretically lead lowering the capital requirement compared with the riskweight function for corporates under the irb approach any equity exposure subject set consideration outlined below bank using the simple marketbased approach this will entail risk weight for private equity exposure sufficiently diversified portfolio for exchangetraded equity exposure and for other equity exposure these risk weight are much lower than those originally applied the basel text otherwise the other approach the pdlgd approach and internal model approach may trigger more differentiated risk weight depending the risk type these exposure under the original basel framework these risk charge could not lower than for firm with publicly traded equity and for those with private equity for some definition subordination this may include economic subordination such case where the facility unsecured and the bulk the borrower asset are used secure other exposure see annex vii section the crd the new basel capital accord and sme financing longterm investment existing position exemption transitional arrangement may apply and lead risk weight all other investment will imply significantly higher capital charge how doe the

ultimately must provide mechanism that can used determine the economic capital requirement bank and the resulting capital allocation framework must robust enough used for riskadjusted pricing and other strategic purpose figure simplified attempt illustrate the linkage between the essential component sound internal credit risk model see crouhy for comparison the current credit risk model the

study sent qualitative questionnaire credit risk manager compliance and auditing expert some banking institution located throughout europe the question mainly sought more information about the internal rating system used european bank the bank were selected from representative sample within the plus some eastern european country the sample lending institution different geographical area when possible telephone contact made with key person within the bank explain the purpose the research they agreed participate very specific question were posed through email followup telephone interview explore particular issue that either were not well understood not identified the questionnaire credit institution participated geographically distributed follows denmark france portugal

between and their asset the predominant from eight banking risk expert eight the questionnaire reproduced annex the intention the questionnaire obtain information the preparation made bank comply with the provision basel related internal process for managing credit risk the eastern european country included poland the czech republic hungary and the slovak republic many reason could explain the low rate response first some credit manager andor expert were not prepared give any response the internal rating system they used manage credit risk second some did not want disclose aspect their credit riskmanagement method noting this confidential strategic information stating that they would need the agreement their board discus third some are not planning adopt the irb approach for credit and operational risk finally should noted that questionnaire were sent back because the contact person longer working the bank the low rate response doe not however affect the quality the result qualitative survey the new basel capital accord and sme financing sector more than their total asset the majority consider that least their overall sme exposure fulfil the requirement qualified part their retail portfolio they indicated that the historical data they collect are based easily gathered financial information from balancesheet statement and profitandloss account mostly related the factor mentioned above specifically data are gathered with regard the debtcapital structure the ability the sme satisfy credit obligation through the ratio concerning free cashflow earnings before interest and tax the profit and loss structure and the business plan these data are determinant when selecting potential borrower they added that the main qualitative factor taken into account are those related the ownership structure the legal form and the age the enterprise the managerial capability and reputation the entrepreneur owner experience age creditworthiness and hisher share the capital structure obtain this information the respondent bank prefer collect directly from their customer and some case from private external credit bureau public credit registry the majority the respondent mentioned the relevance collateral and guarantee the process credit approval notably when granting medium longterm credit for example when the collateral very liquid such cash some type debt security the pricing the loan lower since the bank able recover loan loss default occurs other collateral such real estate commercial and residential and receivables reduce the risk inherent the loan but necessitate extensive assessment when the borrower default therefore the recovery rate would vary depending the loss given default lgd assigned each loan general collateral allows extension the credit line term volume and duration and some case lower the cost credit particular when the loan pledged account receivable the respondent bank consider that wellmanaged account are far better perceived than those poorly managed credit insurance mentioned few responding bank valuable guarantee account receivable indemnification against default and also case the enterprise operation emerging

serve the construction the final model the relationship between each the ratio and the dependent variable default and their predictive capacity must analysed those factor offering low predictive capacity must excluded from the analysis along with ratio presenting counterintuitive relation with default phase mainly statistical exercise depends greatly the activity sector company their growth cycle and the overall business environment the company when asking the banking expert about the characteristic this selection phase they confirmed that done through statistical analysis individual factor and ratio which are selected according their relevance the decisionmaking procedure phase specification and estimation the model the next stage carry out multivariance analysis assign weighting the model taking into account not only the individual predictive capacity univariance each ratio but also corelationship with other type information other variable are introduced during this phase such the diversification and the granularity the portfolio phase essentially econometric exercise phase obtaining the rating and the associated once the model and weighting the applicable ratio are set the next stage seek systematise the assignment the from the rating obtained through internal statistical model the establishment group percentile that will define the rating company follows the ordering enterprise according their rating for each rating level obtained observing the proportion defaulted and nondefaulted company that obtained that rating the past response bank expert question concerning phase and were very divergent some were advanced the generation process and others were preparing establish the best system corresponding the new basel capital accord and sme financing their business such divergence expected given the effort underway get ready for the new rating process required the basel and crd regulation finally depending the bank financial institution the rating updated every year sometimes every quarter month according some risk manager the same condition are maintained the assigned rating stable condition improve worsen the rating will also improve worsen the respondent bank indicated that the main factor leading credit downgrading are the delayed submission financial data incomplete unstructured unclear financial data worsening the business and financial factor the company such loss market share decreased negative earnings before interest and tax increase balancesheet mismatch longterm commitment versus shortterm liquidity deterioration liquidity increase longterm debt reduced equity ratio recurring overspends poor credit management within the company more late and defaulted payer and rise merchandise dispute with suppliersclients drastic change the ownership structure the firm such the mortality the ownermanager and absence future plan the loss other key person and some macroeconomic factor such increase the political risk where the company located reduction export they also mentioned that they look excessive overdraft behaviour and blocked payment rating system practice rating system are based very objective

exercise the data some company are reported table the quality the firm depends the assigned rating and the correspondent probability default each factor input weighted according degree importance these weight may vary depending the model used the final result improves with the rating and the lower probability default revealing how easy would for the firm obtain financing for example firm the best rating associated with the lowest probability default the highest own capitaldebts liquidity cashflowdebt and cashflowfinancial expense ratio comparison with the other firm the opposite side the table firm the worst rating associated with high probability default this firm low chance obtaining loan with good condition since considered highly risky these result are mainly based the economic and financial data collected either directly through some private credit bureau national credit registry the rating however may also depend other information that may serve alert such past due loan for example the case firm data collected from private credit bureau showed that this company previous default history with other financial institution prior the rating exercise performed riskcalctm the alert resulted downgrade the company question irregardless current economic and financial situation important note that historical data the solvency company can serve effective warning that impact their actual and future financing other situation such the loss key person the firm the loss market share late payment from client low innovation capacity can cause the downgrading the firm these

poorer are the condition for obtaining loan firm would receive loan with very good condition whereas firm would obtain loan with more stringent condition account for the amount risk the bank would taking offer the finance the risk premium the key component the cost credit explained the previous section the risk premium depends three component the probability default the loss given default and the exposure default the estimation given the internal rating which depends the economic and financial situation the borrower and previous solvency history the lgd the estimation the percentage loss over the exposure minus recovered part and associated cost lgd depends the guarantee and collateral provided the borrower which are used calculate the recovery rate during interview with rating expert from international rating agency and with credit risk expert within bank they both mentioned that the use guarantee and collateral are taken into consideration when calculating the recovery rate ead the estimation the amount used the borrower the time when she default ead the sum the amount the loan used and fraction the available loan this fraction depends the type product and the rating the borrower good estimation the risk premium depends greatly the accuracy the client rating process this process will allow their classification according their creditworthiness assigning rating and see figure moreover rating the key element for bank and other financial institution determine the return adjusted risk indeed growing rym ayadi number financial institution have been using riskadjusted performance measure measure their economic capital including the return riskadjusted capital rorac and the riskadjusted return riskadjusted capital rarorac also called riskadjusted return capital raroc raroc the riskadjusted return the difference between financial revenue and financial cost minus the potential expected loss and the administrative cost the riskadjusted capital the economic

majority smes rely loan financing previously shown however another option exists for bank which finance company through equity either directly through venture capital basel and the crd will impact sme financing which may first sight raise some question about the overall consequence these change although the new basel capital rule will certainly impact the credit condition for smes they may not necessarily lead reduction credit supply these entity term the cost credit basel will directly affect three component the cost credit smes first the administrative operational cost resulting from the process originate and manage loan portfolio may increase owing the use more sophisticated risk the new basel capital accord and sme financing management tool that require greater investment infrastructure data collection database maintenance and adequate modelling and human resource second there the cost risk composed the cost capital which the opportunity cost resulting from the fact that bank need regulatory and risk capital cover loan exposure and finally the risk premium which linked the probability default the borrower the exposure default and the loss given default the impact

institution different size see heitfield who explains how bank should choose their own rating philosophy the new basel capital accord and sme financing when adopting the standardised foundation advanced irb approach furthermore different lending procedure and varying risk management expertise will lead diverse outcome throughout the banking industry with betterrated bank able manoeuvre more and lend better rate the whole very likely that bank opting for the moreadvanced rating approach would have competitive advantage when lending smes within the retail bracket indeed these different approach will certainly generate difference capital requirement for different quality sme portfolio favouring some extent the large internationally active bank that are more willing adopt the advanced irb approach and thus benefit from considerable capital discount highly rated smes notably those treated retail the high risksensitivity the irb approach would benefit the investment grade smes and penalise the riskier one say brated borrower and below the latter will expensive for bank adopting the standardised approach the opposite true for highly rated smes the existence and the application sophisticated creditrisk management tool will key element for bank qualify for the advanced irb approach and turn ensure better riskmanagement their credit portfolio including the exposure smes small mediumsized banking institution that have poorer internal riskmanagement system and are unwilling install more sophisticated tool will have adopt the standardised approach which fairly improved version the current capital regulatory rule this doe not lead capital charge for the sme portfolio that are different from the current rule average the capital requirement are kept regardless the rating the borrower but would result deterioration their asset quality since they not have the adequate rating system isolate and reject highrisk borrower the greater risk sensitivity introduced when using the foundation irb implies low capital requirement particular for good quality smes and relatively high capital requirement for poor quality one see figure this not necessarily bad news for smes since medium poorquality borrower better off asking for loan from bank using standardised approach whereas highly rated smes are better off asking for loan from irb bank previously explained traditionally small and mediumsized bank are active locally and are the main supply source external finance rym ayadi smes while they have strong longterm relationship with their client based local

the internal creditrisk system these effect are certainly different while using the standardised the irb approach indeed according study the bank england which sought estimate the extent which bank would downgrade loan recession rating based moody approach lead little any increase capital requirement whereas rating based mertontype model lead increase the strong reactivity the more sophisticated

and higher when the economy experience downturn confirming these conclusion altman investigated the link between probability default and loss given default and the effect procyclicality capital requirement they found that bank that estimate probability default and lossgiven default had reduce their credit portfolio larger extent compared with bank that only estimate and rely supervisory estimate lgds this finding provides clear evidence that the procyclicality the accord more prominent when using the advanced irb approach when the economy downturn the high risksensitivity basel may indirectly exacerbate the deterioration sme financial condition since bank are more likely cut credit because the overall deterioration see catarineurabell merton model structural credit risk model first proposed black and scholes and developed robert merton his seminal paper option pricing well more detailed paper merton had fact anticipated the model earlier this fact along with his active

company very likely deteriorate which typically undermines smes commercial transaction this would create cash imbalance due late payment casting additional doubt smes creditworthiness and consequence would curb lending even more reduced lending would have direct negative effect growth suggesting that some corrective measure should put place avoid exacerbating the cycle against this background when asking banker whether the new basel accord would make lending smes attractive comparison with large company survey the european investment bank wagenvoort showed that roughly one out four banker still find difficult ass the possible impact basel sme lending see figure figure the likely impact basel firm lending become attractive stay equally attractive become more attractive difficult ascertain atthis stagesource wagenvoort small mediumsizedlargearound the banker are the opinion that lending medium and large firm will remain equally attractive under current banking regulation with respect small firm only the respondent think that basel will neutral for smallfirm lending among those who expect basel have impact loan small firm about half think that basel will stimulate lending while the other half anticipates negative impact other word expected that there will bank reducing smallfirm lending but this reduction likely offset other bank that increase recently the mckinsey survey the new basel capital accord and sme financing confirmed that overwhelming majority bank view the sme credit business core element their portfolio and showed their interest increasing term the practical implication for sme lending the new irb approach managing credit risk imply increase work maintain updated and completed database and review the rating and the factor involved the modelling process more often indeed there strong expectation that irb bank will require their client notably smes under corporate and retail portfolio provide more better structured focused and timely data financial statement business plan etc complete their system and allow them produce precise and adequate rating closely aligned their risk profile over time covenant will become standard feature loan contract particular rating leverage and liquidity especially for longterm credit and the trend collateralised lending mean mitigate credit risk will continue the most tangible change are the use more sophisticated statistical design derive the rating and the way this information interpreted when using the most sophisticated statistical technique convert quantitative and qualitative data into rating and probability default which will enhance the ability identify potential future default these change will entail much tighter and more systematic monitoring creditworthiness the borrower and credit risk overall yearly rating will common standard for bank help identify problem loan the monitoring process will based the data submitted yearly the client and any delay submission will serve warning signal and most likely lead downgrading these conclusion were confirmed the majority bank the mckinsey survey european commission the one hand basel revolution term improving risk management through the introduction more risksensitive and more sophisticated tool borrowed from modern finance theory but the other hand may create higher burden for some small enterprise notably the potentially lowrated smes which would need provide wellstructured and timely financial statement keep their bank account straight line with their agreement communicate any change the personnel and capital employed the firm and arrange the successor matter provide adequate guarantee and collateral and manage their credit function very carefully these enterprise could still overcome the burden internally managing their own risk first investing the accountingfinancial function and ensuring they submit rym ayadi accurate and timely information about their financial situation their bank second implementing viable credit management method that could complemented credit insurance monitor their client payment behaviour and therefore avoid bad payment habit coverage the event insolvency this would turn lead more stable cash flow and hence may improve the enterprise creditworthiness bank also have the alternative finance smes the first stage their growth cycle through equity either directly investing private equity venture capital under the basel accord equity position are riskweighted which doe not correctly reflect their underlying risk profile the risk weight assigned these type exposure which are considered highrisk category are noticeably higher under the new basel rule the european commission crd proposal introduced lowerrisk weight such exposure compared with the original text basel but these are still considered higher than the current rule the new treatment may limit the attractiveness this type financing the higher charge imposed directequity financing and bank investment private equity and venture capital business europe will inhibit banking institution from investing such business they are becoming very costly some smes particular those developing new technology hightech smes and relying certain extent private equity and venture capital financing will somewhat affected this treatment indeed developing new technology considered risky business addition the uncertainty expected return where the problem information asymmetry prominent the role bank developing the european private equity and venture capital market essential bank contribute all capital committed evca according survey european venture capital conducted bottazzi almost european firm were financed european venture capitalist these firm mainly belong the hightechnology industry the new basel capital accord and sme financing measure improve sme financing under the new rating culture their business they usually conceive bank have been and will continue the most important source financing for smes europe today bank are facing drastic change the manner indeed recent development such emerging riskmanagement technique financial innovation and other driver linked the high expectation shareholder and regulator have brought new challenge for bank hence they need run their business with the most accurate tool not only meet expectation but also position themselves against fierce competition practice bank must manage the risk which they are exposed very carefully with specific focus credit risk stemming from counterparties varying risk quality the sme sector clearly one which bank are looking expand first because smes have high potential for innovation and flexibility and second because they foster growth parallel the european commission committed creating the best possible environment for smes grow and contribute the realisation the lisbon agenda march the new requirement introduced basel parallel with the crd mirror the trend the financial industry towards more scientific riskmeasurement and management since managing risk the core business financial institution they ought the best possible way hence the new regulation creates higher incentive for bank ass the risk inherent each individual exposure riskier lending will more expensive while safer lending will costly other word for the bank that choose the irb method there will room for crosssubsidisation for these type bank credit decision will based the individual risk quality each borrower and his her capacity repay debt over time for smes this will mean that their rating and probability default are the determinant component for credit decision acceptance rejection and condition they are also going have wider range choice term price and credit condition since smes will not necessarily aware these change important that bank inform them smes will also need expend greater effort and cooperate constructive way the same time the public sector should take action term improving the general framework condition finance together with the rym ayadi market the public sector should act catalyst encourage development the role bank previously shown gap information between borrower and lender are among the root cause financing constraint for smes the establishment longterm relationship based increased transparency key reducing these information asymmetry the new banking regulation also cite increased transparency precondition for effective cooperation between lender and smes bank should not hesitate play their role informing their customer about the change and showing them how rating impact their credit term communication should not limited the reason for not granting bank loan withdrawing existing credit line should built upon mutual trust between bank and smes indeed since rating and associated probability default are becoming the main factor for deciding whether not bank assigns extends line credit smes will need informed therefore bank procedure including individual rating risk assessment and the factor leading downgrading will need more transparent smes our interview with bank they were asked about their plan disclose the rating process and individual rating their client only minority intend disclose the individual rating voluntarily the majority plan inform customer about the main driver the rating decision enable them address the necessary lever leading improved rating and mitigate credit risk obviously variety view emanated from these interview against these different view advisable define minimum criterion the level the transparency required which not prejudicial bank term cost increase competitiveness disclosing and explaining the overall detailed rating process potential client could overburden bank implies mobilising extra human resource the potential client becomes loyal customer the additional cost incurred see boot these conclusion were confirmed the mckinsey survey see european commission the new basel capital accord and sme financing the bank may passed service cost the customer the potential client longer interested shopping around obtain the best rating then these cost will complete loss building this point crucial define the right amount disclosure that both acceptable bank and helpful smes explore this recommendation our survey asked bank how they perceive explicit regulation rating disclosure loan applicant the striking majority respondent were not favour such move since they think this would entail extra regulatory burden this respect they consider that nonlegislative code conduct between bank and smes should suffice establish framework that set out principle the disclosure rating and rating process for banking and sme association strongly believe that better disclosure rating process bank will improve the new rating culture and also the sme bank relationship the rating process therefore important adequately define the principle that are the minimum requirement for governing this relationship for example before the rating process bank need inform smes about the data needed determine the rating the factor affecting the credit decision collateral external rating etc the principle the rating system that will applied those covering the retail versus corporate category and possible way improve the rating better credit management further guarantee more defined business plan etc after the rating process bank need communicate and explain the credit decision acceptance rejection likely change loan condition clear comprehensible written manner when updating the rating generally annual basis bank need inform their client well the adopted crd stipulates that bank are called upon disclose their rating decision writing and comprehensibly smes and other corporate applicant for loan should voluntarily undertaking the sector this regard prove inadequate national legislative measure shall adopted the administrative cost for the bank have appropriate rate the size the loan emphasis added rym ayadi advance provide the necessary input and again provide written comprehensible explanation the change the role smes adopting one the irb approach under the new banking regulation mean that bank have rely extensively quantitative and qualitative information provided smes this information essential for running the internal rating system properly company that are well managed adequately leveraged equity ratio and that provide timely relevant and precise information will position obtain better rating and consequently better credit condition hence crucial that company understand and accommodate the new capital requirement order provide the most relevant data needed lender rate their risk exposure below are the practical action that smes must take improve their rating general step study and understand the bank requirement for granting loan financial advice could seen additional solution make sure all the element are taken into consideration deliver clear complete and timely financial and performance data needed lender assign yearly rating for granting new loan extending existing line credit with better condition indeed delayed submission financial and performance data seen warning signal many bank internal rating system usually lead downgrading and therefore price increase new loan offer the refusal new loan practical action improve the factor that are considered important the rating process specifically make sure that cashflow stabilisation and generation receive priority among these effort since often the key tangible for more detail see the european commission practical guide loan financing for smes the new basel capital accord and sme financing signal with which smes can negotiate their creditworthiness this could done increasing and diversifying the source revenue product and service the customer and supplier base and distribution channel and implementing viable internal external creditmanagement procedure monitor client payment behaviour receivables and therefore avoid bad payment habit late payment habit from client should limited since the late irregular cashingin revenue could easily drag down the rating and limiting the perceived debt capacity the firm may adversely affect company growth addition legislative effort combat such malpractice the late payment directive many company could directly take action for example using credit insurance policy prevent and minimise late payment and default credit insurance could offer complete riskmanagement tool that help management put place the necessary procedure continuously monitor the creditworthiness client and reduce the risk delay and default increase the equity base preferring retained earnings over distributed profit improve the accounting controlling and management method within the company where these need attention entrepreneur should not only give more importance the accounting and financial function within the company but also move towards more active balancesheet asset liability management term reducing the mismatch between longterm commitment versus cash smes should also consider how they manage their liability mean increase competitiveness this respect innovation could serve them very well served bank reduce the overall amount risk through the active management liability consolidate the business development strategy encourage strategic thinking among manager term the business prospect undertake marketsectoractivity analysis and improve external communication with stakeholder renew the attention given some aspect the business that may have been neglected such keeping bank account line with agreement communicating any change the personnel rym ayadi capital employed arrangement for key staff the firm and determining successor put place recovery procedure the event crisis scenario such the loss key person the company the revaluation national currency for company that heavily rely export etc ensure that adequate guarantee and collateral are provided collateral and guarantee help obtain better loan condition previously noted the loan pricing policy mainly influenced rating term structure maturity and collateral smes need able provide adequate collateral the list creditrisk mitigation technique basel and the crd extensive but these ultimately depend the expected recovery rate which related variable the lgd for example the expected recovery rate cash almost while the expected recovery rate for receivables between and advisable for smes look other type collateral such credit insurance which again could offer indemnification for account receivable increase their value when recovery required the case default credit insurance could also serve protection for smes country with high political risk other specific action work more proactively increase equity finance many smes need stronger balance sheet venture capital equity finance and business angel are more readily accessible smes that can show high growth potential consider different financing source although true that the main financing product are provided bank important for smes able compare different financing source judge which more appropriate the risk level the company according growth cycle leasing factoring and other source could offer good response smes willing investigate other financing mean particularly for those that have more difficulty providing wellstructured financial and performance data the basic prerequisite accessing finance through bank the new basel capital accord and sme financing the role public policy improving access finance important aspect fostering entrepreneurship and growth europe many action have been already been taken the european and national level improve access finance the purpose this section not enumerate these action but suggest some improvement enhance the environment for sme financing the postbasel iicrd era there room for continued improvement the relationship between bank and smes the new rating culture thus important establish nonlegislative framework code conduct that set out the principle for defining minimum criterion for rating disclosure access equity finance could also improved equity finance included the highrisk category under basel and the crd bank are likely withdraw from these investment owing the high risk weight assigned them the same time many smes need stronger balance sheet that can translated into higher equity ratio hence the regional national and european level important focus developing european venture capital market and their liquidity and promote the possibility provided business angel and their network since stronger equity base reflection higher creditworthiness important recognise that retained earnings are the best form financing growth and investment national government should review whether their tax law obstruct firm growth taxing retained earnings more than distributed profit legislative effort
