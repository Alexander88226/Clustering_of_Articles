and investor still shun the govtech market for fear long purchase cycle which drain company resource and staff morale but the reality far better than many realise government will always have jump through various bureaucratic hoop way that many private company will not have that only right and proper taxpayer money need spent wisely and the everpresent risk collusion must guarded against but year suboptimal outcome and reliance large vendor who overcharge and struggle innovate have prompted many government department both centrally and locally devote more energy improving the procurement process from onwards the effort francis maude the then minister the cabinet office chief procurement officer bill crothers and head mike bracken helped drive significant step towards demystifying the procurement process there are now greater opportunity for smaller firm not least with the introduction the government digital marketplace gcloud the commitment buy percent public product and service from smes particularly important change which will benefit govtech startup sale cycle today are significantly complicated than even few year ago and while the still operates under and oecd framework and will presumably the foreseeable future this provides plenty leeway make change happen from hmrc the dvla digitallycapable leader have brought score startup into government transform service most department have also brought senior ctos from the private sector who may better equipped understand how benefit from the new capability startup can bring government and the crown commercial service the government procurement agency changing the way government buy product will hopefully build the success gcloud based public conversation with company funding stage ranging from seed series and with aggregate government contract from just million the sale cycle which define proof concept production took between two month and month and have identified three recurring theme that have helped winner

company who have low implementation cost saas should offer trial for free second free trial may make sense the solution very new approach public sector problem accurx company which reduces negative externality from antibiotic through working with clinic there are exception for example implementation cost are high most company charge for more formal pilot due the dearth guidance available standardised pilot value difficult quantify for more information please see httpscivtechatlassiannetwikihow the process worksthe cycle can broken into four section preprocurement work the tendering and award phase iii postacceptance negotiation and delivery scoping the contract and supplier managementthere are four route market when selling government there are two direct sale method which can take the form either freetrial format sale system integrator that existing contract that sits upon framework agreement alternatively company can sell directly government through pilot funded competition these pilot tend smaller contract value and are therefore onerous both buyer and seller during the procurement phase going through framework agreement the fourth and most onerous form sale this necessary procedure for more complex project which require thorough diligence the part the government establish the strongest bidder for these last two route market present detailed procurement roadmap showing that for smaller value contract the process much simpler with none the official journal the european union ojeu restriction only when contract value rise above for local authority and above for central government that ojeu regulation kick and corresponding tendering process requiredgovernment sale cycle long government sale cycle are often described the most challenging barrier entry the govtech market but they can also provide competitive advantage keeping potential competitor who may ready motivated informed out the bidding processlength sale cycle based conversation over the past six month with company between seed and series funding stage who have sold between million the government the case more optimistic the sale cycle which define proof concept production took between two month and month have identified three recurring theme that have helped successful bidder overcome hurdle and succeed the govtech state the govtech marketsystems integrator simple route market system integrator offer sustainable strategy for international expansion regulatory compliance and sale some startup choose sell directly which help them generate scale and achieve public sector delivery credibility the benefit the ensuing ability offer innovative and cuttingedge technology part their proposition government without the need build such tool inhouse city government london venture partnership between the private sector acting and london council aimed codesigning and scalingup cohort smedeveloped service across the capital boroughsframeworks the most common route market framework agreement act preferred supplier list public sector body will often only procure from company who are supplier listed the framework the crown commercial service which the body offering procurement service the public sector many active framework but the most used framework for technologybased company the gcloudgcloud now iteration and boast sme spend ratio which consistently outstrips public sector average acceptance the framework far from guarantee work because there are formal tender for contract which are put company the framework however acceptance big step achieving scale the public sector arena there are recurring application window which new company can apply join the frameworkcompanies should able shorten their sale cycle and become viable contender the govtech market missionism the importance social motivation govtech company should able demonstrate their social value and ideally some quantitative manner the importance social impact been driven the social value act which passed mandate that commissioner think about social environmental and economic benefit before procuring contract higher threshold firesouls ukbased startup help company comply with the social value act finding them social community partner with whom work there room for improvement obstacle still exist mainly around transparency startup feel open competition doesn exist addition the sale process made more difficult inability interact directly with relevant government entity detailed technical rfps are not written those providing the relevant service company should able shorten their sale cycle and become viable contender the govtech market achieve this they will need strategise around regulatory compliance keep mind implementation cost while offering pilot iii find solid partner and prove their social mission state the govtech market conclusionthe already established and worldleading technology sector and also recognised digital superpower but the competition intensifying and over the coming year will see further challenge emerging most recently larger country such the united state canada and france have begun following pioneer like denmark estonia and singapore into the govtech arena the advancement the digital transformation public service which began earnest now entering new phase technological capability improvesthese technological improvement combined with the existing digital talent pool the and the access capital should create golden opportunity for the become the govtech centre the world the stage set for boom which will create large number govtech company and generate great number job the same time this industry will provide better and cheaper public service and will show that the many digital advance recent year have not just made shopping easier helped small metropolitan elite but have also been able help solve real societal problem and bring benefit every segment our country however policymakers from central local government must support govtech the potential dividend both commercial and societal are realised that mean finding way incentivise the adoption new technology within the public sector and proactively thinking about easing the procurement process for startup believe that the next few year will spectacular for govtech and result for the digital economyit also mean helping govtech firm export and ensuring that postbrexit govtech company can continue access talent investment and overseas market the process transformation must not simply see large vendor contract roll over when buying the next generation system and tool the government must have the courage and foresight give startup fair crack the commercial opportunity the public list demonstrates depth the govtech market the list contains many commercially solid earlystage and highgrowth startup that are designing product purposefully built for the public sector the govtech market can and will grow and already quite impressive believe that the next few year will spectacular for govtech and result for the digital economy few country have the kind opportunity that the now the full extent which hope have shown this

set central government starting point looking current spend innovation and forecast the end compounded the growth these investment asset class out giving valuation about million what missing here truly new technology further study will need spend time understanding which emerging technology are transforming the public sector and aim quantify concretely the expected value this could provide and this how much the public sector would compensate for the servicepositive externality private company really consist the value added company whose product enhances citizen experience the archetypal example given here citymapper most the company that studied not have revenue one approach could have been make some assumption around the value added back the economy for time saving happiness gain etc however considered more prudent consider the investment made the public sector and venture capitalist govtech spend taken from figure published ons venture capital investment measured from pwc study into govtech deal for venture capital return looked preqin global summary private equity and venture capital and picked the median rate return actually achieved globally private capital percent compound venture investmentas expand upon our work more will done build bottomup model based industry activity although must clear that the govtech market larger than simply expenditure believe that good base start from the government spend ict this about billion and look bpo expenditure get combined spend billion these number are based tussell data and porge data sourced from actual invoice respectively this therefore considered low estimate the market but believe that prudence establishing base best practice sizing the net new contract opportunity have looked annualised ict bpo expenditure again this conservative when compared the true value the market took the cumulative growth rate from and projected this out chose not adjust for inflation etc because are currently highinflationary period and hence this may overestimate growth figure from here assumed that the government would achieve desired percent ratio procurement from smes and took this expenditure the baseline for net new contract took the sum contract spanning because would incorrect assume that all contract fall for renewal within any one year and therefore deemed appropriate take year proxy contract length and sum over three year truth many the larger contract extend beyond three year and therefore are again erring the side caution hereone important assumption made both the new technology and positive externality calculation the rate return investment innovation taking the riskfree rate return the end november when lot investment announced emerging technology which percent assumed that for any rational investor supply capital nascent market they would expect receive least twice the riskfree rate return compensate for the implicit risk earlystage investment govtech this
