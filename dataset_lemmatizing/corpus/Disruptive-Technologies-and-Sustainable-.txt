sustainable development may help achieve economic growth and reduce inequalitiesledger technology distributed dlts colloquially known blockchain the name suggests are built upon interdependent chain secured block that brings together existing technology like cryptography peertopeer network and consensus protocol filippi and wright depending the level openness and decentralization blockchains can broken down into two type permissioned and permissionless the former involves central authority and are not open for everyone permissionless blockchains contrast have central authority and are collectively managed various node spread across the globe with each node having the same copy the data based prescribed software protocol the decentralized feature make blockchains tamperproof that people can interact transparent and nonrepudiable manner blockchains can deployed public private hybrid actor increasing number corporation and government have applied different type blockchains serve various function cryptocurrency digital identity real property registration the internetofthings iot smart contract traceability mechanism and supply chain management are just few notable blockchainbased application the other hand umbrella term that blend range technique such data analysis machine learning and deep learning and can roughly divided into two type strong and weak the former also known artificial general intelligence there are two other type hybrid blockchains and distributed ledger which are based directed acyclic graph dag ferrarini inclusive economic

optimal institutional design for different context how can clmv country align their sustainable development plan with disruptive technology address these issue the rest this paper proceeds follows section begin identifying some salient contribution disruptive technology economic growth and sustainable development the developing world further point out important ramification that not only highlight how certain institution government have reinvented their governance mode public and private institution but also shed light potentially bigger role disruptive technology can play for most the developing world including clmv country this basis will then address clmvspecific implication contextualizing their political social and economic underpinnings and examining the opportunity and challenge three area financing food safety and supply chain control and the manufacturing sector our observation section lead take one step further map the possible policy strategy that clmv country may leverage section along four dimension legal technical human and institutional section concludes putting disruptive technology into practice layer implication for southeast asiathe farreaching ramification blockchains and have been documented medium literature and political arena recent year while much the focus centered the implication for the developed economy blockchains and will similarly reshape the landscape the developing world due space constraint more closely examine the role disruptive technology for five issue land registry identity trade finance food safety and supply chain management and manufacturing these area are clear relevance the sustainable development the global south discussed below each case demonstrates the potential benefit the developing world and the same time underscore facing policymakersthe challenge fostering business development protecting property rightsa nation economic prosperity often premised modest legal infrastructure protecting property and contract right posner valid property right are the building block for investment productivity and economic growth study indicate that clear and effective delineation property right can not only put owner better position getting credit from bank but also offer incentive for foreign investor more broadly credible and uptodate land administration system can help all party involved government financial institution buyer and seller track the deal correctly appraise the value property for various purpose taxation and reduce transaction cost world bank while this look rather promising not every developing country maintains adequate land registry which make secured transaction more pricey and problematic mendes rampant bribery and corruption add further complexity this context ghana for instance landrelated matter remain the major source dispute accounting for some percent ghanaian court case berryhill this large part due the lack effective land registry study show that traditionally the average time confirm land ownership and realtime land information from the government about one year and one month respectively resolve this problem the ghana government relied bitland the ethereumbased digital invented benben overhaul the system bitland able reduce the abovementioned processing time three month and three day respectively and enhanced transparency can mitigate concern about property fraud and corruption thereby increasing efficiency gain kshetri and voas registry similar initiative can found the rest the developing world like honduras india and georgia oprunenco and akmeemana shin honduras for instance teamed with texasbased startup factom move land registry onto blockchain the underlying purpose rebuild people trust the land administration scheme for decade honduras struggled with land conflict majority land are unregistered and the expansion mining and energy project fueled landrelated violence chandran plus common see government official alter the title for their own interest exchange for bribe maxim the above case have lesson for southeast asia including clmv country per the most recent doing business report issued the world bank for instance cambodia lao and myanmar still use paperbased system keep the majority title deed record their largest business city and lack electronic mean record boundary check plan provide cadastral information world bank while vietnam and lao have begun use electronic database check the right attached property neither cambodia nor myanmar offer such provision moreover transfer title can also involve extra paperwork for the purpose inclusive economic transformation publicity myanmar for instance party the transaction are required part the registration process announce their agreement one the state newspaper allow those with claim the property least two week though typically one month come forward before the registration can finalized overall the index score clmv country term quality property registration are cambodia lao myanmar and vietnam which are all below the average score east asia and the pacific area this suggests that clmv country can tap into the potential disruptive technology upgrading the traditional paperbased land administration system blockchainbased one some industry stakeholder vietnam for instance have suggested blockchain innovative way boost the real property market viet nam news however much remains done before these reform can take place with the political climate and special interest important hurdle improving participation and access disadvantaged group secure and another major impediment sustainable development the lack identity document inclusive trustworthy identification system that ensures individual access right service and the formal economy identified key component the sustainable development goal world bank yet evidence reveals that there were still around billion people lacking official identity document and more than half them lived lowermiddleincome economy desai people without appropriate document may denied access range right and service such finance education health legal redress and social benefit such identification gap can inhibit disadvantaged group from participating social economic and political life this problem can exacerbated the context asylumseekers and refugee where most them are forced leave their home without verifiable document while there individual from obtaining are effort moderate these concern some the approach that are implemented more formalized manner may instead restrict certain legal document disruptive technology appear promising alternative fix this problem beginning for instance the world food programme wfp the launched the building block program using irisscanning technology and blockchains this program helped syrian refugee verify their identity and directly deduct what they spent from the amount aid they received from the wfp bacchi the benefit this program salient transforming paperbased document into blockchainenabled identity can one hand better protect refugee because their identity remain immutable and can not lost destroyed and the other enable the wfp make cash transfer efficient secure and costeffective way undercutting the role middleman while tracking the fund flow wfp jafrey technology noting that blockchains can promote transparency and reduce fraud and corruption charity organization have also applied this disruptive their donation platform the ant love launched ant financial affiliate china alibaba one prime example that empowers people track their donation with view improving the accountability chinese philanthropic organization chen using blockchain technology solving identity issue matter southeast asia region hosting more than million refugee and stateless people and some asylumseekers unhcr significance can best illustrated the rohingya crisis which large number rohingya refugee fled from myanmar bangladesh and malaysia according one source percent rohingya refugee are not possession documentation any kind while another percent hold the socalled white card temporary noncitizenship document deemed invalid the myanmar government rohingya survey with the aid unhcr the bangladesh government set biometric registration help identify the refugee properly considering the ramification their data being controlled centralized authority and the longterm development the rohingya community there been call for the creation rohingya project empower the stateless and financially excluded rohingya people through more secure and transparent blockchain system rohingya survey asean indonesia malaysia the philippine singapore and thailand personal fund rather than bank loan which serve primary source financing tan and although there are relevant data about the clmv this regard all but vietnam are underperforming compared the other asean counterpart term getting credit generally facilitating trade through banking innovationsustainable development rest robust global trading system international trade turn underpinned adequate financing credit and credit insurance provision help exporter and importer different jurisdiction receive payment mitigate risk and expand operation despite significance however trade finance remained major impediment for small and medium enterprise smes engage global trade unlike larger firm smes typically lack financial track record sufficient skill and knowledge and collateral secure credit facility from financial institution such concern are particularly true for smes lowerincome economy who have relatively small banking industry that are not interest global financial institution wto another issue related smes access trade finance asymmetry information crossborder transaction not necessarily the case that financial institution will have information whether the applicant already received financing based the same invoice besides double financing not uncommon see fake invoice these issue have been pervasive part asia adding further complexity trade financea recent survey the asian development bank adb suggests that percent smes request for trade financing were rejected while the rejection rate only percent for multinational enterprise mnes and large company caprio there exception for asean another report reveals that for smes the five original member both private and public sector southeast asia have begun improve sme access bank lending some government like thailand seek help smes provide adequate collateral required for their transaction enacting business collateral act ferrarini others such the philippine and malaysia have introduced program help smes secure credit setting credit volume target for smes mandatory requirement credit guarantee program comprehensive credit information regarding smes adb more recently disruptive technology seems another promising solution streamline finance for instance hsbc and bank america teamed with infocomm development authority singapore improve the letter credit transaction process via blockchain technology suominen likewise thailand group bank launched the thailand blockchain community initiative create blockchainbased platform facilitate the use letter guarantee ono which could help bank reduce overhead and infrastructure cost billion annually through and reduce error and inconsistency suonminen while the clmv have not yet rolled out similar initiative these country may follow suit some point cambodia for instance the national bank cambodia reportedly engaging with tokyobased financial technology startup create blockchainbased payment system offer people secure costeffective method money transfer nikkei this would help this nation remove the impediment better banking service low quality staff atm accessibility and poor digital capacity kotoski stakeholder inclusive economic transformation vietnam banking industry seem keen tap blockchain technology serve massive underbanked population hynes blockchain technology adopted the banking system clmv country can not only support smes but also facilitate labor mobility this region according the international labour organization ilo for instance there are around vietnamese worker now present more than country worldwide creating annual inflow remittance some billion recent year ilo date rebuilding the payment system through blockchains could enable migrant worker move their money back home without the middleman way this may help the mode trade clmv country under the framework the general agreement trade service gat the wto innovating food safety and supply chain management industry the agrifood paramount importance the economy southeast asia for example the agricultural and fishery sector accounted for about percent gdp and percent employment cambodia percent gdp and percent employment thailand and percent gdp and percent employment vietnam oecdfao among all the business actor asean over percent are smes which play critical role the region economic growth and sustainable development acca iqbal and rahman the production distribution and consumption food become globalized against the background trade liberalization recent decade the southeast asian country are not immune from regulatory challenge relation domestic and crossborder issue food safety and quality trade facilitation and supply chain management product standard compliance and market access and food fraud and fair competition nevertheless government and enterprise especially those clmv country may have their disposal limited financial resource technical capacity respond infrastructural support these complex challenge the local regional and global level machine learning algorithm blockchains and among other disruptive technology may able help clmv respond such challenge various way some case technology are being developed and applied both developed and developing country increase farmland management and productivity learning algorithm combined with drone technology efficiently plant and cultivate crop and reduce sanitary and phytosanitary disease machine image classification and animal facial recognition speedily identify unhealthy animal and plant jagannathan other case blockchains have effectively transformed how conventionally think about food safety certification and traceability for instance ibm been collaborating with certain major retailer such walmart which required upstream supplier leafy green comply with new standard september use the cloudbased ibm food trust platform blockchainize the food supply chain wolfson ganne the daytoday management food production and distribution along the global value chain especially for player the developing world and large manual and paperbased and therefore laborintense and timeconsuming endeavor the ibm food trust platform place physical supply chain virtual blockchain connecting all participant globally each represents node upload their data the system and generate transparent traceable immutable and shared record production detail quality specification and origin fact sustainability and fair trade certification and storage logistics information ibm food trust date the use blockchain cut off intermediary and third party facilitates realtime transparency and pinpoint traceability and enables much faster reaction case food safety outbreak thereby considerably reducing the cost transaction and recall well the likelihood and scale damage addition the benefit for better food safety governance importexport and blockchains may also help entity along the supply chain identify inefficiency provide verification and certification and maximize shelf life reduce waste ibm food trust date blockchains can also combined with smart contract system other technique increase efficiency simplify transaction ensure compliance and security and promote trade facilitation across border resulting more inclusive and sustainable agrifood supply chain tripoli and schmidhuber and consumer clmv there been growing demand for leveraging blockchain and technology modernize agrifood production and distribution boost efficiency transparency and competitiveness cambodia for example worked with oxfam use blockchain system called blocrice that help smallscale organic rice farmer preah vihear province traceability smart contract and cashless payment communication oxfam cambodia date such blockchainbased initiative help small farmer and exporter use technology gain negotiating power and get fair price these small player have sell quickly under pressure repay highinterest loan usually provided trader oftentimes are neither protected valid contract nor paid accordingly and who generally lack market power and information necessary for negotiating term and condition especially regarding price with trader and middleman ono recent development vietnam also indicate promising path towards effectively using blockchain and technology increase market value and competitiveness livelihood smes the agrifood sector and sustainable development the country concerned about lagging behind thailand the world agrifood market due high price lower quality and the lack information the deputy director the vietnam agriculture academy stated that vietnam product will encounter difficulty accessing high value chain and market the player not replace their outofdate technology with advanced one vietnamnet bridge this light infinity blockchain lab launched the blockchainbased fruitchain platform which provides realtime production packaging shipping and quality information consumer and trading partner strengthen vietnamese fruit farmer and supplier capacity term supply chain management traceability and transparency standard certification and international competition and sustainable development infinity blockchain lab date similarly tefood recently recognised the food and agriculture organisation the united nation fao partner also implemented blockchainbased farmtotable traceability platform the livestock and fresh produce sector vietnam tefood established pig tracking system along the entire supply chain track pig daily and also worked with local government train over company south vietnam tefood trained twentytwo region vietnam track chicken and million egg daily and since the company engaged national livestock registration and management well tracking mechanism for fruit and vegetable tefood date reinventing service and manufacturing sector via aiwhile there are now numerous application that have been deployed developed country upgrade manufacturing and service the use clmv country remained relatively rare nevertheless technology have equal potential clmv country help transform service and manufacturing sector boost economic growth and provide critical public service similar way according the asean secretariat the application disruptive technology could generate internal growth and external investment and significantly increase productivity resulting additional billion term annual economic impact the region asean optimal use disruptive technology such blockchains and system can empower inclusive economic transformation business including smes and citizen clmv country ensure economic growth and sustainable development for example together with robotics system can applied traditional factory site modernize the labor and experienceintensive production process into smart manufacturing process increasing productivity ensuring quality reducing production cost and preventing harm from strenuous dangerous work while robot have already been used large scale manufacturing since the beginning industrial automation the the development and application aisupported robot expected grow significantly the coming decade the industrial robot market estimated account for billion and around industrial robot were sold both number are predicted increase the near future stankovic the combination technology and robot can also used upgrade work and service various setting such restaurant waste processing site train station and airport farm hospital elderly government agency providing assistance and care aging and disabled population can contribute the overall quality and accessibility social welfare system stankovic automated vehicle and smart transport infrastructure may also increase the potential production logistics and distribution network offering more efficient and sustainable option for business trade and connect while the empirical employment impact and robotic technology yet ascertained various and robotic innovation have been diffused developing country including clmv country through global supply chain and multinational business upgrade local manufacturing and increase product quality stankovic center care and blockchains may provide innovative and inclusive way for individual access service which were previously unreachable and for business trade with each other across existing barrier via new source market information new channel education and employment and new platform financial service wef and adb clmv country blockchains and system may offer new opportunity context where many smes have limited capacity for obtaining fair and efficient manner information financial service business network and global market access for instance while than third the population myanmar and vietnam have bank account with conventional financial institution blockchain poised revolutionize payment and logistics enabling small firm interact trusted basis despite never having met each other empowering smes trade novel way global digital marketplace and therefore unleash world microtransactions wef and adb addition blockchains and system are able bring innovative model for delivering various business and public service most notably health service advanced country such clmv the development and application telemedicine such online portable medical expert system mobile health advisor unmanned drone delivery medical product for rural area adequate example commentator have affirmed that while many country have integrated technology into their healthcare system generate benefit like cost reduction increased access and distributional justice there tremendous potential for system facilitate and revolutionize healthcare provision resourcelacking country wahl for instance while the internet penetration rate clmv not high that most developed country the rapidly growing number smartphones the necessary basic increasing the supply quality data network electronic device which can support the provision health service resourcepoor scenario with adequate investment cloud computing digitizing health information aisupported expert system may deployed clmv and other developed country many way some circumstance expert system can help communicate health information patient for application infrastructure and when personal interaction are infeasible other case expert system can used assist physician some rural area community health worker diagnosing and making treatment decision and even more exceptional condition usually poor community expert system may used act lieu human doctor when they are nonexistent wahl broader setting technology are being exploited predict model and slow the spread disease epidemic situation around the world wahl manila for example researcher who have studied epidemic pattern dengue fever recently leveraged machinelearningbased system identify weather and landuse factor pertinent the transmission this disease wahl with doubt such technology can equally beneficial clmv countriesinclusive economic transformation aligning disruptive technology with sustainable development policy strategy the age megaregionalism thus far this paper discussed the development and deployment dlts and technology for the provision public and private good and service this section take one step further discus possible policy strategy along the regulatory institutional technical and human dimension elucidate the potential disruptive technology bridge the development gap industrialized nation amid the trend megaregionalism there are hurdle facing policymakers clmv country explained below some these challenge such the lack adequate physical infrastructure and human capital are not new yet clmv can face even heavier stress catch with the developed world because the fastgrowing disruptive technology other emerging issue like mapping out adaptive and anticipatory regulatory approach response the dynamic the digital world and taming and blockchains through transparency accountability and fairness have become even more challenging task facing clmv identify major challenge and potential policy option below improving infrastructure and human capital capture datadriven opportunitiesas explained disruptive technology can cause fundamental change throughout the world including developing country but how developing country can benefit from these new change bridge the development gap between have and have nots within and between country large part premised infrastructure demonstrated the digital adoption index dai issued the world bank clmv country lag way behind their asean counterpart singapore term digitalization while singapore sits the top the ranking vietnam cambodia lao and myanmar rank and respectively this reflects part the shortfall internet access and electricity these country despite year effort via initiative like easean for instance large number inhabitant myanmar lao and cambodia remain offline the number internet user per the population about for the developed world the end contrast these three country had user density somewhere between itu date shortfall electricity another critical issue study show that only half the inhabitant cambodia and myanmar had access electricity wef and adb seems unlikely that population without access the internet and electricity would readily take using blockchain let alone relevant application meaningful way example point myanmar lao and cambodia have not joined the asean single window platform facilitate trade and expedite electronic exchange custom data that may harness the potential blockchain adding more complexity the operational cost for storage bandwidth computing power and encryption technology involved blockchain and mature overtime kasireddy clmv should hence continue work the improvement infrastructure offering stable and quality supply connectivity and electricity affordable cost which would course require substantial fiscal resource this would help mitigate the digital divide major challenge further economic integration the digital realm the age disruptive technology wto another related hurdle for clmv grasp the opportunity presented disruptive technology the lack skilled manpower catch with the shifting datadriven economy vietnam for instance the shortage information technology personnel for the year alone projected some staff and the number will increase employee tuan the quality manpower yet another problem evidenced the average productivity lagging behind many asean counterpart like singapore and malaysia vietnamnet bridge emerging big data and blockchain well their crosssectoral implication put great pressure clmv improve computer science education and training close critical gap skill set for job hightech industry and encourage interdisciplinary collaboration from trade law perspective this may also call upon clmv revisit their existing commitment mutual recognition agreement and visa and work permit process effectively facilitate crossborder labor mobility within outside the multilateral regional bilateral economic arrangement response market demand engaging technologically informed and adaptive regulatory reform diffusion disruptive technology depends not only physical infrastructure and human capital but also adequate regulatory framework yet been daunting task for government craft optimal regulatory framework when come technological innovation while protecting public interest and preventing market failure certainly imperative how achieve this without deterring innovation mean easy for one the question when and how regulate can problematic because they turn the underlying risk public perception legal tradition common law civil law and various economic social and political underpinnings black and baldwin for another the pacing problem situation where technological progress always outpaces legal development make innovation moving target catch with marchant and wallach heavyhanded regulatory approach adopted too soon could reduce investment research and development activity below some optimal level thereby stifling innovation cost government failure mismatch between adequate regulation and the corresponding problem can significant and sometimes more expensive than other policy option breyer all these problem become particularly prominent the context disruptive technology that evolve and revolutionize rapidly and exponentially high uncertainty about their risk benefit and future direction and wide range application across sector and national border challenge can even more acute for developing country including clmv due their relative low regulatory and policy capacity compared their developed counterpart unfold the potential disruptive technology and avoid the immense cost government failure picking the wrong side while the world resetting itself clmv need rethink the traditional linear approach taking into account the unique nature disruptive technology fastmoving crosssector and crossborder flexible experimental regulatory model based the notion inclusiveness and multistakeholderism would seem promising option wef and adb this would call for principlebased approach ensure regulatory decision can more openended subject new knowledge and input from stakeholder both public and private sector this end clmv policymakers should tap into big data map out whether when and how govern new challenge the emergence the socalled sandbox approach the banking and financial sector prime example alternative governance mode the rationale underlying the sandbox approach facilitate innovation creating safe space for business test new product and service without immediately fulfilling the licensing requirement under the existing framework fca asean country like singapore malaysia indonesia and thailand have set sandbox scheme for fintech the comprehensive and progressive agreement for transpacific partnership cptpp which vietnam party for instance annex set forth provision facilitate the recognition professional qualification licensing registration also vietnam undertaken under the cptpp allow the entry contractual service supplier sector like computer and related service engineering service and integrated engineering service inclusive economic transformation while this sandbox approach seems promising there are hurdle facing clmv too although the requirement the sandbox approach can vary different nation innovativeness often prerequisite for firm benefit from the licensing exemption bromberg determining whether proposed service product innovative enough often involves certain judgment call that require relevant expertise and skill set facilitate diffusion disruptive technology and their application without creating unnecessary obstacle international trade and investment crucial for clmv draw lesson from other nation not only crafting new legal framework but also the way implementation practice regulatory cooperation bilateral regional multilateral much warranted avoid negative ramification arbitrary exercise discretionary power asean financial innovation network such example that promotes collaboration and facilitates development and experimentation with innovative financial product and service the region nevertheless promising sandbox framework the asean level may challenge may arise from the diverse regulatory landscape different member state and thus wellinformed evaluation required for example some country the region have welldesigned property law and contract law system while others have serious problem law enforcement and independent judicial review some have stringent privacy protection regime while others are underdeveloped this regardsystems and international cooperation also play role least two other aspect first could help establish common standard and moderate ramification the lack interoperability across country existing blockchain platform for instance not speak one another which pose challenge for widescale deployment blockchains wto ganne the second aspect beyond the purely technical aspect interoperability bringing together policymakers shaping mutual understanding various value attached these disruptive technology different jurisdiction this broader implication from the perspective international economic law been debated for instance whether and what extent robot should gain legal personhood will robot still considered product service for the purpose the wto could consider them service provider that are subject certain educational and professional qualification requirement and thus trade negotiation even though they may not neatly square into the existing framework mode notion based natural person other issue such likeness can equally even more problematic when come evaluating different treatment given robot and human service provider addressing all these question would require policymakers including those from clmv work together and explore the common value shared diverse group stakeholder with different cultural background considering the vast diversity the region term technological development economic structure legal system and position the global value chain different nuanced pattern disruptive technology application may call for different policy response having said that any unilateral regulatory intervention without regard the crossborder nature disruptive technology and their spillover can create more problem than they solve this region for clmv reap the benefit disruptive technology there are many other hurdle lying ahead for instance cryptocurrencies may undermine already fragile antimoney laundering and terrorism financing scheme kotoski market concentration and anticompetitive conduct due the nature the digital market require clmv government reconfigure their competition law and policy wto transparency brought blockchain can influence the political will engage deeper reform this what happened with honduras land registration reform fatcom blockchain project socalled stalled because political issue kirby moreover the dearth adequate privacy and data protection law meet requirement set out the apec privacy framework asean framework personal data protection the general data protection regulation for instance can not only raise human right concern but also inhibit crossborder data flow these country thereby reducing incentive for foreign investment hightech industry greenleaf these and many other factor are all important underpinnings the diffusion disruptive technology the long runcourts various setting state loomis can problematic detect and address the bias effectively because legal and technical constraint these system can operate legal black box they are often treated proprietary technology and are thus protected trade secret otherwise even more problematic the technical black box the outcome produced certain sophisticated based artificial neural network are barely explainable even their creator liu unpublished ensuring adequate accountability transparency and fairness like other developing country clmv are most likely recipient that borrow disruptive technology from the more technologically advanced world promising these innovation may there are challenge ahead the process transplanting new business model system into clmv these challenge are and large centered the notion transparency accountability and fairness while disruptive technology reinvent business model making conventional machine and process even smarter the cost
