data fully available least public database especially case nonlisted company taken private equity lack data private company creates also potential problem choosing correct sample comparable firm publicly listed company often chosen availability data typically relatively large company whereas private equity investment usually smaller size therefore remains unclear whether finding study generalized provide insight often smaller buyout company return private equity investor limited partner empirical study show historically speaking net return limited partner private equity fund higher diversified stock portfolio valueweighted stock market index true even deduction cost considerable fee however spread return large due leverage private equity investor automatically achieve higher return average handinhand greater risk higher riskadjusted return caused undervaluation moment investment indicator company improved performance unless higher return caused tax benefit associated leverage adjusted disadvantageous factor reduced liquidity higher risk compared benchmark appears essentially outperformance limited partner general partner charge substantial fee metrick yasuda
