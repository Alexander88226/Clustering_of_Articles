fintech arnoud boot introduction the financial service industry undergoing massive change information technology key this process change the recent focus fintech basically new technologyoriented player entering the financial service industry possibly the most visible manifestation the impact that information technology the industry this chapter will focus the structure the banking industry going forward will try draw lesson from the older literature scale and scope economy banking and relate these insight the modern world information technology and fintech fintech widely seen disruptive force the banking industry new information technologyfocused entrant including large data and platformoriented firm like google and apple are seen potential threat the position bank while bank appear still the lead information technology and fintech are changing the competitive landscape empowering customer one the effect customer have easier access multiple provider and potentially more transparent product offering the traditional bankcustomer relationship risk the digitalization the industry also changing the operational process bank massive transformation bank the way while the impact information technology the operation bank and the customer interface relatively recent phenomenon information technology been changing the word finance already for some time the impact the proliferation information technology financial market perhaps been most noticeable deepened financial market and via change the business model bank strengthened the link between market and financial institution the latter run for example via securitization and other form asset sale that remove asset from bank balance sheet allowing those asset become tradeable this intertwines market and institution and have seen the financial crisis could amplify the impact financial market condition bank see shin apart from providing all kind benefit diversification liquidity more negative view that the enhanced opportunity trade asset invite excessive changeability and possibly more opportunistic behavior bank that could undermine their stability the linkage the financial market facilitate proliferation transactionoriented banking trading and financial market activity possibly the expense more traditional relationship banking activity boot and ratnovski before delving into fintech development will discus the implication this more fluid and transactionoriented world finance see section see the contribution boot and thakor the oxford handbook banking edition forthcoming this context also the ownership structure bank might important for example the traditional partnership model investment banking may have contained opportunistic behavior that partner had their personal wealth tied the business and could not easily leave and liquefy their ownership claim sense the marketability their own involvement human capital severely constrained which may have countered the fluidity banking activity itself also here information technology and the deepening financial market may have been instrumental creating more fluid ownership structure based stock market listing will discus these development and subsequently address the more recent fintech phenomenon what the economist called the fintech revolution trying ass the potential impact fintech the structure bank will seek draw insight from the extensive literature scale and scope economy banking will argue that only limited insight are available while recent empirical work identifies some scale economy face difficulty identifying true scope advantage what particularly missing the literature the impact that information technology may have the industry information technology and fintech consideration have not been part this literature the organization this chapter follows section focus the impact information technology and the deepening financial market the transaction versus relationshiporientation bank section discus ownership structure issue scale and scope economy are discussed section section focus the impact fintech the banking industry particular focus there how fintech might disaggregate the value chain and may put the customer interface risk for bank and what extent bank will hookup fin tech player andor become fintech player themselves concluding observation are made section arguably not much contested observation that bank have become more transaction oriented the economist put over twenty year ago the context the experience security firm perhaps the worst feature the which subsequently returned haunt the security firm the abandonment most them the old relationship with their customer the aim deal any deal remembers one manager who prefers not named the economist april special section survey wall street information technology and transaction orientation while this quote made over twenty year ago interesting note that when financial market prosper they appear push financial institution away from their relationship banking franchise the consultancy bcg put explaining the surge transaction oriented activity amid surging economy low loan loss and readily available cheap capital did not really matter the fintech revolution the economist may this section follows part boot see also boot and ratnovski whether bank had top bottomquartile capability all that mattered were workable sale process bcg the modern world information technology and deepening financial market clearly induced bank become more heavily exposed the financial market doing transaction become easier and hence marketlinked activity like securitization and proprietary trading have become more prominent more fundamental level what this point the scalability transactionoriented activity subject available capital bank can quickly increase their exposure those activity relationshipbased activity are more constrained they depend employing human capital and engaging with potential client thus transactionoriented banking not only more susceptible sudden spur momentum but also the feasibility financial institution quickly mobilize resource and give such opportunity seems greater than for relationship banking activity the competitive dynamic play important role when financial market are exuberant bank that abstain from for example trading activity one the financial market activity that can expanded quickly may look profitable and might feel left behind the earnings game other bank this precisely what happened with ubs one the bigger victim the crisis internal investigation following massive loss subprime investment discovered that troublesome subprime investment were undertaken following pressure from external consultant that pointed fixed income activity that were lagging those competitor fill this gap ubs advised close key product gap which explicitly referred subprime investment vehicle ubs page more subtle concern that opportunistic trading may undermine relationship banking boot and ratnovski show that bank may allocate too much capital transactionoriented activity and doing have insufficient riskbearing capacity for relationship banking bank may also underestimate the risk involved and implicitly subsidize the transactionoriented activity the expense relationshiporiented activity more specifically insufficiently recognizing divergent risk profile proprietary trading might granted artificially low cost capital other mainly relationshiporiented activity are then implicitly taxed and appear profitable than they really are thus proprietary trading could undermine bank competitive edge relationship banking business related mechanism that such transactionoriented activity initially appear very profitable long the boom last and that during that time those department and the individual involved them will gain power what this might that power shift from people engaged more prudent relationship banking activity those engaged transaction activity this may affect the overall balance power institution via promotion the corporate hierarchy and may tilt power away from relationship banking franchise consequence relationship banking may suffer these power consideration deserve more attention research much the focus been remuneration contract while incentive running via promotion opportunity and power might arguably important even more important direct link could also exist with the pricing risk financial market risk booming time are underpriced underestimated this would further push bank such euphoric time toward transaction like trading activity boot the extensive work the field financial intermediation point the distinct value relationship banking importantly however much this research predates development information technology that have facilitated more distant banking operation while continue believe the importance relationship banking information technology particularly the way information can obtained from data analysis big data and for example the proliferation interaction via social medium will have impact how relationship banking can add value particular payment system and distribution channel are changing rapidly and this will affect the business banking and the competitive positioning bank distinct financial institution will come back this when discus fintech and particularly the disaggregation the value chain that may entail ownership structure partnership and stability stated the deepening financial market and information technology general may have caused excessive changeability and tradability the industry pointed the opportunistic behavior that this may unleash important link can made the ownership structure and stability investment bank versus commercial relationshiporiented bank traditional relationshiporiented bank seem incentivized build institutional franchise value individual are part the organization entity and the continuity the organization and lasting relationship with clientele define value the value can not transferred and can not readily assigned individual star other word the value created integral part the organizational entity franchise value and not portable part individual investment bank the other hand particularly their trading and transaction activity seem more based the individual star concept with high marketability individual consequence institutional franchise value built individual franchise value dominate this the only difference relationship banking with franchise value investment banking keeley analysis would suggest that investment bank would take lot risk while the franchise value commercial bank would help curtail risk taking historically investment bank could contain the marketability issue and the potential problem associated with the potential lack institutional franchise value having partnership the partnership structure two dimension that could help jointly resolve the marketability problem and related opportunistic risky behavior and star phenomenon partnership mean that banker have their personal wealth tied the business they own the equity claim the business the partnership structure such that the equity not optimally marketable activity investment bank have relationshipbased component well more recently though trading dominates which not relationship based but solely transactional recent time trader appear have gained power within investment bank more recent leader goldman sachs came from the trading side any case not see the distinction between commercial banking and investment banking absolute dichotomy the latter implies that star can not take their money out only reduced value implicitly this mean that nonportable franchise value created and this value transferred over time future partner additional argument partnership ensured relatively high capitalization which directly augmented the franchise value risk interesting example exist where institution have made change that have destroyed this structure for example with gopublic transformation converting partnership listed shareholder owned company the current partner effectively expropriate all franchise value that been built over time even worse once the partnership gone star may longer under control their financial interest longer tied the firm this may elevate risk and reduce stability commercial banking the enhanced marketability and with transaction focus may have opened the door for some type star phenomenon well sense may have brought commercial banking closer investment banking and similar issue might play this may have induced opportunistic behavior particularly because partnership structure commercial banking never have been very common any case partnership among major financial institution are rare the important point however that via enhancing marketability the demise partnership could have undermined stability caveat all this doe not mean that there might not distinct benefit associated with these development well what have stressed the potential downside are however prepared conclude that the financial crisis made look more favorably alternative ownership structure like mutuals cooperative bank credit agricole france and indeed partnership also having diversity ownership structure might have become more appreciated after all one the problem the increasing intertwined nature bank and market that might make bank look more alike and that could induce systemic risk diversity ownership structure might help counter this question also what impact fintech will have ownership structure and the structure the industry general following discussion the literature scale and scope economy will turn these question morrison and wilhelm analyze the decision major investment bank public investment bank were initially organized partnership the opacity partnership and illiquidity their share allowed for successful mentoring and training tacit noncontractible human skill such building relationship negotiating deal and advising client they argue that technology necessitated heavy investment and that that necessitated investment bank public potentially confirming this that wholesaleoriented investment bank such morgan stanley for which tacit human capital more important than technology went public later than retailoriented investment bank such merrill lynch schellhorn emphasizes the unlimited liability partner stabilizing factor and recommends private partnership form for investment bank see also berger publicly listed firm sometimes use restricted stock create some fixity the ownership structure and ensure continued loyalty key personnel scale and scope economy banking what drive financial player choosing their scale and scope operation this question important because the size and particularly the complexity financial institution concern regulator and supervisor more recently the question what impact fintech and information technology will have bank business model and the scale and scope bank research scale and scope economy remains rather inconclusive the word richardson smith and walter indeed the recent study mirror the finding some year earlier there predominance evidence either for against economy scale the financial sector nevertheless the literature scale and scope come some insight this section will discus the extant literature subsequently will seek use these insight when discussing fintech development casual observation real world banking suggests that bank like combine many different activity this distinguishes bank from many their competitor nonbanking financial institution like mutual fund and finance company the latter often choose specialize and therefore are often more transparent bank generally choose diversify their activity although few would readily deny that some degree diversification necessary bank seem engage very broad variety activity source scale and scope economy particularly continental europe the size and scope bank typically enormous one explanation could that implicit explicit government guarantee and toobigtofail tbtf concern give artificial competitive advantage size see feldman universal bank while often not particularly efficient might that way have sufficient protected revenue compete with more focused player scale and scope economy are often cited rationale for why financial institution tend growth size and complexity scope over time but are scale and scope economy truly present source scale and scope economy include see boot and walter informationtechnology related economy reputation and marketingbrand name related benefit iii financial innovation related economy and diversification benefit information technology related economy particularly refer back office efficiency and distributionnetwork related benefit transaction processing offer distinct scale economy and information technology development facilitate increasing array financial product and service offered through the same distribution network and thus allow for cross selling reputation and brand namemarketing related economy may present the joint marketing product customer brand image partially marketing related but also indeed this one the complaint more focused investment banking institution universal bank can leverage their balance sheet read cross subsidize secure investment banking business financial time march page bank face fresh scrutiny lending some evidence exist tbtf benefit jagtiani and brewer find that investor are willing pay premium when acquisition would create bank with asset over billion rime find that bank above some threshold tend have higher credit rating and baker and mcarthur show that bank that have more than billion asset have lower cost capital beccalli anolli and borello show that scale economy are larger for bank that are designated systemically relevant the european commission related the notion trust and reputation financial innovation related economy point benefit that large institution may have exploiting innovation specifically they might better position recoup the fixed cost those innovation diversification benefit are first sight more controversial many case conglomeration may lead valuation discount which could point anticipated inefficiency this line with corporate finance theory that tell that investor can choose diversify and that this doe not need done the firm level however key the business banking risk processing and absorption and confidence bank requires safe diversification then needed able absorb risk and safe observe also that several bank activity benefit from better credit rating which suggests that diversification the level the bank value evidence scale and scope economy scale and scope economy banking have been studied extensively year old survey paper berger demsetz and strahan conclude that general the empirical evidence can not readily identify substantial economy scale scope illustrative also saunders cite study which found diseconomies scope found economy scope and were neutral important caveat that this research mainly involves study using data from the and apart from also potential methodological shortcoming the result therefore not capture the dramatic structural and technological change banking that have taken place since then furthermore they reflect the historic fragmentation the banking industry due severe regulatory constraint the type banking bank could engage commercial banking investment banking but not both and the geographic reach activity limit interstate banking that were present till the deregulation the see calomiris and karceski subsequent study examine the existence diversification discount for financial institution laeven and levine confirm the existence diversification discount bank that combine lending and nonlending financial service and suggest that the potential economy scope financial conglomerate are not large enough compensate for potential agency problem and inefficiency associated with crosssubsidies rajan servaes and zingales nuance this picture they emphasize that even though conglomerate trade discount average the conglomerate trade premium they show that the interrelation between activity within the conglomerate crucial importance diversified firm can trade premium the dispersion between activity low high dispersion induces inefficiency which point the importance focus within the conglomerate for many guarantee contract and activity that involve recourse the credit standing the guarantor crucial for the credibility the contract mester emphasizes that bank production decision affect bank risk scale and scope related decision have via diversification effect risk and that turn may affect choice about risk exposure goetz laeven and levine show the existence diversification risk benefit domestic geographic expansion bank holding company schmid and walter confirm the laeven and levine result and confirm that this discount indeed caused diversification and not inefficiency that already existed prior the diversification prior initial diversifying merger chevalier show that controlling for the preconglomeration performance business important inefficiency measured after merger often already existed prior the merger particular one should look what type merger and acquisition involve scale and scope benefit research suggests that merger with both geographic and activity focus are most value enhancing similarly analyzing scope and scale issue one should focus the type activity what are the scale economy each activity and what productmix offer true scope economy delong looked the shareholder gain more specifically the immediate announcement effect share price from focused versus diversifying bank merger the between and she found that focused merger both the level activity and geography have positive announcement effect moreover focus activity shown more important than geographical focus albeit the latter important well activitydiversifying merger had positive announcement effect these result point the presence scale rather than scope economy the typical result these earlier study however that even scale economy are exhausted relatively small bank size later evidence point more persistent scale economy wheelock and wilson and feng and serletis find increasing return scale and elsas hackethal and holzh user find increasing return scope also for larger financial institution substantial scale economy are found when come backoffice activity and payment apart from methodological issue see mester this could driven informationtechnology development that might only have showed more recent data this spirit researcher have looked whether there are scale economy investment suggested boot and walter the evidence somewhat mixed erber and madlener find significant relationship between capital investment and bank productivity the country level beccalli even find negative relationship between bank efficiency and investment hardware and software but positive relationship between bank efficiency and countrylevel bank spending consulting service koetter and noth find that merely increasing investment doe not lead higher profitability but that the efficiency employing matter the impact bank business model far not really been empirically investigated one could envision that the demand side the proliferation saving product and their link pension mutual fund and life insurance clearly push for joint distribution and suggests economy scope distribution development might have made possible better exploit potential scope economy with multiple product offering particular customer group using new direct distribution channel with relatively easy access formerly distant customer all this might also invite new competition physical presence local market might have become important various data source become available big data and data analytics alternative standard relationship banking data collection consequence will see next the value chain may break some player may for example specialize distribution others back office see hughes and mester davy and tracey and deyoung the impact fintech the banking industry service product development various scale and scope economy could then possibly attained more targeted way the term fintech associated with this development key manifestation that fintech might lead the disaggregation the value chain interface online platform particular may come about that help bundle the product offering different provider thereby becoming the direct point contact for customer the distribution related economy that alluded may actually lead such disaggregation the value chain online platform and disaggregation online platform could disruptive existing financial institution particularly disaggregation the value chain could follow from online platform becoming the preferred customer interface online platform could offer supermarket type model facilitating access various product and service disparate provider along with record keeping financial service platform might act market place where people interact directly and financial institution serve the limited role advisor broker lending could have party transacting directly without the benefit financial intermediary except possibly for back office service technology firm such google facebook amazon apple may use payment solution such apple pay platform and gain direct customer interface for related product and service legacy financial institution then might relegated serving the back office the platform there reason why platform should limited offering only financial service lifestyle oriented focus could integrate financial and nonfinancial offering the disruptive force affecting banking information technology and fintech particular may also offer new opportunity for other business that have tried enter banking for example tesco large supermarket chain provides banking service customer under own brand new specialized lender have arisen that seek replace relationship lender and traditional credit scoring with sophisticated algorithm based big data mining data analytics while still infancy such analysis predicts creditworthiness analyzing buying habit membership reading proclivity lifestyle choice and all manner opportunistic demographic correlate similarly the growing availability information allows for public certification creditworthiness similar the trustworthiness score ebay the client satisfaction score tripadvisor one could envision similar development enabling lending well whether society will accept the widespread use these data different matter any event more and more potentially sensitive personal information inexpensive the observation follow part greenbaum mckinsey talk about seamless customer experience with banking and thirdparty service and refers the tencent wechat platform that includes mobility travel and dining service can already obtained with few mouse click big data may also facilitate crowdfunding another form direct lending involving multiple lender and singular borrower the customer level might see emergence more community oriented arrangement lending and crowdfunding suggest customer may take matter their own hand empowerment thus local arrangement may emerge where community organize their financial affair directly among themselves information technology therefore may not only invite increase scale but might also facilitate more tailormade local arrangement the latter would fit the empowerment that customer may increasingly desire this point more general many the recent fintech related development may put customer the driving seat for example the platform would give them easier access variety provider the consultancy mckinsey talk about platform creating customercentric unified value proposition that beyond what user could previously obtain and often more central the customer journey mckinsey this point empowerment customer and simultaneously could cast doubt whether bank will able continue control the customer interface reach fintech payment area which seems most open fintech payment and particularly retailrelated payment this core area banking being coveted technology firm and payment specialist like google apple and paypal thus far bank have maintained their central role payment also the payment innovator are not typically independent bank but have developed joint venture other type alliance with traditional bank some country bank themselves have managed offer the leading online payment solution while retail payment were the initial point entry fintech player getting into payment solution for corporates might next step regulatory development like psd the may further elevate competition this area psd force bank share payment information with others the request their customer this designed encourage competition the payment sphere this context also the blockchain technology should mentioned this decentralized system record keeping and transaction promise have impact the banking industry might undermine the centricity bank the financial system cryptocurrencies like bitcoin that use the blockchain technology could offer alternative payment infrastructure that bypass the banking system however these development are still their infancy and highly unpredictable also bank may choose see also report fintech the consultancy accenture accenture page wyman and the world economic forum rightfully state dlt distributed ledger technology blockchain not panacea instead should viewed one many technology that will form the foundation next generation financial service infrastructure wef will not speculate most wellknown application cryptocurrencies digital currency might play important role the future whether private one like bitcoin see nakamoto become important unknown one could also envision central bank issued digital currency gaining the upper hand bank england bank and fintech embrace these development and part the response bank and the more general threat opportunity fintech for the banking industry will discus next what role will bank play these development they may face challenge hirt and milmott put digitization often lower entry barrier causing longestablished boundary between sector tumble the same time the plug and play nature digital asset cause value chain disaggregate creating opening for focused fastmoving competitor new market entrant often scale rapidly lower cost than legacy player can and return may grow rapidly more customer join the network particular bank lose some their competitive advantage overcoming information problem may longer enjoy privileged access stable customer base and feel erosion their access cheap deposit vives bank doomed this doe not mean that bank are doomed the past banking institution have shown remarkable resilience despite question about their viability far back economist john boyd and mark gertler commented the predicted demise bank wellknown study titled are bank dead are the report greatly exaggerated that point the discussion about the bank role lending particular the question whether securitization would undermine the bank lending franchise they concluded that while securitization would make bank important for the actual funding loan the core function bank the lending process origination including screening servicing and monitoring would preserved would the centrality bank also bank would typically play role the securitization vehicle providing backup line credit and guarantee the refinancing the commercial paper that fund many the vehicle the message that article undoubtedly relevance today bank will respond and try player the fintech world themselves they may also set platform and this way hold the customer interface moreover fintech often facilitating and thus way improve operation and existing process within bank big data and data analytics could for example help improve the lending process bank bank and bank also play role lending not just innovation that develops independently bank andor without involvement bank like securitization bank may serve essential function that lending process like compliance screening and funding bank together with institutional investor boyd and gertler and samolyk are important provider funding platform bank may also have setup the platform all this point complementarity between bank and fintech player another issue what extent the market served overlap with that bank far typically target consumer lending some country contrary the bank are not key player this market and hence competitive effect would limited for the demyanyk loutskina and kolliner find that primarily serf predatorytype segment causing excess borrowing often vulnerable consumer given that this segment not primary banking segment the overlap would limited buchak point competitive effect the residential lending market they show that shadow bank including fintech grow strongly the more risky yet guaranteed segment via government sponsored enterprise gse where bank retreat for regulatory compliance reason the prospect for corporate lending are more difficult ass banking skill might indispensable for example those needed deal with controlling risk moral hazard and distressed asset again this could point role bank platform more risky informationsensitive corporate loan not seem good fit for brokeroriented platform dermine partner perish increasingly partnering seen crucial for bank recent study the world economic forum concludes that all financial institution will need find way partner with large tech without losing their core value proposition wef agility and flexibility setting and finding value enhancing partnership are seen distinct skill doing bank may face dilemma when partnering with fintech optimal and when not desirable such dilemma could play for example partnering with apple google payment will bank continue important for such partnership only the beginning and redundant subsequently bank however have some competitive advantage bank benefit from the anxiety people about the safety their liquid wealth the financial crisis may have created anxiety about the stability bank but bank are still seen the place where money safe whatever the popularity apple will people trust technology company safeguarding their money being bank with license and implicit guarantee from the government value bank may also have valuable compliance expertise and having extensive customer data distinct competitive advantage well while peertopeer suggests lending individual individual this often not the case stated bank and institutional investor are important provider fund analyzing lending club wellknown platform jagtiani and lemieux find that relatively high risk consumer are being served compared those bank they also see some inclusion benefit pointing pps role providing credit area that could benefit from additional credit supply the latter contrast with demyanyk loutskina and kolliner who not find that cover market underserved traditional bank hence they are skeptical about improving financial inclusion for strong stand partnering with the motto partner perish see report the consultancy also argues that the major risk for bank doe not come from fintech player but from bank that are better partnering see also mckinsey and wef for similar point view the economist note that bank and fintech become increasingly collaborative the economist special report international banking may page point echoed well the world economic forum many fintechs have shifted building partnership they struggle with scale and customer adoption wef vatanasombut highlight that trust play key role the retention customer with online banking they also find that perceived security reinforces trust these comment also point potential artificial and undesirable competitive advantage that bank have particularly alluded above the implicit guarantee that bank have from their government may give them edge over new entrant including possibly fintech player indeed safeguarding fair opportunity for new player challenge when strong and highly politically connected incumbent are present fair say that the future the industry and structure particular are highly uncertain development technology have inherently level unpredictability the financial service industry the middle some bank may play leading role the new universe perhaps becoming fintechs themselves and provider leading platform what seems clear that bank will need become agile and flexible deal with the challenge and uncertainty ahead nevertheless there are reason envision potential decline new competitor and the disaggregation the value chain will put pressure existing player information technology play leading role the transformation banking development information technology and the related deepening financial market have pushed bank more transactionoriented activity including trading the expense relationship banking banking become more fluid and possibly opportunistic result financial market also facilitated investment bank moving away from the more stable partnership model more fluid shareholder owned public listing these change have put pressure bank and regulator stability concern alike conclusion the latest incarnation information technology led fintech revolution where bank face new competitor with different more specialized business model forcing disaggregation the value chain with technologydriven solution they offer alternative key banking service including payment and lending important question what extent existing financial institution can leading can they the forefront new development for example absorbing fintech player and their innovation will bank and fintech complementary and collaborative will bank fade away with new technologylinked player assuming prominence the financial sector while have commented the resilience bank only time will tell many question few answer philippon put what know however that combination restrictive regulation and powerful incumbent can certainly prevent entry the importance political connection banking see calomiris and haber observe also that bank that embrace fintech development may this neutralize innovation and protect their existing way operating potentially relevant historic example moody the rating agency acquisition kmv kmv had developed novel approach for assessing credit risk that arguably moody saw threat more recently some consortium bank are setting blockchain system that are closed for others and thus possibly frustrate the open architecture that blockchain based example ing participation blockchainbased platform for energy commodity which involves limited number participant see ing press release november ing join force blockchainbased platform fair ing state the same press release that intention open others the technology intended made available all market participant and service provider the energy trading sector the dutch central bank list three possible configuration for the industry bank manage absorb the fintech revolution and manage continue the lead more dispersed landscape come about with new player conjunction with more traditional bank and iii new player take the lead possibly with high level concentration the hand the new giant google facebook etc dnb see mckinsey for other insight the potential different role bank going forward also from financial stability point view the fintech revolution challenging the bank england formulated the question whether the distress failure technologyenabled alternative finance provider have implication for financial stability bank england just not know the dutch central bank identified not just risk the new fintech type operation and player but also stability risk coming from existing institution that could lose out the technology race dnb but stability benefit are also alluded fintech development may increase diversity the financial sector whether this will benefit weaken the resilience the system time will tell for example roboadvice and risk management algorithm could lead more uniformity and induce herding and thus have potentially destabilizing procyclical effect again many question and few answer

bank oliver wyman financial service point view october private equity the netherlands value creation redistribution and excess introduction arnoud boot jeroen ligterink and jens martin private equity continues the news proponent emphasize the positive effect can have they refer the advantage private equity alternative source financing vehicle that provides expertise and access network industry expert governance model that lead better company performance and the added value private equity asset class critic the other hand argue that value creation occurs rather the return for private equity investor just redistribution value the expense other stakeholder such employee creditor supplier and tax authority they also point the danger excessive use debt financing and the higher insolvency risk this thought entail they claim that consequence cost are passed society for example through layoff employee following insolvency critic also point the possibility excessive focus the short term private equity investor private equity riskbearing capital invested private equity fund into what ultimately nonlisted company the two most important form are buyout and venture capital buyout takeover mature company which the private equity fund generally obtains majority stake exchange for injecting equity primarily raised from institutional investor the equity investment hand hand with substantial debt financing the ownership model private equity temporary exit usually planned after four seven year the case venture capital equity invested into startup emerging company the nederlandse vereniging van participatiemaatschappijen nvp the dutch trade association for private equity and venture capital firm report that dutch company attracted total billion euro from private equity fund nearly billion which came from foreign private equity fund dutch private equity firm raised record amount billion euro for making new investment which million consisted venture capital nvp also report that company the netherlands employing around people total have private equity investor shareholder the focus the study reported this chapter buyout which are also central the public debate the research question are thank ludovic phalippou and kees cool for their contribution the original study underlying this report ligterink also would like thank maureen wouters and janelle zoutkamp for outstanding research assistance and sidonie rademaker and lorena zevedei for their editorial work source nvp website httpwwwnvpnlpaginaondernemend vermogen what are the advantage and disadvantage this form financing and ownership what the importance private equity the dutch economy during the period doe private equity contribute economic growth how what the effect private equity the company which invested what the added value and what effect doe private equity have the stakeholder these company including the tax authority how these effect differ from those other source financing the study analyzes how private equity operates how can create value and where excess might occur also contains empirical study into the effect private equity the netherlands the study build upon previous research conducted jong and boot and cool the structure this chapter follows section describes how private equity work and how return made the company which private equity fund invests section provides insight into how private equity can create value not only for investor but also for society whole and discus finding international empirical study the impact debt financing leverage the return and compensation private equity investor discussed section the source return not necessarily value creation but could also associated with redistribution value from other stakeholder the private equity investor this the subject section section trace the development private equity and buyout the netherlands and provides the key insight from empirical study the effect private equity investment the dutch market section concludes what doe private equity how doe private equity work private equity firm creates investment fund from which investment are made the investment fund filled with injection capital the private equity firm itself acting general partner meanwhile capital also obtained from limited partner these limited partner are institutional investor such pension fund but may also wealthy private investor under the general partner leadership the fund invests multiple buyout company besides capital from the general and limited partner considerable amount debt used financing with debt offer tax benefit interest payment are partially deductible leverage also enhances the reward for accomplishing improvement the business the return equity becomes even more sensitive the target company performance illustration financing company valued with debt implies equity investment increasing the company value then give increase the value the equity claim increase from all detail about the study into the effect private equity the netherlands can found ligterink the general partner contribution the fund capital typically around such provider private equity have strong incentive actually improve the performance the company which they invest additionally the high leverage ensures discipline and strong sense urgency the high debt load after all also subject default risk section examine the importance leverage greater detail heavy use also made performancelinked compensation both within the private equity investment fund and within the target company this encourages engagement the target company how doe private equity fund generate return investment the investment fund return often come from combination the following source operational improvement implementation measure that make the company more efficient for example more efficient use the mean production the company selection better management team better management information system improvement logistical planning betterfocused etc revised strategic focus implementation newimproved strategy including better use growth opportunity and optimization the corporate scope for example buyandbuild strategy disposal noncore activity etc governance structure enhancement aligning the financial interest the company management more closely with those the shareholder for example making management coshareholder increased supervision and oversight via stronger incentive and more direct access information for the shareholder etc change the supervisory board more expertise more direct involvement forging relevant network stronger incentive through optimization leverage increasing pressure and incentive through more debt financing financial engineering optimal use tax benefit interest expense may partially deducted from corporate tax because specific expertise and experience the private equity firm may better know how organize the company capital structure such way that can financed with relatively high amount debt without facing corresponding increase insolvency risk investment selection and market timing private equity investor are position buy undervalued company and then subsequently resell them they can generate return for themselves arbitrage may result from greater ability predict development the market market expertise access better information about the company andor superior dealmaking capability negotiation skill and better access deal the most important conclusion from the point listed above that company business affair intensify the moment private equity enters the picture whether this actually the same value creation and for whom the main topic the chapter ahead with buyandbuild strategy the private equity firm grows the target company through merger and acquisition private equity and value creation private equity temporary ownership and governance structure that creates strong financial incentive for action central focus achieve return for the investor yet how are these return created and how doe private equity impact the insolvency risk company which invested start with discus the valuecreation potential private equity governance model what can that other governance structure can not subsequently take closer look statistical problem measuring the performance private equity afterwards turn insight from the international empirical literature the performance private equity including the effect insolvency risk closer look the potential for value creation private equity address important concern related public equity how discipline management private equity involves small group shareholder the general partner often young welleducated and active with direct access management and the latest information this make easier maintain steady focus and strategy with optimal coordination between management and shareholder within listed company the distance between management and shareholder often greater and the dispersion shareholding can lead socalled freerider problem this refers shareholder looking one another which begs the question who keeping watch over management each individual shareholder would happy someone else would put the effort but everyone assumes that someone else doing ultimately nobody will the combination maximal codetermination and minimal information asymmetry reduces the typical agency problem characteristic public equity another feature private equity the very strong alignment interest shareholder the private equity fund and management through compensation contract with powerful financial incentive often including obligation for management buy share the company such obligation ensures that management not only profit when thing well but also face consequence when thing badly normally management can not sell investment before exit take place this illiquidity eliminates for example the incentive for management manipulate shortterm result see kaplan and str mberg the horizon the moment exit which lie few year the future private equity fund also have qualm about replacing poorly performing management early stage see acharya another aspect private equity which contributes higher return possibly more remote and clinical view which could make reorganization easier furthermore private equity can help company achieve change strategic focus injecting fund expertise and access external network private equity fund the general partner often seek the advice external expert with specialized knowledge various aspect the company activity this execution often accompanied disposal activity that are determined not part the company core business well additional takeover strengthen the company actual core activity the corporate scope and adjustment made are primary focus private equity investor the picture sketched above indicates that private equity added value and thus can have advantage form ownership compared with other ownership structure this should expressed improved operational performance and stronger growth the company financed private equity compared with similar company that are not financed with private equity additionally this suggests that private equity investor can achieve higher riskadjusted return compared for example public equity box statistical problem quantification what happens the company after the buyout what change occur empirical study the greatest problem that remains unknown what would have happened the company had not been bought out private equity other word the socalled counterfactual unknown approximate this counterfactual researcher look for the most relevant benchmark for comparison sometimes they choose compare with the sector with collection company from the same sector with similar characteristic the target company this can already lead initial problem selection bias company financed private equity are not randomly chosen but may precisely those with the greatest potential for improvement opportunity for growth etc furthermore the company management and shareholder must open private equity that mean there may also selection bias here company that are open private equity are possibly different even adjustment are made for obvious difference this make difficult compare the two group company financed private equity versus those without private equity financing draw conclusion about the effect private equity another problem empirical research the effect private equity that many the necessary data are not fully available least public database this especially the case for nonlisted company taken over private equity the lack data for private company creates also potential problem choosing the correct sample comparable firm publicly listed company are often chosen for this because the availability data but these are typically relatively large company whereas private equity investment are usually smaller size therefore remains unclear whether the finding these study can generalized provide insight into the often smaller buyout company return for private equity investor limited partner empirical study show that historically speaking the net return for the limited partner private equity fund higher than that diversified stock portfolio valueweighted stock market index this true even after the deduction cost and considerable fee however the spread return large due leverage private equity investor automatically achieve higher return average but this handinhand with greater risk higher riskadjusted return that are not caused undervaluation the moment investment should indicator the company improved performance unless these higher return are caused tax benefit associated with leverage and when adjusted for disadvantageous factor such reduced liquidity and higher risk compared the benchmark there appears essentially outperformance for the limited partner the general partner charge substantial fee metrick and yasuda estimate based simulation that the present value these fee approximately the committed capital important emphasize that the higher return private equity based average there significant variation over time and among different fund selecting the right fund and fund manager appears very important not every institutional investor equal access private equity fund particularly large institutional investor with strong reputation will invited the most successful private equity firm participate their fund top that these larger institutional investor may have the inhouse expertise select the right fund and know how keep cost check smaller professional pension fund will have greater difficulty achieving comparable high return yet even these high return are actually achieved this doe not necessarily mean outperformance can compensation for extra risk the risk profile private equity fund different than that welldiversified stock portfolio the fund often contains smaller company with relatively low market value compared their book value and lowerliquidity investment are also typical adjustment are made for these extra risk factor various study find that the higher return largely eliminated attributable these factor that mean there such thing significant outperformance for limited partner the extra return compensation for exposure these factor operational performance and insolvency risk based existing international research can cautiously conclude that private equity positive effect average the operating performance and growth company which invested most study find that company achieve higher ebitda margin and higher revenue average the same time recent study conclude that these advantage have declined over time see for example guo hotchkiss and song important disclaimer must applied here the first place unclear what extent the positive effect are caused the selection underperforming company this would indicate selection effect rather than outright positive contribution private equity secondly takeover and divestments part company which often together with private equity investment can lead the creation entirely different company that have little with the original benchmark study find that the return often consists three primary component operational improvement and growth market timing and selection and advantage high leverage acharya find that sample european buyout transaction operational improvement and growth account for the return market timing and selection for and advantage higher leverage for another important element the performance private equity influence risk particularly insolvency risk research the united state show that insolvency risk slightly rise due the increased leverage under private equity this rise however limited work hotchkiss smith and str mberg the probably the most extensive study the impact private equity insolvency risk this study examines more than company from and find chance insolvency among private equity supported company compared chance among company without private equity support european study such tykov and borell covering sample european private equity company and wright covering group company the united kingdom find difference the probability insolvency furthermore harford and kolasinski find that refinancing activity used pay out dividend have discernible impact private equitybacked company chance insolvency consequently study show that the risk insolvency company financed private equity hardly higher average than that similar company without private equity backing this suggests that private equity fund are apparently capable managing the high degree leverage private equity investor aim decrease the leverage through the cash flow generated the portfolio company lower level before they exit the company the median holding period year the high leverage the portfolio company more pronounced the early year since the chance insolvency are only slightly higher the expected societal cost layoff value destruction during insolvency proceeding etc are limited the importance leverage additionally private equity fund act buyer part bankrupt company potentially enabling bankruptcy resolved more efficiently this make easier for example keep viable part bankrupt company afloat private equity also play significant role the takeover market facilitating the transfer company through restructuring and rationalization operational activity the process creates liquidity the takeover market place where would otherwise available shall illustrate how financing with debt influence the expected return and risk private equity investment before turning impact the general partner compensation the carried interest the effect leverage return can best explained using simulated example suppose the value company that private equity fund seek acquire the first scenario this investment financed the fund with equity the second scenario the investment financed with equity and the rest external debt and the third scenario equity account only for the investment the study are not unequivocal some study find increase where others find change the chance insolvency compared with group company that are not financed private equity alternative explanation that lowcovenant loan agreement give private equity player strong position with regard their creditor who turn are quicker make concession case problem arise private equity could enable viable part company salvaged from insolvency imtech for example prevent insolvency through welltimed reorganization the influence leverage investment risk and return with the remaining being external debt suppose the private equity fund succeeds increasing the target company value the value becomes through operational improvement organic growth what would the return for the private equity fund each the three financing scenario considering that the value increase those who have provided equity the private equity fund the return investment consisting entirely equity the scenario where the investment made debt and the fund own equity make the other the return rise the scenario where debt make the investment the return the fund equity investment increase all the way see table table development the shareholder return case value creation company value equity debt value creation return equity invested value increase equity equity equity additionally important emphasize that greater leverage also increase the spread and therefore the risk the private equity investor return suppose there are two possible scenario the value added above there decrease value how the return the invested capital affected for the private equity fund case decrease value assuming once again that the fund equity account for the investment the return equity and respectively see table other word the higher the leverage the higher the positive return but also the more negative the negative return the fund equity this applies generally for return investment the financial market the case active private equity involvement the return are effort related and are basically reward extra return for the restructuring new growth strategy and that reward can boosted leverage have chosen for rather extreme value the financing ratio order clearly illustrate the effect debt financing the return equity the private equity fund for the sake simplicity abstract from the cost debt these example this put and the onetime value creation achieved single year this lead return the fund own investment equity equal and respectively leverage thus increase the reward but also the loss doe not work out note that this different from the focus the famous work modigliani and miller that look return that investor require for holding stock bond other asset those return typically not reflect any skill action but are compensation for time preference and risk with leverage those return need average higher higher expected return compensate investor for extra risk table effect operational value decrease the return equity company value equity debt value creation return equity invested value decrease equity equity equity the effect leverage the compensation the general partner the general partner the private equity fund compensated the form management fee and fee related the fund performance the carried interest this section demonstrate how the buyout mean financing influence the general partner carried interest suppose the agreement contains apart from the carried interest hurdle this mean that the general partner only receives the carried interest once the limited partner achieve least return their investment once this return achieved the general partner receives followup return until reach return this known catch any additional return achieved then distributed ratio for the limited partner for the general partner the total this performancebased variable compensation for the general partner known the carried interest illustrate the effect leverage the carried interest return the example used section value creation assume carried interest the return achieved above the hurdle although reality the carried interest usually calculated based the fund level will assume here for the sake simplicity that only one investment been made from the fund and that all value created within single year assume total operational value creation within the company top company value will show the carried interest for the three scenario which the fund investment equity amount and respectively the first financing scenario the fund equity account for investment that case the limited partner first receive return their investment then the general partner receives amount equal the return paid out thus far this which equal the rest distributed among the general partner and limited partner according the rule therefore the general partner receives additional from this total the general partner receives carried interest performancebased compensation this scenario for the sake simplicity not take management fee into consideration this example carry out these calculation for each the three financing scenario see that each case the general partner receives see table this seems suggest that the general partner indifferent with regard the financing proportion but that only the case look single investment fact financing with more debt the general partner can finance more project considering the size the investment fund and thus increase the total compensation across all project combined suppose the general partner fund size that case the general partner can make single investment which equity amount the fund invests with debt invest equity and debt thus enabling take two project each and thus receiving twice the carried interest the fund invests with debt even such project can taken each contributing the general partner carried interest other word the total carried interest increase proportionally increase leverage important note that the carried interest calculated the fund level that one investment fails deliver good return come the expense the total carried interest abstaining from problem associated with default insolvency the preceding analysis implies that the general partner the private equity fund interest financing investment using debt the greatest extent possible table development carried interest project under various financing scenario company value equity debt operational value creation value equity exit hurdle rate surplus profit above hurdle catch remaining carried interest total carried interest equity equity equity leverage and value creation there are multiple reason for using leverage buyout make possible more with limited amount equity thus increasing fund clout multiple buyout can done adding debt the available fund enables more concentrated shareholding fewer additional shareholder needed improving engagement and reducing free rider problem leverage increase the return the private the example table assume that the cash flow high enough pay out the hurdle well the catch equity investor effort and the performancesensitivity the general partner compensation the carried interest further could enforce greater discipline and urgency additionally could offer tax benefit stated private equity fund can raise the leverage even more providing loan themselves called shareholder loan the interest rate these loan usually high and could further increase the tax saving depending the selected structure the private equity fund interest income either nontaxable taxed relatively low rate the tax benefit associated with leverage have been scaled back recent legislation several jurisdiction the netherlands began limiting the taxdeductibility interest payment the tax plan for the deductibility interest shareholder loan abolished through amendment article the dutch corporate tax act the high degree leverage often seen undesirable critic because reduces tax for the government and might expose the company and investor high level insolvency risk critic also claim can used mean pillaging company having pay out superdividend with the cash from newly issued debt this may result greater insolvency risk and may impact the company future prospect however general partner private equity fund seem capable managing the risk greater leverage they work closely with the company and contribute their own knowledge and expertise this make them better capable promptly evaluating the desirability and necessity additional injection capital soon problem arise they also often have relatively strong negotiating position when dealing with creditor bank additionally they may care about their reputation because investor need found for new fund that they may establish the future this argument expands creditor the firm well management since private equity firm also want fund future investment with relatively high debt level they have additional incentive not default their debt management will prefer private equity investor with good track record they often invest alongside the private equity investor and thus skin the game redistribution and possible excess besides real value creation the return that private equity investor earn can point redistribution the expense other stakeholder employee may lose their job face pressure accept lower salary supplier may forced make concession and creditor may pressured lower their claim private equity raise the company risk profile heightened insolvency risk may inflict damage other stakeholder the section below first discus possible negative aspect private equity specifically the oftenbemoaned shortterm focus and aggressive asset stripping selling company underlying asset following the buyout then turn possible redistribution effect discus redistribution effect towards the government tax arbitrage the possibility favoritism towards management the expense existing old shareholder redistribution that put employee disadvantage and redistribution between the general and limited partner finally examine the possible spillover effect private equity the sector which the target firm operates and externality the economy whole investment shortterm bias and asset stripping doe private equity lead heavier focus the short term the sense damaging the longterm prospect the target company the notion stronger shortterm mentality among private equity company compared similar nonprivate equityfunded company only very limited way supported finding the international research study the effect private equity the found that private equityfinanced company invest this could characterized stronger focus the short term however that time private equity focused primarily inefficient conglomerate need restructuring this would naturally lead reduction scope and limit wasteful investment characterize this undue bias favor the short term somewhat misleading recent decade private equity more focused growth with typically decrease investment throughout ownership recent study show that the level investment doe not decrease under private equity but doe become more focused median holding period year would also suggest more medium term rather than shortterm focus another related criticism focus asset stripping and superdividends basically selling asset the expense future opportunity the firm order increase profit distribution however asset stripping and the issuing superdividends are not structural occurrence company taken over private equity although superdividends have been observed some case and may indicate that the company question being pillaged research cohn mill and towery find that even for business the percentile highest dividend payouts dividend account for only the transaction value the first year and the second year this mean that dividend were even lower than before the buyout the study doe find that company buyout with low cash flow tend pay slightly higher dividend and vice versa however the effect the economy whole very limited furthermore the possibility paying superdividends have been somewhat limited government policy around the world legislative measure have been enacted prevent excessive profit distribution and asset stripping purest form the netherlands this fall under director liability article the dutch civil code and the aifm directive which enshrined law article the dutch financial supervision act wft under article the dutch civil code the purest form refers selling asset that superdividends can then paid out leaving creditor and employee with hollowedout company director must act the company interest when carrying out planned profit distribution they must test the basis realistic prognosis whether the distribution may result continuity problem for the company the event insolvency the director can held personally liable this testing not carried out carried out inadequately shareholder have received dividend and the company bankrupt the creditor can claim and recover the wrongfully paid out amount from the shareholder the aifm directive article contains measure counter asset stripping among other thing requires the private equity fund with controlling interest company abstain for the first month from supporting action that affect the asset the company question this intended prevent private equity fund from selling off valuable asset and redirecting the profit themselves paying dividend another source concern that excessive leverage place too much pressure management tempting them cut corner there some evidence that high leverage push management increase shortterm cash flow order help deal with the debt burden this could lead degradation the quality product matsa show that this can indeed occur found that concession were made with regard the quality product heavily debt financed private equity transaction the american supermarket sector this doe seem indicate shortterm focus the longer term similar strategy would probably cost the company clientele and revenue this research however too limited draw broader conclusion overall one could say that there reason assume that desirable investment decline investment are however more focused under private equity only isolated case are superdividends paid out early stage however absolute conclusion can not drawn concern can raised about limitation the empirical study including selection bias also mentioned previously research focus primarily relatively large company because more data these company are publicly available market timing and selection alternative partial explanation for the positive return for private equity investor the possibility timing well selection private equity fund good selecting undervalued company that later sell for higher price this merely transfer value from the shareholder the target company those the private equity fund that case the return reflect the elimination undervaluation rather than value creation this can also apply the buyout company with undervalued asset which are then sold off part asset stripping lerner argues that patent lbo firm seem have higher economic impact they are more cited the study cohn exception cohn base their research tax return thus incorporating data from smaller more comparable company exposing the undervaluation can actually have real effect achieving accurate valuation can enable asset allocated more optimally sends better signal about where opportunity are and thus can result better allocation resource strategy focusing market timing and asset stripping were particularly popular the when breaking conglomerate common those year not only undervaluation issue but typically also underperformance the different part within the conglomerate the different piece could hide their shortcoming breaking these conglomerate allowed more focused response offering possibility for real value creation redistribution effect this section discus how private equity can lead redistribution value among the various stakeholder and private equity investor government and tax arbitrage private equity hand hand with relatively high level debt this produce tax saving through the deductibility interest payment result the government loses out tax revenue this led many country develop regulation limit tax deduction for leveraged buyout germany for example the deduction capped ebitda the netherlands set limit the interest deduction with acquisition holding decision article the dutch corporate tax act specifies that effective january only the interest paid the healthy part the acquisition debt deductible the healthy part set the acquisition price this lowered five percentage point each year for period seven year after the buyout until reach the deduction limit includes sme franchise million euro interest per year tax arbitrage can also take place charging management fee the company level these management fee are partially taxdeductible depending where management fee fall they may taxed lower rate not all the tax advantage leverage are significant knauer find that tax saving germany for example amount between and company value this result lower tax revenue for the government the benefit come with higher price that are paid during buyout and thus seem least part transferred the boughtout shareholder the company being taken over see jenkinson and stucke indicated tax benefit are mean the only reason why private equity transaction involve leverage they are simply part broader set force including the impact leverage incentive the further elimination tax benefit will therefore not make the relatively high use leverage private equity disappear but may moderate for further analysis the fiscal aspect private equity see van streek with the recent dutch tax plan interest deduction for shareholder loan been abolished redistribution through favoritism towards management flattering example private equity transaction whenever the deal consciously created achieve more lucrative reward the expense existing shareholder particular management the target company might susceptible pressure promise from the private equity fund management may have been approached the runup the buyout and based promise made with regard role the buyout already acting the interest the private equity fund instead the interest existing shareholder other stakeholder some evidence this found the study mao and renneboog which show that management buyout mbos more downward earningsmanipulation take place the year leading the transaction may imply that existing management try negatively influence the value the company order bring down the purchase price for the private equity fund this creates greater potential increase the company value after the transaction management might benefit promised role postbuyout particularly when get share any case this call for active role the part nonexecutive director the supervisory board the target company management might compromised box the failed buyout qantas consortium private equity party discussed illuminating some these issue box conflict interest between shareholder and management qantas early consortium private equity fund referred here apa group which included macquarie and tpg made bid above the latest share price share the listed australian airline company qantas march that year qantas released annual report which showed earnings that were higher than had been expected apa did not increase bid based this information and april amended the bid would conditional backing from qantas shareholder yet the may that year not even the share were offered prompting apa withdraw bid the most important reason why the buyout fell through that investor considered the bid too low however addition that conflict interest between managementboard and shareholder may have played significant role qantas chairwoman margareth jackson had been strong proponent the deal the fact that increase the bid requested despite the company reported earnings being higher than expected contributed the perception that management qantas eager make deal that played into the private equity fund hand rather than putting the interest the old shareholder first qantas announced that management would acquire share the privatized company value around million dollar later revealed that this stake might increase much these revelation reduced confidence both management and board and ultimately contributed the shareholder decision this case study based primarily study the melbourne centre for financial study turn against them the qantas case raised much attention and concern australia and other country over conflict interest private equity buyout there are several other way which management might compromised for example exorbitant severance package might offered for member management who consent the buyout again this would tempt existing management advise shareholder sell the company too quickly and price that too low this put existing shareholder disadvantage and call for vigilant role nonexecutive director redistribution and employee the impact private equity the size the workforce within company average negative during the first year after the buyout however the workforce generally recovers the year after that see cressy munari and malipiero wilson boucly sraer and thesmar private equity transaction focused restructuring more permanent negative impact private equity the number employee can expected however also here understanding the counterfactual important what would the prospect employee have been the restructuring would not have taken place also schumpeter creative destruction argument should taken into account what opportunity come about restructuring downsizing bloated incumbent enforcing strategic reorientation the company itself might ultimately grow again based the strategic reorientation with possible subsequent merger and takeover the company the most extensive study the effect private equity financing employment company davis that study analyzes very broad dataset from buyout company during the period concluding that buyout lead limited net loss job than but result significant gross job creation while considerable number job are eliminated large number new job are created resulting only minor net job loss with regard salary per employee the picture clear some international study find slight decrease while others identify average increase although identifying the exact reason for such ambiguous finding remains anyone guess certain extent there are two effect which seem play part private equity exerts downward pressure salary level general but the same time there possible shift towards more higherlevel job position study show that other force and arrangement that surround employee union membership occupational safety record career perspective complaint this conflict interest also may occur nonprivate equity initiated takeover see for example mannesmann where management received very favorable retirement package note that the process shrinking and growing again will not without pain nor without cost society whenever mass outpouring older worker occurs they may not all able reenter the labor market and substantial cost are passed society even the long term possible mechanism for this that financing with large amount debt and the resulting pressure the company doe weaken the negotiating position employee for thorough theoretical discussion this topic see perotti and spier procedure internal promotion etc not fundamentally change that sense there seems systematic evidence indirect transfer value from employee investor redistribution from limited partner general partner the general partner compensation contract with management fee and carried interest should seek align the interest the general partner with those the limited partner nonetheless conflict interest may still arise these are primarily related the fact that the general partner place great importance the size the fund see also our analysis the carried interest whereas limited partner are primarily concerned with the return their investment the urge see the size the fund and that subsequent fund objective can lead the general partner undertake optimal investment particularly the end fund lifetime the general partner reputation and strong screening measure the limited partner private equity fund are intended keep this behavior under control furthermore the general partner can charge all kind other fee for example management fee paid the company nowadays limited partner usually try define such fee their contract with the fund negotiate that these fee will deducted from the amount carried interest paid nonetheless transparency towards smaller investor particular remains concern market force could prompt some discipline currently however relative surplus capital given rise demander market giving general partner greater power and putting market discipline under pressure two recent study see bernstein and lubber von eije and westerman have examined the impact private equity the meso sectoral level bernstein find that sector which private equity fund have been active the last five year experienced relatively more growth employment well more investment this may point spillover effect onto competitor the sector due the presence private equity fund for example private equity involvement via creative destruction elevates competition that competition could stimulate nonprivate equityfinanced company increase their productivity and improve operational process spillover effect private equity too soon draw strong conclusion based these study they are simply too sporadic for that clear however that there real possibility that the presence private equity financing positive effect other company the same sector research this topic still the early stage development the private equity market the netherlands the market for private equity investment reached high point both worldwide well the netherlands aside from the overheating that point and the correction that followed during the see for example the survey evcacmbor financial crisis especially the volume private equity increased steadily over the last three decade however the market develops wave which are strongly influenced the degree which debt available any given time well how easy make exit the latter depends strongly the stock market private equity the netherlands this section first provide general information about the dutch private equity market subsequently present empirical insight from analysis buyout the netherlands during the period because relatively high return the past least compared with welldiversified equity index private equity become popular asset class for institutional investor the pension fund abp for example invested approximately total portfolio private equity the increasing supply capital for private equity also result the relatively high number exit earlier private equity fund which free capital for reinvestment consequence there are currently many fund the market with relatively high amount capital that committed but not yet invested also known dry powder such market the supplier capital may have relatively weak bargaining position compared the demand side the private equity fund annual private equity investment the netherlands from amounted approximately billion euro gdp see figure the greatest portion private equity investment fall the category midmarket with investment between and million euro are smaller deal and the remaining are large transaction see figure for the period from the total investment volume average initiated foreign private equity firm syndication which multiple private equity party are involved occurs regularly the time average for the period because the relatively high degree debt financing the clout private equity greater than own contribution capital including any shareholder loan this reflected the higher leverage average after buyout following the crisis around the capital private equityheld company debt which somewhat below the average amount debt before the crisis this refers

their fundraising there are also many foreign private equity fund active the netherlands result the insight from the international empirical study mentioned section are undoubtedly also relevant for the netherlands addition taking stock these insight have specifically looked the netherlands see ligterink for detail based two complementary sample attempt made gain insight into the effect private equity buyout the netherlands the first sample come from public database zephyr bureau van dijk referred here bvd based this private equity buyout were identified over the period from the result these buyout are compared with two control group one control group contains ten dutch company which are comparable size and sector and the other consists ten similarly comparable european company examine the development certain figure from one year before the buyout until three year afterwards the moment exit because the availability data for these company often limited the final sample considerably smaller than and the number company varies depending the aspect being examined such than the original sample remains for certain figure related revenue debt number employee and tax this may impact how representative the ultimate sample implying that the result should interpreted with caution the second much smaller sample buyout contains more detailed information making further analysis possible refer this database the database alongside the aforementioned bvd database the database contains information the size the investment and the characteristic the company involved and that for the year which the buyout occurred until the exit far exit had already taken place the most important insight are discussed below holding period and deal characteristic the median holding period for both sample four year for the company that realized exit during the period this comparable the european median furthermore only the company had realized exit this most likely related the influence the crisis this mean that the actual period company held private equity average longer most case private equity fund buy majority stake the database case coinvestors are involved investor who invest along with the private equity fund and nearly case multiple private equity fund participate single deal term the initial investment private equity fund buy from strategic seller case case they buy from other private equity fund and case they buy directly from company owner their family when realizing exit private equity fund choose strategic buyer the time alternatively they sell different private equity fund undertake initial public offering sell family private investor company management case the company written off effect the company the bvd database show higher median growth total asset and earnings for company during the first three year under private equity compared with the control group this suggests that private equity fund are capable either selecting fastgrowing company speeding the growth the company they invest important recall earlier disclaimer selection effect might present also acquisition and disposal these company which often together with private equity investment can lead the creation entirely different company that have little more with the original benchmark the importance this can seen the bvd database where the portfolio company were involved merger and buyout activity the period under private equity ownership compared with the year before the buyout private equity company have more debt this decrease the end the lifetime for those company that subsequently have had exit other finding show how important correct with control group for instance the performance the private equity company show negative trend but relative the control group positive thus company with private equity investor perform better furthermore appears that company that have had earlier exit are the problem child their growth rate negative compared with that the control group the employee perspective term the number employee see increase for the company the large bvd database from one year prior three year after the buyout the control group however show even stronger increase the difference employee growth rate between the private equity company and the control group company not significant also for company with exit the increase the number employee not significantly different from that the control group the number observation here however very limited the cautious conclusion drawn from this that private equity doe fact maintain employment level but ultimately show growth employment number than the control group when the full threeyear period taken into consideration combined with the aforementioned higher growth total asset and earnings compared with the control group this mean that private equity succeeds growing company without corresponding growth employment the investor perspective only have information about the return achieved investor for the small database the median return irr amount for all company combined for the company with exit the irr amounted these return are not adjusted for fee charged the private equity fund tax the large bvd database witness decrease tax paid company the period from one year prior the buyout until three year after the buyout until the moment exit the decrease tax the amount debt probably still underestimated considering that portion the debt often remains the buyout holding this can not ascertained the figure from the database for the database see strong growth earnings and increasing company value addition this there slight decrease ebitda and debt compared with the year which the buyout itself take place information for the year prior the buyout not available the small database also witness increase the number worker measured three year after the buyout alternatively the moment earlier exit take place actually case the latter look the first year after the buyout information for the year prior the buyout not available paid however not large among the control group this decrease part might explained the financial crisis conclusion mentioned earlier the aforementioned finding are based small number observation furthermore major change often occurred the composition the company involved see the disclaimer therefore essential that these finding interpreted and used with due caution much like the rest the world investment private equity fund the netherlands increased strongly the runup the financial crisis fueled part favorable market condition low interest rate advantageous credit condition and good opportunity for selling company the period after the crisis downward correction took place but recovery quickly set overall one observes continued growth private equity over time the study support the view that private equity added value ownership structure not particularly shortterm oriented with horizon typically four seven year due strong financial incentive part because leverage private equity add urgency accomplishing improvement target company private equity involvement brings financial clout expertise and access external network via concentrated ownership also mitigates freerider problem associated with public exchange listed ownership historical term private equity generated return for investor limited partner which above that welldiversified equity portfolio even after deducting cost and the considerable fee are referring here limited partner who participate investor from the outside this history also the most important reason why these investor are eager participate private equity however the spread return large and when adjusted for unfavorable factor like reduced liquidity and higher risk compared with the benchmark there seems significant outperformance for the limited partner our own analysis and the international literature show that private equity investment slightly positive effect company performance general private equityfinanced company our dutch sample grow somewhat faster and are slightly more profitable than comparable company the control group the impact employment slightly negative compared the control group international evidence point marginal net loss employment expected particularly restructurings but going hand hand with gross employment creation the return that private equity fund achieve their investment target company stem from number source operational improvement including adjusting the strategic focus and facilitating growth improving the governance structure aligning interest and strengthening oversight benefit associated with higher leverage investment selection and market timing private equity firm ability track down undervalued buyout candidate and take advantage that reselling them later higher price there are concern however the return for the private equity investor not always true value creation but could based redistribution effect the expense other stakeholder inside and outside the company this important area concern discussion private equity and point possible conflict interest the most important potential conflict interest between private equity fund and other stakeholder are incentive push heavily for fastpaced reorganization too much focused cash payouts high dividend the expense investment the business more generally taking overly opportunistic approach this can result burden for the company employee supplier and customer incentive significantly increase leverage arbitrate reduce tax paid and create via insolvency risk undue burden creditor supplier including deterioration payment term and ultimately employee and customer our conclusion that these conflict undoubtedly arise but that excess have occurred only isolated incident also the likelihood insolvency only slightly higher than company with private equity involvement reason for this include the proximity private equity the company which they invest the ability inject capital when needed and the stronger negotiating position with regard creditor also find systematic evidence harmful effect private equity employment and other stakeholder more rigorous understanding the force leading leverage important given presence private equity investment and the controversy associated with the public debate obvious reason for leverage are the tax saving because the possibility deducting interest payment why such stimulus need provided not clear many country like the netherlands limit are being introduced however private equity investor have also other reason for financing buyout with relatively large amount debt debt make the fund return equity investment more sensitive performance provides extra reward for return enhancing action debt also creates sense urgency the high leverage demand action which particularly important when restructuring needed also enables more investment made with set amount equity this positive impact for example the private equity general partner compensation finally can help the company pushing for concession from other stakeholder due the burden leverage they may more prepared make concession particularly the latter but also the tax benefit point advantage gained the expense other party and thus are based redistribution value rather than real increase the value the company overall one may conclude that leverage exists for several reason and just limiting even abolishing tax benefit will not have disappear but might help contain conflict interest may also arise between the general and limited partner private equity fund the general partner often interest the size the fund and therefore may have different concern than the limited partner the fee structure can also result conflict interest between the general and limited partner general partner are closer the company which the fund invests and extract considerable fee although general partner benefit from having good reputation among limited partner they will need find limited partner the future too ultimately there remains potential for conflict the danger conflict interest must not understated more pressure from the limited partner would welcome development and transparency limited partnership agreement could help bring this about the recent guideline developed the dutch pension fund pggm push this direction but unclear how effective they are and what extent they apply the sector whole appropriate governance both within the buyout company and the organization that the limited partner belong specifically institutional investor crucial these are business transaction involving large institution the scope for government interference limited the end these are business decision and responsibility nevertheless legitimate have concern international standard might offer little protection and transparency limited institutional investor pension fund limited partner might not able offer sufficient counterweight the general partner private equity fund also the transaction process leading buyout deserves attention prior buyout management target company might conflicting situation particular private equity investor have interest acquiring share the target company for little possible because the company management might enticed with the promise postbuyout role including equitybased compensation may have interest driving down the share price prior the transaction this damaging the existing old shareholder and relates the more general topic protecting the interest minority shareholder essential for the company board particularly nonexecutive director take the right position and keep management own interest check and thus protecting existing shareholder another area attention shareholder loan these are considered legitimate source financing their own right the question whether these loan should not treated equity which would therefore make them subordinated other creditor claim this may prevent abuse also the effectiveness current regulation see for example legislation the area director liability the dutch aifm directive and the interaction with insolvency legislation need regularly assessed tax deductibility for the interest paid these loan undesirable the extent that still exists not only worrisome because the burden imposes other taxpayer primarily problematic for the improper conduct entices interest deductibility these loan been abolished the dutch tax plan for conclude further work understanding the impact private equity important private equity play legitimate role but more needed shed light operation particularly for the netherlands significant data problem need resolved access data limited this not just problem for empirical analysis like this study but also limit public acceptance private equity therefore critical that more comprehensive database will created the nederlandse vereniging van participatiemaatschappijen nvp
