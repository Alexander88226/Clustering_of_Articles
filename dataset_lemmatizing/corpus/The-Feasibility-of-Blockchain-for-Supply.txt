bherein filefebruary the feasibility blockchain for supply chain operation and trade finance industry study daniel hellwig bank fellow transatlantic business and finance table content abstract introduction literature review method expert interview research study result benefit realization challenge operation trade finance discussion limitation conclusion acknowledgement reference abstract blockchain transformational potential been heralded across all industry with some particularly enthusiastic voice even comparing emergence that the early internet protocol communication protocol over the past few year have witnessed several enterprise start their distributed ledger technology dlt journey with blockchain the magic bullet for operational process efficiency however company have often jumped into earlystage proof concept poc project without clear roi goal other kpis defined there have been databased quantification impact term investment return realized customer value largescale feasibility study focused process efficiency indeed many company continue invest their poc there have been reported realization efficiency claim even lesson learned this paper present databased perspective the perceived feasibility blockchainbased innovation and value creation for supply chain operation and trade finance while expectation remain high across all region and industry none the study participant indicated financial customer value benefit realization date while technical implementation were executed without major challenge key challenge been the simultaneous adoption solution different ecosystem stakeholder drive actual value realization qualitative review the study result produced critical lesson summarizing the current market perspective blockchain benefit key challenge well realization horizon these result have resounding implication for industry with vision implementing and adopting blockchain technology and can define the nature successful implementation blockchain for supply chain operation and trade finance introduction global trade growing significantly outpacing growth nominal world gdp alone the wto anticipates growth merchandise trade volume the asian development bank adb forecast particularly strong growth emerging market growth for and for despite this inefficiency abound adb estimate the unmet demand for trade finance trillion with asia and africa accounting for and respectively micro small and mediumsized enterprise msmes face the biggest difficulty accessing trade finance representing total rejection last year these are daunting number especially considering that least rejected trade finance transaction had been considered viable therein however lie the promise primarily the cost and complexity antifinancial crime due diligence that caused most rejection capture this immense value going forward firm must willing fundamentally shift from laborious and paperbased process redefine the current global trade finance ecosystem enter blockchain blockchain describes decentralized software platform that enable distributed ledger system citation allows authorized participant track and record transaction and asset the absence single central trust authority bank blockchain network have the capacity create proof ownership across the endtoend trade finance process through digital signature that rely both public and private encryption key only known authorized member thereby curtailing fraud and collusion addition these network also enable peertopeer exchange data asset and currency through rulesbased smart contract set promise agreed between party and encoded software which are performed automatically when agreedupon criterion are met these smart contract are run blockchain the sense generalpurpose computation that take place distributed ledger result payment flow are more efficient transparent and costeffective while also providing temperproof record keeping benton describe the general benefit that blockchain can bring with regard provenance particular they describe how until recently creating accessible and reliably auditable trail information cost prohibitive addition they point the competitive advantage that emerge from the efficiency blockchain promise bring they note that particularly the scm space blockchain promise streamline regulatory and documentary process and potentially even remove the need for audit many situation the implementation such nascent technology not without challenge key issue include the general lack familiarity among market participant well the need integrate this technology with existing legacy system critically not all market participant are incentivized partake this revolution for example the business model many midmarket trade credit fund relies the very existence information asymmetry and the lack market transparency supply chain and trade finance however stand benefit handsomely clark thomson from consensus hypothesized that within the financial service realm trade finance stand benefit significantly especially given mostly paperbased process point the vast potential for the automation and streamlining enablement consistent insurance vehicle and risk modeling and the ability make capital flow cycle independent however enable the seamless and fullyintegrated adoption blockchain within the broader trade finance ecosystem the industry must called upon take concrete global step that facilitate and accelerate sustainable digitization when speaking with alisa dicaprio the head research dicaprio pointed out that small and mediumsize enterprise smes are the group most interested new solution currently smes are the mercy bank oftentimes these organization avoid trade finance product not because they are too expensive but because they can not get them all here blockchain could render smes operation more transparent thereby assisting credit check and kyc process smes are often time too immature properly signal their fitness financers however smes will not the one driving the adoption process feasible approach will heavily rely market leadership key buyer ensure the establishment blockchain technology standard bank will least initially operate node behalf smes addition particularly for the participation smaller supplier infrastructure and subsidy for the operation blockchain node are realistic prospect however while many initial effort have been undertaken across the industry few study addressing tangible benefit have been published furthermore there are study that provide databased industry perspective the perceived feasibility using blockchain from the trade finance space this paper thus aim quantify the market perspective with regard the potential and limitation that dlt visavis the operational process underlying the existing trade finance business model analyzed the perceived applicability supply chain financing and trade finance process specifically investigated how industry expert ass what extent industry participant expect blockchainbased solution impact traditional instrument such letter credit and trade credit insurance well operational process that end conducted sme interview with series trade finance and insurance expert ass existing project well analyze inflight blockchain pocs addition implemented comprehensive field study ass the current pulse the trade finance industry and quantify the perceived feasibility among ecosystem representative addressing these question provide first databased indepth analysis the current market perspective when come the adoption blockchainbased technology for scf process practitioner can therefore gain perspective how the industry perceives current development and where others stand the blockchain adoption journey addition provide overview perceived hindrance and put these perspective for each the industry branch covered finance insurance technology and government the remainder this paper structured six section first present the literature review benefit and feasibility assessment for supply chain finance and trade finance subsequently describe our study method both for the deepdive expert interview and the comprehensive market pulse survey next present the result pulse survey which conducted amongst trade finance industry expert along with discussion the result conclude the article discussing theoretical and practical implication pointing limitation and suggesting path for further research and exploration literature review systematic literature review undertaken estimate the breadth the literature search space because blockchain remains new technology the search horizon limited five year given the large number article discussing the general feature blockchain ensure quality blockchain discussion and credibility the selected resource only peerreviewed scholarly article were captured the term blockchain commonly used but other term such digital ledger distributed ledger shared ledger are common ensure comprehensiveness the keyword string collect article related blockchain technology determined blockchain distributed ledger distributed ledger technology dlt narrow down the research scope trade finance and supply chain finance only article including trade finance supply chain and value chain were selected several article analyzed pointed the various potential and benefit that blockchain can contribute supply chain management and trade finance however none the publication analyzed provided databased figure were based representative study industry expert the assessment therefore remained opinionbased indeed judith and martin point out that existing data supplier and fsps are scarce and that the moderating effect scf market adoption and technological process such blockchainbased scf require additional research part the ibm maersk case study van kralingen quantifies potential benefit part the ibm maersk case study estimating that supplychain operation that could reduce cost approximately percent and increase total global trade volume approximately percent similarly nash describes how blockchainbased pilot walmart led walmart report that more transparent and accurate record transaction blockchain could lead benefit including safer food product enhanced flow provide fresher product customer and boosted consumer trust albeit without citing specific improvement metric the challenge with trade finance and supply chain today that participant are forced use disparate digital system bridged paperbased process with little common standard these digital island work well when everyone the same network but soon there lack connectivity with certain participant using different solution thing quickly revert paper and manual processing their paper mao beyond the mere traceability good alone the author describe system strengthen the effectiveness supervision and management the food supply chain the system gather credit evaluation text from trader smart contract the blockchain and machine learning for semantic analysis their literature review tribis point out that among the paper reviewed key gap appeared the absence any databased performance evaluation within industrial context hofmann year report finding which suggest that the blockchain and dlt could deliver substantial benefit for all party involved scf transaction promising expedite the process and lower the overall cost financing program given the lack primary researchbased assessment comprehensive study among trade finance professional sorely needed quantitatively shed light the perceived feasibility and expectation blockchain technology adoption the market method data for this empirical assessment collected via longform interview with industry expert within the trade finance ecosystem and through the execution research study with industry participant familiar with dlt technology expert interview expert interview were conducted with representative from traditional financial service firm fintech startup dlt technology leader trade insurance and logistics provider well government entity both the united state and europe with the goal painting comprehensive picture the current status the dlt adoption journey with focus trade finance while the adoption maturity varies both traditional company like well fargo and startup like skuchain unequivocally recognize the disruptive potential that dlt technology can bring the existing marketplace the road unlocking this potential while paved may nonetheless require several year even established technology leader like consensys and reckon that the true value realization enabled blockchain technology will ensue only once all ecosystem stakeholder have taken the plunge together type company financial service well fargo american express insurance technology logistics fintech chubb stenn international consensys euler hermes skuchain table list company interviewed part the expert interview research study the initial list prospective participant for the quantitative research study were sourced from base their affiliation with global trade the group that surveyed included representation from finance and insurance industry well dlt technology provides and government regulatory entity the regional representation included the united state europe africa south america and asia all participant were informed that they would receive copy the final report they participated the survey consisted total multiple choice and freetext question aimed probing into different topic with regard the current adoption well the outlook with regard future applicability dlt for the respective organization the topic analyzed included the individual expectation benefit from dlt solution the perceived challenge part this implementation operationsrelated consideration and summary trade financerelated consideration all question asked within the research study are included part the appendix the that received the survey individual completed the questionnaire given the cold nature this survey approach response rate considered high all the survey participant represented finance insurance technology provider and regulatory and legal profession representation from europe strongest with followed north america asia the middle east africa and latin america result half all the survey respondent indicated that their own organization had direct experience with regard implementing blockchain technology among the participant that indicated direct experience inquired where they are the blockchain adoption journey here result appeared mostly aligned the only outlier amongst the insurance representative here indicated that they were currently conducting market collaboration activity figure doe your organization have experience with blockchain technology figure where are you the blockchain adoption journey structured the review the study result four distinct bucket benefit challenge operation and trade finance analyzing the result the group allows point out interesting trend and contrast high benefit expectation without any realization this approach also help the reader absorb the information provided benefit realization key area interest the ability blockchain technology deliver value for adopting organization thus included series question aimed the value generation potential financial otherwise that blockchain technology can bring when inquired after the overall benefit potential from blockchain for their organization general the vast majority participant indicated that they expect benefit realized strongly agree agree somewhat agree approximately indicated that they were undecided and only voiced their skepticism figure organization will benefit from implementing blockchain technology subsequently asked all participant which area within their organization that believed would stand benefit the most from the introduction blockchain technology setup answer possibility between business technology and operational benefit order measure the type benefit that the individual group would expect while finance technology and governmental institution appear see the potential for benefit across the board business technology and operation representative from the insurance space indicated that they not expect any operational benefit within their space whatsoever interestingly participant also indicated that they look blockchain technology help establish interoperability standard figure which area within your organization could benefit the most from blockchain second set question aimed the benefit horizon with regard time wanted know how quickly participant expect see tangible benefit general and when they expect see any return investment from blockchain technology for both provided mutually exclusive answer choice grouped into five distinct bucket already year year year and never when come the general impact blockchain technology different horizon expectation industry the majority finance respondent indicated expectation fundamental impact within year figure while expecting tangible return only later year among the technology and governance respondent the majority expected impact year technology respondent also expect benefit within the same time frame while the expectation amongst the governance participant equally distributed across all the horizon bucket representative from the insurance industry had the longest expectation horizon for both impact and benefit for both category the largest group respondent expects impact and benefit only within year horizon when asked they expect true moment disruption the vast majority affirming respondent originated within the finance group perhaps interestingly though not surprisingly for people familiar with the latest round blockchain pocs not single participant indicated having realized any benefit financial otherwise now figure the spread blockchain will fundamentally impact the operation industry challenge addition the benefit blockchain also asked all participant about their perspective the key hindrance and bottleneck when come the implementation blockchain first asked participant about the key hindrance that they see when come the adoption blockchain the first place and specifically about the challenge that blockchain might bring when integrated into existing system figure investment blockchain will produce tangible return cost reduction customer value creation depicted figure below the three key concern consistent across the board are perceived lack subject matter expertise regulatory legal uncertainty and the perceived risk low adoption overall the concern low adoption particularly strongly expressed representative within the realm insurance and government surprisingly for insurance respondent the lack absence industry standard not seem point concern addition all group not see particularly concerned with regard the availability talent the marketplace figure which the following may hinder the implementation blockchain when asked specifically about potential integration challenge the key concern for respondent across the board the current absence industry standard figure addition all group cited the general lack experience when come the implementation dlt figure what are key challenge for integrating blockchain into existing legacy system when asked about the overall talent availability for blockchain implementation general respondent opinion were consistent across all inscope industry group overall respondent acknowledged lack available talent today from outlook perspective participant were divided whether the talent will available eventually whether will not when asked about potential operational risk with regard blockchainbased operation the key area concern included the absence legal authority the risk hacking and the possibility fraud general when separately asked about relevant legal consideration the notion jurisdictional uncertainty especially with regard smart contract law consider the biggest concern far operation the next section asked all participant about their concrete experience well their expectation when come the implementation blockchainbased product and service were interested their preferred mode implementation well the type blockchain they were looking deploy overall respondent indicated strong preference for blockchain implementation using packagedtype product sap when asked explicitly indicated that they would prefer using nonproprietary product while only stated that they would prefer build solution inhouse when asked about their preferred blockchain flavor for implementation all industry group indicated strong preference for consortiumowed blockchain deployment effectively none the participating respondent indicated preference for public blockchain technology figure what kind blockchain you think will the key for largescale adoption also accordance with the selected blockchain approach most participant indicated the same preference when come the question network interoperability for multilateral approach blockchain that run and maintained industry consortium addition participant indicated lack the knowledge make informed decision when come interoperability trade finance when ask about the potential and specific applicability blockchain technology for end endtoend process trade finance transaction the fast majority survey responder expressed great optimism total all participant either strongly agreed agreed that blockchain will streamline the trade finance process contrast only participant indicated that they not expect the process streamlined result dlt adoption their organization figure blockchain can streamline the endtoend process trade finance transaction similarly most survey participant also indicated that addition the adoption blockchain technology itself the simultaneous modernization existing legacy system modernization key consideration for the enablement trade finance efficiency when come tangible trade finance process benefit the survey participant response were once again streamlined the vast majority expects benefit from process time reduction process transparency enhancement and overall process risk reduction discussion the previous analysis analyzed four domain ass the feasibility leveraging blockchain technology from the perspective professional within the trade finance space starting with benefit realization observe several surprising trend from balance sheet perspective trade finance still the bread and butter lucrative business revenue have increased overall with bcg predicting revenue growth roughly year for trade finance this sort revenue firm best interest recurrent and independent interest rate thereby providing steady income stream trade finance provides corporation with complete and integrated transaction banking offering presenting invaluable crossselling potential east partner trade finance report project that trade finance fee can bring and crossborder payment fee and other revenue the fact that most study participant foresaw strong potential for the adoption blockchain technology can linked the intricacy integrating the abovedescribed process hypothesize that blockchain technology can therefore significantly simplify integration and transaction especially leveraging smart contract another interesting trend the value expectation industry while finance representative see value opportunity across the entire spectrum activity business operation and technology representative from insurance see business opportunity only and operational gain whatsoever one the one hand one can assume that the very nature insurance contract lends itself well for automation which would fall into the realm business application the other the notion disruption for insurance general given the significant simplification the entire industry that smart contractbased policy could bring about not being considered here accordingly when asked about the disruptive potential blockchain the majority indicated they were unsure whether there would such moment disruption when speaking with pierre sin from the euler hermes digital lab gleaned further indicator for the long adoption time for blockchain euler had initially started research and build solution independently primarily get initial exposure however since the company focused collaborating with the main consortium blockchain development intrinsically networkbased endeavor the key bottleneck the establishment standard naturally with many ecosystem participant the agreement shared standard will take time enhancing transparency the risk resulting from the lack visibility the conventional trade finance model the primary catalyst for the increasing cost capital using technology like blockchain expected minimize risk and reduce the cost capital shareholder essentially blockchain stand significantly improve the value chain integrating the movement good transaction processing and payment the technology bridge the chasm between buyer and seller two way reducing the prevalence manual process well automating and digitizing paper documentation unifying the wide array disparate party involved the supply chain establishing shared standard streamlining data the current endtoend trade finance process single transaction may exact data field document interaction data flow through this process decreasing share these field create valueadding data with roughly registered ignoretransmit the next party realistically there are only unique relevant data field such reference number date supplier and amount the current model these unique data field are reused time this complicates the transaction process increase the risk discrepancy and expands the extent redundant activity ultimately threatening significantly delay already lengthy process and increase fraud and error exposure fraudulent activity the recent year have been the billion dollar however they still only account for small fraction the overall trade finance volume potentially explaining why fraud only considered key application case for mere respondent bcg estimate that blockchain technology can streamline this endtoend trade finance process while enhancing transparency and reducing overlaperror simplifying potentially eliminating altogether more than data field interaction addition intricate nature the process behind trade finance transaction also creates long paper trail and may take between day exchange all relevant documentation lastly blockchain entry are updated each participant the network reflect the most recent transaction thereby obviating the need for multiple physical copy the same document information the information stored numerous ledger across various entity the network all necessary information can stored single blockchain which save time and improves data transparency and accuracy challenge the key adoption challenge pointed out the survey participant included perceived lack subject matter expertise legal and jurisdictional uncertainty and overall low adoption the notion jurisdictional uncertainty also highlighted maloney from stenn international trade finance investment fund pointed out that for reliable operation stenn only deal with jurisdiction with more predictable common law situation place another key aspect addition legislation the implementation ability while india for example strong law place any jurisdictional process tend prohibitively slow especially when dealing with smaller entity indeed manufacturing contribution india come from smes defined usd today market environment the provision financing for this market limited and requires technology automation were possible and trade could aggregated larger volume this would result attractive return capital invested both for bank and specialty finance company the concern low adoption concern expressed representative within the realm insurance and government this notion also echoed euler hermes while the company multiple occasion witnessed consortium bring together multiple ecosystem participant for test transaction bank insurer and enterprise little progress materialized operationalized for once product deployed larger scale you find that system are not uptodate anymore and that people lose interest when launched one their earliest dlt prototype significant amount internal infrastructure had upgraded due the required realtime capability often time when people describe the advantage dlt they are really describing the benefit the internet and not dltspecific aspect another key consideration the absence standard which appeared relevant for all participant except for insurance representative without coherency and unification crossing the two different supply chain buyer seller the market vulnerable fragmentation circumstance under which the promised omnichannel consistency blockchain technology will fail hence the implementation and adoption data standard and protocol imperative for any blockchain based trade finance service there been some progress this regard the form the bank payment obligation bpo initiative additionally ucp the latest version the rule that govern letter credit transaction worldwide solves this for letter credit dltenabled smart contract need equivalent set standard and procedure from business perspective the biggest operational problem when come servicing trade finance product are paperbased process christopher lewis the global head trade service well fargo made this very clear ever since the early when there massive push for retailer source good oversees the biggest customer complaint been reduce the paper from the system the initial solution for this the rollout big system mainly oracle and sap the bank had build interface tie going forward lewis see the potential for blockchain technology the biggest advantage from his point view the standardization that the adoption process will drive addition lewis see big potential for the handling process transaction once blockchainbased solution find mainstream adoption imago more efficient process with local bank hsbc providing financing asia and then handing over this transaction different institution different region key hindrance for such solution today transfer physical shipping document would largely vanish all information would available within the decentralized ledger system finally lewis expects shift product focus today usbased smes would like more business overseas however currently this only possible via letter credit with the supporting bank enabling nonrecourse discounting once the good are shipped and document provided the ability using open account process however limited these would always require near total insurance coverage meet regulatory requirement with blockchainbased solution this limitation would not change but much more streamlined process could enabled where financial service insurance logistics and other stakeholder can interact more efficiently integration one the most surprising outcome the survey voicing strong interest packaged solution product for blockchain this trend notable across all industry representation part the survey this response patter also congruent with the respondent indication preference for consortiumoperated blockchain rather than any shared model this applies both for the preferred model overall well for the interaction different blockchain the interest blockchainasaservice offering whether packaged software product consortiumprovided use model could the result the overall lack knowledge when come blockchain implementation well the notion around lack industry standard general the lack standard within the industry made integrating the disparate source data necessary grant buyer seller and any required intermediary interface the network hindered previous initiative from successfully automating the global trade finance industry without having entirely overthrow legacy system and introducing disconnected technology infrastructure the party involved the trade finance process will need flexible tool map the process document and payment the big question therefore how can company best integrate this technology with their existing operating model this context euler hermes explained that client are very much behind with regard technology result readymade solution corda are easier adopt since they are significantly more similar what company already know and understand because this that euler hermes expects corda become the technology choice with regard blockchain implementation while there are genuine promise the longterm benefit blockchain technology implementation costly must often developed for the specific firm question did you get estimate for this from any the interview additionally skill set and human capital are required maintain the technology efficiently hence firm must train find qualified personnel platform like corda for example only provides solution that work like the internet originally supposed easy way share information standardized confidential controlled fashion amongst multiple application for euler hermes appears logical that controlled platform are only interim step once all problem pertaining security and confidentiality have been resolved the company expect the emergence and wide adoption public platform ala hyperledger final interesting outcome the significant number respondent across the board who indicated their concern with regard high energy need for blockchain maintenance given the near complete selection consortiumoperated blockchain ledger energy consumption not technical concern this outcome line with the beforementioned notion nascent knowledge which amply expressed the participant themselves trade finance the participant opinion with regard the potential blockchain for trade finance operation were line with the overall market excitement total participant indicated that they believe blockchain will streamline the endtoend trade finance process this amusing especially since approximately half these respondent had indicated earlier that they had experience with blockchain whatsoever the benefit most prevalently expected the participant such process time reduction process transparency enhancement and overall process risk reduction notable increase trade finance accessibility one the key advantage from our perspective and one the biggest challenge today world contrast only pointed out the participant this finding critical reaffirms the strong focus the industry blockchain technology for operational efficiency and not for the enabling new product this however unsurprising earlier estimation focused the operationsrelated cost saving the dependence redundant manual process and paper decline blockchain trade finance can cut cost between billion and billion over year driven primarily through the following collaborative digitization intelligent automation smart contract usage the benefit case for blockchainbased innovation applies primarily operational efficiency these however will inturn enable new product well market expansion transaction cost will cheaper will crucial for the industry look beyond the operational efficiency blockchain alone and consider other new product that are enabled this technology dlt the potential significantly change the trade finance aspect supply chain management natural fit blockchain technology will help drive efficiency through the ecosystem improve the endtoend process for all player while significantly lowering cost the short term firm are encouraged champion immediate initiative reduce risk improve service and reduce the costtoserve documentary trade the marginal cost and effort required serve client continues drop firm should look small and mediumsized enterprise smes build scale lower trade finance cost are simultaneously expected increase demand realizing the benefit dlt technology requires the successful aggregation the following initiative facilitating the flow trade receivables enabling transparency trade asset movement reducing dispute and fraud provide delivery and payment certainty understanding the underlying information fabric data point that support transaction player supply chain will help with more accurate risk pricing and ultimately the creation new product and service data flow must have unique purpose and path their logistic interaction with other entity involved avoid redundancy and duplication additionally firm must shift digitizing document order navigate the everevolving landscape trade finance achieving scale and lower unit cost will imperative trade becomes more commoditized and the customer increasingly focused cost currently estimated that the cost processing physical trade paperwork billion this compliance cost transaction value under the right circumstance digitizing the paperdominated industry and implementing blockchain technology the capacity substantially reduce and eliminate this cost altogether this line thought smart contract are expected streamline the trade financing process hardwiring the various element agreement between party into automatically executing code for example imported good may scanned immediately upon arrival the destination prompting automatic signal the smart contract which would then authorize the release fund the exporter the case where party require further assurance delivery the good could also geotagged that the smart contract would only trigger the release the fund upon receipt two confirmation the scan the good upon arrival and the gpsbased signal confirming that delivery location correct the adoption blockchain technology trade finance doe not necessarily entail complete overhaul legacy system bank for example should focus creating digital ringfence with internal system digitized and built around the flow data paper use decline bank could rework the interface rather than creating entire new business process system and data flow from scratch bank should see startup technology firm and fintechs potential partner rather than threat limitation despite being first kind something like that our study also several limitation limited our study the speci impact blockchainbased technology supply chain and trade finance exciting avenue for future research would investigate the project that the survey participant have already worked and the result that they have obtained addition when considering the overall ecosystem would informative the participant have already worked collaboratively with other ecosystem participant however having derived testable proposition future research might test them largescale study related domain determine how many further limitation the large number participant from european rms plausible assume that distinct banking and industrial context might alter the perspective the blockchain adoption process well benefit expectation limited use electronic banking and strong use check india however unclear how these contextual change would impact the result for example particularly region where supplier access nancial market more restricted they might demanding innovation such blockchainbased scf even stronger than european american supplier finally our study capture snapshot the feasibility perspective across multiple firm and role would interesting study rms longitudinally this would reveal each follows the innovation adoption process detected this research our study also reveals further adjacent research topic which might guide researcher interested the domain blockchainbased scf would therefore interesting broaden the research upstream innovation more than one type innovation combination blockchain and aibased automation second reader will benefit from analysis the scf innovation from the viewpoint specifically the supplier further complement our understanding upstream innovation this approach might also reveal further success factor for the implementation scf conclusion blockchain technology the potential revolutionize the trade finance process reducing operational complexity and transaction cost while also redefining value chain interaction core blockchain decentralized software platform that enables distribution ledger system dlt allows authorized participant track and record transaction and asset the absence single central trust authority such bank blockchain network have the capacity create proof ownership across the endtoend trade finance process using digital signature that rely both public and private encryption key only known authorized member thus curtailing fraud addition these network also enable peertopeer exchange data asset and currency through rulesbased smart contract set promise agreed between party and encoded software which are performed automatically when criterion are met result payment flow become more efficient transparent and costeffective while also providing temperproof record keeping across the board market participant see the potential for the adoption blockchain technology for both operational element well new business product addition there overall acknowledgement and awareness the limiting factor and hindrance that have yet considered additional key observation that none the study participant have realized any blockchain delivered benefit financial otherwise key challenge the success blockchain technology trade finance the threat market fragmentation there must unified series player consolidated under one seamless technology initiative that client may use naturally given the strong element network effect financial service this championed strong focus the establishment banking consortium around the development and adoption blockchainbased solution for trade finance and supply chain management while significant progress been made this space blockchain technology still infancy true set standard not been defined yet the momentum progress key player will face significant challenge before reaching seamless and revolutionary integration blockchain however made aware such challenge and with the appropriate knowledge and guidance firm will undoubtedly able take rewarding stride towards integrating blockchain their current trade finance process analyzing and interpreting directly collect study response from trade finance industry leader our study mark rst cornerstone the exploration this important and fast evolving eld blockchainbased innovation for supply chain operation and trade finance furthermore pave the way for future research into ecosystem stakeholder expectation expected blockchain adoption timeframes and underlying rationale different industry branch well the behavior and investment patter that can expected result acknowledgement thank the american council germany acg for continued support throughout the research process also thank
