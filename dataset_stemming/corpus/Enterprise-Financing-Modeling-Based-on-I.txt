the right remedi order make improv and enhanc the competit financ model evalu although the sme invest and financ market the boom some sme still could not get away from the financ difficulti the reason the select mechan mutualtrust and mutualbenefit hadn establish the inform screen model had built bridg for the investor and financi great benefit solv the problem asymmetr inform for the sme higher index the screen model right model first the financ cost had reduc the screen mechan sme the higher index could tri avoid advers select and would not have rais interest rate for financ the lower one not onli return for the symmetri but also reduc the financ cost second credibl had been reflect object most peopl had the stereotyp sme that the small scale compani would poor credibl and low index fact plenti sme were not lack good busi reput therefor the inform screen mechan would safeguard the right those enterpris for the sme lower index the screen model relief model under the screen model chanc would place all the sme had find their own defici and make improv for the favor investor one hand they should enhanc the credibl and reduc the default risk the other hand they should improv the

improv the qualiti the inform the probabl moral hazard would declin rapidli addit the perform capac higher index enterpris were satisfactori and the default risk would also maintain lower level conclus applic the screen model would chang the origin lemon market for the financi accur and time disclosur privat inform investor could better grasp the market and make object choic due the improv
