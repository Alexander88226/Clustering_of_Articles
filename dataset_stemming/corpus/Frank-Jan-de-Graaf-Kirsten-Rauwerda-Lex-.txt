inform and substanti all plan and forecast the financi advis play major role thi part the process gener bank and crowdfund platform request the same inform from sme howev crowdfund platform often more flexibl brainstorm about how substanti the turnov for instanc the interviewe felt that bank did look rather lot the rearview mirror especi the case smaller sme and smaller financ requir bank often look onli the histor inform compani they also often want suppli standard digit format which hardli ani forecast can includ thi type develop significantli reduc the chanc success for smaller loan applic some bank also want inform place portal when appli for financ inform that then come directli their system financi advis see thi costcut measur which work deleg the client the client doe not enter thi inform into the portal the bank charg handl fee you say want have ton credit with the bank then that absolut the standard approach what more even for our intermediari becom difficult find onestop shop but that not nice you entrepreneur with nice busi you good job and the door keep get slam your face like that sorri but just can anyth for you herey have call our call centr for credit request lower than inform and entrepreneur not onli the combin bank and inform that mention frequent inform and entrepreneur were also mention veri frequent combin time for all financi not onli inform about the compani but also about the entrepreneur themselv vital import figur the number time the risk associ with financ are mention dure interview entrepeneurcollaterallif cycl stagesizesector accord advis the level knowledg that entrepreneur sme have vari consider one entrepreneur doesn have the first clue often the smaller entrepreneur while anoth can arrang everyth themselv without the help advis there are also entrepreneur who are curiou and who get activ involv new develop while other not understand them veri much and not realli want learn about them ani detail addit some entrepreneur wonder whether parti they not know are fact reliabl for advis sme import discuss open discuss dure the orient phase the advisori process what entrepreneur expect and object are and what the compani situat what kind product and market the entrepreneur activ and gener what need not crucial that the advis have the best financ make sure that the fund and the financi are good fit for the entrepreneur all partiesthi appli micro small and mediums enterprisesfor all parti true that they want the best overview the prefer busi with few differ parti possibl and prefer with parti where continu the card take crowdaboutnow for instanc that requir huge effort the part the entrepreneur themselv becaus they have grab the bull the horn and get their network all fire and that certainli not someth that everi entrepreneur can pull off that easili sometim you think might suit you but then the entrepreneur see that they themselv are not all interest thing that way and had entrepreneur where thought well that perfect fit for you the whole crowdfund thing but then turn out later that well actual after quick form financ and don want have put too much effort put into get solut crucial that the entrepreneur abl choos the financ solut that best suit them the advis can advis the client but the client who ultim decid what they want advis sme indic that import that they know what type entrepreneur they are deal with well what kind motiv vision and mission but then also what their need and prefer are one entrepreneur can not stand bank while anoth just the opposit accord advis sme some entrepreneur often the older one find difficult publish their data and forecast crowdfund platform they think thi sensit inform from the competit standpoint addit crowdfund campaign often cost lot time energi and money that entrepreneur must will spend for financi import know entrepreneur age educ and experi and whether they alreadi have strong track record are just start out ani experi employe fundament differ from busi for oneself addit inform about client and competitor lender also want know how entrepreneur built their new exist busi and what they have done that end perhap they have been bit passiv some advis also take their client the financi they themselv can tell them all about their compani and show their enthusiasm advis want show that entrepreneur with sme have good understand how busi work and that they know what they are talk about these aspect the entrepreneur are reflect both financi attitud and how much the financ they offer cost entrepreneur often know what they are strong but they are often not focus their weak success applic for financ should abl show both entrepreneur strength but also how they can come grip with their compani weak spot one advis said thi also import reason whi some entrepreneur are unabl get financ when come their busi they not have all their duck line row thi advis also said alway possibl get loan you entrepreneur can offer exit option and good rate return financi whether the financi bank privateequ entiti some other investor request for financ that demonstr too littl pragmat and betray too much opportun the part entrepreneur have chanc succeed bank and cost bank have the advantag abl offer low interest rate and high volum the market thi give them huge amount power when come financ sme entrepreneur and their advis will alway look bank for financ the first instanc thi the most inexpens way secur fund that gener the percept the market and the interview show that most case the bank the cheapest option financ bank possibl thi also recommend financi advis nevertheless still happen that bank charg rel high rate for bank loan from and that mean that other form financ such crowdfund are hardli possibl all the cost bank charg can not separ from lack flexibl the bank part from the speed with entrepreneur want their applic process categori cost the most import factor consid factor that expens that expens form but you get cash immedi you immedi get liquid bank are inexpens and fast compar the other possibl factor rather expens form financ financ bank seem cheap but the risk increas the rate increas and come close the other form bank and leas leas reason straightforward and suitabl for the cofinanc invest machineri and transport advis spend rel littl time leas applic leas also easi combin with bank financ one the first option advis will mention along with bank crowdfund and factor when come the wellknown financ product leas also offer the bank themselv bank and life stage bank are keen offer financ where the busi model and the entrepreneur have demonstr track record they are look for predict and pattern recur turnov they are much more cautiou with startup onli startup with that special someth can expect financ bank startup are often better off with crowdfund privat equityventur capit possibl leas the case machin and famili friend and fool the proport bank financ increas with the matur the compani starter are often better off with crowdfund platform than with bank but starter with silver line then you can use also bank deposit bank and starter that not realli the logic combin anymor often use factor especi for highgrowth busi when come entrepreneur who have veri flexibl demand for work capit will soon look debtor financ becaus that chang with the growth shrinkag that take place bank and criteria bank and the criteria they set for sme client were mention time the advis sme who were interview what strike that most peopl say that the criteria that sme meet order obtain bank financ are constantli chang credit analyst like that the bank spend the whole day look applic behind close door doe thi guy ever get out and about refinanc often difficult becaus the big bank have agre with each other not solv each other problem you have problem with one bank you won get foot the door anoth bank thi one the most difficult thing keep with for advis some organis keep central record for their advis the polici bank thi respect determin from the top down and the contact person with whom financi advis commun must also keep thi mandat may that one bank want financ sector one week and longer the next week there are also major differ among bank accord the advis thi everyth with basel solvenc requir and the percept risk bank are constantli awar the solvenc requir their loan portfolio for thi reason advis say bank have also becom stricter their lend standard previous for exampl bank would say that compani had suffici capit within three year would will financ bank are now say that there must suffici capit the outset cost and time the cost advic mention time and time mention time are domin aspect the financ process onli the inform request the entrepreneur mention more frequent time see figur figur the number time the element the advic process were mention dure interview entrepreneur informationcoststimecriterianetworkrefusalfeasibilityskillsacquisitionsystemsmonitoringaccount time and cost are mention the interviewe time combin these are import consider for the process becaus the more hour advis must charg the higher the cost the advic will clear from the interview that financi advic from advis sme usual too expens especi for startup and sole proprietor who want expand need some extra financi latitud that case the amount financ need can not justifi the cost the advic addit there group sme that can pay littl for financi advic but not too much there group financi advis who can provid thi short time with kind hitandrun approach the advis help the entrepreneur just onc with the financ requir and the advis and the entrepreneur then part way sme with littl more room for manoeuvr can afford moreextens financi advic there also group advis who focu these these advis also take the financi structur the compani into account their analysi and also look toward the futur financi pictur form financ that are opt for now will also have impact flexibl and the rang option the futur there seem thi score kind dichotomi the market for financi advic the one hand there group advis who focu smaller sme and who use hitandrun approach keep the hour they put and the cost they incur minimum the other hand there group advis who have longerterm relationship with sme and who can assist them more extens with advic not onli their current financ need but also the financi structur and the futur the compani question the latter cours cost more the advis time and result steeper bill ration consider and heurist when analys the codif with regard unconsci habit heurist and their counterpart consciou consider base ration econom argument strike that the number time interviewe refer ration consider much greater than the number time they actual make statement that can trace back one the three accept sociopsycholog heurist affect avail and confirm see figur tri regard everi question about financ tailormad and see what can help that entrepreneur both right now and the longer term stack financ particularli interest for grow compani network that what all about thi world network ourselv like crazi thi give financi advis the impress that they are alway care consid the dozen exist form financ from the analysi the codifi form financ howev appear that the advis are talk primarili about bank loan revolv credit from bank and leas and factor whether from bank other entiti the most frequent chosen form other form financ are sometim mention but they come much less frequent advis repertoir figur the number time heurist and ration consider are mention ration considarationconfirmationavailibilityaffectrepresent discuss financi advis sme seem take rather similar approach they have rather similar idea what their role and what client and other expect them howev distinct can made between organis there the hitandrun way work quick advic financ with rel few hour spent give advic and there are organis that provid financi advic look the longer term too and that build relationship with the entrepreneur more hour are spent give advic and thu higher cost are incur than hitandrun way work the concept heurist quit difficult put into oper the wellknown heurist are sometim discuss state number time that someth must feel good affect heurist interviewe also seem opt
