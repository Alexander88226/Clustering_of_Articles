could competitive advantage institution whose current operation consist grant receive deposit public state freixas rochet require simultaneous performance three distinct activity transform characteristic financial asset liability supply service gathering processing information barba navaretti first activity mainly achieve maturity transformation take short term source finance turn longterm borrowing mortgage fundamental economic system allows funding longterm investment thus stimulate productivity simultaneously protect depositor nonsystematic liquidity shock thanks ease provide liquidity customer able accomplish second abovestated activity well offering service service form field great interest major form broad plenty opportunity particular interest emerge country eventually third key activity information processing include task related exante assess potential borrower expost track behavior buildup management welldiversified portfolio maximizes return respect existence three service provide rationale existence reasonably bundle within one institution therefore deeper analysis activity drawn upon understand potential effect banking industry transmute feature financial asset liability first main task especially maturity transformation make diversified pool size depositor deal effect idiosyncratic liquidity shock put aside limited cushion liquid asset concede longerterm thanks unlikeliness depositor could withdraw simultaneously core capability deliver liquidity service liquidity management service unlikely provide company would specific

depositor thanks maturity transformation achieve much wider portfolio diversification individual depositor could obtain contrary peerto peer crowdfunding platform provide diversification investor would would add part book issue security fall either banking regulation security regulation fact financial intermediary currently apply agency profit commission fee paid side transaction retain generate interfere price therefore company likely high liability riskier asset portfolio mean far also implement innovative information management technology regulatory arbitrage exclude threat activity liquidity realm seem limited move second key service provide regard strongly related ability provide liquidity management customer liquidity much well pay directly deposit account indeed barba navaretti reason many nonbank financial intermediary well nonfinancial institution company recently emerge service take advantage large client base example mpesa mobile phonebased money transfer

service offering high interest despite incapability neither earn interest margin provide maturity transformation exploit fractional reserve requirement also implementation blockchain technology would boost digital virtual currency expand nonfinancial nonbanks institution could flourish blockchain technology register kind information permanently digital ledger manipulate guarantee actual legitimacy transaction state notary intermediate lastly involve third major activity information processing whole financial set upon information information management recent development related technology affected three different aspect storage processing transfer availability information fintechs take two diametrically oppose approach whereas latter mostly exploit soft relationshipbased information

industry near future also example innovative technology could implement banking industry give first scenario analyse well one modernisation digitisation incumbent financial insitutions brought upon case traditional innovate keep core banking service customer relationship implement enable technology transform current business traditional usually pressure improve cost efficiency customer

provide value proposition could effectively offer current infrastructure technology adopt nonfinancial innovator also put action incumbent instance biometry chatbots artificial intelligence might help sophisticated way sustain valueadded remote customer relationship keep transtactions safe reduce fraud bcbs many incumbent already introduce mobile service employ service offer third party innovative service would support well scenario fact customer could believe traditional would provide safer transaction nonbanks alternative would however although early sign suggest incumbent player increase investment digitisation modernisation strategy plan still see magnitude scenario actually dominant second scenario consider one incumbent financial instituions replace challenger accord scenario traditional able adapt incoming technologyenabled disruption thus supplant neobanks establish bigtechs fully digitalize banking platform provide costeffective innovative banking service implementation advanced technology may receive banking license exist regulatory system may traditional financial institution partner neobanks german chinese webank move away branchcentred customer relationship thanks technologybased relationship may able exploit innovative instrument low cost quickly uptodate manner compare incumbent player due fact neobanks constrain legacy infrastructure say evidence

financial service become progressively modularised incumbent still capture enough share survive several business rise provide specialise service focus specific niche without attempt become universal retail business may decide compete ownership whole customer relationship incumbent challenge provide core banking service customer relationship distribute scenario delivery financial service share

improve customer experience innovative way point entity manage platform enough resource compete incumbent own customer relationship therefore relegate mere commoditised function provider carry basic service management operational play role service provider abovestated platform operate customer relationship currently relegate scenario seem unlikely due extreme assumption however example

financial industry customer interact directly financial service provider intermediary therefore replace leaner agile platform base stateoftheart technology effectively secure direct match end user depend financial requirement borrowing raise make customer direct approach choose financial service provider scenario justify inutility intermediary however also may expose high perform transaction bearing whole responsibility instance peertopeer lending industry common customer would lender borrower depend therefore expose either former conduct latter extreme scenario seem far reality near future however example component disintermadiated scenario already happen example include cryptocurrencies ensure value transfer without involve incumbent intermediary public distribute ledger
