However only since 2014 has the sector attracted the focused attention of regulators consumers and investors.

An evolutionary approach to create a framework of understanding is necessary to understand the implications for established financial institutions IT companies startups and regulators alike. \\x0cFinTech Evolution and Typology \\x0cEvolution FinTech is often seen today as the new marriage of financial services and information technology. However this interlinkage has a long history and has evolved over three distinct time periods.

Better to break down highlevel approaches (e.g. risk or productbased) and complement them with a subset of specific regulations (eg payments AML).  Broadly speaking financial regulators have 4 main mandates     Prudential Regulation Financial  Stability  Conduct & Fairness Competition & Development \\x0cRegulatory implications Many  startups  use  technology  to  disintermediate  banks  and  directly  propose  their services or products to consumers (eg Telco providing payment services).  This creates a set of questions  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2   \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 How  to  balance  startup  low  cost  models  and  agility  benefits  with  compliance \\xef\\x83\\xa8  Who  can/should  provide  financial  services  or  products?  (eg  Telcos  or Banks) Increasingly a blurred line  costs?   \\xef\\x83\\xa8  Banking  licence  restrictions  limits  business  model  freedom  (eg  mobile   money balance acting as a current account)   \\x0cRegulatory threshold New  emerging  FinTech  companies  often  have  limited  track  records  regarding  their business  (eg  risk  management  liquidity  and  profitability)  and  difficulty  identifying their obligations (eg applicable regulations or licences).  For  regulators  these  earlystage  companies  represent  a limited  prudential  & consumer  risk.  However  exponential  company  growth  can  create  \\xe2\\x80\\x9crisk  blind  spots\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Additionally frequent failures or fraud can impact market or investor confidence.  Too Small to Care Tacit acceptance  Too Large to Ignore Licensing obligation  Too Big   to Fail \\x0cRisk blindspots Using size (eg small large systemic) as a way to evaluate risk is not adequate given interconnectedness  of  financial  markets  and  rapid  uptake  of  certain  financial products.  Today  some  small  companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99  path  to  become  systemic  is  not  linear  but exponential  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Kenya (2008) In three years Mpesa was being used by over 18 million customers and 43% of Kenya\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GDP was flowing thru this service   \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 China  (2014)  Third  party  mobile  payment  market  reached  1433  trillion  yuan  a +400% increase compared to 278 trillion exchanged in 2013 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 China (2014) Yu\\xe2\\x80\\x99e Bao a money market fund part of Ant Financial Group (Alibaba) held  over  US$  90billion  (e.g.  4th  largest  in  the  world)  just  10  months  after  its creation \\x0c New risks New business models and delivery mechanisms create new sets of risks  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 P2P platform capital buffers during credit cycle change or interest rate liberalisation \\xef\\x81\\xb1 2.5% deposits vs 15% P2P lenders (eg warning over 1250 platforms in China) \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Money Market Fund (MMF) maturity mismatch enhanced by technology \\xef\\x81\\xb1 Technology facilitation of ondemand redemptions (eg \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmobile app bank run\\xe2\\x80\\x9d)  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Liquidity problems for mobile money agents to meet large withdrawal requests \\xef\\x81\\xb1 Can undermine public confidence but also slows scalability of the solution  Scalability of process policies and risk management frameworks \\xef\\x81\\xb1 Particularly  for  companies  with  exponential  growth  (eg  loan  origination \\xe2\\x80\\xa2quality) \\x0cRegulatory innovation Since 2008  national and international regulators have been focused  on drafting and implementing  reactive  regulations  covering  the  causes  of  the  GFC  to  avoid  its repetition.  However  the  increased  layering  of  regulations  and  compliance  cost facilitated the emergence of new FinTech startups.   There is nonetheless a set of proactive regulations emerging to allow for innovative businesses propositions to emerge eg  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 US Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act 2012 (JOBS Act) \\xef\\x83\\xa8 Alternative financing \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 EU Payment System Directive 2008 \\xef\\x83\\xa8 Realtime payments \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 UK Small Business Enterprise and Employment Bill \\xef\\x83\\xa8 Loan referral to P2P \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 HK  Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP)\\xef\\x83\\xa8 Automated bill payments \\x0cInstitutional change Regulatory supervision by specialist bodies focused on products appears inadequate when looking at the rate of technological progress. This can  create grey areas as to which  body  should  be  regulating  a  specific  business  (eg  insurance  companies performing banking activities in the US pre2007).  Thus financial innovation driven by technology is preferably overseen in the context of a  twin  peaks  /  functional  model  such  as  in  the  UK  or  Australia.  This  is  particularly relevant in jurisdictions that have more a sectoral approach.  Product Based Approach Vs Functional Based Approach (eg United States China Hong Kong) (eg United Kingdom Australia) \\x0cRecent approaches in Asia Unlike US and EU where FinTech sector emergence was driven by the private sector first in Asia governments and regulators are often seeking to lead   esahP ssenerawASingapore Involvement with FinTech Accelerator + consultation Australia ASIC creates Innovation Hub  Hong Kong SFC on the government FinTech Steering Group South Korea  Simplifying retail banking  licence for tech firms New Zealand Lifting investment criteria's for equity crowdfunding China Comprehensive strategy  esahPevita lsigeL\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig data\\xe2\\x80\\x99 regulatory online reporting and analytics among other technologies  could  create  a  new generation of  UK regulatory technology (RegTech)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d RegTech Blackett  Report  (UK)  government  recognizes  the  new  challenges  but  also  opportunities brought by the FinTech sector.

USA  51 Jurisdictions National Regulation Homogeneous Market    Vs APAC 25 Jurisdictions Vs Europe   27 Jurisdictions Harmonized Regulation Homogeneous Market   25 sets of behaviours  25 sets of  regulations 25 sets of  infrastructures \\x0cCollaboration or disruption?
