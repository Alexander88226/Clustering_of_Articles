Prior to that Mastercard collected a de minimis assessment fee in a few countries particularly France on transactions with Mastercard cobadged cards if the brands of domestic networks (as opposed to Mastercard) were used.  As a result the nonMastercard cobadged volume is no longer being included.To aid in understanding the underlying trends in the business the table above reflects adjusted growth rates for the impact of Article 8 by eliminating the related cobadged volumes in prior periods..dracretsaM7102\\xc2\\xa9 \\x0c'
