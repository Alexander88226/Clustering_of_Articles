Now in China SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s contribution to GDP is already close to highincome country level however loans granted to SMEs were disproportional. Various studies found constrains in SME financing access from both supply and demand side. This paper using World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Enterprise Survey on the demand side found that there is selfselection problem during the application process. Large number of firms are abundant with cash thus less likely to apply for loans. While firms with better latest sales are expected to take in loans to sustain their growth. The finding calls for reduction of SME financing costs via competition and financial sector reforms. !!Table of Contents!!V. Results!Introduction!IV.i.Data!IV.ii.Model!IV.iii.Variables!I.II.

LUOIntroduction I.By 2011 Chinese SMEs already accounted for 95% by numbers employed 80% labor force marked  up  to  60%  of  GDP  share  (OECD  2014).  That  is  almost  equivalent  level  as  highincome countries (median GDP share 65% World Bank 2003). For that reason SME is vital both  socially  and  politically.  Nonetheless  according  to  World  Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Enterprise  Surveys financial access is the biggest obstacle to firms growth. There were few researches focused on  Chinese  SME  financing  this  paper  made  some  effort  by  using  the  Enterprise  Survey. From the survey summary (Table 1 of Appendix) some observations were made i. Lack of demand shown in 58.5% of surveyed firm claiming no need for credits. ii. Firm surveyed posted lower proportion of banking financing majority of their investment financed by  internal  channel.  This  could  be  the  result  of  bank  discriminations  or  could  be  a  result  of  selfselection.  iii. 77.6% of the loans requiring for collaterals regardless the channel. Collateral/loan value ratio is an indicator for borrowing cost the interest rate is also important however not observed in firm surveys. The ratio is a level comparable to Canada and Belgium while in Finland only 20% (OECD 2014).  These distinguishing facts of China were ignored by former researches or did not apply to their countries of concern. The vacancy is with great importance. Thus this paper proposed with following questions and hypothesis i. Which firms has the demand for loans? Hypothesis 1 firms that located in more developed area in heavy  industry  having  better  financial  performances  get  higher  chance  of  having  loan  demands  to finance their future growth. ii. Who applied for loans? Hypothesis 2 Contrary to hypothesis 1 of loan demands it is assumed that if firm was with better financial performances less likely to apply for the loan since they could finance themselves with retained profits. iii. Who eventually get the loans? Hypothesis 3 Firms that more established larger financially better performed are positively related to better chance to get granted. The findings suggest selfselection problem during the application process. Large numbers of firms are abundant with cash thus less likely to apply for loans. While if the firm has better sales they are inclining to apply for and obtain financing to sustain growth. This paper organized as follows following section provides brief review on SME financing in China. Section 3 reflects theories and researches. Then followed by methodology (Section 4). Empirical results are in Section 5. Lastly in Section 6 the paper concludes with more discussion on its implications limits and suggestions. \\xe2\\x80\\xa9Page \\x001 of \\x0014\\x0cSME Financing  NEKN75 FinalP. LUOII. SME Financing in China!World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s definition of SME is widely used by researchers in practice if firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s number of employees less than 300 it counted as SME. The dataset this paper based on falls into such category the sampled firms averaged at 235 employees with a median of 60. Despite the size they are critical for economic growth not only contribute to GDP but also set the dynamics by providing employment spreading innovation and entrepreneurship. In China SME did not flourish until the transformation towards market economy started in 1978. During the 1970s to  1980s  SME  were  in  the  form  of  collective  enterprises  or  TVEs  (township  and  village enterprises) which sheltered under local governments protection. Since then more and more private SME firms were benefited from gradual market liberalization and reform policies in various  sectors.  They  experienced  rapid  growth  since  and  have  been  contributing  a  lot towards the spectacular GDP growth. Only by 1990 SMEs have grown into as a major share of Chinese economy (Wang 2004). Only realized this irreversible trend Nee & Opper (2012) argues did Beijing recognized their legal status and put on policies promoting them. Despite such efforts due to the limitation of financial reforms argued by Lin and Li (2001) the financing market are controlled by state players and in favor of lending to stateowned giants. Stateowned commercial banks are dominating the market the big four SOCBs have 75% of all capital in the economy while they are not keen to lend to SME (XU et al. 2013) 85%  of  all  bank  loans  were  to  the  big  SOEs  (The  Diplomat  2013).  During  20092011  in which time the credits were abundant due to the 4 trillion CNY \\xe2\\x80\\x98stimulus program\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reacting to the  global  financial  crisis  even  though  less  than  half  of  business  loans  went  to  SME. Afterwards  in  20132014  it  was  down  to  40%  (Peterson  Institute  2012  OCBC  2014  see Appendix  Figure  1).  This  picture  was  seriously  disproportional  considering  SMEs  are responsible for half of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s output (Appendix Figure 2). Alternatives for example the stock and bond markets were also unsuccessful (Pistor & Xu 2005). Analysts say as a result SME turned to and rely heavily on informal financing P2P financing  and  shadow  banking Tsai  (2002)  estimates  that  counted  for  1/4  of  all  financial transactions which casting doubts on nonperforming loans and their riskiness. Ayyagari et al.  (2006)  identified  finance  as  the  most  important  factor  for  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  growth.  Such underdeveloped financial sector would negatively affect SME growth.\\xe2\\x80\\xa9Page \\x002 of \\x0014\\x0cSME Financing  NEKN75 FinalP. LUOIII. Theory and Literature Review!Established theory of financing difficulties for small firms is the Finance Gap Hypothesis that focused more on the supplier side of loans. This gap emerges when SME were too small to go public and underdeveloped to get formal/informalchannel lending. OECD further pointed out the relation of this hypothesis to the principal/agent problem asymmetric information etc. Finance  Gap  Hypothesis  states  that  under  credit  rationing  by  the  lenders  SME  lending  is considered as costly and risky. Like any business economy of scale would reduce costs SME lending however is not the case. The costs could be reduced by competition in competitive financial market while in China such competition were highly limited due to the de facto oligopoly  of  financing  source  and  supply  by  the  stateowned  players.  Further  smaller companies tend to have less transparency in their financial reports and they are facing high level  of  uncertainty  more  than  half  small  businesses  bankrupts  within  four  year  into operation (IFC 2010). Larger firms in China with large number of employment were backed unemployment  threats  the  governing  of  Communist  Party.  Giant  SOE  enjoys  soft  budget constraints and is almost certainly ensured a bailout in case of failure (Opper 2014). OECD (2006) further suggested such gap could also be explained within the institutional economics. The gap was noticed as early as 90s. Cressy & Olofsson (1996) pooled range of important papers that later had become corner stone of researches on the topic. They found 1.) Constraints on demand and supply side their existence preserved even controlled for firm management factors. 2.) Giant enterprises and smaller ones differ in their financial structure growth prospects scope of products etc. shifts the market power to the supplier side making SMEs suffering more severely from "financial scale disadvantages". While Berger & Udell (2006) were arguing for institutional causal chain from financial infrastructures to the market and discussed information gathering during lending process. Moreover the authors are for larger financial institutions even for developing nations due to better information gathering and lower overall cost. Empirically there are abundant literatures based on different data which confirmed such gap around the world. For instance Beck Kunt & Peria (2008) using banking survey data from World Bank confirmed so in 45 countries. More specifically on China Lin & Li (2001) based on data from Nation Bureau of Statistics suggested the early planning era\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bias Page \\x003 of \\x0014\\x0cSME Financing  NEKN75 FinalP. LUOtowards large SOEs continued which resulted in SME financing difficulty. Also Ge & Qiu (2006) structured their research on firm survey from the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences found in China the informal channel primarily trade credit plays a significant role. However the author also pointed out that most trade credits were more costly than bank loans. Nee & Opper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research using survey on Shanghai Stock Exchange found financial status are insignificant in influencing loan access while firm size innovation activity and location do politicized capitalism are also significant. It is universal that SMEs are struggling in getting credits from various formal and informal channels. Nevertheless constrains from supply side cannot fully explain the financing obstacles since many smaller firms simply have not any demand. Cole (2008) firstly tackled on the problem of need vs. noneed of loans by firms and sets the model which used by later researchers. Kuntchev et al. (2013) not only considered the nondemand fact but also went further; they detailed four ordinal categories from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cno credit constrained\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfully credit constrained\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The framework by these two authors has provided the basis for later demandside financing researches and made it possible for comparisons. These literatures however did not include China. A comprehensive survey only done until the 2012 Enterprise Survey. Further previous studies on credit rationing from banks cannot fully explain the SME financing difficulty resulted from selfselection. A third limitation was that they did not differentiate firms who do not have credit demands firms who have but did not apply and those who applied. Thus this paper based on such logics would use the latest China data from the ES to examine which firms actually has needs for loans/credit which ones succeed and which of them failed in the loan applications.  !Page \\x004 of \\x0014\\x0cSME Financing  NEKN75 FinalP. LUOIV. Econometrics Methodology!Using logistic regressions on three groups of the surveyed firms the hypothesis raised from the beginning of this paper could be test empirically. IV.i.Data!Empirical research with a large firmlevel dataset was too difficult to conduct before the World Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Enterprise Survey. Based on accepted and universal methodologies the survey also ensured its data quality (in terms of questionnaire settings data gathering rejection rate etc) and it provided possibility to do crosscountry comparisons. The \\xe2\\x80\\x98Global methodology\\xe2\\x80\\x99 they used from 2006 as a standardized survey method provided possibility of crosscountry multiyears comparisons; China among more recent target countries being surveyed in 2012 provided a relatively more recent dataset. It interviewed 2700 firms from 19 different sectors located in 25 cities which is a very detailed sample carrying good indicating information covers majority parts of Eastern China. On this specific topic it not only contains detailed information on firm characteristics (which could be controlled) but also covers various financial indicators. Detailed data source for different variables within the ES questionnaire dataset see Appendix Table 2. IV.ii.Model As the discussion on limits of former studies to solve the problem the surveyed firms are classified  by  their  demand  for  loans  (no  demand  vs  firms  with  loan  demand);  then  within firms need loans applicants vs. non applicant for various reasons (as Cole labeled them as \\xe2\\x80\\x98discouraged firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99). Lastly whether the applicants get the loans or not (denied or approved by  lender)  detailed  breakdown  see Appendix  Figure  3. This  paper  would  not  differentiate whether  the  loans  come  from  banks  or  other  channels  since  majority  of  the  firms  in Enterprise Surveys got their loans from informal channel. This paper would test three logistic regressions since the dependent variable in investigation are binary demand or not applicant or not and are approved or not). Using the logistic estimations with the reporting of robust standard  errors  and  outputting  the  odds  ratios  (Verbeek  2012)  the  estimations  are  easily readable the model specification is Y ~ B (ni  \\xcf\\x80i)  which is binary as 0 for nonobservation 1 otherwise depending on the dependent variable. Page \\x005 of \\x0014\\x0cSME Financing  NEKN75 FinalP. LUOLogit (\\xcf\\x80i) = Xi\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xce\\xb2i   the logit of the probability of Y taken 1 where X is vector of covariates and  beta  the  vector  of  regression  coefficients.  Based  on  Verbeek  (2002)  the  effect  on probability of increasing a predictor by one unit while others constant can be calculated d\\xcf\\x80i/dxij = \\xce\\xb2j\\xcf\\x80i(1 \\xe2\\x88\\x92 \\xcf\\x80i). Using maximum likelihood or ML estimations could be done. The odds ratio  could  be  obtain  just  by  exp(beta  estimation).  The  odds  ratio  which  enables  direct reading  on  the  magnitude  of  effect  (Verbeek  2012)  here  in  the  binary  logistic  regression means  the  constant  effect  of  a  predictor  X  on  the  likelihood  of  the  dependent  variable\\xe2\\x80\\x99s outcome.  When  it  is  greater  than  1.00  indicates  the  firm  with  such  explanatory  variable (characteristics)  are  more  likely  to  need  credit  to  apply  or  eventually  get  the  loans.  For example  an  odds  ratio  of  1.123  mean  that  one  unit  change  in  this  independent  variable (controlled for other variables) would increases the odds of dependent variable change from 0 to  1  by  a  factor  of  1.123  (or  a  12.3%  increase).  On  the  other  hand  if  the  odds  ratio  was smaller than 1.00 it would decrease the possibility of that dependent variable.  IV.iii.Variables!As  mentioned  earlier  this  paper  followed  the  Cole  (2008)  framework  to  differentiate  the three  groups  of  firms  by  introducing  three  models  with  three  dependent  binary  variables. They are need variable for distinguish firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 demand or no for loans. Applicant variable for  application  for  loans  or  need  but  did  not  apply.  Result  variable  for  the  result  of  loan applicants. Three categories of explanatory variables were taken into consideration here is a summary of them their detailed data source from the Enterprise Survey see Appendix Table 2. Firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s characteristics age (established firms suggest they are more successful) size (in terms of employment) legal status location;  Macro  indicators  the  competitiveness  the  main  market  is  (higher  competitive  the market is company may facing lower margins may need financing) and in what sector the  firm  operates  (in  three  categories  loan  value  needed  from  high  to  low  term  of loans from long to short heavy industry light industry services);  Performance variables (with main interest) including the utilization of production capacity sales growth sales in latest year sales 3 years ago sales per employee and gross margin (for the reasons stated in the hypothesis these are the variables with mail interest). !!Page \\x006 of \\x0014\\x0cSME Financing  NEKN75 FinalP. LUOV. Results!V.i. Descriptive Statistics and Pairwised Differences!By three groups as discussed earlier Table on the next page presents the mean values for each variable along with group differences (contrast column = needno need app nonapplicant approval    denial)  as  the  descriptive  statistics.  Besides  that  are  the  significant  levels indicating pairwised ttests\\xe2\\x80\\x99 significance. First from the full sample surveyed firms averaged at 15.9 years our sample has a mean of 235 employees. High proportion (70%) of firms had external audit. Majority of them located in eastern costal region and are specialized in light industry (very few in services) more of them are sole proprietorship or limited partnership.  In terms of performances have positive sales growth but negative gross margin. Secondly Need vs nonneed firms. Overall the ratio of firms with loan demands to without such demands is 60%40%. Firms who need loans are more likely to be shareholding nonlisted  firms.  Loanneeding  firms  also  more  likely  to  locate  in  Eastern  region  and  in  heavy industry. The contrasts of sales indicators are significant suggesting that higherperformance firms are more likely to have financing demands. Actually all three groups share the same findings on sales indicators.  In the applicants compared to nonapplicants firms with more sales number are more likely to  apply  for  credits.  Similar  findings  were  found  for  the  legal  status  region  and  market. However in this group senior firms with auditors are more likely to actually apply for a loan. The findings are in accordance with conventional wisdom. Sales indicators differences also  significant  in  the  group  of  firms  got  approval  vs.  deny  of  loans.  Better  financial performances  gets  higher  approval  rate.  Being  audited  also  improved  the  approval  of  loan applications. Additionally nearly 95% of firms applied were granted. Though conflicting results in firm ages and sizes however firms who need loans are more likely  associated  with  higher  sales  being  audited;  firms  who  are  more  likely  to  apply  and more likely to get the loans also share these similar characteristics. This supports the credit rationing theory. Another fact to be notes is that more than half of the nonapplicants saying they do not need loans simply because they have sufficient capital.\\xe2\\x80\\xa9Page \\x007 of \\x0014\\x0cSME Financing  NEKN75 FinalP.

LUOV.ii.Logistic Regressions Table  next  page  tabulates  results  for  three  logistic  regressions  with  the  three  dependent variable (Demand applicant result) on the same explanatory variables.  Noticeably  the  diagnoses  tests  for  the  models  show  no  or  slightest  problems  such  as  misspecification etc. For robustness because of the often omitted variable situation this paper has  also  done  tests  on  models  without  these  variables;  results  do  not  differ  largely  from models presented. In addition for robustness the estimations also done by another round with the sampling weights suggested by the ES methodology for accuracy (this result would show in table 3 in the Appendix).  Firstly  we  look  at  the  need  columns  on  next  page  when  a  firm  indicating  they  have  no demand for loans need variable takes the value of 0 otherwise the need variable takes value of 1. On conventional confidence levels the east region firms heavy industry firms and high sales  growth  firms  were  significantly  adds  up  the  likelihood  for  demanding  loans.  Other variables less significant. This suggests that in more developed part of China or the SMEs with higher sales growth rate would want loans to sustain their growth. Then we move to the applicant columns of table 4 when a firm indicating they have applied for a loan APP = 1 nonapplicants even if they have such demand APP = 0. It seems that for the legal status variables all their odds ratios are significantly less than 1 suggesting being different legal status does not increase the chance for the firm to apply. However being in the east region of China the odds ratio is as high as 5.106 it largely increases the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s odds of application. Sales per employee also increase odds of loan applications however sales three years ago and the gross margin decreases the odds of loan applications. Firms with previous better performance and higher margins may suggest that they are abundant in funds thus less likely to apply for a loan.  Last part of the result columns it takes value of 1 when get approval from lenders 0 if being denied of a loan. Only the current financial year sales are significantly increasing the odds of get their loan application granted. At a lesser constrained significant level result suggesting that more competitive the firm at less likely to get approval of a loan. All other variables are insignificant which may be due to limited observations.\\xe2\\x80\\xa9Page \\x009 of \\x0014\\x0cSME Financing  NEKN75 FinalP.

LUOVI. Discussion and Conclusion From this particular set of survey data evidences show that from the demand side the main credit access problem Chinese SMEs facing occurs when they are in the process of making application decisions 74% of them as \\xe2\\x80\\x98discouraged firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99. The main findings are 1. More revenues attained they could finance themselves thus lower the chance to apply for new  loans;  2.latest  sales  numbers  as  proxy  of  potential  growth  in  the  near  future  have positive effect on loan applications since the owner would have to find ways to finance the immediate presented higher production activity. 3. for those who applied majority of them successfully obtained the loans and if they have good sales number they are with even better odds.  These results are largely in line with original hypothesis financial performance variables are negatively related to odds of application however positively to the possibility of having loan demand  &  being  granted. The  intuition  behind  the  findings  is  that  a  firm  considered  with more cash are less likely to need or apply for a loan; However if any firm applied for loans then  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  on  the  supplierside  selection  based  on  the  findings  latest  sales  as  indicator  of growth potential is the evaluation indicator lenders are looking at. VI.i.Implications !This  paper  found  limited  evidence  confirming  the  popular  belief  that  SME  financing  gap happened because of discrimination by the lender. First the financing difficulties happened mainly because large share of firms did not apply for a loan despite the existence of needs. Second main reason they did not apply was that such firms abundant in funds other reasons mainly concerned on the costs and denial rates. Thirdly even when a firm applied for loans majority of them would go for informal means very few go to banks whether it is because of general perception of discrimination is unknown from this survey. Aiming to the problems financial market improvement (competition efficiency) could drive down  the  costs  for  the  lenders  resulting  in  lower  rates  offered  to  the  SMEs.  In  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s context  more  investment  and  funding  channels  and  liberalization  of  financial  sector  are needed (McKinsey 2006). Last year State Council took measures such as \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x99credit channeling\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cguidance window\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to promote SME financing. China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s central bank PBoC was gradually Page \\x0013 of \\x0014\\x0cSME Financing  NEKN75 FinalP. LUOrelaxing interest rate limit and adjusting official rates in the event of financing difficulties. More recently during the National People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Congress   Zhou Xiaochuan the Chair of PBoC signals the removal of upper limit of interest rate in 2015 he also suggests liberalization of the financial sector. Beck & Kunt (2006) concludes that in countries without welldeveloped financial sector special tools like leasing or factoring are with effectiveness even though the author ask for information share and competitiveness in the financial system. VI.ii.Limitation and Suggests!This paper used the ES from World Bank which conducted a huge sampling however like many  surveyed  data  it  suffered  from  problems  of  1.)  subjective  scale  data  questions  on financial should be and can be quantified however were not. Rather based on interviewee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perception which is inaccurate. Smaller private firms who do not regularly post their financial status and may not be honest when answering sensitive questions. 2.) frequency of data the survey was yearly based so that shorter term of loans which often the case for SMEs were not observed. 3.) location selection with only one city in the West very few in the middle it could  generate  biased  results.  Regional  variable  was  often  omitted  by  the  econometric software or insignificant. 4.) There were too few observations of firms who get loans as seen in the many insignificant variables of the tests. These factors contributed to a low level of robustness. 5.) Survey setup some of the questions were ask on latest value and reflection for earlier  year  (such  as  sales  no.  of  employees)  while  others  not  (such  as  costs).  This inconsistency prevents timespan changes in the firm behaviors. Further studies could be done with different variables to further test the firms by regions size or other characteristics. Studies could take other surveys or data source into consideration for example longer time series data or vertically include more macro factors such as economic conditions  or  more  detailed  firm  level  data  for  example  the  most  important  indicator  of lending the interest rate offered by the lender. The researches then could control for more factors and give more accurate and detailed results.  One could also use a more complicated model such as Kuntchev et al. (2013). Their model category  firms  not  binary  but  into  ordinal  order  of  degree  of  credit  constrains.  Using  that model as the authors suggest not only evaluate firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 credit access behavior but also enables researchers to assess the financing constrains facing different firms.\\xe2\\x80\\xa9Page \\x0014 of \\x0014\\x0cList of References !Ayyagari M.
