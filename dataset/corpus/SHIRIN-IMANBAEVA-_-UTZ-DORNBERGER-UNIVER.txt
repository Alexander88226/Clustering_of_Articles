Ask  people  this  question  and  they  are  likely  to  pick familiar  technologies  such  as  printing  or  electricity.  But  they  are  unlikely  to  suggest  an innovation  that  is  just  as  significant  the  financial  contract.  Widely  disliked  and  often considered grubby it has nonetheless played an indispensable role in human development for at least 7000 years\\xe2\\x80\\x9d1. Indeed  the  topic  of  finance  and  consequent  financial  innovation  has  both  supporters  and opponents.  Tufano  (2013)  defines  the  financial  innovation  as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe  act  of  creating  and  then popularizing new financial instruments as well as new financial technologies institutions and markets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with a purpose of overcoming market imperfections. On a post2008financialcrisiswave the discussion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbad\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sides of the financial innovation regained interest of various counterparts including academia2 and international development organizations3. In  2009  within  six  months  of  each  other  Paul  Krugman  and  Robert  Shiller  both  the  Nobel Prize Winners in Economic Sciences posted two diametrically different articles about financial innovation. Krugman states his opposition to financial innovation by writing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hard to think of any major recent financial innovations that actually aided society as opposed to being new improved ways to blow bubbles evade regulations and implement de facto Ponzi schemes4\\xe2\\x80\\x9d On  the  contrary  Shiller  supports  the  phenomena  by  saying  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit  is  critical  that  we  take  the opportunity of the crisis to promote innovationenhancing financial regulation and not let this be eclipsed by superficially popular issues5. He then lists several \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d innovations which in his opinion could have eased people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s lives e.g. lifecycle fund and retirement annuities. Nevertheless regardless of the position in the discussion of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbad\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sides of finance and  financial  innovation  it  is  impossible  to  neglect  its  enormous  influence  on  global development  overall  as  well  as  on  development  of  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  in particular as they are considered to be building blocks of developing countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 economy due to strong employment power6. SMEs account on average of 50% of jobs in both developing and developed  countries  remaining  as  one  of  the  main  driving  forces  of  the  economy  (Torre Martinez Schmukler 2009). Simultaneously however the SME segment suffers from access to finance constraints mostly due to the inability of conventional finance to accommodate the segment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s needs. As stated by Stein Ardic & Hommes (2013) commercial banks are still perceived to be the major source of funding for SMEs. Privately held commercial banks provide about 58% of external financing for                                                             1 http//www.economist.com/news/essays/21600451financenotmerelypronecrisesitshapedthemfivehistoric alcrisesshowhowaspectstodaysfina 2 See for instance Henderson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and Pearson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe dark side of financial innovation A case study of the pricing of a retail financial product\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2010; or Allen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTrends in Financial Innovation and Their Welfare Impact\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2011 3 See for instance World Economic Forum\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRethinking financial innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2012 4 http//www.nytimes.com/2009/04/27/opinion/27krugman.html?_r=0 5 http//www.ft.com/intl/cms/s/0/c4a74ba2ab8311de9be400144feabdc0.html#axzz3jokYMlsW 6 According to IFC Jobs Study 2013 SMEs represent on average about 66% of permanent fulltime employment in developing countries.  4 \\x0c the  SME  sector  while  state  owned  banks  and  other  agencies  cover  a  further  20%.  These numbers  make  the urgency for  innovation  of  the  banking industry  obvious.  As  Kevin Hanley Director of Design and Services at the Royal Bank of Scotland stated at the Financial Services Forum (2324 June 2015 London) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwe spend most of our time in this industry fixing today and making incremental improvements. Innovation is different it is thinking about what tomorrow holds. And about making disruptive change happen\\xe2\\x80\\x9d7. Despite the evident augmentation of the financial system across the globe (Beck et al. 2008) the financing gap of MSMEs (micro small and medium enterprises) in developing countries is still  estimated  at  $2.1  to  $2.6  trillion  (Stein  Ardic  &  Hommes  2013).  Figure  I  provides  an overview of a total financing gap of both formal and informal MSME sector. Here the region of South  East  Asia  and  the  Pacific  has  the  highest  percentage  of  unserved  and  underserved MSMEs.  Figure 1 Formal and Informal MSMEs sector \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Total financing gap  Source Stein Ardic & Hommes 2013 After  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9crole  of  the  entrepreneurial  enterprise  as  an  engine  of  economic  growth  has garnered  considerable  public  attention  in  the  1990s\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (Berger  &  Udell  1998  p.  613)  the finance gap hypothesis which presumes that small and medium enterprises suffer from a lack of external financing more than larger companies has started being widely researched (Ang 1992;  Avery  et  al.  1998;  Berger  &  Udell  1998;  Gregory  et  al.  2005;  Beck  &  Demirg\\xc3\\xbc\\xc3\\xa7Kunt 2006;  Ayyagari  et  al.  2007).  Consequently  all  types  of  factors  affecting  growth  and development  of  SMEs  from  a  degree  of  institutional  development  and  judicial  system                                                             7 http//thefinancialbrand.com/52725/bankinginnovationimperative/  5 \\x0c efficiency (Kumar et al. 1999) to access to external financing (Demirg\\xc3\\xbc\\xc3\\xa7Kunt & Maksimovic 1998;  Beck  &  Demirg\\xc3\\xbc\\xc3\\xa7Kunt  2006;  Ayyagari  et  al.  2006)  also  grabbed  the  attention  of academics and policymakers alike.  Traditionally  the  finance  gap  hypothesis  assumes  that  (i)  SMEs  will  grow  but  due  to  (ii) disadvantageous  market  conditions  the  SMEs  sector  is  left  behind.  Using  an  empirical  set  of data i.e. World Business Environment Survey8 Ayyagari et al. (2006) define the main obstacles that influence enterprise growth to be limited access to external finance as well as high levels of  crime  and  political  instability.  Additionally  Beck  et  al.  (2003)  using  the  survey  data  of 10000 companies from 80 countries conclude that foreignowned larger and older companies face fewer constraints with external financing than SMEs.  The existence of a finance gap is driven by many factors. In addition to macro level issues like undeveloped  financial  and  legal  systems  (Beck  et  al.  2003)  there  are  at  least  five  more obstacles (Zavatta 2008) faced both by the demand and supply sides when pursuing financing of the SMEs sector \\xef\\x82\\xb7 Informational asymmetry  where lender or investor faces difficulties with differentiation between high and low quality projects (adverse selection problem) due to limited access to unofficial insider information about financial status of the given SME.  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Higher  risk  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  the  problem  of  informational  asymmetry  leads  to  a  problem  of  higher  risk ratings  of  SMEs  projects.  Due  to  lack  of  hard  information  or  its\\xe2\\x80\\x99  opacity  SMEs  are  given higher interest rates.  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Transaction costs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 SMEs financing is perceived as an expensive business as this segment usually borrows little amount of loans or better say it is allowed to borrow only smaller loans  due  to  direct  correlation  between repayment  power  and  size  of  operation. At  the same  time  administrative  costs  legal  fees  and  cost  for  acquisition  of  information  about business  stays  the  same  as  it  is  for  bigger  loans  while  profit  from  these  types  of  deal  is kept low.  Lack  of  collateral  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  younger  and  smaller  businesses  have  fewer  (or  in  many  cases  none) assets that could be used as a collateral. Institutional  and  legal  factors  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  which  directly  influence  the  ease  of  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  access  to external  finance.  This  includes  highly  concentrated  and  uncompetitive  banking  sector which is built as a result of highly restrictive and conservative government regulations and undeveloped legal systems. \\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\xef\\x82\\xb7 From a theoretical point of view  the finance gap hypothesis is built upon at least two more theories i.e. conventional wisdom and relationship lending. For a long time the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconventional wisdom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  an  assurance  that  SMEs  are  better  served  by  small  and  niche  banks  through  the \\xe2\\x80\\x9crelationship  lending\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  which  implies  application  of  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoft\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  skills  by  a  relationship  manager  in order  to  overcome  an  information  asymmetry  problem  was  believed  to  be  the  only  way  to deal with the above stated obstacles for SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to external financing. These two theories started  being  widely  researched  and  discussed  in  early  90\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  after  the  USA  approved  its Interstate  Banking  and  Branching  Act  in  1994.  An  ample  amount  of  publications  argued  that large multioffice and branch banks were less likely to provide lending to small businesses than other  types  of  banks  (Keeton  1995).  Furthermore  the  literature  stated  that  with  a                                                             8 For the very recent data see http//data.worldbank.org/datacatalog/BEEPS  6 \\x0c transformation  and  consolidation  into  more  complex  larger  banks  these  banks  reduced funding for SMEs (Berger and Udell 1996; Craig and Hardee 2007; Francis et al. 2008; Jimenez et al. 2009).  Furthermore  the  SME  sector  is  characterized  by  a  high  heterogeneity  making  it  highly complicated to serve as well as to define. Ang (1992) prefers to define a small firm as one that is  privately  held  as  opposed  to  a  publicly  traded  firm.  The  condition  of  private  ownership  is important  but  it  does  not  solve  the  problem  of  classification  as  it  differs  on  a  countrytocountry basis. The more conventional approach is to define the size of an enterprise based on the number of employees Gibson and Vaart (2008) thus argue that a better way of defining size of an enterprise is to base it on an annual turnover variable. The World Bank definition on the other hand puts a set of requirements where the enterprise must meet at least 2 out of 3 characteristics  (see  Table  I)  in  order  to  qualify  for  MSME  definition.  Therefore  the  issue  of defining SMEs still remains highly disputable. Table 1 History of application of effectuation principles in field studies      Source Ayyagari et al. 2007 Despite  the  arguments  provided  and  discussed  above  substantial  changes  of  the  financial landscape  over  the  past  years  including  the  post  and  pre2008financialcrisis  showed  that the SME sector is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cperceived to be big and with good prospective\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Beck et al. 2008 p.6) by all types of banks. In a highly competitive environment banks tend to have more incentives to bear the costs of serving the SME sector and applying new approaches in doing so such as  credit scoring  and coming  up  with  innovative  products  like  factoring  fixedassets  lending  and  so  on  (Torre Mart\\xc3\\xadnez  Schmukler  2010).  Because  as  Berger  &  Udell  (2006  p.2946)  stated  relationship lending  is  not  the  only  way  to  work  with  the  SME  sector  and  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe  inference  that  large institutions are disadvantaged in lending to opaque SMEs is flawed\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Therefore Chapter 2 will look through the current trends of innovation in the area of SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 finance.      7 Firm sizeEmployeesAssetsAnnual salesMicro <10<$100000<$100000Small <50<$3 mln<$3 mlnMedium <300<$15 mln<$15 mln\\x0c TRENDS   The list of identified and provided below trends in the area of SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 finance is by no means exhaustive  and/or  complete.

Growing digitalization of financial services leads to increasing use of online platforms that reduce intermediation between financial institutions and SMEs. The FinTech innovators have started disrupting the financial sector after its\\xe2\\x80\\x99 global collapse in 2008. Goldman Sachs estimates that FinTech\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual revenue could go up to $4.7 trillion9 the revenue  taken  away  from  conventional  and  established  financial  companies  (WEF  2015). There are at least four different types of nonbank market based online financing which SMEs can benefit from namely \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Crowdfunding  Kickstarter10 is a leading rewards and preselling based crowdfunding site where project owners have raised over $1  billion in funding for their projects.

In 2014 it has raised the largest rewardsbased crowdfunding campaign with Coolest Cooler at over $13M. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Mobile  Payment  Services    EcoCash11 is  a  mobile  payment  solution  that  enables  its users to complete simple financial transactions such as sending money and buying and paying  for  goods  and  services.  It  also  provides  an  option  of  saving  money  earning interest  and  obtaining  loans  which  range  from  as  low  as  $15  to  $500  depending  on how  much  customer  saves  with  EcoCash.  The  higher  the  savings  are  the  higher  the loan limit is. To qualify for the loan customers need to have an EcoCash Save account and  to  save  a  minimum  of  $5  or  more  for  3  months.  EcoCash  belongs  to  Econet Wireless  which  is  a  diversified  telecommunications  group  with  operations  and investments  in  Africa  Europe  South  America  and  the  East  Asia  Pacific  Rim  offering products  and  services  in  the  core  areas  of  mobile  and  fixed  telephony  services broadband satellite optical fibre networks and mobile payment.  PeertoPeer Lending \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is an onlineenabled lending wherein individual lenders provide capital directly  to  individual  borrowers  with  further  ability  to  get  higher  yields.  However  unlike conventional  providers  of  financial  services  most  of  the  onlineenabled  platforms  do  not guarantee full return of funds to the savers putting capital into the system (TheCityUK 2013). In  addition  these  platforms  could  act  as  secondary  markets  by  providing  marketplace  for existing  lenders  who  want  to  withdraw  their  capital  prior  to  the  loan  term  through  selling shares of any loans to other investors (ACCA 2014). There are two subtypes of peertopeer platforms;  those  are  persontoperson  (P2P)  and  persontomerchant  (P2M)  or  persontobusiness (P2B) platforms.                                                              9 The Economist \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe fintech revolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2015 10 https//www.kickstarter.com 11 https//www.econet.co.zw  9 \\x0c \\xef\\x82\\xb7  P2P  Unlike traditional lenders Kabbage12 approves small business loans by looking at reallife  data.

The  loans  made  through  the  portal  are  repaid  by  the  borrowing businesses in monthly payments of principal and interest. No collateral is pledged for the  loans  received.  MoolahSense  states  its  benefits  to  SMEs  as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpotentially  lower borrowing  costs  being  fast  and  convenient  building  a  resilient  longterm  funding strategy  by  cultivating  a  relationship  with  alternative  pools  of  investors  and  being empowered to negotiate your own rates\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. (ADB 2014)  Online equity financing \\xe2\\x80\\x93 is a transaction aimed to raise new equity where equity is defined as the  part  of  longterm  liabilities  used  to  fund  a  company  (Moles  &  Terry  1997  p.188).  This transaction  is  being  fully  done  electronically  mainly  through  the  dedicated  platforms  on Internet.    \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Business Angel  Intellecap Impact Investment Network14 which states that it is India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first  angel  network  of  highnetworth  individuals  and  institutional  investors  seeking investments in fledgling enterprises.

Minimum threshold of investment is \\xe2\\x82\\xac10 there is  also  an  option  for  earlystage  startups  and  more  established  businesses  to  raise investment from friends family customers angels and other independent investors in exchange for equity in the business. The platform offers three types of campaigns for investment    equity  funds  and  convertible  campaigns.  Seedrs  is  an  "all  or  nothing" platform where companies do not receive any funding unless they reach their declared investment target. In late 2015 Seedrs has expanded to US market. Up to 2015 it has funded over  270  deals  and  raises  up  to  \\xc2\\xa33.5m  per  month on average. The company predicted  that  the  US  would  represent  between  onethird  and  half  of  the  business over the next two to three years.  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Venture capital  Letsventure16 enables startups that are looking to raise seed capital to create investmentready profiles online and to connect to accredited investors. The amount of financing ranges between $1 million and $10 million and is focused on the internet sector.  Around  750  startups  and 1200  investors  across 20  countries  375  of them  Indian  are  registered  on  its  platform.  The  platform  is  free  for  investors  and charges startups 2 per cent of the funds raised as fee. It invests 1 per cent back into the  startups  as  equity.

In 2015  LetsVenture has managed to raise $17 million for 53 startups that are under its aegis.  2.  Digitalization  also  facilitates  the  trend  of  big  data  which  leads  to  partial  solution  of information  asymmetry  problem  through  establishment  of  data  warehouses  i.e.  credit information  sharing  systems  and  use  of  collected  data  for  further  assessment  through various screening models. The information asymmetry is one of the most cited obstacles that supply side refers to when talking  about  SMEs  financing  (Torre  Mart\\xc3\\xadnez  Schmukler  2010).  Growing  digitalization  of services provides an innovative way not only in delivering those services but also in collecting and  assessing  data  on  end  users.  This  opens  new  ways  for  investment  analysis  of  loan applicants.  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Predictive Modelling  Alipay17 is a unit of Ant Financial Services Group an affiliate of Alibaba  Group.

The  new  mathematical  model  analyses  amount  average dispersion total amount trend and other variables to calculate the final credit amount. Given  the  large  amount  of  clients  BAC  needs  to  check  first  the  previous  payment record  of  the  client  and  commercial  references  from  the  bank.  Here  BAC  also developed software that massively checks all the references. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Use of pointofsale (POS) account data  SMEs often operate on a small business scale do little financial bookkeeping and own a few liquid assets but very little fixed assets. As a result those SMEs normally find it difficult to get credit from banks. Here is where Chinese  Nanchong  City  Commercial  Bank\'s19 innovative  POS  account  transaction  flow rate loan product resolves that problem. This loan product allows the Bank to review loan  applicants\\xe2\\x80\\x99  POS  account  transaction  flow  rate  analyze  its  business  operation condition and other factors such as loan applicants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 business assets business selling channels  or  length  of  trading  history.

Moreover at postlending period the bank will continue to monitor an applicant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  bankcard  usage  from  their  POS  machine  transaction  records.  Thus  the Bank can oversee their business operation condition. In addition the bank will perform postlending  onsite  investigation  for  the  clients  look  for  any  potential  business problems  prepare  for  business  risk  early  warning  and  fulfill  Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  risk  management duty. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Psychometric  Assessment    Unlocking  entrepreneurial  potential in  developing countries requires a new way for banks to screen clients and evaluate risk.

In tests over four years in seven countries in Latin America and Africa the tool was able to predict default as well as or better than traditional credit scoring models. In Africa the initial research and adaptation of the tool has already started to catalyze private sector scaleup. Financial institutions on the continent are now lending out over $1.5 million per week based on these tools to smallscale entrepreneurs that would have previously been rejected.  3. Growth of financial literacy of  SMEs is fuelled by digital apps and conventional financial institutions which are interested in a longterm high capacity of the demand side. According  to  the  World  Bank  survey  (Torre  Mart\\xc3\\xadnez  Schmukler  2010)  conducted  in Argentina Chile Colombia and Serbia roughly 50% of surveyed banks point at  SMEs specific factors21 as  one  of  the  main  obstacles  to  serve  the  sector.  One  of  the  ways  to  mitigate  that obstacle  is  to  build  capacity  of  the  SMEs  sector  itself.  This  goal  is  being  achieved  through application of such tools as \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Financial  literacy  campaigns    after  the  over  indebtedness  crisis  of  2011  both regulatory  bodies  and  nonbank  financial  institutions  of  the  Kyrgyz  Republic  started admitting  the  importance  of  financial  literacy  of  local  SMEs  and  individuals.  Shortly after  the  Closed  Joint  Stock  Company  (CJSC)  FINCA  Bank22 launched  its  Financial Literacy  Project  which  is  a  multiple  level  program  that  includes  various  directions channels and instruments of distribution. Within the program a series of educational materials  and  training  has  been  prepared  and  disseminated  through  training  events which were conducted jointly with the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic. In 2015 the  CJSC  FINCA  Bank  published  the  electronic  version  of  the  manual  on  financial literacy prepared in cooperation with the KyrgyzRussian Slavic University. This edition is a basic course combining 101 theoretical foundations and practical experience. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Financing  blended  with  technical  assistance    Sembrar  Sartawi  IFD23 /  Sembrar  is  a Bolivian  development  finance  institution  providing  a  variety  of  financial  services  to micro  and  small  agricultural  producers  since  1989.  There  is  a  need  to  increase production and productivity of agriculture particular for net food importing countries like  Bolivia.  Furthermore  agriculture  is  the  most  important  source  of  income  for millions of smallholder famers with no access to technology credit and markets. Here the  Sembrar  Sartawi  IFD  has  developed  the  ATF  model  (Technical  Assistance  and Financing).  This  innovation works  on a  platform of  these  two  institutions.  They  were created to deliver services to smallholder farmers through a comprehensive approach.                                                             20 http//www.hks.harvard.edu/centers/cid/programs/entrepreneurialfinancelabresearchinitiative 21 These factors mostly refer to low quality balance sheets and/or lack of quality information in overall. In Colombia for instance this percentage goes up to 88%.  22 http//www.finca.kg/ 23 http//www.sembrarsartawi.org/  13 \\x0c One  institution  specializes  in  the  transfer  of  knowledge  and  builds  productive capacities and the other provides customized financial products to small agricultural unit.  The  value  for  the  smallholder  farmers  consists  of  (i)  Technical  assistance  (TA) provides best practices and the farmer can increase yields (ii) TA helps the producer to mitigate  risks  this  reduces  the  probability  of  crop  failure  and  an  eventual  credit default  and  (iii)  Information  and  initiatives  to  reach  markets  allow  farmers  to  find more stable demand paths. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Financial  literacy  applications    Creation  and  popularization  of  online  applications aimed at simplifying or teaching bookkeeping such as Xero24 which is a cloudbased accounting  solution  tailored  to  the  needs  of  small  to  midsize  businesses.  Features include account management billing invoices expense reporting and payroll (this last is  currently  limited  to  the  United  Kingdom  Australia  New  Zealand  and  20  states  of United States of America). Xero also integrates with over 400 other applications which facilitate  nearly  all  aspects  of  business  operation  including  inventory  management CRM  and  POS.  Prices  range  from  \\xc2\\xa39  a  month  for  the  starter  to  \\xc2\\xa330  a  month  for  a sophisticated version with multicurrency options.  4. FinTech is also being used in the area of development financing with the aim to increase financial inclusion and access to finance by SMEs and individuals in developing countries. As was stated previously the FinTech companies are truly booming. Today they have proved to be  leaders  in  finding  new  solutions  for  old  problems  to  such  an  extent  where  even International  Financial  Institutions  (IFIs)  have  also  started  using  the  financial  technologies  in the process  of  their  programs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  delivery.  However  application  of  financial  technologies  is  not the only innovative instrument being used in the area of development finance.  Listed  below  are  the  innovative  instruments  which  embrace  the  social  financing  of  SMEs  in developing countries as a part of development finance \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Finance through FinTech  Mobile Money for the Poor25 is a global programme funded by  the  United  Nations  Capital  Development  Fund  the  Swedish International Development  Cooperation  Agency  and  the  Australian  Government  Department  for Foreign Affairs and Trade. The programme provides support to branchless and mobile financial  services  in  a  select  group  of  Least  Developed  Countries  particularly  Benin LaoPDR Liberia Malawi Nepal Senegal Uganda and Zambia to demonstrate how the correct mix of financial technical and policy support can build a robust branchless and mobile  financial  services  ecosystem  that  reaches  low  income  people  in  Least Developed Countries (LDCs).                                                             24 https//www.xero.com/ 25 http//www.uncdf.org/en/mm4p  14 \\x0c \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Social  Success  Note    Yunus  Social  Business 26  in  collaboration  with  Rockefeller Foundation  launched  The  Social  Success  Note  which  is  a  financial  innovation  that allows  capital  to  flow  into  underfunded  sectors  (e.g.  low  income  geographies  and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpush\\xe2\\x80\\x9d product sectors) deemed traditionally too risky or unprofitable for mainstream capital.  It  is  an  innovative  payforsuccess  financing  mechanism  that  addresses  the investment  gap  for  impactoriented  SMEs  and  social  businesses.  Through  a  new alignment  of investors  and philanthropic  outcome  payers  the  SSN  holds  the  promise  of  addressing  the  missingmiddle  financing  gap  for  impact  SMEs  by  mobilizing  commercial  capital  into  these businesses while overcoming the longentrenched tradeoff between social impact and financial return. It also allows existing social businesses to delve deeper into their area of  social  impact  e.g.  targeting  a  poorer  customer  segment  than  traditional  IRR investment  hurdle  rates  would  allow.  Yunus  Social  Business  and  The  Rockefeller Foundation  are  working  together  to  launch  the  pilot  in  2016  with  one  of  YSB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investmentready social businesses. interests  among  entrepreneurs incentives  and \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Social Venture Capital  AgDevCo27 established in 2009 as a social impact investor and agribusiness  project  developer.  Incorporated  as  a  nonforprofit  distribution  limited company in the UK to invest patient capital in the form of debt and equity into early stage agribusinesses. Operations with locally managed subsidiaries in five countries in subSaharan Africa (Mozambique Ghana Zambia Malawi and Tanzania). AgDevCo has developed an innovative Social Venture Capital model to serve the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmissing middle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in the  African  agricultural  sector.  Beneficiaries  are  SMEs  who  are  too  large  for microfinance  but  too  small  for  private  equity.  AgDevCo  offers  (i)  flexible  risk  capital with a 510 year time horizon. Mezzanine loans are structured to match the projected cash  flow  and  (ii)  Handson  technical  support  to  improve  financial  management governance agronomy and smallholder support schemes.   Another subcategory of the development financing is the  one  which supports projects  with sustainable agenda.  include renewable  energies  energy  efficiency \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Such  as  issuance  of  green  bond  this  is  a  debt  security  that  is  issued  to  raise  capital specifically  in  support  of  climaterelated  or  environmental  projects.  Those  projects typically sustainable  waste management  clean  transportation  biodiversity  sustainable  land  use  and  climate change  mitigation  and  adaption.  The  green  bond  market  has  grown  exponentially  in recent years going from $4 billion in 2010 to over $37 billion in 2014 according to the World Bank. Private commercial lenders such are also stepping into the sector. Bank of America  has  issued two  green  bonds  \\xe2\\x80\\x94  one  for  $500  million  in November  2013  and                                                             26 http//www.yunussb.com/socialsuccessnote/ 27 http//www.agdevco.com  15 \\x0c another for $600 million in May 2015 \\xe2\\x80\\x94 to finance renewable energy projects in solar wind geothermal and energy efficiency. This financing also covers the SMEs. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Financing  of  energy  efficient  technologies  where  subject  of  investment  is  an enterprise  or  a  project  that  works  or  plans  to  work  with  the  energy  efficient technologies instead of old inefficient ones also falls into this category. CenterInvest bank28 was the first Bank in Russia to participate in International Finance Corporation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (IFC)  Russia  Sustainable  Energy  Finance  Program  for  SMEs  in  2005.  In  2008  with  a credit  line  from  Kreditanstalt  f\\xc3\\xbcr  Wiederaufbau  (KfW)  the  Bank  opened  up  energy efficiency lending to the agricultural sector. In 2009 the Bank started another program with IFC on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEnergy Efficiency in the Housing and Communal Services Sector\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In 2011 CenterInvest Bank launched a loan product to enable its retail customers to purchase modern  energy  efficient  household  appliances  and  to  carry  out  energy  efficiency renovations to their homes.  5. Fast growing SMEs using intangible or tangible  assets as a key success factor are served through more innovative financing ways   As stated by McKinsey \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoftware and online services are in a period of dizzying growth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d29. A small startup can easily become a billiondollar giant. The latest example of such companies is Airbnb which was valued at $25.5 billion30 and Uber which has a valuation of $62.5 billion31. Traditionally one of the main obstacles for financing of  SMEs engaged in the area of ICT was the absence of the tangible collateral. The introduction of intangible asset based financing has partially solved that problem.  \\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\xef\\x82\\xb7 Intellectual Property (IP) Auctions  Patentauction.com32 is an online free marketplace designed only for selling or licensing patented inventions. PatentAuction.com is a noncommercial  and  not  for  profit  initiative  only  designed  to  help  inventors  get  more exposure  for  their  patents.  PatentAuction.com  provides  potential  buyers  with  the opportunity  to  contact  the  inventors  and  to  have  a  private  conversation  within  the site. When that happens it is up to the parties to come to an agreement and seal the deal outside the platform. IP Collateral Enhancement  MCAM Global Holdings33 is a global financial services and collateral management firm with specialized expertise on capital risk management.  In 2000 it introduced the Certified Asset Purchase Price tool which allowed the process of  IP  collateral  enhancement  to  become  commercially  viable  and  secure.  MCAM provides  lender  with  a  Property  &  Casualty  Insurance  policy  that  provides  a                                                             28 http//www.centrinvest.ru 29 McKinsey \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGrow fast or die slow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2014  30 Fortune \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAirbnb raises $1.5 billion valuing it at an eyepopping $25.5 billion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2015  31 Bloomberg \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUber Raises Funding at $62.5 Billion Valuation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2015  32 http//patentauction.com/ 33 http//www.mcam.com/  16 \\x0c predetermined purchase price in the event that a lender forecloses on the borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s collateral.

Paradox is specialized  in  financing  nonroyalty  and  royalty  generating  IP  using  a  wide  variety  of credit structures including loans and securitizations. The firm has established itself as the de facto financing partner to IPcentric businesses. In conjunction with its parent Babcock  &  Brown  Limited  Paradox  Capital  has  established  a  $280  million  fund  that provides  financing  to  companies  with  strong  patent  trademark  and  copyright portfolios. Another  subcategory  of  innovative  asset  based  financing  is  one  where  movable  assets  are used as the collateral. This instrument is widely used particularly in the agricultural sector. \\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Equipment Finance  Equity Bank of Tanzania35 provides Kilimo Biashara (Agribusiness Small Scale) A credit product for the procurement of agricultural tools and equipment for  smallholder  farmers  cultivating  grains  and  other  crops.  The  product  targets  Self Help  Groups  and  provides  seasonal  loans.  Loans  are  given  at  an  interest  rate  20 percent with a payback period of 24 months.  Infrastructure Finance  Jain Irrigation Systems LTD36 (JISL) is the largest manufacturer of  microirrigation  systems  (MIS)  in  India  and  the  second  largest  globally.  In  120 districts with a total workforce of 7000 JISL focuses on small farmers with holdings of less than 10 acres. JISL prefinances farmer microirrigation system purchases against the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccollateral\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  of  a  government  subsidy  payment.  Farmers  who  buy  irrigation equipment from Indian MIS producers such as JISL obtain a subsidy of 50\\xe2\\x80\\x9370 percent of the equipment purchase price with the national Government supplying 40 percent and  the  state  Government  providing  the  remaining  10\\xe2\\x80\\x9330  percent.  The  JISL  dealer prepares the cost estimate and the applicant farmer submits a subsidy application to the Implementing  Agency  (IA).  After  approval  subsequent  MIS installation and IA inspection the subsidy release requires a 180\\xe2\\x80\\x93360 day processing period (IFC & GPFI 2012).  local  subsidy \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Warehouse  Receipts  Financing    Origo  Commodities37 is  a  collateral  management company based in India which allows farmers to make deposits of their products in its warehouses  and  obtain  pledge  financing.  It  currently  operates  over  350  warehouses on  a  lease  basis  and  has  over  3.5  million  tonnes  of  commodities  valued  at  around United States Dollar (USD) 1.4 million under management.                                                             34 http//www.paradoxcapitalpartners.com/ 35 http//ke.equitybankgroup.com/ 36 http//www.jains.com/ 37 http//origoindia.com/  17 \\x0c \\xef\\x82\\xb7 Leasing    Development  Finance  Uganda  Leasing  Company 38 (DFCU)  specializes  in providing  finance  leases  to  SMEs  for  agricultural  machinery  \\xe2\\x80\\x94  particularly  tractors milk equipment harvesters and agroprocessing equipment. Typically DFCU finances 60 percent of the asset purchase while the client finances the additional 40 percent. The  client  share  however  may  range  between  10\\xe2\\x80\\x9350  percent.  DFCU  retains  full ownership during the life of the lease though the asset is transferred to the client or sold  to  a  third  party  after  the  lease  terminates.  Although  DFCU\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  interest  rates  are similar  to  those  of  banks  their  leases  are  more  attractive  to  SME  s  because  they typically offer longer payment periods (3\\xe2\\x80\\x935 years as compared with around 2 years) provide  flexible  lease  payment  schedules  that  match  enterprise  cash  flows  and recognize the leased asset as primary collateral. Additional security is only requested in specific circumstances. (IFC & GPFI 2012)  6. Growing use of accounts financing to manage cash flow problem in SMEs Accounts  financing  is  a  type  of  financing  against  collateral  where  funds  are  provided  against the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s accounts. There are different types of accounts financing these are  \\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\xef\\x82\\xb7 Invoice  trading    MarketInvoice39 is  offering  a  new  type  of  invoice  finance  built  for savvy  growing  businesses.  Their  online  platform  gives  clients  access  to  funds  in outstanding invoices otherwise tied up for between 30 to 120 days. They are entirely different  to  traditional  factoring.  Businesses  can  sign  up  online  sell  an  invoice  and draw  down  funds  on  the  same  day.  There  are  no  contracts  hidden  fees  or  personal guarantees.  MarketInvoice launched in 2011 and they have already helped hundreds of  growing  companies  overcome  their  fluctuating  cash  flow.  Over  \\xc2\\xa3300m  has  been funded already. Their clients use the finance raised to launch new products hire more staff and expand internationally.  Invoice  financing  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  The  Fundbox 40  is  helping  business  owners  and  freelancers overcome  cash  flow  gaps  by  advancing  payments  for  their  outstanding  invoices.  The companies  are  not  charged  interest  and  get  100%  of  the  value  of  the  invoice.  The Fundbox however charges a small fee for each week of an outstanding balance (equal to approximately 0.5% of the invoice value). The fee varies slightly depending on the invoice.  However  on  a  $1000  invoice  the  company  pays  ~$60  in  fees  over  the  12 week  repayment  period    this  equates  to  ~$5  per  week.  Advances  are  automatically paid  back  over  12  weeks  but  there  is  a  choice  to  repay  early  at  any  time  without penalty and all remaining fees will be waived.                                                              38 https//www.dfcugroup.com/  39 https//www.marketinvoice.com 40 https//fundbox.com/  18 \\x0c \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Savings account linked input financing  National Microfinance Bank of Tanzania41 has a specialized NMB Kilimo Account which is a tailor made saving account for farmers.

Go Finance augments their credit offering by collaborating with complementary financial services providers such as  health  and  business  insurance  providers  to  provide  a  range  of  relevant  financial solutions  to  the  target  market.  Go  Finance  is  pioneering  the  use  of  data  (such  as payments & historical sales data from large consumer goods and telecom companies) in  combination  with  data  from  credit  bureaus  etc.  as  a  satisfactory  innovative  to assessing credit worthiness in absence of traditional options such as audited financials. Go Finance secures its loans primarily through guarantees based on the business and social  relationships  that  exist  within  a  value  chain  as  the  main  form  of  collateral  as opposed to requiring hard collateral such as title deeds. The value proposition is to use existing  data  and  social/business  relationships  within  a  value  chain  to  assess  and extend  credit  in  a  manner  that  is  convenient  and  flexible  to  the  SMEs.

Banks  in  Kosovo  view  SMEs  lending  as  risky  and  costly  and  the underwriting requirements of most banks make loans out of reach for many  SMEs in                                                             41 http//www.nmbtz.com/ 42 http//www.gofinanceco.com/ 43 https//www.aztecexchange.com/ 44 http//www.cffkosovo.com/  19 \\x0c the region. CFF\'s main lending instrument is Purchase Order Finance (POF) which is an innovative  working  capital  finance  instrument.  In  POF  the  SME  obtains  a  verified purchase  order  from  a  buyer  and  estimates  the  total  cost  required  to  complete  the order.  The  financier  reviews  the  order  the  cost  breakdown  and  the  operational history of the SME. If the loan is approved the financier advances a percentage of the total order value to the SME equal to the exact amount the SME needs to complete the  order.  The  SME  then  produces  the  good  and  invoices  the  customer.  The receivables  are  assigned  to  the  financier  and  the  customer  is  instructed  to  pay  the financier  directly.  When  the  financier  receives  the  payment  it  deducts  the  amount advanced and interest or fees and remits the balance to the SME.  SUMMARY  The topic of financial innovation is quite a controversial one. It has many opponents as well as allies. However whatever the outcomes of the innovations in the financial sector are it is very clear  that  there  is  an  obvious  need  for  it.  One  of  the  arguments  for  this  statement  is  the existence of a financing gap and a high percentage of unserved individuals and SMEs.  The FinTech companies true disruptors of the financial sector are at the leading centre of the innovation  movement.  Nonetheless  the  conventional  players  i.e.  banks  still  dominate  the sector. According to the Economist the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLending Club has arranged $9 billion in loans through its  marketplace  small  change  compared  with  $885  billion  of  total  creditcard  debt  in America45\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. However as seen from the cases provided above banks are also stepping into the field of innovation through the creation of tailored products and the adoption of new financing instruments.  It is also important to note that as Schumpeter stated the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdefining characteristic of innovation is simply the doing new things or the doing of things that are already being done in a new way\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Schumpeter 1934 p.153). That is the criteria that the research was guided by when selecting cases  upon  which  the  trends  were  identified.  Therefore  we  also  list  instruments  that  could seem  to  be quite traditional in one region of  the world but very innovative in  another. Such instruments  as  financing  blended  with  technical  assistance  financial  literacy  campaigns  or mobile payment services.  It  also  can  be  suggested  that  the  SME  financing  niche  is  narrowing  down  thanks  to  the emerging  innovative  financing  instruments  applied  in  the  given  area  by  various  financial institutions. The availability and application of those instruments vary greatly on a countrytocountry  basis.  This  can  be  explained  by  the  influence  of  different  factors  where  degree  of development of financial and legal systems is among the major ones.                                                               45 http//www.economist.com/node/21650546/print  20 \\x0c REFERENCES ACCA 2014.
