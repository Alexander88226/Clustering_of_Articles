Their number reached 99% of the number of companies and accounted for 92% of job creation. However many of them especially from the micro and small enterprises (MSEs) category have difficulties  to  grow  or  expand  their  production  capacity  or  even  to  sustain  including  limited access  to  finance  from  formal  sources  like  bank  and  other  nonbank  financial  institutions.  This paper  presents  the  results  of  a  study  on  the  financing  of  micro  small  and  medium  enterprises (MSMEs)  in  Indonesia.  The  approach  used  in  this  study  is  descriptive  and  analytical  in  nature and is based on secondary data collected from various official/government sources on their main obstacles  the  annual  growth  of  loans  granted  to  these  enterprises  from  commercial  banks  and their  main  financial  sources.  This  paper  presents  three  important  findings  from  the  study  (i) limited  funds  is  their  main  constraint  especially  from  the  MSEs  category  (ii)  the  majority  of MSEs depend on own money or loans from informal sources and (iii) for those who have never borrowed money from banks lack of collateral is the main reason (except not interested).

These  enterprises  are  the  main drivers  of  national  economic  activities  with  their  contribution  to  the  formation  of  Indonesia\'s gross  domestic  product  above  50%.  They  are  very  numerous  reaching  99%  of  the  number  of companies  of  all  sizes  and  accounting  to  92%  of  job  creation  in  Indonesia.  Even  MSMEs especially micro and small enterprises (MSEs) are the main source of employment opportunities for low skilled workers and business opportunities for married women from poor households in rural  areas.    In  Indonesia  many  married  women  from  poor  farmer  families  run  own  small businesses in front of or not far from their homes such as food stalls small shops that sell simple items of daily  necessities  for villagers or make handicraft  items  from  bamboo rattan or  wood. They  do  such  activities  solely  to  increase  family  income.  In  other  words  the  existence  of MSMEs  in  Indonesia  contributes  significantly  to  generate  employment  and  so  to  alleviate poverty in the country (Tambunan 2018a). http//ijbmer.org/   Page 88  International Journal of Business Management and Economic Review                                                                                                                     Vol. 2 No. 03; 2019                                                                                                                         ISSN 25814664 Within the group of developing countries it can  be said that Indonesia  is the  most experienced regarding  MSME  credit  policies  and  the  development  of  microfinance  institutions.  Even microfinance institutions already existed in Indonesia long before its independence in 1945. The first  time  the  Indonesian  government  launched  a  special  designed  subsidized  credit  scheme  for MSMEs  was  in  1971  at  the  beginning  of  the     New  Order     era  under  the  Suharto  government (19661998)  and  followed  by  various  other  credit  schemes  with  government  subsidy  for  these enterprises  in  certain  sectors  during  the  1980s  and  1990s.  In  2007  a  public  guarantee  credit scheme People\'s Business Credit (or KUR) was launched for MSEs that do not have access to commercial banks because they do not have valuable assets  to be used as collateral (Tambunan 2018ab). In  addition  to  KUR  many  ministries  have  also  their  own  special  designed  credit  schemes  for MSMEs  such  as  startup  capital  initiated  by  the  Ministry  of  Cooperative  and  Small  Medium Enterprise (SME). And  in the past few  years  financial technology (fintech) peer to peer (P2P) lending  has  grown  rapidly  in  Indonesia  which  can  be  a  good  alternative  source of  funding  for MSMEs.   2.DEFINITION AND FEATURES OF MSMEs Indonesia is one of the countries that have the same definition of MSMEs in all sectors. While in many  other  countries  such  as  Malaysia  and  Thailand  the  definition  of  MSMEs  differs  across sectors  for  example  between  MSMEs  in  services  and  MSMEs  in  manufacturing  industry  or those  in  trade  (Tambunan  2009).  The  first  time  the  Indonesian  government  had  the  national definition of MSME was in 1995 through the issuance by the Ministry of Cooperative and SME of the Law on Small Business Number 9. In this  law MSEs are defined as  business units with initial  assets  (not  including  land  and  buildings)  of  no  more than  200  million  Indonesian  rupiah (IDR) or  with  annual  turnovers  up  to  1  billion  IDR.  Business  units  that  have  annual  turnovers with value above 1 billion IDR but less than 50 billion IDR or initial assets  above 200 million IDR  up  to  500  million  IDR  are  defined  as  medium  enterprises  (MEs).  In  2008  the  Ministry replaced  this  1995  Law  by  the  new  one  i.e.  Law  on  MSMEs  Number  20.  In  this  new  law MSMEs  are  defined  as  business  units  with  annual  turnovers  not  more than  50  billion  IDR  and total  initial  assets  excluding  land  and  building  of  less  than  10  billion  IDR  (see  Table  1). Companies  with  annual  sales  more  than  50  billion  IDR  or total  initial  assets  of  10  billion  IDR and beyond are considered as large enterprises (LEs).

In  addition  to  this  law  Indonesia  also  has  a  definition  of  MSMEs  based  on  the  number  of permanent  workers  adopted  by  the  National  Statistics  Agency  (BPS).  Accordingly  business http//ijbmer.org/   Page 89  International Journal of Business Management and Economic Review                                                                                                                     Vol. 2 No. 03; 2019                                                                                                                         ISSN 25814664 units  with  a  number  of  permanent  workers  excluding  business  owners/entrepreneurs  up  to  4 people  are  defined  as  MIEs;  SEs  are  units  with  5  to  20  permanent  employees  and  those  with more than 20 but less than 100 permanent workers are defined as MEs. Companies with 100 or more employees are considered as LEs. Apart from being different in monetary value and the number of permanent workers actually in Indonesia it can easily be seen the difference between MIEs and SEs or between SEs and MEs in such as legality market served (sell only to local market or also to national market or also to foreign  markets) socioeconomic profile of  business owners  have a special workplace/factory or  not  sources  of  capital  the  nature  of  work  or  the  applied  method  of  production  process structure of organization and  management system applied sources and quality of raw  materials used business  location (urban or rural) have external relations or networks or not motivation level  of  entrepreneurship  and  level  of  involvement  of  women  as  business  owners  (Table  2) (Tambunan 2018a).

For example with respect to formality MIEs are mainly unregistered business activities or found in  informal  sector.  Whereas  all  firms  from  the  ME  category  are  registered  have  permanent addresses  and  they  pay  taxes.  Or  with  respect  to  women  engagement  as  business  owners  or entrepreneurs they are more prevalent in                                  smaller enterprises than in large companies  and  among    MSMEs  the  number  of  tiny  enterprises  (i.e.  MIEs)  whose  owners  or entrepreneurs  are  women  is  far  more  than  the  number  of  SEs  especially  as  compared  to  the number of MEs for the following two main reasons. First according to the nature of the activity or type of business or item  made or the pattern or method of production applied MIEs do not really need advanced machines and modern and expensive production tools and highly educated workers. In  Indonesia    generally  MIEs  are  activities  that  generate  low  income  just  enough  to live or survive such as roadside food stalls tiny  shops that sell daily essentials  small meals or snacks  production  street  vendors  and  handicrafts.  Second  also  because  of  that  activities  of MIEs  do  not  need  special  spaces.  Many  married  women  from  low  income/poor  household  in rural  areas  do their  own  small  business  activities  in  their  home  or  in  front  of  their  houses  (e.g. small  shops handicrafts) so they can  more  easily  share their time  between doing  business and conducting their household duties  (Tambunan 2012 2018a).  3.LITERATURE REVIEW http//ijbmer.org/   Page 91  International Journal of Business Management and Economic Review                                                                                                                     Vol. 2 No. 03; 2019                                                                                                                         ISSN 25814664 Literature  on  growth  barriers  facing  MSMEs  in  developing  countries  is  quite  large  which includes many journal articles official reports and working papers with crosscountry evidence e.g.  Beck  et  al.  (2005)  Beck  et  al.  (2005)  Beck  and  DemirgucKunt  (2006)  Beck  (2007) Ayyagari  et  al.  (2011)  Abdulsaleh  and  Worthington  (2013)  Kuntchev  et  al.  (2013)  ADB (2014a) and Wang (2016). There are also many country case studies. For example studies from Chowdhury  (2007)  Ahmed  and  Chowdhury  (2009)  Aziz  and  Siddique  (2016)  Hoque  et  al. (2016) and Islam Hossain (2018) on constraints facing MSMEs in Bangladesh. They show that lack  of  financial  support  is  a  serious  obstacle  facing  many  especially  MSEs  in  the  country. Different from LEs and also from MEs to a certain extent most MSEs in Bangladesh do not have access  to  banks.  Instead  they  depend  heavily  on  loans  from  informal  sources.  The  same evidence  is  also  found  in  India  and  Pakistan.  Studies  by  such  as  Kshetri  (2011)  and  Khandke (2014)  show  that  MSEs  experienced  a  variety  of  problems  that  make  many  of  them  mostly traditional  enterprises  difficult  to  survive  which  include  lack  of  funds.  Only  few  MSEs  have access  to  banks  because  owners  of  most  MSEs  do  not  have  valuable  assets  to  be  used  as  loan collateral. and their businesses are often considered unprofitable by banks. In  Indonesia  Tambunan  (2017  2018ab)  has  identified  development  constraints  of  MSEs  and again  lack  of  access  to  formal  sources  of  funding  is  their  main  barrier to  grow.   Other  serious problems  facing  many  MSEs  in  this  country  are  difficulties  in  marketing  distribution  and  the procurement of  raw  materials.  Meanwhile  in  China  Shen  et  al.  (2009)  Ji  (2011)  Yin  (2012) and  Jiang  et  al.  (2014)  among  yet  many  others  also  come  with  the  same  conclusions  that  in general  MSEs  experience  financing  difficulties  which  are  partly  due  to  lack  of  access  to  credit from formal sources such as banking and other nonbank financial institutions. In Africa findings from case studies in countries such as Ghana South Africa and Mozambique suggest obviously that only MSMEs with easy access to finance from formal sources have great opportunities to grow (e.g. Quartey 2003; Abor and Biekpe 2006; Abor and Quartey 2010; and Dinhucha Gon  alves Fumo and Jose Chiappetta Jabbour 2011). These studies found that MSEs    access  to  bank  credit  is  hampered  by  various  factors  such  as  collateral  requirements  poor knowledge  of  financial  providers  strict  eligibility  criteria  lack  of  knowledge  about  loan  and bureaucratic criteria. In  conclusion  what  emerges  from  the  literature  review  is  that  MSMEs  in  developing  countries face various constraints. However the general finding is that lack of funds is their main serious problem especially MSEs. Although in many countries studied their governments have tried to help  MSEs  in  funding  by  e.g.  providing  special  subsidized  or  guaranteed  credit  schemes  and making  various  regulations  so  that  the  banking  sector  gives  more  opportunities  for  MSEs  to obtain credit only minority of them have access to banks. In other words most of the MSEs that need  additional  capital  are  still  dependent  on  informal  sources.  There  are  three  reasons  often mentioned in the literature namely the absence of collateral businesses of MSEs are considered unprofitable because they only serve the local market that most consumers are from lowincome or poor households and most MSEs do not have good records of their business performance or financial condition.  4.OBJECT OF THE STUDY In  this  study  attempt  has  been  made  to  examine  the  impact  of  MSMEs  financing  policy  in Indonesia on MSMEs access to financing from formal sources. More specifically the study had http//ijbmer.org/   Page 92  International Journal of Business Management and Economic Review                                                                                                                     Vol. 2 No. 03; 2019                                                                                                                         ISSN 25814664 three  main  objectives  namely  to  examine  (i)  the  main  constraints  faced  by  MSMEs;  (ii)  their access to financing from formal sources; and (iii) various alternative credit schemes available for MSMEs in the country.  5.RESEARCH METHODOLOGY & DATA SOURCES The approach used in this study is descriptive and analytical in nature and is based on secondary data  collected  from  three official  sources  namely the  Ministry  of  Cooperative  and  SME  Bank Indonesia (the central bank of Indonesia) and National Statistics Agency (BPS).  For the purpose of analysis simple statistical tools like percentages and volumes are used.  6. EMPIRICAL ANALYSIS 6.1 Recent Development As said before MSMEs play a crucial role in Indonesian economic  development. In 2017 there are 62 million units (see Table 3) or around 99% of all firms in all sectors. National data shows that  92  %  of  the  total  workforce  works  in  this  business  group.  Especially  MSEs  are  very important  for  many  low  income  or  poor  households  either  as  their  main  source  of  income  or additional (secondary) income or seasonal income during the dry season in rural areas.  It can be found that in many poor farm households men do work in rice or plantation fields while women do some simple income generating activities not to seek profits but merely to supplement family income. Such MSE activities not only help them to survive or to have a decent life but also they help  the  government\'s  efforts  to  alleviate  poverty.  Because  Indonesia  does  not  have unemployment benefits as in many developed countries the existence of MSEs is very important indeed. Table 3 Total Enterprises by Size Category in Indonesia 2009 2011 2013 2017 (000 units)   Description Period MIEs Ses Mes LEs 2009 2011 52176.8 546.7 41.1 4.7 54560.0 602.2 44.3 5.0 2013 57189.4 654.2 52.1 5.1 2017 62106.9 757.1 58.6 5.5  Sources State Ministry of Cooperative and SME (www.depkop.go.id) and BPS (www.bps.go.id).  One  characteristic  of  MSMEs  in  Indonesia  (as  also  evident  in  other  countries)  is  that  their contribution  to  GDP  formation  is  always  far  smaller  than  their  contribution  to  job  creation. However because their numbers are far more than the number of LEs their GDP share is greater than  the  contribution  of  LEs to  GDP.  As  can  be  seen  from  Figure  1  based  on  constant  market prices the contribution of MSMEs to GDP is recorded at around 57%. So this structure of GDP by  size  of  firm  that  the  greater  GDP  share  of  MSMEs  than  that  of  LE  is  simply  because  the number  of  LEs  is  less  than  1%  of  total  number  of  firms  (compared  to  that  of  MSMEs  that reaches 99%) gives a clear impression that the level of productivity per worker or per firm of the MSMEs  group  is  very  low.  This  can  be  understood  because  MSMEs  are  dominated  by  MIEs http//ijbmer.org/   Page 93  International Journal of Business Management and Economic Review                                                                                                                     Vol. 2 No. 03; 2019                                                                                                                         ISSN 25814664 which  consist  of  traditional  trade  activities  like  street  vendors  various  services  providers  and traditional/home industries which manufacture simple and low quality products with low degrees of mechanization and do not use advanced technologies (see again Table 2).

Although there is  no data available to support it is very possible that the number of MSEs experiencing  many obstacles in rural areas is far more than those in urban areas or cities. Simply because the farther away from the center of government and the center of economic and financial activities the less hope  is  for them to get  assistance  from the government and access to funding and  market. The number of the constraints or the magnitude or the seriousness of the obstacles faced by MSMEs may differ between regions or between rural and urban areas or between sectors (e.g. between MSMEs  in  manufacturing  industry  and  those  in  agriculture)  and  subsectors  (e.g.  between MSMEs  in  food industry and their counterparts in garment industry) or even  between MSMEs in the same sector or subsector or region. However there  are  a  number  of  problems  commonly  experienced  by  many  MSMEs  anywhere and in any sector namely limited funds to finance their daily production activities and to expand their  production  capacities;  difficulties transportation  and procurement of raw materials and other inputs needed; difficulties in getting skilled workers with relatively  inexpensive wages; unable to  use advanced technologies  limited access to  uptodate and comprehensive information; complicated bureaucratic procedures especially in dealing with business  and  other  businessrelated  permits  and  requirements  regulated  by  the  government regarding  many  aspects  such  as  clean  production  product  quality  and  safety;  and  government in  marketing  distribution http//ijbmer.org/   Page 94  International Journal of Business Management and Economic Review                                                                                                                     Vol. 2 No. 03; 2019                                                                                                                         ISSN 25814664 macroeconomic  policies  (e.g.  price  policy  labor  policy  foreign  trade  policy  monetary  policy fiscal  policy)  which  resulted  in  market  distortions.  All  of  these  problems  in  the  literature  are referred  to  as  external  obstacles  to  MSMEs  growth  with  limited  funds  as  the  most  serious constraint  for  many  MSMEs  especially  MSEs  in  developing  countries  (e.g.  Abdulsaleh  and Worthington 2013; Tambunan 2009 2018a). Based on data obtained from national surveys on MSEs in the manufacturing industry conducted in  2010  and  2013  (BPS  2011  2014)  Table  4  shows  their  main  constraints.  As  can  be  seen limited funds is indeed the main problem experienced by many of them. The second most serious problem is marketing difficulties in various forms such as many of them are unable to compete with LEs or imported goods  difficulties getting strategic  locations and building rentals are too expensive. The third most serious problem is lack or costliness of raw materials.

While the results of the 2017 survey (BPS 2018) show that out of the total 4.46  million MSEs  65.67%  experienced  serious  difficulties  to  increase  their  production  volume  or  to  expand  their production  capacities  in  order  to  meet  increasing  market  demand  or  even  to  stay  in  business. Figure  2  shows  the  types  of  problems  experienced  which  include  difficulties  in  financing marketing  and  getting  raw  materials.  The  number  of  entrepreneurs  experiencing  these difficulties however differs according to industry groups. For example in the food industry the are  979931  entrepreneurs  experiencing  serious  difficulties  and  around  38%  of  them  said  that their  main constraint is to find external sources of  funding; while  in the paper and paper goods industry only about 18% of 3510 entrepreneurs having difficulties said the same.

However the 2017 national survey of manufacturing MSEs although only a  survey  (not  census)  and  only  in  the  manufacturing  sector  may  provide  a  clue.  Regarding  the source of capital it reveals from the survey three categories of MSEs namely (a) fully financed by own money (i.e. 3679592 respondents or 82.42% of the total MSEs surveyed); (b) partially funded  by  external  sources  (i.e.  608352  respondents  or  13.63%);  and  (c) the  rest (i.e.  176744 respondents  or  3.99%)  who  are  wholly  dependent  on  funds  from  external  sources.  Those  who wholly  or  partly  used  funds  from  external  sources  only  a  small  percentage  of  them  fully  used bank loans. There are more respondents who used funds from nonbank such as saving and loan cooperatives  (credit  unions)  pawnshops  multi  finance/leasing  companies  microfinance institutions  or  from  informal  sources  such  as  friends  relatives  money  lenders  payments  in advance from consumers or debt to the suppliers of raw materials (i.e. payment of raw materials after  goods  have  been  sold).  Many  owners  of  especially  MIEs  prefer  informal  sources  of  fund because they can get the money they needed immediately with no administration costs; although interest rates that they pay are often much higher than commercial banks    rates (BPS 2018).  6.3.2 The SupplySide Figure  3  provides  a  general  picture  about  financial  service  providers  of  MSMEs  in  Indonesia. The  financial  service  providers  can  be  grouped  into  two  categories  namely  banks  and  nonbanks.  The  bank  category  can  be  divided  further  into  two  subcategories  namely  rural  banks (well  known  in  Indonesia  as  Bank  Perkreditan  Rakyat  or  BPR)  and  commercial  banks.  Then each subcategory can be distinguished between sharia or Islamic banks and conventional banks. Sharia banking is a banking system based on the principles of Islamic or sharia law and guided by  Islamic  economics.  Islamic  law  prohibits  collecting  interest  or  "riba".  That  is  why  sharia http//ijbmer.org/   Page 96  International Journal of Business Management and Economic Review                                                                                                                     Vol. 2 No. 03; 2019                                                                                                                         ISSN 25814664 banking is also known as noninterest banking.

BPDs  are  owned  by provincial governments and have a legal form that is now the same as that of commercial banks but these banks focus more on financing regional economic activities. Among commercial banks that provide credits BPR BPD and BRI are the main providers of loans. Although in principle it is the same as a commercial bank the presence of a BPR is focused from the beginning to serve the  community  in  remote  rural  areas  which  have  not  been  reached  maximally  by  commercial bank services. It is regarded as a formal microfinance provider or a secondtier bank to provide services to MSEs and poor households (ADB 2014ab). Microfinance  has  a  long  history  in  the  national  poverty  reduction  and  rural  economic development  context  in  Indonesia  and  it  is  linked  to  development of  local  economic  activities. Some stateowned as well as large commercial banks have developed microfinance windows and programs.  The  most  important  one  is  BRI.  This  stateowned  commercial  bank  is  the  leading institution  in  microfinance  in  Indonesia  and  it  is  wellknown  internationally.  The  other important  banks  with  microfinance  programs  are  Bank  Danamon  with  its  Danamon  Simpan Pinjam (DSP) program Bank Mandiri with its Unit Mikro Mandiri (UMM) and Bank Bukopin with its Swamitra program (ADB 2014a; Tambunan 2018ab). To expand MSME access to bank funding in 2018 Bank Indonesia (the Indonesian central bank) requires  all  banks to  allocate at least 20% of their total  loans to MSMEs. Since the  issuance of this regulation banking attention to MSMEs has been getting better each year.

In  November  2007  a  special  designed  public  credit  guarantee  scheme  (CGS)  was  launched called Community Business Credit or more popular as Kredit Usaha Rakyat (KUR) to provide loans to feasible but not bankable MSEs and cooperatives. KUR is a portfolio guarantee scheme in which the CGS providing agencies give the channeling banks permission to provide credit to any  potential  debtor  as  long  as  he/she  can  meet  certain  eligibility  criteria.  In  return  the  banks notify  the  CGS  providing  agencies  usually  on  a  monthly  basis  of  the  new  loans  they  have approved.  In  case  that  KUR  granted  MSEs  cannot  payback  their  loans  the  CGS  providing agencies  then  pay  the  guaranteed  amounts  of the default  loans  to  the  particular  banks  by  using the fund provided by the Ministry of Finance (Tambunan 2018b).  There  are  three  key  pillars  in  the  implementation  process  of  the  scheme.  The  first  one  is  the government  with  the  main  function  is  to  assist  and  support  the  implementation  process.  The government  is  represented  by  Bank  Indonesia  the  Ministry  of  Finance  the  Ministry  of Cooperative  and  SME  and  the  Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  and  a  number  of sectorrelated ministries to oversee the implementation of the scheme in their own sectors such as  the  Ministry  of  Trade  the  Ministry  of  Industry  and  the  Ministry  of  Agriculture.  The Coordinating  Ministry  for  Economic  Affairs  has  been  appointed  as  the  national  coordinator  of implementation of the KUR scheme (Figure 7).      http//ijbmer.org/   Figure 7 The Functioning of KUR Page 99   International Journal of Business Management and Economic Review                                                                                                                     Vol. 2 No. 03; 2019                                                                                                                         ISSN 25814664 MSMEs Financial institutions                                                                                        Loan guarantee                                                                                                                                                          KUR                                                                                                                                          State budget CGS providing agencies  National government/Ministry of  Finance                                                Coordinated by the Coordinating Ministry for Economic Affairs    The second pillar  is the guarantor companies. In 2018 there are 11 guarantor companies which consists of 10 limited liability companies (PT) including PT Asuransi Kredit Indonesia and PT UAF  Jaminan  Kredit  and  one  public  company  i.e.  Perum  Jaminan  Kredit  Indonesia.  The executing banks are the third pillar which include all statedowned banks many regional banks and some private banks.  Since  the  launch  of the  program  in  2007  and  up to  2018 the  number  of  KUR  realization  from year  to  year  showed  a  significant  increase  except  in  2009  when  the  global  economic  crisis  hit Indonesia  which  only  channeled  4.75 trillion  IDR.  In the  first  year  the  amount  disbursed  was recorded  at  981  billion  IDR  and  by  the  end  of  2018  (December  31)  the  realization  of distribution was recorded at 120349 trillion IDR (Figure 8) or around 97.2 percent of the 2018 target with a total of 4440028 people.

UMi  provides  financing  facilities  also  without  collateral  with  a  maximum  value  of  10  million IDR  per  customer  with  interest  rate  of  2%4%.The  fund  is  distributed  by  nonbank  financial institutions i.e.  PT Pegadaian PT Bahana Artha Ventura and PT Permodalan Nasional Madani and the government appointed the Government Investment Center (PIP) as the coordinator. The sources  of  fund  come  from  the  state  budge  and  the  contributions  of  local  governments  and financial  institutions  both  domestic  and  global.  In  2018  UMi  was  targeted  to  reach  800000 nonbankable  microentrepreneurs.  All  entrepreneurs  who  received  UMi  credit  must  be accompanied by experts and attend trainings so that their business can develop smoothly (MoF 2019).  Besides  KUR  and  UMi  there  are  yet  many  other  special  designed  credit  schemes  for financially  feasible  but  nonbankable  MSEs  including  from  BRI  known  as  Village/Rural Business  Credit  (Kupedes).  This  credit  is  channeled  through  all  village  branches  of  BRI  (BRI Unit  Desa).  Kupedes  is  a  generalpurpose  rural  loan  scheme  with  competitive  interest  rates.  It offers  loans  for  working  capital  as  well  as  investment  to  traders  farmers  producers  and businessmen in other economic sectors as well as to households who need extra money for such as the education needs of their children house renovation and new vehicle or house purchases. Despite  its  name  Kupedes  is  not  only  for  rural  community  but  for  anyone  in  urban  areas  or cities  who  need  money.  The  maximum  loan  limit  is  250  million  IDR  with  competitive  interest rates  and the  period  of  credit  is  between  1260  months.  As  with  KUR  and  UMi  Kupedes  also does not require collateral only the applicant must have run his/her business for at least 1 year and the business documents must be completed (BRI 2019). The Ministry of Cooperatives and SMEs has also its own designed credit namely startup  capital. Initially this fund was prepared for 1830 business beginners with loans ranged from 10 million IDR to 13 million IDR. Only pilot businesses that have been at least six months old with the owners/entrepreneurs maximal 45 years old and have never received similar assistance from the Ministry can apply to this scheme. But before applying the applicants are required to have a business  plan  business  information  loss/profit  calculations  plan  for  using  the  requested  fund and  identity their  business activities. The proposal should  be submitted to the Ministry  via the relevant  local  government  institutions.  For  2019  the  Ministry  will  increase  the  target  with 16292 new entrepreneurs with a total value of 325.84 billion IDR (Hadi 2019).  In  addition  to  start  up  capital  the  Ministry  also  has  a  revolving  loan  scheme  that  is managed  by  an  institution  specifically  built  for  this  scheme  i.e.  Revolving  Fund  Management Institution for Cooperatives and MSMEs (LPDBKUMKM). The conditions for applying for the scheme are very simple. For cooperatives it requires only a letter of application proposal deed of  establishment  and  ratification  clear  financial  statements  annual  member  meeting  reports (RAT)  and  the  legalities  of  cooperative  administrators  supervisors  and  managers.  While  the conditions  for  MSMEs  are  almost  the  same  as  for  cooperatives;  the  different  is  only  that submissions  by  MSMEs  do  not  need  to  be  accompanied  by  reports  of  RAT.  The  allocation  of loans  for  2018  was  set  then  at  amounted  to  Rp1.2  trillion  and  the  target  of  distribution  was focused on the productive sectors such as in agriculture and manufacturing industry. The interest rates  for  MSMEs  in  agriculture  fisheries  and  plantations  are  4.5  percent  while  in  the manufacturing industry 5 percent and 7 percent for savings and loan cooperatives.

Alternatively  MSMEs  can  also  try  to  get  financing  from  venture  capital  companies.  The  first venture  capital  company  in  Indonesia  was  PT  Bahana  Pembinaan  Usaha  Indonesia  founded  in 1973 by the Ministry of Finance and Bank Indonesia. This company together with all  stateand regional  governmentowned  companies  have  established  venture  capital  companies  in  all regions/provinces  in Indonesia. Unlike bank  financing financing by  venture capital companies is in the form of temporary capital participation. Other differences are venture capital companies as risk takers in capital and provide management assistance to granted MSMEs. Until July 2018 the venture capital industry recorded total financing and investments worth Rp. 8.13 trillion from a  total  of  66   venture  capital  companies  (https//keuangan.kontan.co.id/news/inilah65perusahaanmodalventurayangterdaftardiojk). Many  other  ministries  also  have  their  own  credit schemes  for  MSMEs  in  their  sectors  such  as the Ministry of Agriculture (e.g. SSRG KUPS KPENRP) the Ministry of Maritime Affairs and Fisheries  (KKPE)  the  Ministry  of  Communication  and  Information  (BP3TI)  the  Ministry  of StateOwned  Enterprises  (PKBL)  the  Ministry  of  Finance  (KUMK)  the  Ministry  of  Public Works and Public Housing (PPP) and the Ministry of Forestry and Environment (P2H KLH). Finally in the past few years fintech Peer to Peer (P2P) lending has grown rapidly in Indonesia which  can  be  a  hood  alternative  source  of  financing  for  MSMEs.  Data  from  the  Financial Services Authority (OJK) shows that per October 2018 P2P loans have reached Rp 15.6 trillion. P2P  loans  do  not  need  collateral  and  the  loan  ceiling  can  reach  IDR  200  million.  Per  January 2019 there are 99 fintech companies based on P2P lending. One of them is PT Amartha Mikro Fintek which by the end of 2018 had distributed loans of more than Rp. 635 billion to 152000 MSMEs  mostly  in  the  trade  and  agricultural  sectors.  Other  companies  include  Drrupiah.com Cekaya.com Taralite.com Credy.co.id DuitPintar.com and Modal.co id.  6.3.3 Main Reasons for Lack of Access Both data on the total number of MSME bank credit accounts for the period 20132018 as well as  the  result  of  the  2017  survey  of  manufacturing  MSEs  shown  above  give  a  clear  impression that  although  there  are  already  so  many  formal  sources  of  funding  for  small  businesses  both from  banks  and  nonbanks  only  a  small  number  of  MSMEs  in  Indonesia  have  used  these sources. There are several reasons. From the 2017 survey of manufacturing MSEs it reveals that many of them were unable to lend money from banks because they did not have valuable assets to  be  used  as  collateral.  Many  families  in  rural  areas  who  run  small  businesses  do  have  large houses  and  land  obtained  from  their  parents  but  no  certificate  so  that  their  land  and  houses cannot be accepted by banks as collateral (BPS 2018). While other respondents said that they don\'t dare to borrow because of high interest. Especially for those  whose  productions  are  seasonal  such  as the  craft  industries  in  tourist  areas that  make various kinds of souvenirs that only highly demanded during the holiday seasons or those who make children\'s uniforms that only have many buyers when new school period is about to start. Also  many  MSE  owners  do  not  dare to  borrow  from  banks  because  their  sales  on  average  per month are not so much or uncertain. There are also many respondents confessed that they have difficulties fulfilling credit application procedures  or  their  proposals  were  rejected.  This  can  be  understood  because  most  of particularly  the  MSEs     owners  have  only  elementary  school  education.  Even  though  they  can http//ijbmer.org/   Page 102  International Journal of Business Management and Economic Review                                                                                                                     Vol. 2 No. 03; 2019                                                                                                                         ISSN 25814664 read they have difficulties understanding all kinds of requirements in the credit application form. Therefore  the  government  has  often  asked  for  various  parties  such  as  NGOs  universities officials of related ministries or even the banks themselves to assist MSEs    owners in applying for credits. There are also some respondents whose limited information about credit application procedures is their main reason for not borrowing money from banks. Often a ministry or a commercial bank issued a special credit scheme for MSMEs but without extensive socialization about the scheme. Let  alone  MSMEs  in  remote  locations  or  isolated  rural  areas  many  MSMEs  in  cities  or  urban areas are also not aware of existing funding schemes special  designed for them that they actually can  easily  get  because  without  collateral.  Indeed  it  is  often  recommended  that  banks  or government  departments  that  have  MSMEs  funding  schemes  to  actively  look  for  or  identify potential borrowers not just wait until MEMEs come to them.  7. CONCLUSION This Indonesian case study shows that even though the government has tried to make it easier for MSMEs to gain access to official sources of financing including providing a number of special designed  credit  schemes  for  MSMEs  such  as  KUR  only  very  few  MSMEs  that  has  ever borrowed  money  from  banks  or  nonbank  financial  institutions.  Of  course  there  are  many MSMEs who were initially not interested to borrow money from banks for various reasons. But for  those  who  want  to  get  loans  from  the  bank  not  all  of  them  have  managed  to  get them  for various  reasons  including  the  absence  of  collateral  high  interest  rate  and  their  proposals  were rejected. Perhaps  the  important  message  of  this  study  is  that  making  many  credit  schemes  specific  for MSMEs and the active participation of the banking sector in MSMEs  funding do not  guarantee the  success  of  the  government  policy  on  MSMEs  financing.  There  must  also  be  done  on  the demand  side  such  as  mentoring  for  prospective  borrowers  in  preparing  all  administrative requirements for loan applications and perhaps more importantly making it easier for MSMEs owners to arrange land certificates to be used as collateral. Indeed in recent years the Indonesian government has distributed many land certificates for farmers and other villagers who own land but are not certified. This effort must continue and  must be comprehensive  in all rural areas  in Indonesia.       References 1.  Abdulsaleh  A.  M.  &  Worthington  A.  C.  (2013).
