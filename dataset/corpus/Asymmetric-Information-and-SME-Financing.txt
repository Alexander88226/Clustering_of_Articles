Kodippili Arachchi Introduction It is evident that Small and Medium Enterprises play a vital role in the Sri Lankan economy contributing 52       53  per  cent  to  Gross  Domestic  Production.  Role  of  SME  is  considered  as  one  of  the  major components in every developing as well as developed economy where it caters socioeconomic strength  to  the  country.  SME  sector  enables  the  country   s  economy  to  be  boot  up  as  well  as creates a huge amount of employment opportunities in the informal sector. Therefore SME can be taken as the backbone of the economy. When it comes financing aspect financing on SME sector is vulnerable and widespread for many times. SMEs have their own complete information which  will  rarely  be  disclosed  to  another  party.  Lenders  experience  a  great  pain  in  providing credit  facilities  to  this  sector  due  to  high  transaction  cost  and  recovery  process  occurred  by asymmetry of information. The  main  objective  of  this  study  is  to  find  out  how  asymmetric  information  affect  in  SMEs financial  access.  It  is  further  narrowed  down  into  four  such  as  understanding  the  financial reporting  discipline  of  the  entrepreneurs  observing  why  entrepreneurs  are  restricted  produce their actual business status to lenders identifying the main reasons which restrict SMEs to obtain external  financial  resources  and  examining  bank  strategies  to  handle  asymmetric  information issue. Lenders such as banks and other financial institutes are restricted to grant credit facilities due to asymmetry of information. Lenders are exposed to a huge risk in funding while the entrepreneurs manipulate financial figures and provide false information. All these lead to adverse selection and moral hazard occurring immense contractions in the industry.  Literature review  Kitindi  Magembe  and  Sethibe  (2007)  argue  that  creditors  lenders  and  other  bankers  use financial information provided by enterprises. In this situation if the accuracy of the information is  not  entrusted  the  lenders  will  be  mislead.  Stiglitz  and  Weiss  (1981)  argue  that  agency problems  such  as  asymmetry  of  information  and  moral  hazard  may  impact  on  the  ability  to  1  obtain  the  external  sources  of  funds.  Shinozaki  (2012)  argues  that  information  asymmetry between  borrowers  and  lenders  increases  the  adverse  selection  and  moral  hazard  risks  for financial  institutions.  Mazani  and  Fatoki  (2012)  argue  that  asymmetry  of  information  has become a major issue for lenders in credit rationing. Hong and Gu (2014) argue that asymmetry of information has made severe impacts on accessing external financial resources from formal financial industry.  2. Methodology  Sample and collection of data Homagama Divisional Secretariat is in Colombo is consisting of 68 Grama Niladhari Divisions. The area is fully furnished with essential infrastructure. There are 254 small and medium scale enterprises  established  within  the  coverage  of  Homagama  Divisional  Secretariat.  Randomly selected 75 SMEs were considered for the sample for SME sector and 4 banks were considered for  the  banking  sector  representing  2  from  state  sector  and  2  from  private  sector.  Data  was collected using both primary and secondary methods. In this study the primary data is collected using  two  questionnaires;  one  is  for  SME  firms  and  the  other  is  for  banks.  Other  than  that interviews and field visits were made to assure the accuracy of the study. Collected data fed into the  SPSS  17.0  to  derive  the  set  objectives.  Likert  Scale  questions  were  used  to  test  the respondents views are given a respective value. One    way Anova test is applied in this study. p     values is used to test hypothesis and the significance level of p     value is 0.05.    3. Results and discussion It carries 66.67 per cent from manufacturing sector 24 per cent from industrial sector and 9.33 percent  from  services  sector.  As  a  percentage  50.67  carry  Sole  proprietorships  18.67  carry Partnerships and 30.67 carry Limited Liability firms.  Referring  to  Table  1  analyzing  the  questionnaires  given  to  SMEs  it  is  arrived  that  p  value  is 0.602  which  is  above  the  standard  p       value  which  shows  SMEs  are  vulnerable  to  mislead lenders not declaring actual information.    2  Table 1  SMEs mislead the lenders Source Why  asymmetry Error Total Model Summary Source  Author   s calculations 903.5 3 71  34246.5 74  35150.0 DF  Adj SS  Adj MS  FValue  PValue 0.602 0.62 301.2 482.3                Referring to the Table 2 second objective p value is 0.327 means that SMEs faced difficulties in the event of getting credit facilities from banks.

Similarly  the  first second and third objectives were addressed by the p and ANOVA test. Percentage calculation of regular financial behaviour gives a clear picture of their accounting practices.  3  4. Conclusion and policy recommendations Conclusion Majority  sole  proprietors  (55.27  per  cent)  and  partnerships  (64.29  per  cent)  do  not  maintain audited  financial  statements.  All  limited  liability  firms  maintain  audited  financial  statements. Higher information asymmetry can be observed among sole proprietorships and least asymmetry of information is granted to limited liability firms. Lack of knowledge in financial reporting less awareness about how it is needed by lenders to take credit decisions. heavy work load in the business operational activities and banks always prefer favourable financial positions before lending caused for asymmetric information.  Banks  demand  for  financial  reports  do  regular  customer  call  for  other  bank  status  reports review CRIB reports to evaluate the direct and indirect liabilities. release funds stages by stages observing  utilization  and  obtain  a  fixed  property  security  to  mitigate  the  credit  risk  (  as  a secondary option) Policy recommendation The  study  focused  to  examine  the  financial  reporting  behaviour  of  SMEs  why  SMEs  are  far distant  from  formal  financial  industry  why  SMEs  are  facing  difficulties  in  getting  loan  from banks and how do banks manage the problem of asymmetric information while evaluating credit proposals.  Form a unique definition for SMEs in the country is stressed out since different institutions have formed different definitions depending on their institutional goals and they are conflicting with each other.  Formalizing  the  sole  proprietors  and  partnerships  is  an  essential  fact  to  be  considered  since majority of them avoid maintaining proper financial discipline. Informality of the management and tax evasion have caused for that. Therefore these firms should be streamed line into formal financial discipline.  Banks heavily depend on CRIB report however pawning facilities obtained by borrowers are not traced by them yet a matter to be considered for the credibility of the borrower. Status of the  4  pawing  facilities  must  be  included  in  the  CRIB  under  the  borrower   s  identification  number which enables the lender to evaluate the total debt of the borrower.
