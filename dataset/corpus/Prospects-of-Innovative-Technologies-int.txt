b'herein filePROSPECTS OF INNOVATIVE TECHNOLOgIES  INTO EDUCATIONAL SYSTEM INTRODUCTIONP. Machashtchik Doctor rector State Higher Educational Institution named prof. Stanislaus Tarnowski I. Britchenko Doctor of Economic Sciences professor State Higher Educational Institution named prof. Stanislaus Tarnowski Educational system innovative development innovation management and marketing technologies and tools active improvement learning technologies improvement and multiplication have become an integral attributes  of  educational  technology  of  the  majority  countries  in  the  world. Innovations in educational system development is the basis of a state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innovative and technological policy.The need to improve educational system and introduce innovative technologies is an essential prerequisite able to ensure countries into the world economic community untrammeled integration. In this context it should be noted that modern information and communication technologies application enables to significantly speed up information search and transfer process transform mental activity nature and automate human labor. Erudition and the ability to manage information have long become wealth and power basis in most of economically developed countries. The OECD (Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development) report noted that \\xc2\\xabin the knowledgebased economy science and technology are the most important sources of economic growth and welfare\\xc2\\xbb.OECD experts all definitely agreed that \\xc2\\xabthe basic longterm economic growth rate in OECD countries depends on knowledge base maintaining and expanding ... In many OECD countries value added real growth in the knowledgebased industries has consistently outpaced the overall economic growth for the past two decades. Globalization process has accelerated these trends... Countries comparative advantages are less determined by natural resources richness  or  cheap  labor  but  increasingly  by  technological  innovations  and knowledge competitive application... Economic growth today is as much a process of knowledge accumulation as it is a capital accumulation process\\xc2\\xbb[1].161\\x0cChapter 4. Social investments as a contribution to SMEs development According  to  analysts  educational  technology  is  one  of  the  most promising sectors for investment. Despite the fact that educational technology is a market with $5 trillion a year turnover it is completely shaded by not just fintech but by other investment spheres as well. But according to TechCrunch journalists the situation tables have begun to turn. According to the EdTechXGlobal and IBIS Capital report investment in education and training will have reached $252 billion by 2020 [2].Besides the fact that this industry has direct access to schools institutes and universities it also is the most reliable object for investments. In contrast to the financial market upsanddowns education remains constant and secure from geopolitical storms. According to TechCrunch experts digital education is the largest and probably the most profitable IT sector [3].Geoff Mugan the Chief Executive of Nesta \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a British Innovation Institute \\xe2\\x80\\x93 has adopted four technological trends in education which he considers to be the most promising for GovInsider they are digital textbooks blockchain crowdteaching and adaptive learning [4].More detailed analysis of modern innovative technologies which may significantly change educational system configuration in the nearest future is deemed necessary.Education along with a number of other sectors (such as health care and  telecommunications)  are  subject  to  significant  changes  due  to  digital technology increasing distribution. As is usually the case commercial organizations such as private universities business schools and corporate universities set trends for digital technologies in educational and research activities implementation. But public universities and institutes are increasingly starting to consider digital transformation [5].Rapid  online  learning  adaptation  which  is  expressed  in  the  form  of blended learning development and MOOC (Massive online open course) active development should be noted among the challenging digital innovations. The term MOOC was invented in 2008 by David Cormier of the University of Prince Edward Island of Canada and Brian Alexander of the National Institute for Technology in Liberal Education [6].Massive  online  open  course  (MOOC)  is  a  training  course  with  a mass  interactive  participation  by  means  of  elearning  technologies  and open access via the Internet [7] and is one of distance learning forms. As 162\\x0cProspects of innovative technologies into educational system introduction additions to traditional curricula such as videos reading and homework assignments massive online open course provides an opportunity to use interactive user forums that help to create and maintain students teachers and assistants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 community.Online learning development dynamics is demonstrated in particular by available online courses growth the number of which is doubled every year in more recent times. At present more than 4200 courses from over 500 universities are available. Fig. 1. Online Learning Development Dynamics [5]Advancing  online  segment  of  educational  services  emergence  can completely change this sector landscape according to some estimates in addition to the number of courses offered and the number of trainees annual  doubling  MOOC  market  projected  consolidated  revenue  will  grow more than fivefold by 2020.Development  of  digital  libraries  and  digital  universities\\xe2\\x80\\x99  campuses which have already been implemented by many universities in America and Europe are additional areas of digital technologies in education application.Currently three major MOOC platforms are successfully in operation in the USA they are edX founded by Harvard University and Massachusetts Institute of Technology Udacity a structure formed on the basis of Computer Science syllabus at Stanford University and Coursera.163\\x0cChapter 4. Social investments as a contribution to SMEs development MOOC is being developed in other parts of the world as well Iversity in Germany (300 thousand students more than anywhere else in Europe) Open  University  in  the  UK  Crypt4you  in  Spain  OpenupEd  which  is  a spring of the European Union educational structures EduKart in India etc.Americans  were  the  first  to  launch  so  their  MOOC  magnitude  is beyond competition 1.6 million audiences (or users) in edX as many in Udacity and as many as 6.3 million in Coursera [6].However the opinion of A. Chikunov [8] is shared by us and along with undeniable advantages online learning disadvantages shall be critically catalogued. MOOC is a good example of technological solutions into educational field implementation. In fact it is a tool that allows to change material delivery method instead of lectures at universities interesting video lessons can be viewed interactive tasks exercises etc. can be solved. But it emerged that \\xd0\\x9c\\xd0\\x9e\\xd0\\x9e\\xd0\\xa1 proved to be ineffective in traditional learning formats competing due to the fact that the same level of material understanding was impossible  to  be  reached.  \\xd0\\x9c\\xd0\\x9e\\xd0\\x9e\\xd0\\xa1  offers  lectures  interpretations  simple tests and surveys \\xe2\\x80\\x94 but all this is not enough to memorize the material. A person often needs direct communication with the teacher. In addition not all training fits into the lecture format \\xe2\\x80\\x94 there are also exercises laboratory classes as well as design work.The matters that colleges and universities are facing now are limited to the further development strategy choice and direction to focus on selection. It is obvious that digital transformation program for transition to a competitive educational and research model in the future should now be developed.Artificial intelligence is another innovative technology that is rapidly developing in educational sector. Artificial intelligence (AI) is a research area associated with methods for modeling individual functions of intelligence by means of software and hardware development [9]. Many  AI  application  areas  are  available  theorems  proving;  games; patterns recognition; decisions making; adaptive programming; machine music  composition;  data  processing  natural  language;  knowledgebased networks (neural networks); verbal conceptual learning are among them.Thus according to the Laboratory of Knowledge of University College in London and Pearson report [10] many schools and universities already 164\\x0cProspects of innovative technologies into educational system introduction apply artificial intelligence technologies for educational purposes. Most of them combine AI with Big Data technologies in order to monitor whether the students attend classes and do tasks.Due to artificial intelligence introduction intellectual training systems that are programs that simulate the teachers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 behavior have appeared. They are capable of checking the students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 standard of knowledge by analyzing their answers reporting feedback and even scheduling personalized training programs.At the moment the following examples of introduction both applications as chatbots and artificial intelligence in educational sector are known1. Automated valid classification. Automated written work e.g. an essay assessment is a challenging task faced by many teachers. For instance both tests and essays are evaluated by artificial intelligence on such online platforms as Coursera EdX and Udasity. Such training programs as Carnegie Speech and Duolingo use natural language processing technology to identify mispronunciation and correct it.2. Intermediate interval training. Thus a Polish inventor Peter Wozniak came up with an educational application based on the interval effect. This application back traces what is studied and when. By means of artificial intelligence the application can track when the information is likely to be forgotten and recommend to revise it. It only takes a few refresher courses to make sure the information is stored in memory for many years.3. Feedback. Feedback that is students\\xe2\\x80\\x99 assessment of teachers has a centurylong history. Due to modern technologies such as AIdriven chat robots computeraided learning and natural language processing a lot of interesting opportunities for feedback quality improvement are now available. Chatbot is capable of collecting opinions via a dialog interface with the same benefits as a \\xc2\\xabreal\\xc2\\xbb interview but with a smaller amount of work required. Conversation can be adapted in accordance with answers and student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s personality the chatbot is even capable of investigating this or that opinion cause. Besides the fact that it is a good option for conducting surveys the chatbot provides many other benefits to the teachers who seek to improve teaching effectiveness. By attracting more data sources such as selfassessment evaluation peers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 feedback and the latest scientific evidence on how to effectively teach a more aggregate picture of training effectiveness can be 165\\x0cChapter 4. Social investments as a contribution to SMEs development created. Own data with other teachers around the world data comparison should enable the system to offer new and powerful ways to improve teaching methods as well as results in teaching community sharing.4. Teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistant. At the Georgia Institute of Technology students enjoyed communicating with the new teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistant Jill Watson who quickly and accurately answered their different questions. But the students did not know that Ms. Watson\\xe2\\x80\\x99s true identity was actually an IBMAIsystemequipped computer with the same name. With the help of Ashok Goel a Professor of Computer Science the teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistant Watson responded with more than 40000 posts on the forum.Having received huge advertising Jill Watson is now being introduced to universities around the world. One of the last to be added to the list is BI Norwegian Business School in Oslo Norway.5. Chat campus. A bot that helps students who have just gone up to the college \\xc2\\xabto get accustomed\\xc2\\xbb has been created in AdmitHub  students can apply for scholarships register for courses issue a plea for a place in the dormitory by its means. Cornell University uses the CourseQ bot to interview students about various problems associated with the new school year start.And at the University of Deakin in Victoria (Australia) the chat campus is now being tested in service. As with the teacher\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assistant case the intelligence  underneath  it  is  IBM  Watson  supercomputing  system.  The chatcampus being implemented is capable of answering questions related to everything a student may need to know about the campus life such as how to find the next lecture hall how to apply for the next class of the semester how to obtain assignments where to find a parking place or how to contact a consultant. All these issues can be solved by the socalled \\xc2\\xabdjinns\\xc2\\xbb i.e. chatbots [11].6. Feedback from students. A new approach to studentcentered educational models where an individual personality and a student concern are the most crucial factors in curriculum development is being studied.The content is adapted to the individual pace of training and can consistently  offer  more  complex  challenges  to  accelerate  learning  process. Thus both fast and slow students can continue training at their own pace.Thus AutoTutor for example teaches Computer Literacy Physics and Critical Thinking by communicating with students in their preferred lan166\\x0cProspects of innovative technologies into educational system introduction guage. And Knewton Software takes into account each student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s training specifics and allows to develop a personalized learning plan taking into account the degree of mastering the material as well as student\\xe2\\x80\\x99s frequent mistakes. Bill Gates suggested that chatbots can also be used as tutors [12]. Theoretically these services can teach almost anything. Thus Nerdfy Bot helps students do homework and Ucheba_bot recommends courses universities and colleges for applicants.   Dozens of bots related  to  education  are  already  available  around  the  world  some  help practicing signboards legal issues history etc. others present rare and interesting facts. However in our opinion a foreign language study remains the most popular area in the bots\\xe2\\x80\\x99 application. This problem is come to grips with by Russian startup Edwin as well. The company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emphasis is made on English language skills training. The service combines artificial intelligence (it personalizes training plans communicates with the user in the chat manages different language skills training equipment supports study etc.) and tutor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s services (e.g. the service is needed for individual lessons on spoken language practicing) [8].The authors of the Laboratory of Knowledge of University College in London and Pearson report note that artificial intelligence is already actively being introduced into the group learning process. It is used to appoint groups of students with the same level of knowledge analyze the discussion between people and mark the moments when the conversation participants get off the topic.The report states that artificial intelligence technologies are capable of tracking each student progress. Such a monitoring may become mandatory in the future to ensure schools districts and a country as a whole performance evaluation as well as effectiveness of various training programs testing.Researchers believe that the future will offer \\xc2\\xabeducational partners\\xc2\\xbb that will teach a person throughout his lifetime. \\xc2\\xabBeing in the cloud they will be available on each device as well as in offline mode. Instead of teaching all subjects these partners will be able to contact an expert in a certain field on requirement and then inform the user about his point of view \\xc2\\xab[10].Artificial intelligence technologies which are already called \\xc2\\xabnew electricity\\xc2\\xbb are rapidly entering new verticals and EdTech is not an excep167\\x0cChapter 4. Social investments as a contribution to SMEs development tion. It is obvious that AI in education application will significantly change learning process in the future [13].Many important problems can be solved by means of blockchain technology into education introduction. Thus currently the distributed blockchain database is increasingly being integrated into document storage and control systems. This technology advantage is lack of practical capabilities to manipulate the data recorded in the system due to the fact that the information in the database can only be added but not recirculated. Conversely document authenticity can be easily traced as everyone can trace whom it was recorded into the blockchain by. Along with identification papers and banking sector \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKryptorevolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d has not ignored educational system as well.Cryptocurrencies including Bitcoin operate on its basis. The main blockchain feature is its immutability. Posted into the database transaction data can neither be deleted nor edited since huge computing resources are required for the smallest revision [14].Blockchain is a technology enabling to store information in a distributed form. If a user has a key to this database he will have access to the materials posted which will provide some openness and transparency to many areas of life. However like any new technology the \\xc2\\xabblockchain\\xc2\\xbb system to date causes a lot of questions and disputes that require solutions from the experts.It should be noted that currently situation in digital economy market in the education development sphere is in the initial development stage.The University of Nicosia has become the first to officially use blockchain to store their diplomas and certificates. Importantly it also became the first university to accept Bitcoin as a payment. Massive OnLine Open Courses (MOOC) of the University of Nicosia are available in 83 countries. It is also a member of European Universities Association (EUA) and European Association of Higher Education (EURASHE). It means that its diplomas and certificates are recognized worldwide.Such organizations as Open University (UK) Sony Massachusetts Institute of Technology and others have become inheritors [15].Sony Corporation and Sony Global Education (SGE) have created a system  with  blockchain  technology  in  educational  field  application.  The system  enables  centralized  data  within  several  educational  institutions management. It enables making links recording information and perform168\\x0cProspects of innovative technologies into educational system introduction ing digital manuscripts. The system eliminates data falsification possibility as well as controls the access to the records that allows transferring data to authorized third parties in the proper form. The program will operate on the basis of Hyperledger project in which blockchain technology is actively being implemented.It is noteworthy that the current system will enable operators to link previously  collected  data  to  training  systems  and  students  data  systems even though such data is collected from different sources. Further the users can see the overall academic performance picture perform digital decoding and send it to an appropriate authority. In addition the presented system allows to analyze data and records by means of artificial intelligence and subsequently suggest ways to improve curriculum as well as educational institutions management mechanism [16].The Company representatives stated \\xc2\\xabThis technology holds the potential to develop an innovative infrastructure system for the data on the network various secure distribution providing incredible opportunities for dealing with academic records and their evaluation\\xc2\\xbb.Sony Global Education innovation will help to facilitate open and secure data management that will further result in new services in educational field emergence. Moreover the new system will attract attention of numerous educational institutions representatives to the network which will increase the level of confidence in testing procedure.The company representatives added \\xc2\\xabSony Global Education is planning to launch the new system development as early as in 2017 by implementing applications based on blockchain technology in the services provided commencing with Global Math Challenge.\\xc2\\xbbGlobal Math Challenge is an international online competition which participants are assessed on mathematical knowledge and logical abilities level. More than 150 thousand enthusiasts from more than 80 countries have taken part in the competition. It is noteworthy that the results are determined not only based on correct and incorrect answers calculation. In addition overall performance including time spent on the proposed tasks solution  is  also  assessed.  The  final  assessment  is  a  participant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  abilities confirmation which meets international standards requirements [17].As  for  academic  progress  data  with  blockchain  recording  the  San Francisco Engineering School of Holberton outstripped the Japanese giant 169\\x0cChapter 4. Social investments as a contribution to SMEs development by signing an agreement with Bitproof to transfer its own diplomas to the blockchain.Educhain  is  a  blockchain  startup  in  educational  technology  field which has become a Dubai Future Accelerators (DFA) program \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgraduate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The company is planning to launch its pilot project in the selected institutions in Dubai which will affect all system levels. The launch is scheduled for early 2018.This project enables academic institutions to issue their official diplomas in digital form and automate their verification. Control over making entries in such a document is at the Registrar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s directly and a student himself can see who exactly looks through his records. This approach reduces administrative costs and at the same time saves institutions time on processing information.  Ultimately Educhain platform can completely change documentation storage management and processing by eliminating unnecessary middlemen and creating benefits for institutions students and employers.At the end of 2017 the DFA invited Educhain for cooperation with KHDA (Committee on Science and Human Development) the regulatory body of Dubai providing the quality of education. The goal of creating selfregulating school institutions ready for challenges of the future and able to become a world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best by 2025 was set. Educhain and KHDA has investigated startup blockchain solutions potential to ensure certification practices and certification system to digital rails transfer. This is required by the Dubai Blockchain Strategy2020 [18].In January 2016 the Ministry of Education of France announced plans to create a new digital platform which allows diplomas confirmation.Blockchain technology is of great interest to French universities these days due to great potential for innovation in educational sector especially when it comes to degrees and diplomas authentication. All current procedures could be shortcut quite simply while at the same time providing all safety measures and confidentiality. Due to this future headhunters can go online and check out information from an applicant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s CV in a matter of minutes [19].The European Commission has published a report [20] which presents the results of their research on Blockchain technology in education application. Among other things the Commission has analyzed such areas as feasibility possible problems benefits and risks as well as the technology 170\\x0cProspects of innovative technologies into educational system introduction application in universities and schools. 8 possible blockchain technology in education applications are mentioned in the report. The most relevant issues that can be solved by the blockchain is documents accreditation and transfer  digital  certification  multilevel  accreditation  and  students\\xe2\\x80\\x99  fees payment.In  conclusion  the  Commission  has  recognized  the  fact  that  blockchain in this field application is still in its infancy. It also stated that only a \\xc2\\xabcompletely open\\xc2\\xbb process of the technology implementation can produce real results and give Blockchain Technology an opportunity to support educational sector [21].All the above allows to assert that getting education being anywhere on the planet is possible in the modern world. And although traditional forms of getting education do not lose their ground the given advantages of innovative technologies in education are undeniable.Today we are witnessing a new educational system focused on integration into global information and educational space emergence. This process is accompanied by significant changes in learning process organization which should correspond to modern technical possibilities. Modern information technologies in education penetration can qualitatively change educational methods and organizational forms having made it much more convenient and accessible.REFERENCES1.  \\xd0\\xa1\\xd0\\xb5\\xd1\\x80\\xd1\\x82\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xba\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb2\\xd0\\xb0 \\xd0\\x98.\\xd0\\x9d. \\xd0\\x9d\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb2\\xd1\\x8b\\xd0\\xb5 \\xd1\\x82\\xd0\\xb5\\xd1\\x85\\xd0\\xbd\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xbb\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb3\\xd0\\xb8\\xd0\\xb8 \\xd0\\xb2 \\xd1\\x81\\xd1\\x84\\xd0\\xb5\\xd1\\x80\\xd0\\xb5 \\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb1\\xd1\\x80\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xb7\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb2\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xbd\\xd0\\xb8\\xd1\\x8f \\xd0\\xb8 \\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb1\\xd1\\x80\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xb7\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb2\\xd0\\xb0\\xd1\\x82\\xd0\\xb5\\xd0\\xbb\\xd1\\x8c\\xd0\\xbd\\xd1\\x8b\\xd1\\x85 \\xd1\\x83\\xd1\\x81\\xd0\\xbb\\xd1\\x83\\xd0\\xb3/ \\xd0\\x98.\\xd0\\x9d. \\xd0\\xa1\\xd0\\xb5\\xd1\\x80\\xd1\\x82\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xba\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb2\\xd0\\xb0 // \\xd0\\x90\\xd0\\xbd\\xd0\\xb0\\xd0\\xbb\\xd0\\xb8\\xd1\\x82\\xd0\\xb8\\xd0\\xba\\xd0\\xb0 \\xd0\\xba\\xd1\\x83\\xd0\\xbb\\xd1\\x8c\\xd1\\x82\\xd1\\x83\\xd1\\x80\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xbb\\xd0\\xbe\\xd0\\xb3\\xd0\\xb8\\xd0\\xb8.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 2010.\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xd0\\x92\\xd1\\x8b\\xd0\\xbf. 17\\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x94 \\xd0\\xa1.296301.Emily Spaven.
