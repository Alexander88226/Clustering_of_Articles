Saksonova2         Abstract   This article analyses the ways how companies operating in EU countries attract alternative financial  resources.  The  importance  of  nontraditional  alternative/innovative  financing  is gaining recognition in both developed and emerging economies throughout the world.   SMEs    financing in Europe remains primarily bank based in spite of many policies proposed to  develop  alternative  financing  instruments  (e.g.  adopting  directives  on  venture  capital improving the transparency and visibility of SMEs on capital markets etc.).   The research is therefore to expose recent trends in alternative financing in EU significantly enhancing  the  evidence  base  on  this  key  source  of  entrepreneurial  finance.  As  a  source  of    smart money    supporting new and early stage businesses alternative providers are widely accepted as being a critical part of the competitiveness enhancement.  Generally accepted qualitative and quantitative methods of economic research were applied in this paper including indepth facetoface interviews with the board members of the nine banks  of  Latvia  operating  in  the  other  Baltic  and  Nordic  countries  as  well  as  1200 companies    owners or top managers.   Main  findings  show  that  alternative  financial  service  providers  are  competing  and  often outcompeting  the  traditional  ones  at  high  speed.  Conducted  empirical  analysis  shows  the most available financing sources except banking products are Friends and Family (FF) and different  state  (including  EU  grants)  support  programmes  Venture  Capital  (VC)  and Business Angels (BA).

Introduction  Availability of funding has been a pressing obstacle for SMEs    entrepreneurs banks and  academics  since  2009.  In  many  countries  small  and  medium  firms  are dominating  for  instance  in  Latvia  about  95%  of  all  companies  are  small  and medium providing market with the majority of jobs. The shape of financial market is  changing  partly  because  of  the  20082009  crisis  and  partly  due  to  other  world processes that have been developing alongside it. Starting from the second decade of 21st  century  business  models  of  banks  are  challenged  by  nontraditional  financial service  providers almost in  all areas  including the  core  banking  functions  as loans and  deposits.  Companies     financing  mechanism  is  changing  reshaping  the traditional bank activities and promoting alternative financing provider activities.    Nontraditional  financing  for  companies  is  an  alternative  solution  how  to  get  the necessary  funding  when  traditional  financing  resources  as  credit  lines  loans overdrafts  and  credit  cards  are  not  available.  Alternative  financing  is  a  new  field with a gap in the theoretical and empirical aspect. It is not clear how to manage these resources effectively both from the authorities and the entrepreneurs point of view.     Freshlyestablished  firms  face  many  challenges  to  get  funding  and  they  have increased since 2008. Consequences of the last financial crisis geopolitical situation and  economic  uncertainty  are  effecting  bank  risk  tolerance  towards  new  firms crediting.  To  get  a loan  from  a  commercial  bank  a  company  needs  stable  financial indicators  and  credit  history  that  is  not  common  practise  for  freshlyestablished firms. These processes effect small companies harder than the large ones thus they have to pay higher risk premium can get loans for shorter maturities and also need bigger collateral.        Availability  of  capital  markets  by  issuing  equities  and  bonds  for  SMEs  is  also problematic.  Only  companies  with  good  financial  statements  and  positive  credit history with good reputation and wellknown in general can attract money directly through  the  capital  markets.    Small  amount  of  listed  companies  and  small capitalisation  in  Europe  confirm  the  difficulties  of  raising  funds  through  capital markets for instance in 2015 the market capitalization of listed domestic companies (% of GDP) in the US was 1390 % comparing with 653% in the Euro area (World Bank 2017).  Meanwhile venture capital firms have become more risk adverse due to pressures in the  industry  and  have  focused  on  later  stage  investments.  Angel  investors  have become  more  visible  and  active through  groups  syndicates  and networks  but  they also  face  difficulties.  As  a  result  governments  in  many  advanced  economies  have sought to address the financing gap and perceived market failures by supporting the seed and early stage market.       R. RupeikaApoga S. Saksonova 45  Although  the  amount  of  publications  and  research  papers  on  the  topic  of  raising alternative  informal  or  nontraditional  financing  has  increased  since  2008  the availability  of  this  financing  has  not  been  sufficiently  researched  yet.  Mainly  the researchers are specializing in one kind of alternative resources instead of focusing on the whole market (Kuzmina and Kublina 2014; Prohorovs and Fainglozs 2014; Venckuviene and Snieska 2014). Additionally there is lack of statistics (Prohorovs and  Fainglozs  2014)  in  this  field  making  the  research  even  harder.  The  research question in this study is how well known are alternative financing resources for the small and medium companies in Europe.  2.  Literature Review    Statistic reports of ECB European Commission national countries economic reports  indicate that SMEs are mostly using the formal bank credits (ECB 2014; EM 2014; European  Commission  2015;  Japparova  and  RupeikaApoga  2017;  Karlan  and Morduch 2010; Havlicek  et al. 2013). During 20152016 EU28 SMEs most often reported  using  short  term  bank  finance  (credit  line/bank  or  overdraft/  credit  card) followed  by  longterm  bank  loans  leasing  or  hirepurchase  trade  credit.  Latvian SMEs  reported  bank  loans  (50%)  equity  investment  (25%)  and    loan  from  other sources  as  the  main  types  of  external  financing  for  future  development  projects (Kwaak and Zeijden 2016).  Whereas  another  strand  of  the  literature  focuses  on  the  nontraditional/alternative financing  that  can  help  fill  the  gaps  between  SMEs  financial  needs  and  available traditional  financial  resources  (Casey  and  O   Toole  2014;  Cycle  2013;  Kuntchev 2014;  Prelipcean  and  Boscoianu  2014;  RupeikaApoga  and  Solovjova  2017).    A broad  range  of  studies  have  highlighted  governmental  supporting  policies  for alternative  financing  providers  (Alperovych  and  H  bner  2015;  Cumming  and MacIntosh 2006; Guerini and Quas 2016). Conducted literature and surveys review shows  that  there  are  still  some  unanswered  questions.  Are  alternative  financing resources  competing  with  traditional  ones?  Would  they  replace  the  traditional financial service providers in the next 5 or 10 years?     Therefore  the  main  aim  of  this  research  is  to  analyse  access  to  finance  including alternative finance (risk capital funds and business angels seed funding and crowdfunding) of companies in Latvia.  3.  Research Methodology  Generally accepted qualitative and quantitative methods of economic research were applied  in  the  paper  including  indepth  facetoface  interviews  with  the  board members of the nine banks of Latvia and 1200 companies    owners or top managers. The research of Latvian financing opportunities shows that the most common forms of  funding  of  freshlyestablished  companies  are  FF  (Friends  and  Family) commercial banks offering special programmes and state supported programmes but             SMEs    Alternative Financing The Case of Latvia   46  with rather limited available amounts.  If a company is interested in bigger amounts Venture Capital (VC) comes to overcover the needs mainly supported by EU funds and business angels.   The  following  methods  are  applied  to  analyse  alternative  financing  possibilities  in Latvia        SIBiL (Survey of Innovative Businesses in Latvia) that follows the development of more than 1200 small and mediumsized businesses in manufacturing in the period from 2008 to 2015. The data were collected in the form of indepth facetoface interviews; Indepth facetoface interviews with the board members of the nine banks of Latvia in 2015/2016;          By analysing information from national    Business Angel Networks    or the    European Business Angel Network    from Venture Capital funds and grants programmes both public  and private.    The main resources used by companies in Latvia can be divided into the following groups  Traditional 1.  Banks loans; 2.  Banks    special support programs; 3.  FF (Friends and family); 4.  Loan guarantee programmes; 5.  Tenders/competitions. Alternative  1.  Venture capital funds; 2.  Business angels/informal investors; 3.  Crowdfunding.  Latvia   s government responded to the global financial crisis and its intervention  on companies     financing  have  been  imposed  with  a  variety  of  instruments.  The  most popular  measure  was  loan  guarantee  programmes  which  expanded  substantially over  20072011.  Furthermore  new  elements  were  added  to  these  programmes  or new  instruments  were  created  outside  of  the  traditional  guarantee  programmes. Applying for a particular grant it is important to understand that grants are available according to certain criteria. These may be related to the industrial sector the target group particular development methods or processes size of the project etc. A lot of entrepreneurs  in  Latvia  consider  the  applying  process  too  bureaucratic;  too  much work  for  rather  small  financial  support.    Banks     special  support  programs  are temporal  and  have  targetcharacter  additionally  granting  small  amounts;  thus  this financing type is of limited availability for SMEs especially new ones   (Solovjova 2018).         R. RupeikaApoga S. Saksonova 47  Figure 1. Satisfaction with the state support to employees % of GDP (SSE Riga and SEB 2015)   As suggested by the data from ECB and research of the Sustainable Business Centre of Riga School of Economics business people are still relatively dissatisfied with the state support (loans to SMEs Venture Capital and guarantees implemented from the EU  funds) to  businesses  (42.2% in  2014) (Figure  1). There  is  no  official statistical data about FF availability but it is rather clear that this source comes first when new entrepreneur is looking for money. Additionally it is also not clear how to separate FF from informal investors both from the definition concept and from the statistical point of view. Analysing the share of personally provided funds for a new business started by someone else in the past three years  Informal Investors Rate  Latvia   s performance is better than in Nordic countries the leader in this field is Finland. It   s also better than in Poland and as well as in Lithuania and Estonia (Figure 2).  Figure 2. Informal Investors Rate in the Baltic States and Poland with Finland from 2005 till 2015 (Kelly et al. 2015).              SMEs    Alternative Financing The Case of Latvia   48  Estonian Business Angel Networks states that during the first year of their activities (20132014)  the  total  investment  sum  reached  46  mln.  EUR  (EstBAN  2015) Latvian Business Angel Networks is not collecting these data and Lithuanian Strata (STRATA 2015) as well is not offering such statistics.  From  the  analysis  of  access  to  Venture  Capital  in  the  Baltic  States  (Figure  3)  we concluded that Estonian financial market is more innovative compared with Latvia   s and  Lithuania   s  and  what  is  very  positive  more  creative  than  the  average  EU15 market. In some market segments the competition among venture investors is rather tight involving five and more market players. Financing can be provided to business projects worth over 50 000 EUR and can exceed hundreds of millions.  Figure  3.  The  Baltic  and  Nordic  States  World  economic  forum  venture  capital availability rating (World Economic Forum 2017).   It would be fair to say that Estonia is leading the Baltic group with more local VC   s angels and investments than in other Baltic countries. This can be partially explained by success of such companies as MicroTask and of course Skype. However in the last couple of years Latvia and Lithuania have made a lot of progress to catch up and it is expected a lot of new companies will come in the future.  As  for  crowdfunding  there  are several local  platforms  in  the  Baltic  States  but  our entrepreneurs  are  quite  efficient  using  other  international  platforms  as  Kickstarter Indiegogo Crowdfunder. In Estonia crowdfunding started in 2009 with a local P2P consumer lending platform called isePankur (now Bondora). The first equity based platform  Fundwise.me  launched  in  2015.  In  2017  in  Estonia  operate  4  local  and  1 Latvian  platform.    In  2015  Estonia  ranked  second  in  Europe  on  total  volume  per capital.  Although  the  Estonian  market  is  only  1M+  people  it  has  the  potential  to grow by virtual Estonians     attracted by the eresidency program that was recently launched by the Estonian government. Lithuania has the ambition to become one of the  most  attractive  FinTech  destination  in  Europe  in  2016  Lithuania  approved  a number  of  regulatory  changes;  amended  KYC  regulation  (enables  non  facetoface identification) amended consumer credit rules related to peer to peer regulation and      R. RupeikaApoga S. Saksonova 49  passed  the  Law  on  Crowdfunding.  In  2017  in  Lithuania  are  operating  5  local  P2P platforms    23 million has been raised on P2P consumer lending platforms in 2015. In Latvia transaction value in the "Crowdfunding" segment amounted US$ 18m in 2016. (   CrowdfundingHub    2017). This fastgrowing market is especially attractive to new entrepreneurs all over the world. Table 1 reflects the results of companies and commercial banks interviews on financial sources availability in Latvia.     Table 1. Availability of traditional and alternative sources for SMEs in Latvia  Amounts (EUR)    10 000    50 000 <100 000 Bank loans Without collateral With collateral + +++ +++   ++ + ++ + FF(family  and friends) State support prograBusiness angels Venture capital funds  + Seed funding Crowdfunding + ++ + + + ++  ms + +  + + + Source Compiled by authors.  One     +     means  that  resource  is  available  but  not  very  popular     ++     means  that resource  is  available  and  rather  popular  with  entrepreneurs  and     +++     means  that resource is available and very popular with entrepreneurs. The summary is general and of course shifts in both directions are possible.  It must be noted that to facilitate the raising of funds Nasdaq Baltic stock exchanges had created the alternative market First North Baltic which represents a multilateral trade  system  (nonregulated  market)  with  loyal  regulations  and  lower  costs  also allowing for listing enterprise bonds. Further popularization of the First North Baltic market  among  SMEs  is  needed  as  well  as  simplification  of  the  bond  issue  process both in terms of the costs and paperwork. Summarising the availability of alternative financing sources in Latvia we concluded that companies mostly use short and medium loans and leasing provided by banks or owner funding and state support programmes as well whereas access to venture capital business angels and crowdfunding is still rather limited and problematic.     4.  Discussion   One  of  the  main  problems  revealed  in  this  paper  is  the  availability  of  alternative financing. Mainly researchers from the Baltic States are specializing in one kind of alternative sources; venture capital in Latvia problems of data collection processing and use of informal venture capital hybrid Venture Capital Funds in Lithuania etc. Nontraditional financing has experienced rapid growth during the first decade of the 21st  century;  institutional  and  private  investors  together  with  governments  are             SMEs    Alternative Financing The Case of Latvia   50  interested  and  support  the  further  development  of  alternative  capital  market  in different regions.  In the alternative financing sector the research reveals that there is  a  limited  access  to  informal  investors  due  to  lack  of  networks  uniting  informal investors  reluctance  to  invest  due  to  lack  of  investing  experience  regional incubators seldom produce startups attractive for alternative investors.  Building  of  a  single  social  network  of  alternative  financial  service  providers  in regions as the Baltic States or Nordic Baltic or North Europe etc. would link them together providing better availability to their services. Even though there are various information  dissemination  and  publicity  channels  (as  local  investment  agencies development  banks  etc)  and  knowledge  centres  responsible  for  informing  SMEs    about the availability of private and public financing instruments there is still lack of SME awareness about it that should be improved.  Returning to the scope of this paper with the question    Would alternative financing providers squeeze out the formal ones in the near future     next 5 or 10 years?    the answer  is     Yes     and     No     depending  on  the  company  type  and  activities  area. According to statistics the loan portfolio of the commercial bank system of Latvia steadily shrank in the period between 2008 and 2014. It to a large extent was due to the  effect  of  the  recession  characterized  by  writing  off  the  bad  debts  and  gradual correction  of  the  household  indebtedness.  Nevertheless  all  interviewed  banks  are wishing  to  increase  their  loan  portfolio  in  the  near  future.  The  role  of  banks  in lending to freshlyestablished companies is rather small as in this stage it is virtually impossible  to  assess  risk  and  possible  return  on  the  investment  therefore  in  this segment  the  role  of  other  sources  of  funding  will  retain  and  speed  up  their significance.   The  current  study  is  not  free  from  limitations.  Its  current  sample  consists  of  1200 detailed  surveys  of  SMEs  in  Latvia;  therefore  these  findings  may  have  limited generalizability.  Future  studies  that  replicate  the  current  proposal  including  new surveys  for  larger  amount  of  companies  not  only  in  Latvia  may  provide  a  more complete picture or add further dimensions to the current findings.
