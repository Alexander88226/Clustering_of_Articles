Nevertheless  a  lot  of  bottlenecks  and  obstacles appear for further growth of SMEs especially with respect to financing. SME financing is different from that of larger corporations since they are younger and subject to more growth uncertainty than large firms especially in developing countries. The main problems related to SME access to finance in China are the risk involved in performing bad loans is higher. So it is significant for managers and investors both in theoretical and practical fields to assess the financing risk of SMEs. This paper   s aim is to propose an analytical framework of risk evaluation on SME financing based on grey theory. Firstly this paper discusses the current SME financing in China. Secondly it sets up a multihierarchy index system. Thirdly it confirms the weight of every index with AHP and gave a general assessment by means of a grey clustering method. Finally a case study is conducted to validate the evaluation model and the evaluation process. Keywords Small and Medium Enterprise Financing Risk Analytic Hierarchy Process Grey Theory 1. Introduction The availability of financing for SMEs have the subject of growing attention in recent years based on the role SMEs play in  economics  growth.  Due  to  their  privateownership  nature  entrepreneurial  spirit  and  the  ability  to  adapt  to  the everchanging environment they contribute to sustainable growth and employment generation in a significant manner (Aung Kyaw 2008). SMEs have unique characteristics on their own   they are naturally more labor intensive easy to start up focus on small markets require lower investment and promote customer intimacy.   It  is  now recognized  that  SMEs  make a  significant  contribution  to  the  socioeconomic  and political  infrastructure  of developed  and  developing  countries  as  well  as  the  nations  in  transition  from  command  to  market  economies (Matlay&Westhead  2005).  Small  businesses  with  less  than  100  workers  in  the  United  States  represent  onethird  of domestic  employment  and  sales  value.  SMEs  in  the  EU  account  for  about  onehalf  of  the  total  value  added  and twothirds  of  labor  force  (European  Union  2005).  SMEs  contributed  between  40  percent  and  50  percent  of manufacturing output in Chinese Taipei Japan and the Republic of Korea in the 1990s (Wattanapruttipaisan 2003). After  moving  towards  a  more  marketoriented  economy  in  1978  China  has  experienced  a  decline  in  stateowned enterprises and an important expansion for small businesses (Walter 2005). The role of SMEs in economic development Published by Sciedu Press 73 www.sciedu.ca/ijfr                                        International Journal of Financial Research                                Vol. 3 No. 1; January 2012 is well documented for advanced economies and has been crucial in China   s process of economic reform in last decades. There are currently more than 4000 million of China   s small and medium enterprises creating a nearly 60% of total GDP taxes amounting to almost 50%. Also SMEs provide about 75% of urban employment opportunities. Nevertheless some bottlenecks and obstacles appear for further growth of SMEs especially with respect to financing. The main problems related to SME access to finance in China are the risk involved in performing bad loans is higher than for larger firms. The evaluation of financing risk on small and medium enterprises is significant because the process can  help  us  find  the  latent  problem  and  reduce  the  risk.  Evaluation  and  monitoring  is  warranted  for  measuring  the efficiency and effectiveness of financing. Multilevel grey evaluation method has been set out in this paper and has proven to be especially useful in the following instances when data is only partially available; when using qualitative variables; or when using quantitative variables which  are  inaccessible  to  the  professional  and  their  quantification  cannot  therefore  be  deduced.  We  extend  the  AHP approach  for  the  multicriteria  assessment  problem  and  propose  to  use  a  GAHP  technique.  The  application  of  the multilevel grey evaluation to the field of financing risk on small and medium enterprises is an advance with respect to previous studies on the application of multicriteria methods. 2. Current SME Financing in China 2.1 Current State of SME Financing Comparing with stateowned corporation private enterprises (majority of those are SMEs) rarely got favorable treatment from government in terms of subsidies tax relaxation and development loans. According to the World Bank Investment Climate  Survey  for  China  conducted  for  the  period  2001  and  2002  SMEs  in  China  face  much  more  serious  credit constraints and limited access to private finance than large firms even compared to other Asian countries (Dollar etal. 2003).   The Project Group of Research in Chinese Private Enterprises organized by China Industrial and Commercial Union and Research Commission of Chinese Private Business showed in a survey conducted in 2002 that selfaccumulated money was  the  major  source  for  starting  up  firms  (approximately  55  percent)  complemented  by  money  borrowed  privately (31.6 percent) and bank and Rural Credit Corporation loans (23.4 percent).SMEs as opposed to larger publicly held businesses  typically  depend  on  external  financing  for  liquidity.  The  evidence  suggests  that  the  private  enterprises performance is associated with access to formal finance (bank loans) and more so firms using formal financing sources grow faster than those financed by alternative channels (Cull & Xu 2005) (Maksimovic Demirg    Kunt & Ayyagari 2008). < Table 1 about here> Table  1  Shows  that  the  financing  preferences  of  owner/managers  in  China  and  US  changed  according  to  the development needs of their SMEs. Along with the growth of the enterprise most of the owner/managers in the UK came to  rely  primarily  on  financial  institutions.  In  contrast  owner/managers  in  the  Chinese  depended  primarily  on  their immediate family and to a lesser extent on financial institutions (Hussain eta 2005). 2.2 Main Problems Related to SME Access to Financing From a credit risk point of view SMEs are different from large corporate for many reasons. For example Dietsch and Petey (2004) analyze a panel of German and French SMEs and conclude that they are riskier but have a lower asset correlation with each other than large businesses do. There are scale economies in lending per unit cost of screening and monitoring a loan decreases as the size of loan increases. If firm size is positively related to loan size then the average cost of serving SMEs is larger than that for larger firms. According to Mu (2002) since most SMEs are nonstate enterprises the risks involved in performing bad loans is higher than  for  larger  firms  where  there  are  still  more  stateowned  enterprises.  Most  of  the  SMEs  rarely  keep  accounting records of their business in a systematic manner which resulted in the information asymmetry between the business and the  bank  (Kanamori  &  Zhao  2004).  To  an  extent  such  costs  of  information  asymmetry  can  be  reduced  through relationship banking or collateralized loans. 3. Designing of Index as System   Financing  risk  is  any  risk  associated  with  any  form  of  financing.  Risk  is  probability  of  unfavorable  condition;  in financing sector it is the probability of actual return being less than expected return. Financing risk on small and medium enterprises is mainly credit risk which is the risk of loss due to a debtor's nonpayment of a loan or other line of credit. 74ISSN 19234023      EISSN 19234031  www.sciedu.ca/ijfr                                        International Journal of Financial Research                                Vol. 3 No. 1; January 2012 The financing risk on SMEs is resulted from financing and nonfinancing factors of enterprises industry conditions and policy environment. As shown in Table 2 this paper constructs the evaluation index system. There are three layers and thirteen evaluating indexes in the system. Financing risk on small and medium enterprises (U) is the goal layer; the first index layer consist of three indexes capital risk (U1) management risk (U2) and industry and policy risks (U3); the second index layer is the overall segments of the first index layer including all the aij. < Table 2 about here> 4. Multilevel Grey Evaluation Process 4.1 Computing the Weighted Set of Evaluating Factors by Using AHP The  analytic  hierarchy  process  method  is  to  express  a  complex  decisionmaking  problem  as  a  sequential  stepup hierarchy  structure  compute  the  comparatively  weightiness  measurement  of  diversified  decisionmaking  behaviors scheme  and  decisionmaking  object  under  different  rule  and  the  whole  rule  and  then  rank  them  according  to  the measurement  providing  decisionmaking  evidence  for  the  decisionmakers  (Huang  Jihong  &  Ke  Konglin  2005) (Zhengdong  Xu  Sifeng  Liu  &  Zhigeng  Fang  2008).  The  steps  to  solve  the  real  problems  using  AHP  method  is  as follows 4.1.1 Establishing the Problem   s Hierarchy Structure According to the elementary analysis divides the factors into several groups and each group present a hierarchy. Then ranks them as the sequence the top layer several relative middle layers and the bottom layer. 4.1.2 Determining the Comparative Judgment Matrix A={aij}m  n 4.1.3 Calculating the Priority Vector to Weight the Elements of the Matrix Wi   n   j1   aijnn       ni1   j1                                                                                                                                                     (1) aijThereinto i j=1 2 3    n      MAX   1n   n 1i   (BWWi)i 4.1.4 Coincidence Rate (CR) Calculation CR = CI/RI                                                                                                                                                                        (2) CI=(  MAX   n)(n   1).  When  the  CR<0.10  we  think  the  judgment  matrix  has  satisfying  consistency.  Otherwise  we should adjust it to obtain the satisfying consistency.   4.1.5 The Whole Hierarchy Sort The whole hierarchy sort. The whole hierarchy sort is to compute the weighted value of all factors    weightiness in this layer according to the upper layer by taking advantage of all results of the single hierarchy sort in the same layer. The single hierarchy sort is just the whole hierarchy sort for the top layer. 4.2 GreyAHP Evaluation Model 4.2.1 Constituting Comment Set of Evaluation Indicator We make out all the comment set of evaluation indicator. The assessment standard was divided into five grades very low low common high and very high. These are endowed with the following values 5 4 3 2 and 1. the grade is between two adjacent grades which are marked by 4.5 3.5 2.5 and 1.5. 4.2.2 Confirmation of Evaluation Sample Matrix Under the circumstance of determining the evaluation indicator system and the evaluation indicator weight we can give evaluation indicators    values according to evaluation indicator D.

Conclusion The reliance of small businesses on banks    finance is not an uncommon fact as the same scenario happen in china and many  parts  of  the  world.  In  this  paper  we  focus  on  the  main  issue  concerning  the  SMEs  financing.  Evaluating  the financing risk on small and medium enterprises is an important part for developing financing policy. Building scientific evaluation  systems  making  appropriate  evaluation  factors  and  attaching  corresponding  weight  to  them  are  of  vital importance in evaluating correctly the financing risk on small and medium enterprises. We evaluate the financing risk by using the three level comprehensive evaluation of fuzzy mathematics. A multilevel grey evaluation has been set out in this paper and has proven to be especially useful. The application of the method in financing risk appraisal on small and medium enterprises is an improvement over previous work in which both quantitative and qualitative variables are used where only partial information is available.
