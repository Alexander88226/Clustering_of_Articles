Such  disruptive  wave  of  innovation  is  now  converging  towards  an  historically  bound  to tradition and  renovationadverse  industry banking. This upcoming  flow of innovation  goes under  the  name  of     fintech     that  is  financial  technology  and  has  the  goal  to  disrupt  the currently  dated  and  inefficient  financial  sector  through  the  implementation  of  new technologies and processes.  Foreseeing  what  this  phenomenon  might  imply  on  nowadays     banking  industry  a  question spontaneously arises how will fintech shape the future of banking?  This thesis has the ambitious objective to answer this research question through an overlook over  the  current  state  of  the  fintech  sector  and  a  deep  analysis  of  the  market  and  its  main players.  Financial  technologies  are  not  a  banksonly  affair  indeed;  many  new  actors  are entering the market of financial services and products providers such as bigtechs like Amazon and Google or emerging neobanks and startups like N26 and Monzo. Therefore it is due to delineate  an  array  of  potential  scenarios  for  the  future  of  banking  and  more  broadly  the economy while considering the important role that incumbent banks will have in this dispute will they embrace this wave of innovation or try to maintain their current status by relying on their centuryold legacy? To fulfil the thesis    objective two chapters have been devised. The first one gives an overlook on fintech in an attempt to better comprehend what fintech is and its potential implications on the banking sector. Moreover the uptodate size of this sector is assessed along with its state of  development  and  upcoming  trends.  Finally  experts     opinions  are  brought  upon  to understand the different points of view concerning the topic and the general sentiment about the possible disruption of the financial services industry as it is known today. In the second chapter five forwardlooking scenarios are outlined and analysed  in order to comprehend how fintech companies could impact the financial system and which roles would  3  be  played  by  incumbents  in  the  newly  emerged  frameworks.  Then  opportunities  and  risks embedded in the rise of financial technology are considered leading to a presentation of the various initiatives taken by central banks and jurisdictions to facilitate  financial innovation. Eventually a focus on the fintech credit market is given both the business models of fintech credit companies and the size of the sector are researched with particular attention given to emerging countries which are the main beneficiaries of the development of such innovative channels  of  credit.  To  conclude  fintech   s  implications  on  the  traditional  credit  market  are discussed so as to assess their potential benefits to the economy. In conclusion the rise of fintech seem to be beneficial to the global economic framework as it improves financial services and the overall customer experience through the implementation of innovative technologies and disruptive methods. Moreover fintech would facilitate access to financial services and products boosting the economy of emerging countries by providing new  forms  of  financing  and  enhancing  the  overall  efficiency  of  the  banking  industry  in developed  countries  thanks  to  the  increased  competition  and  the  application  of  innovative processes within the industry. On the other hand additional risks attached to fintech must be taken in consideration; to this regard jurisdictions and financial institutions should embrace a path  of  regulatory  renovation  through  the  implementation  of  regulatory  technologies (RegTech) aimed at hedging these new forms of risk.           4  Chapter 1. The rise of Fintech   1.1 What is Fintech  Giving a unique definition of fintech is a difficult task since several varieties of the concept coexist  in  academic  papers  and  business journals.  Fintech  experts  all  agree  that  it  refers  to companies that develop financial services and products by relying on much more intense use of information technology (Varga 2017). Arner Barberis and Buckley (2015) stated that Fintech could refer to all incumbent and new financial  companies  regardless  of  their size  product  portfolio  or  business  model.  Hussain Kim et al. and McAuley (2015 2016) affirm instead that Fintech refers to firms that not only use IT but which also focus on providing more efficient services and try to enter traditionally nonbanking markets. On the other hand Ernst & Young   s definition (2016) implies that all firms can take part in the fintech revolution if they manage to build innovative business models and implement an adequate supporting technology. Overall  there  is  still  no  agreement  on  where  the  boundaries  of  this  arising  sector  lie.  The definition that better suits this paper   s author   s idea is the one given by the Financial Stability Board (BCBS 2018) which defines Fintech as    technologically enabled  financial  innovations in financial services that could result in new business  models  applications  processes  or  products  with  an  associated  material  effect  on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services   . Therefore any company be  it a  traditional bank a  startup firm or a  technology  giant  can enter  the  fintech  sector  by  implementing  new  technologies  for  improving  or  disrupting  the financial services or products that are currently offered by competitors. Currently fintech companies operate a wide array of different services building their business around  each  one   s  specifically  developed  technology;  fintechs     activities  include  microfinancing  platforms  credit  provision  facilitated  peertopeer  lending  businessrelated  data analysis. However the reason that really makes a difference between traditional banks and emerging Fintech companies is the lack of regulation towards the latter as there is still not a clear and  5  wellmarked distinction of which services they are offering and if they should be regulated as heavily as it is currently done for incumbent financial institutions.  To better understand and distinguish such companies we will divide them into several different categories according to the main features that characterize them and based on their level of innovation in developing more customercentred services. First  of  all  we  may  consider  the  traditional  banks  that  still  believe  in  bricksandmortar banking  maintaining  a  costly  network  of  branches  and  with  limited  digital  footprint;  such banks  might  have  accrued  significant  technologyrelated  debt  by  running  on  obsolete  IT systems that are extremely expensive to support and not updated for today   s customers    needs. These traditional banks are the most threatened by the exponential growth of digitized and ever more efficient financial competitors in the market. Banks  that  have  already  been  experimenting  new  business  models  but  have  not  yet modernized their IT infrastructure or fully digitized their business processes will be referred to  as  transformational  banks  during  the  length  of  this  paper.  These  are  most  of  nowadays    banks since there are no large financial institutions which have not yet reacted to the threat of emerging fintech firms; such banks play a significant role in the evolutionary process of the financial  sector  thanks  to  their  large  client  bases  copious  funding  opportunities  and  deep knowledge of the regulatory framework. The  most  successful  technologically  advanced  transformational  banks  which  have  already gone through the process of transformation and adopted an innovative way of doing business related to financial services may be called digital banks or neobanks (King 2014). Neobanks usually adopt broadly digitized core banking systems that can quickly implement innovative services; such banks are also updated on digital channel management and compliant with  regulations  having  established  solid  and  profitable  new  business  models.  Therefore digital banks could be working transparently under the lenses of institutional regulators while capturing the many benefits of Fintech innovation as well. Distinguishing between traditional financial institutions and innovative disruptive newcomers is needed as proof shows that financial technology firms are already affecting the digitization of the banking sector. It is also clear that each one of these categories of banks is going to face different opportunities changes and threats in order to cope with the newly emerging fintech companies.  6  Once defined the different types of banks within the current banking system it is due to give an  overview of the  emerging  global fintech sector in terms of  number of firms that operate within  the  market  and  the  various  functions  and  applications  that  financial  technology companies are offering on the market nowadays; moreover the following paragraphs will also observe the amounts invested in fintech companies all around the world as they are a helpful tool to measure the growing interest in this notyet fully exploited market. Although the exact number of fintech companies may vary depending on the definition of what a fintech company is  it  is  generally  agreed  that  there  are  approximately  7000  Fintech  companies  around  the world (Forbes 2015); some of them are recently founded startups others are largely affirmed corporations. Such  firms  are  emerging  in  cities  such  as  Hong  Kong  London  New  York  Beijing  and Singapore that are affirming themselves as financial technology centers where any Fintechenthusiast should head for developing his ideas or better understand this global phenomenon.     Finovate     is  one  of  the  largest  fintech  conferences  and  an  important  source  of  uptodate sector news and firm valuations; it aggregated all the major financial technology companies in the  world and  clusterized them by field of interest and  company  valuation.  As a proof that fintech is a rapidly growing market the number of    unicorn    companies (firms valued at more than one billion dollars) identified during Finovate meetings is increasing year by year and it does not look like it will stop soon.  The following map shows each    unicorn    company along with its country of origin giving an overlook on fintech most flourishing markets.              7   Figure 1   Fintech unicorns around the globe   . Source www.cbinsights.com  1.2 Banks    key activities and Fintech   s potential  Before  going  deep  into  the  functions  and  applications  of  fintech  it  is  due  to  give  an overlook of what banks    main activities are and where Fintech companies could develop a competitive advantage.     A bank is an institution whose current operations consist in granting loans and receiving deposits  from  the  public     stated  Freixas  and  Rochet  in  2008;  this  requires  the simultaneous performance of three distinct activities transforming the characteristics of financial  assets  and  liabilities  supplying  payment  services  gathering  and  processing information and data (Barba Navaretti et al. 2017). The first activity is mainly achieved through maturity transformation that is taking shortterm sources of finance and turn them into longterm borrowings such as mortgages. This process is fundamental to any  economic system as it allows the  funding of  longterm investments and thus stimulate productivity while simultaneously protecting depositors from nonsystematic liquidity shocks.  Thanks  to  their  ease  in  providing  liquidity  to  their  customers  banks  are  able  to accomplish the second abovestated activity as well offering payment services. Payment  8  services form a field of great interest for major Fintech firms as they form a broad market with plenty of opportunities for growth with a particular interest in emerging countries.  Eventually the third banks    key activity information processing. It includes all the tasks related  to  the  exante  assessing  of  potential  borrowers  the  expost  tracking  of  their behavior  and  the  buildup  and  management  of  a  welldiversified  portfolio  which maximizes the return with respect to risk.  The existence of these three services provides a rationale for banks existence as they can reasonably be bundled within one institution. Therefore a deeper analysis of each of these activities should be drawn upon for understanding the potential effect of Fintech on the banking industry.  Transmuting the features of financial assets and liabilities is the first main task for banks especially through  maturity transformation. They can make  use  of diversified  pools of small size depositors to deal with the effects of idiosyncratic liquidity shocks. Banks can put aside a limited cushion of liquid assets to  concede longerterm loans thanks to the unlikeliness  that  depositors  could  withdraw  their  funds  all  simultaneously.  This  is  the core of banks    capability to deliver liquidity services. Such liquidity management services are  unlikely  to  be  provided  by  Fintech  companies  as  they  would  need  specific authorization for granting illiquid loans or acquiring less liquid assets; in fact providing such services would turn those companies in banks by definition and as such they would be regulated as traditional financial institutions. Moreover  banks  also  detach  any  loan  that  they  provide  from  the  financing  of  each depositor  thanks  to  maturity  transformation  achieving  a  much  wider  portfolio diversification than what an individual depositor could obtain. On the contrary peertopeer crowdfunding platforms cannot provide any diversification of risk to investors; if they would then they would have to add part of that risk to their books or issue securities falling under either banking regulation or security regulation.  In fact most of the  P2P financial  intermediaries  currently  apply  the     agency  model     profiting  through commission fees paid by both sides of the transaction but not retaining any risk from the loan that they generate nor interfering with its price. Therefore such Fintech companies are likely to have higher liabilities and riskier asset portfolios than banks do which means that as far as banks also implement innovative information management technologies and  9  regulatory  arbitrage  is  excluded  Fintech  threat  to  banks     activities  in  the  credit  and liquidity risks realm seems limited. Moving  on  the  second  key  service  provided  by  banks  regards  payments  which  are strongly  related  to  the  banks     ability  in  providing  liquidity  and  risk  management; customers  in  need  of  liquidity  are  much  better  off  if  they  can  pay  directly  from  their deposit accounts indeed (Barba Navaretti et al. 2017). For this reason many nonbank financial intermediaries as well as nonfinancial institutions such as IT companies are recently emerging in the payment services market taking advantage of their large client base; an example for this is MPesa a mobile phonebased money transfer financing and microfinancing service launched in 2007 by Vodafone in less developed countries such as Kenya and Tanzania. Lighter  regulatory  requirements  better  technologies  and  more  effective  economies  of scope  may  be  three  reasons  that  allow  Fintech  companies  to  compete  with  banks  in payment  services  by  offering  higher  interest  payments  despite  their  incapability  to neither  earn  the  interest  margin  provided  by  maturity  transformation  or  exploit  the fractional reserve requirements.  Also  the  implementation  of  blockchain  technology  would  boost  the  use  of  digital payments and  virtual currencies further expanding a  market in  which  nonfinancial or nonbanks  institutions  could  flourish.  Blockchain  technologies  register  any  kind  of information permanently on a digital ledger which cannot be manipulated; this guarantees the  actual  legitimacy  of  the  transaction  with  no  need  for  the  State  or  notaries  to intermediate.  Lastly banks are involved in a third major activity information processing. The whole financial  sector  is  set  upon  information  and  information  management  where  recent developments  of  related  technologies  affected  IT  under  three  different  aspects  data storage and processing data transfer and data availability.  In  the  information  sector  Fintechs  and  banks  take  two  diametrically  opposed approaches;  whereas  the  latter  mostly  exploit  soft  and  relationshipbased  information financial  technology  companies  function  on  big  data  processing  and  on  the standardization  of  information.  Therefore  any  significant  advancement  in  IT  leads Fintech operators to better production and distribution of financial services.  10  Regarding  the  production  of  financial  services  a  massive  quantity  of  personal  data  is gathered  and  analyzed  nowadays  thus  large  customer  bases  and  their  behavior  allow companies to provide the financial products that better suit each client needs. As of distribution of financial services the driver of change  is the possibility to match both  the  demand  and  supply  sides  of  the  market  in  an  easier  and  more  efficient  way thanks to big data processing and  the assessment of customers    profiles. The ability to recognize  patterns  rapidly  by  processing  and  analyzing  huge  data  set  is  what  makes machine  learning  and  AI  so  useful  for  financial  applications;  exploiting  customers    information  thanks  to  computers  and  algorithms  help  financial  services  providers  in developing tailormade services for their clientele.  However  the  collection  and  elaboration  of  private  information  have  legal  and  ethical implications both in terms of cyber risk and privacy concerns;  it is likely that regular restraints  will  be  set  up  in  this  regard  and  legit  holders  of  private  data  will  have  a significant competitive advantage on their competitors.  Overall the 3 activities brought upon by banks that were analyzed  in this segment are feasible  for  Fintech  companies     expansion;  it  will  be  up  to  the  financial  technology companies to exploit these three areas of interests whereas for banks it will be crucial the approach  they  will  take  to  either  act  and  innovate  or  wait  for  other  nonfinancial companies to take their place.  1.3 How is the Fintech sector developing As  interest  around  the  fintech  world  keeps  building  up  investment  into  innovative financial technology companies are steadily increasing as well reaching an astonishing $111.8 billion with 2196 deals worldwide in 2018 alone (KPMG 2019). From 2013 to 2018 the sector has gone through a path of massive growth as the graph below shows. Figure 2    Total investment activity (VC PE and M&A) in fintech   .  11   Source Pulse of Fintech 2018 Global Analysis of Investment in Fintech KPMG International (data provided by PitchBook)  To  better  comprehend  the  magnitude  of  such  numbers  it  should  be  noted that fintech investment globally more than doubled during 2018 a growth that has been driven partly by a small number of megadeals such as the acquisition of WorldPay by Vantiv and the $14 billion venture capital funding round raised by Ant Financial in the first semester of 2018. The second half of the same year saw a significant number of large deals as well including  private  equity  firm  Blackstone   s  $17  billion  investment  in  Refinitiv  and  the $3.5  billion  acquisition  of  prepaid  card  company  Blackhawk  Network  by  Silver  Lake jointly with P2 Capital Partners. While new startups sprang up across emerging Fintech subsectors  more  mature  areas  like  digital  payments  consolidated  themselves.  For instance  the  Danish  payments  firm  Nets  merged  with  Germanbased  Concardis  in  a multibilliondollar deal in 2018. At the same time Nets also went through several other deals including the acquisition of Polandbased payment firm Dotpay.  During 2018  growth was a hot topic for Fintech companies all around the globe  with numerous Fintechs of any kind closing large financing campaigns agreeing international partnerships and carrying out their own acquisitions to propel global expansion activities. As a matter of fact there were numerous crosscountry deals stemming from the reason  12  that companies are eager to find  opportunities  which  could be  helpful to better exploit their potential or to finesse their fintech branch; the following picture shows the global crossborder M&A activity in the last few years. Figure 3    Global crossborder M&A activity in fintech   . Source  Pulse  of  Fintech  2018  Global  Analysis  of  Investment  in  Fintech  KPMG International. Such     expansionary     campaigns  were  particularly  common  among  digital  challenger banks or neobanks  which  have  historically focused  on their domestic  markets rather than on a global scale. In 2018 several challenger banks took strategic moves to spread beyond  their  borders  including  Nubank  in  Brazil  N26  in  Germany  and  numerous challenger  banks  based  in  the  United  Kingdom.  The  aimed  growth  level  of  these companies  has  been  a  strong  factor  of  attraction  for  global  investors.  For  example Chinese technology giant Tencent joined insurance company Allianz in March of 2018 to invest $160 million in the emerging neobank N26 to help boost the bank   s growth on an  international  scale.  Several  others  Asian  Fintech  firms  have  also  aimed  the  use  of acquisitions as a mean for scaling globally.  Other than expanding globally many of the abovestated digital banks also focused on developing their service offerings during 2018 moving from niche offerings into a wider range  of  services  similar  to  those  provided  by  traditional  banks.  To  keep  competing effectively both regionally and globally such expansion of services should continue to  13  be a main priority for neobanks either through internal developments or with the help of strategic partnerships.  Along  with  digital  banks  many  big  tech  players  including  Alibaba  and  Google  are thoroughly working to expand their cloudservices offerings. While some of these firms are looking to compete directly with financial institutions others have mainly focused on developing cloud AI and machine learning services to enable traditional banks and other financial  institutions  to  launch  their  own  Fintech  solutions  or  enhance  their  internal efficiencies. In 2018 many Fintech companies also made their own Fintech investments. In  September  the  iZettle  payments  platform  was  acquired  by  PayPal  for  $2.2  billion while  earlier  in  the  year  Workday  purchased  Adaptive  Insights  spending  $1.6  billion (KPMG 2019).  Together with cloudservices development numerous Fintech companies have spotted the opportunity to help enable banks to comply and get ready for open banking that is offering  financial  services  which  are  heavily  reliant  to  data  sharing  customer management and digital identity management. For instance in the venture capital sector Data Republic raised $22 million in Series B funding during the last quarter of 2018 with the support of Innov8 and Singapore Airlines; also the Irish firm Priviti helped Australian banks  to  comply  with  new  open  data  regulations.  Open  banking  will  probably  lead  to more competition as established Fintechs work to increase their competitiveness and new Fintech companies are trying to enter the market. However growth will still be the main issue with customer acquisition and scaling as key challenges. Therefore it is likely that open banking will primarily be a cause for the development of partnerships that will allow Fintechs    growth. A sector that keeps growing due to its enormous potential is Regtech that is regulatory technology;  as  the  regulatory  framework  is  going  through  a  renovation  process  the implementation  of  MiFID  II  Payments  Service  Directive  (PSD2)  General  Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) new IFRS standards and the EU Benchmark Regulation forced many organizations to adjust their operations in 2018. Moreover the Fundamental  14  Review of the Trading Book (FRTB) and the Central Securities Depositories Regulation (CSDR) are expected to bring further change in 2019 and beyond.  The  ongoing  regulatory  changes  arised  interest  in  Regtech  during  2018  both  from traditional  corporates  seeking  better  management  of  their  compliance  obligations  and from  other  kind  of  investors.  While  Regtech  investments  primarily  focused  on compliance management and risk exposure reduction there was also increasing interest in data and predictive analytics as they are considered crucial for the future of financial services and products as highlighted by the $17 billion Refinitiv deal.  Also  in  2018  $23.1  billion  corporate  Venture  Capital  investment  in  Fintech  nearly doubled  the  previous  high  of  $11.6  billion  registered  in  2016  with  the  quantity  of corporate Fintech deals increasing for the eighth consecutive year. The growing corporate participation  evidences  that  Fintech  is  becoming  mainstream  as  well  as  a  competitive response  to  the  emerging  threat  of  Fintech  companies  that  have  scaled  with  both traditional financial institutions and a broad range of companies outside of the financial services industry joining through investments and acquisitions. The growing maturity of the sector has also led some of the most developed Fintech companies to make their own investments as part of their drive to expand either geographically or on a product basis and  in  some  cases  partnering  with  financial  services  incumbents.  In  fact  there  is expanding  interest  in  partnering  with  Fintechs  to  provide  services  in  addition  to increasing interest from corporates with internal Fintech branches to provide businesstobusiness (B2B) services to corporate clients and other financial institutions.  To sum up 2018 was  a terrific  year for Fintech the  sector keeps growing on a  global scale with deals outside of the core markets (USA UK and China) accounting for 39% of  the  total  and  39  VentureCapitalbacked  Fintech  unicorns  worth  a  total  of  $147.37 billion. The following graph depicts investments across 5 European countries from 2013 to Q3 of 2017 showing that the  sector is growing outside  of its core  markets as well although the disparity between countries is still quite strong.  15  Figure 4     Investments in fintech companies across  EU countries   . Source    FinTech and Banking. Friends or Foes?    Barba Navaretti et. al 2017) Also the US are still the top market for deals with 659 investments worth $11.89 billion funding both a new annual high (CB Insights 2018). Will Fintechs keep the pace during this year as well?  According to a  CB Insights research  in partnership with Mastercard Start Path it is very likely so. In fact key drivers of FinTech growth such as record levels of deals and financing the emergence of new global tech hubs and favorable regulatory tailwinds  characterised  2018;  the  combination  of  these  factors  positions  the  FinTech sector to further digitize the customer journey make inroads in new and adjacent markets and collaborate across the industry in 2019.  Moreover the developments of 2018 have lowered the barriers for market entry and enabled established recent entrants to expand into  new  markets  while  incumbent  firms  are  feeling  the  pressure  put  on  by  Fintech startups on legacy infrastructure customer acquisition and business models.  Then it is reasonable to try predicting 3 upcoming trends for the industry during 2019.   16  1.4 Fintech trends to watch for the near future One  magnet  for  fintech  funding  in  2018  that  seems  destined  to  continue  in  2019  is artificial intelligence (AI). While there has been a lot of discussion around AI   s potential data support that investors are excited about the impact AI could have across the financial services  industry.  Fintech  AI  companies  backed  by  VentureCapital  funds  have  raised approximately $2.22B of capital across 106 investments in 2018. The funding growth is understandable  as  AI  applications  are  rapidly  increasing  in  popularity  and  AI  has proliferated  into  virtually  all  aspects  of  financial  services  from  personal  finance  and chatbots to insurance although with varying levels of maturity. Also this year has seen a rise of AI deals going to regulatory technology startups (RegTech); although it is still early  for  many  banks  to  embrace  full  automation  an  expected  overflow  of  regulatory changes in the future will further incentivize adoption of AI technologies. Another global trend to keep an eye on for 2019 is Open Banking during 2018 a number of regulation were  enacted  in  Europe  including  GDPR  MiFid  II  Open  Banking  and  the  Revised Payment  Services  Directive  (PSD2).  Two  of  the  most  impactful  are  the  UK   s  Open Banking and the EU   s PSD2 which have a common goal requiring banks to open APIs to customer data. Consumers are the biggest beneficiaries of Open Banking and PSD2 as the new regulations create choice through competition and establish consistency around security protocols to protect consumers (CB Insights 2018). For instance startups like TrueLayer Token and Tink are using a B2B2C model. TrueLayer creates an access point for developers to build applications on top of the data and is authorized by the FCA for both  access  to  data  (AISP)  and  access  to  payments  (PISP).  An  Account  Information Service  Provider  can  aggregate  a  wide  range  of  account  information  and  a  Payment Initiation Service Provider can facilitate remote payments for consumers. These services enable  a  range  of  FinTech  solutions  such  as  alternative  financing  platforms  like Clearbanc personal finance tools like Plum and digital banking startups like Monzo and Starling.  Globally banks are actively looking for ways to engage with and provide better services to consumers; leveraging the model laid out in Open Banking is one way to achieve that.   17  The third upcoming trend  is to be  considered the  growing implementation of financial technology for small and medium businesses (SMBs).  SMBs are increasingly a critical component  for  deals  across  the  fintech  ecosystem  indeed.  Firstly  SMBs  remain underserved  by  established  players  that  target  bigger  corporate  customers  and additionally the core of fintech has largely been focused on helping SMBs obtain loans and financing. Digital banking startups or neobanks have seen funding surge globally. Consumers drove earlyadoption in this category which has quickly spread to SMBs who seek for the same ondemand experience frictionless engagement and lowcost services that digital banks can provide at scale. Revolut is a good example of a startup that entered the  market focused  on B2C services but has responded to the  demand  from SMBs by offering them tailored bank accounts. Therefore it is clear that consumers and SMBs will enormously benefit by this newly emerging focus in the fintech industry.  The following figure sums up what has been discussed during this subchapter displaying each major area of fintech and highlighting the potential trends that will shape 2019 for financial technologies; therefore the picture is useful to comprehend the still unexploited functions that these areas could serve to the financial sector. Figure 5    Fintech trends to watch for 2019   . Source www.cbinsights.com   18  1.5 Experts    opinions on Fintech Due to its status of potential disruptor of the traditional banking system as we know it opinions  on  Fintech  are  still  vastly  heterogeneous  since  many  cannot  imagine  yet  the magnitude of its impact on the banking industry and others think it is just a new trend or speculative  bubble  that  will  burst  out  very  soon.  According  to  Christine  Lagarde Managing Director and Chairwoman of the International Monetary Fund (IMF)    we as individuals and communities have the capacity to shape a technological and economic future that works for all. More importantly we have a responsibility to make this happen   . Such statement is proof of Lagarde   s ability to see beyond present while keeping in mind what  the  past  taught  us;  in  fact  many  people  in  the  past  thought  that  process  and innovation would have been the endgame for human beings and society as we know it while it is only up to us the human race to make a good use of such new technologies and  implement  them  to  our  advantage.  Therefore  Fintech  should  be  considered  as  an opportunity to improve our current system instead of considering it as a threat to our job places.  Ian Pollari Global CoLeader of Fintech for KPMG International has a common opinion on  the  topic  recognizing  its  possible  applications  and  functions  as  he  states     The growing complexity costs and risks in managing regulatory and legal obligations on a global  basis  is  a  persistent  challenge  for  the  financial  services  industry.  Through  the application of AI and machine learning global and regional banks are able to now gain access to emerging Regtech solutions that can help them to more accurately assess and monitor their compliance obligations across multiple markets in real time and with greater confidence   . Backing the paper   s assumption that Fintech is going through a process of steady  growth  and  is  a  sector  that  keeps  drawing  the  investors     interest  Anton Ruddenklau Global CoLeader of Fintech for KPMG International said    The Fintech industry  is  particularly  resilient  partly  because  of  the  very  strong  participation  of corporates. In 2018 we saw corporate VC investment more than double while corporates also drove a large degree of the M&A activity. And it   s not just the traditional financial institutions getting involved in Fintech deals. Even when other investors might be more cautious heading into 2019 corporate participation will likely remain strong as they are primarily investing for strategic reasons   .  19  An assessment of what the Fintech industry currently look like was given in the World Fintech Report 2018 from CapGemini and LinkedIn in collaboration with the European Financial  Management  Association  (EFMA)  which  states     Most  successful  fintech firms  have  focused  on narrow functions or segments  with high friction levels or those underserved by traditional financial institutions but have struggled to profitably scale on their own. Traditional financial institutions have a vast customer base and deep pockets but with legacy systems holding them back   . Therefore it suggests that traditional banks and fintech companies partner up to take advantage of each one   s strengths and achieve better outcomes. Also many parties involved in the Fintech industry are sure that tech giants will play a fundamental role in this race towards financial innovation; according to Bain & Company indeed    Many of the tech giants possess the ingredients of success digital  prowess  large  customer  bases  organizations  well  versed  in  improving  the customer experience and ample leeway to extend their corporate brands into banking   . Alibaba  Group   s  cofounder  and  executive  chairman  Jack  Ma  instead  makes  a  clear analysis  of  what  the  future  of  Fintech  looks  like  and  distinguishing  the  two  major opportunities  it  offers  saying  (2016)     there  are  two  big  opportunities  in  the  future financial industry. One is online banking where all the financial institutions go online; the other is internet finance which is purely led by outsiders   . As shown by these various opinions  there  is  not  a  single  view  on  Fintech  still  what  everyone  agrees  on  is  that technology  will eventually deeply affect the  banking and financial system as a  whole thus it is up to us to make it a change for the better.  In  2016  professional  services  firm  PwC  conducted  an  interesting  global  survey addressed  to  executives  from  any  sector  questioning  the  threats  related  to  the  rise  of fintech the results are displayed in the following graphs.       Figure 6    What are the threats related to the rise of FinTech within your industry?     20  Source PwC Global FinTech Survey 2016  Figure 7    What percentage of your business is at risk of being lost to standalone FinTech companies within 5 years?    Source PwC Global FinTech Survey 2016 As the last graph shows bank related businesses are the most exposed to the incoming Fintech threat therefore it is reasonable to think that they will be more prone to arrange  21    partnerships  with  fintech  companies  in  order  to  maintain  their  current  positions  in  the market.       22  Chapter 2. The impact of fintech on traditional banking  2.1 Forward looking scenarios  The  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  within  the  Bank  for  International Settlements depicted five different scenarios describing the potential effect of the rise of fintech on banks in an effort to assess what kind of impact would fintech products and services have  on the  banking industry (BCBS 2018).  Such  scenarios would obviously differ depending on the size or geography of the various actors. Also they are not to be considered mutually exclusive and comprehensive as it is likely that the evoluion of the banking industry may proceed to be a combination of the various scenarios namely the    better  bank     scenario  the     new  bank     scenario  the     distributed  bank     scenario  the    relegated bank    scenario and the    disintermediated bank    scenario (BCBS 2018). The main questions addressed to develop such forwardlooking scenarios were (i) which player leads the customer relationship that is the user experience and interface and (ii) which player eventually provides the services and bears the risk. As for the former point the  advance  of  fintech  innovation  has  ended  up  being  a  kind  of  battle  for  customer relationship and customer data; its outcome will define the actual future role of banks. Another main consideration relates to potential changes in banks    business models and the various roles traditional banks and other fintech companies may play in either owning the customer relationship or supporting banking activities as service providers. The latter question  instead    involves  who  will  ultimately  be  responsible  for  the  tradtional  core banking services such as lending managing risk and offering payment and investment services. However the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision is conscious that future regulation  provisions  will  both  shape  and  result  from  the  depicted  scenarios  and  the manner in which they interact. In the following each different scenario will be described and analysed so as to better comprehend where fintech innovation could lead the banking industry in the near future.  Also examples of how the innovative technologies and processes could be implemented in the banking industry will be given. The  first  scenario  analysed  is  the     better  bank     one  where  the  modernisation  and digitisation of incumbent financial insitutions is brought upon; in this case the traditional  23  banks  innovate  to  keep  the  core  banking  services  and  customer  relationship implementing enabling technologies to transform their current business models.  Traditional banks are usually under pressure to both improve cost efficiency and customer relationship  at  the  same  time.  However  thanks  to  their  market  knowledge  and  better investment capacities a potential result is that incumbent financial institutions improve at offering services and products by exploiting new technologies or upgrading existing ones.  Banks  adopt  new  technologies  to  provide  value  propositions  that  could  not  be effectively offered  with their current infrastructure.  The same  technologies adopted  by nonfinancial innovators can also be  put into action by  incumbent banks; for instance biometry  chatbots  or  artificial  intelligence  might  help  banks  to  develop  sophisticated ways  for  sustaining  a  valueadded  remote  customer  relationship  while  keeping transtactions safe and reducing fraud risks (BCBS 2018). As many incumbent banks have already introduced mobile payments services or employed payment services offered by third parties innovative payment services would support the better bank scenario; in fact customers could believe that a traditional bank would provide safer payment transactions than nonbanks alternatives would. However although there are early signs suggesting that incumbent players have increased investments in digitisation and modernisation to their strategy plans it is still to be seen to what magnitude this scenario will actually be dominant.  The  second  scenario  considered  is  the  one  of  a  new  bank  where  incumbent  financial instituions have been replaced by challenger banks. According to this scenario traditional banks will not be able to adapt to the incoming technologyenabled disruption and thus will be supplanted by neobanks or banks established by bigtechs with fully digitalized banking  platforms.  The  new  banks  will  provide  costeffective  and  innovative  banking services through the implementation of advanced technologies and may receive banking licenses under existing regulatory systems or may have traditional financial institutions as partners. Neobanks such  as the German N26 or the  Chinese WeBank moved  away from the  branchcentred  customer relationship model thanks to their technologybased relationship model and may be able to exploit innovative processes and instruments at lower cost more quickly and in an uptodate manner compared to incumbent players due  to the  fact that neobanks are  not  constrained  by  legacy infrastructure.  That said  24  there  are  no  evidence  suggesting  that  the  current  agglomerate  of  challenger  banks  has reached such a market power for the new bank scenario to be the predominant one.  Then the distributed bank scenario is described; in this situation there is a fragmentation of financial services among specialised fintech firms and incumbent financial institutions. As  financial  services  become  progressively  modularised  incumbent  banks  can  still capture  enough  market  share  to  survive.  Several  new  businesses  rise  to  provide specialised services focusing on specific niches without attempting to become universal retail  banks;  such  businesses  may  decide  not  to  compete  for  ownership  of  the  whole customer relationship while incumbent banks challenge each other to both provide core banking services and own the customer relationship.  In the distributed bank scenario the delivery of financial services is shared across various parties  with  banks  and  fintech  firms  operating  as  joint  ventures  partners  or  other structures.  Therefore  banks  are  more  prone  to  offer  services  and  products  from  thirdparty  suppliers  in  order  to  satisfy  the  customer  whose  expectations  in  terms  of transparency and quality have soared. Also consumers may use various financial services providers instead of using only one financial partner (BCBS 2018). The increasing adoption of open APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) is evidence that this scenario is already playing out in some markets. Other elements signalling the likeliness  of  this  scenario  are  the  increasing  partnerships  between  online  lending platforms  and  traditional  banks  the  growth  of  innovative  digital  payment  systems emerging from joint ventures between banks and fintech firms and the steadily increasing presence of roboadvisors or automated investment advisory services that are provided by fintech companies through banks. Described next is the relegated bank scenario in which incumbent banks are considered as commodities that provide services while the direct customer relationship is owned by other financial services providers that is fintech companies or bigtechs. Both fintech and bigtech  companies  operate  frontend  customer  platforms  to  perform  various  financial services from an heterogeneous group of suppliers; they also take advantage of incumbent banks    banking licenses to offer core banking services. It is uncertain if the relegated bank would  bear  the  risks  attached  to  these  activities  as  it  may  depend  on  the  contract stipulated along with the fintech or bigtech firm.  25  In this specific  scenario frontend   customer platforms fully exploit cloud computing artifical intelligence and big data through various configurations making heavy use of both connectivity and data gathering to improve the customer experience in innovative ways;  at  this  point  the  entities  managing  such  platforms  have  enough  resources  to compete  with  incumbents  for  owning  the  customer  relationship.  Therefore  banks  are relegated to mere commoditised functions providers carrying out basic services such as risk management and operational processes playing the role of service providers to the abovestated platforms that operate customer relationships.  Currently  the  relegated  bank  scenario  seem  unlikely  due  to  its  extreme  assumptions; however there are few examples of modularised financial services that may arise in the near future. For instance alternative payment platforms have experienced a steady growth lately leading banks to provide back office operations aid in fundamental areas such as compliance and treasury functions while fintech companies will directly interact with the customer.  Also  arising  online  lending  platforms  could  extend  their  array  of  services offered  beyond    lending  to  become  intermediaries  between  traditional  financial institutions and customers in which case incumbent banks would keep on existing just to provide operational and funding mechanisms required by other parties. Another example sustaining the likeliness of the relegated bank scenario is given by the instant messaging application  WeChat  in  China;  it  exploits  customer  data  to  provide  their  customers  the financial products and services that better suit them. Moreover WeChat is linked to the licensed  banking  platform  WeBank  eventually  relegating  banks  to  product  and  risk management only. Last  of  the  five  scenarios  to  be  analysed  is  the  disintermatied  bank  one.  In  this  case incumbent  banks  are  no  longer  playing  a  significant  role  in  the  financial  industry  as customers  interact  directly  with  financial  services  providers  with  no  need  for  any intermediary. Banks are therefore replaced by leaner and more agile platforms based on stateoftheart  technologies  which  effectively  secure  a  direct  matching  of  end  users depending  on  their  financial  requirements  be  it  borrowing  raising  funds  or  making payments.  Customers  have  a  more  direct  approach  when  choosing  financial  services  and  their provider in this scenario justifying the inutility of an intermediary bank. However they  26  also  may  be  exposed  to  higher  risks  when  performing  transactions  bearing  the  whole responsibility  for  them  on  their  own.  For  instance  in  the  peertopeer  (P2P)  lending industry common customers would be the lenders or borrowers depending on their needs therefore exposing themselves to either credit risk for the former or conduct risk for the latter.  This extreme scenario seems far to be reality in the near future however some examples of  components  of  the  disintermadiated  bank  scenario  are  already  happening.  Such examples  include  cryptocurrencies  which  ensure  value  transfer  and  payments  without the need of involving incumbent banks as intermediaries just by using public distributed ledger  technology  (DLT).  Their  adoption  on  a  daily  use  base  however  struggles  to become reality as cryptocurrencies have been constrained by several factors such as price volatility antimoneylaundering issues (AML) due to the anonymity of the transactions and scarcity of scalability. Another example sustaining the likeliness of this scenario is given  by  P2P  lending  platforms  which  have  employed  extremely  innovative  and trustworthy credit scoring processes; nonetheless P2P lenders    market share is currently relatively  small  in  most  countries  and  many  peertopeer  platforms  have  adopted  a different  business  model  which  relies  on  the  involvement  of  incumbent  banks  and investment funds rather than on retail investors as it was in origin.  Overall  each  of  the  five  forwardlooking  scenarios  hereby  described  and  analysed  is extreme while it is very likely that the future will provide a mix of these scenarios; both fintech  firms  and  banks  will  own  different  parts  of  the  customer  relationship  while simoultaneously  offering  modularised  financial  services  and  products  for  back  office operations.  Giving  foundations  to  this  assumption  is  the  case  of  Lending  Club  a  US marketplace  lending  company  which  displays  three  of  the  five  scenarios  taken  into consideration. In fact an incumbent bank that exploits Lending Club   s platform to issue and price consumer loans for its own balance sheet could be considered as a    distributed bank     since  the  incumbent  keeps  owning  the  customer  relationship  but  allocates  the revenues and processes with the fintech company (BCBS 2018). Lending Club matches customer  loans  with  retail  or  traditional  investors  as  well  thanks  to  the  support  of  a regulated traditional bank which is included in the transaction in order to make the loan issuing easier in such operations the incumbent bank   s role could be characterised as a  27     relegated  bank     scenario.  Various  marketplace lenders instead  display the    disintermediated  bank     scenario  due  to  the  fact  that  they  enable  direct  peertopeer lending without involving any bank during its process. To  recapitulate  it  is  close  to  impossible  that  a  single  scenario  will  reflect  the  whole banking industry situation as markets differ significantly for size needs and jurisdiction; therefore a blend of the five scenarios is the most likely to emerge in the future. Following  a  graph  that  summarizes  the  five  scenarios  and  its  key  players  where  red represents incumbent banks purple  indicates new players grey fintech companies and blue bigtechs such as Google or Amazon. As shown in the first scenario traditional banks would  retain  their  current  role  both  as  service  providers  and  owners  of  the  customer relationship by undergoing a modernisation process. In the next case depicted new banks are  characterized  by  a  solid  digital  user  experience  and  overall  digitization  of  their services.  Then  the     distributed  bank     scenario  is  presented  where  both  incumbents fintech companies and bigtechs are involved in providing financial services and offering a digital customer interface; the    relegated bank    scenario only differs in the customer interface which is built and managed solely by fintech companies or bigtechs. Lastly the    disintermadiated bank    scenario is displayed both services and interfaces are provided by  fintechs  or  bigtechs  with  focus  on  both  peertopeer  lending  and  digital  ledger technology.              28  Figure 8    The five forwardlooking scenarios    Source BCBS    Implications of fintech developments for banks and bank supervisors     February 2018. 2.2 Opportunities and risks emerging from fintech As  stated  in  the  previous  section  the  banking  industry  might  undergo  a  period  of  radical innovation  and  disruption  in  the  upcoming  future  due  to  the  rise  of  financial  technologies companies  and  to  the  increasing  number  of  bigtechs  approaching  the  financial  services industry. Such development will entail the presence of both new opportunities and risks for the whole banking sector.  Therefore  bank  supervisors  should  lookout  for  opportunities  to  improve  both  safety  wellbeing and financial stability while surveilling over ongoing practices which might excessively or unintendedly hamper enhancing innovations in the financial sector meanwhile remaining alert on ensuring the safety and health of the banking system (BCBS 2018).   29  The  potential  benefits  embedded  in  financial  technologies  implementation  are  several  and they would improve the financial services experience of all users. Such benefits include better financial inclusion as underserved consumers would be easier to be reached; the reduction of transaction  costs;  more  transparency  in  the  cost  of  products  and  services  and  increased efficiency in both spending and budgeting processes. Altogether these benefits could lead to an  improved  customer  experience  by  supplying  an  easier  comprehension  of  products  and terms. Such opportunities will heavily depend on the development of the technologies which would empower them; examples of considerable opportunities might include      Enhanced  banking  services  With  the  inclusion  of  fintech  companies  in  the  financial services industry banks could be helped to improve their range of traditional services and  products  provided;  for  instance  they  may  supply  banks  with  roboadvisors  to improve  the  customer experience  related  to investing.  Also partnerships with fintech could result in more efficiency for the incumbent banks.      Financial inclusion Thanks to the implementation of innovative technologies financial services  are  now  available  in  remote  locations  as  well  helping  the  growth  of  small economies  through  microfinancing  plans  and  enhanced  access  to  credit.  Moreover mobile devices could be the tool to help digital finance in broadening its use scaling up and reducing costs; thus financial services could be offered to a wider array of people with greater reliability speed and efficiency.      Improved banking processes The use of cryptography and more interoperable systems would decrease the likeliness of errors and may grant to run operations in a more secure environment.      Inferior transaction costs and highspeed banking services Fintech companies could accelerate transfers and payments while lowering their costs thanks to their innovative technologies.      Potential improvement of financial stability due to intensified competition The banking services market could eventually be disrupted by the incoming new players challenging incumbent banks lowering the systemic risk attached to actors of systemic size (FSB 2017).      Regulation technologies (Regtech) As financial regulation is increasing worldwide the  30  employment of regtech could significantly ease compliance at financial institutions; for instance  its application could  automatize regulatory and  compliance  processes other than  smoothing  cooperation  between  different  sectors  and  jurisdictions  significantly enhancing the compliance and regulatory frameworks.  Despite the many benefits stemming from fintech safety and soundness of the financial system should  keep  being  a  priority  for  both  banks  and  bank  supervisors;  therefore  they  should continue focusing on risk management monitoring and supervision over the newly unfolding innovations in the financial services market. It is fundamental however that such supervision and regulation must not hamper the implementation of innovative beneficial technologies. Along with the benefits of applying innovations to the banking industry however come new risks; fintech embeds various crosssectoral risks indeed. Most of these threats are featured in almost each of the five scenarios previously described and are illustrated beneath      Strategic risk Profitability of individual banks is put at risk by the swift transition of bank services to fintech companies; if new players are capable of applying innovations efficiently  and  provide  customers  with  cheaper  and  more  tailored  services  than incumbent  financial  institutions  could  lose  a  considerable  slice  of  their  market  share along with part of their profit margin.      Growing difficulties in reaching compliance requirements The increasing  interaction between banks and  fintech companies through the exchange  of products and  services may  result  in  a  lack  of  transparency  in  the  transactions  processing  and  who  holds compliance responsibilities. Such situation could lead to an increased conduct risk for incumbent players since they could be held liable for the fintech partners misconducts if consumers encounter losses or regulatory requirements are not reached.       Compliance risk related to data privacy The surging use of big data to provide better financial services and products could lead to compliance risk concerning data privacy rules  as  the  fierce  contention  for  owning  the  customer  relationship  may  lead  to inappropriate exploitation of personal data.      Outsourcing risk As more  parties are  included  in the  supplying of financial services and  products  ambiguities  related  to  the  accountability  of  the  players  involved  could spread  out  increasing  the  probability  of  operational  mishaps.  Therefore  financial  31  institutions  will  face  the  challenge  of  monitoring  and  managing  outsourced activities conducted by third parties. Moreover incumbents will have to adjust their operational control processes in order to assure the safety of both the bank and its customers.      Higher  operational  risk  The  growth  of  fintech  heighten  operational  risk  both  on  a systemic  and  idiosyncratic  level;  as  the  financial  market  players  become  more interdependent on an IT level a failure of the information technologies infrastructures could  easily  lead  to  a  systemic  crisis.  Moreover  the  increasing  presence  of  fintech companies in the banking industry results in a more complex system composed of novel actors which may have little expertise in IT risks management. As for the idiosyncratic dimension IT systems inherited by traditional banks may not be adjustable enough or simply  obsolete  with  respect  to  the  ones  owned  by  fintech  firms.  Thus  incumbents would increase their use of third parties to provide uptodate services which may lead to higher risks related to data protection money laundering cybercrime privacy issues and  customer  tutelage.  Additionally  banks  may  have  to  sustain  fintech  partners  in financial  distress  due  to  their  common  involvement  in  the  supply  chain  of  financial services.      Cyberrisk The wide adoption of technologies to ease interconnection between different players  and  sectors  require  the  banking  system  to  increase  controls  and  innovate  its regulatory  system  as  it  may  be  more  exposed  to  cyberthreats  putting  to  risk  huge quantities of sensitive data. Such threats highlight the urgency for financial institutions fintech companies and supervisors to update their monitoring processes and stress the importance of withstanding cyberrisk.      Liquidity and volatility risk Customers are facilitated in changing saving accounts for the sake of greater returns thanks to new technologies and neobanks which are rapidly lowering fees with the objective of enlarging their customer base. While the increased competitiveness could improve  efficiency  it could also  worsen  customer loyalty and raise deposits    volatility resulting in notable liquidity risk for banks. Eventually  the  following  table  provided  by  the  Basil  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision shows  the  main  risks  for  each  of  the  five  scenarios  analysed  in  the  previous  subchapter assessing their likelihood and impact on the whole society.  32  Figure 9    Description of main risks per each scenario      33  Source BCBS    Implications of fintech developments for banks and bank supervisors     February 2018.  2.3 Central banks    initiatives to facilitate financial innovation With the objective of facilitating the flourishing of innovative technologies and business models for financial services providers many jurisdictions worldwide have established several  innovation  assistance  systems  in  the  forms  of  startup  accelerators  regulatory sandboxes and innovation hubs. The Financial Stability Board (FSB) partnered up with the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) to conduct a survey on this matter aiming at better assess each jurisdiction   s approach to support fintech innovations. The initiatives  brought  forward  by  each  jurisdiction  have  the  objective  of  smoothing companies navigation through supervisory regulations providing regulatory guidance to both newly emerging startups and incumbent companies. Such interactions enhance the authorities     understanding  of  these  innovative  technologies  as  well  aiding  regulatory institutions in identifying innovations which may be useful for supervisory reasons that is  helping  the  suptech  sector  to  develop  in  a  more  rapid  manner.  Obviously  each  34  programme   s scope depends on the authority   s objective and its regulatory framework; therefore the implementation of such initiatives is specific to the jurisdiction   s mandate.  The following table summarizes what the jointsurvey conducted by the BCBS and the FSB found giving an overlook on the major countries    range of facilities for financial innovation. Figure 10    Authorities    initiatives to facilitate financial innovation     Source BCBS    Implications of fintech developments for banks and bank supervisors    February 2018. The  above  reported  innovation  hubs  are  open  to  most  firms  employing  or  considering  the employment of innovative products services business models or delivery systems (European Banking Authority et al 2018).  In the following diagram is represented the process involved in innovation hubs where firms first submit enquiries to the competent authorities then receive adequate preliminary guidance  35  related to the abovestated enquiries. Figure 11    Diagrammatic representation of innovation hubs    process       Source European Banking Authority    FinTech Regulatory sandboxes and innovation hubs    2018. In regard of fintech accelerators facilities where emerging startups are given the resources and tools to grow up in an institutional environment the Bank of England is a virtuous example for the banking industry; it is in fact taking a systematic look at emerging technologies seeking a proper way for them to be employed on a marketwide scale. Fintech companies applying to be  part  of  the  accelerator  programme  are  selected  through  an  open  competition  based  on  a welldefined central banking use case so as to preliminary assess their usefulness to the central bank (www.centralbanking.com January 2018).  For  what  concerns  regulatory  sandboxes  instead  the  process  may  be  divided  in  4  distinct phases first there is an application phase then a preparation phase followed by a testing phase and to conclude an exit or evaluation phase where the competent authority decides how the firm should approach the exit from the regulatory sandbox which may be either continuing or terminating the company   s activities.   36  Following a graphic representation of such process is given including a brief description for each of the phases involved.  Figure 12    Diagrammatic representation of regulatory sandbox phases    Source European Banking Authority    FinTech Regulatory sandboxes and innovation hubs     2018. 2.4 Focus on the fintech credit market After having discussed the effects that fintech would have on the banking system and having described what the future of financial services may look like it is due to focus on the fintech sector which can already be considered a reality both for its current size and its pace of growth the fintech credit market.  Fintech credit may be defined as credit activity supported by electronic platforms that are not controlled  by  commercial  banks  (Claessens  et  al  2018).  Such  definition  includes  all  credit activity enabled through platforms which couple borrowers with lenders that is investors. A peculiarity  which  differs  fintech  credit  companies  from  other  credit  providers  is  the implementation of emerging technologies and digital innovations to interrelate with customers online  and  manage  huge  volumes  of  customer  data;  commercial  banks  instead  do  not  run  37  digitised  credit  processes  at  the  same  level  and  mostly  employ  offline  processes  and  staff. Moreover traditional banks also intake  demand  deposits this is the  main reason for  which they  undergo  the  lenses  of  prudential  regulations  and  supervision;  on  the  opposite  fintech credit providers are currently not subject such regulation framework and therefore  they are still considered as belonging to part of the alternative credit market.  Fintech  credit  is  supported  by  online  platforms;  such  platforms  can  differ  significantly  in design but are all heavily dependent on digital and innovative technologies to deliver proper customer  services  and  to  effectively  process  large  volumes  of  information.  However incumbent  players  of  the  traditional  credit  market  are  increasingly  employing  these technologies to varying degrees.  Most fintech credit companies belong to the category of marketplace lenders that is nonbank loan  providers  focusing  on  lending  to  individual  consumers  or  smallmedium  enterprises (SMEs); their activities are  mostly operated  online the  underwriting is brought forward by automated systems and algorithms and they are funded by issuing equity or selling loans to investors (Perkins 2018). In the case of a peertopeer (P2P) business model a lowcost standard loan application process is  given  out  by  the  digital  platform  facilitating  the  match  between  borrowers  and  lenders. Potential borrowers dispense private information about their finances    status and the operation for which they are seeking funds; after the platform has overlooked it investors may review it. Once both parties are matched they start contracting the loan directly between each other; such phase assures that the lender takes on the risks promptly without the lending platform being involved. Loans are mostly durationmatched thus lenders are unable to dissolve their investments before the expiration date unless they find a new investor who is willing to buyout the  investment.  Such  process  is  supported  by  some  peertopeer  platforms  that  offer  a secondary market where loans or credit   s rights are traded among investors.  As  the  loan  is  originated  the  credit  platform  provides  services  related  to  the  loan  such  as recordkeeping  collection  of  the  borrowers     instalments  distribution  of  cash  flows  and recovery of unmet obligations; this agentlike behaviour is repaid through ongoing fees by the investor.   38  Many lending platforms also provide loan pricing and borrower screening as extra services in order  to  facilitate  the  investors     selection  of  individual  loans  to  take  over.  A  valuation  of borrowers    credit quality is reflected in the credit grade which is assessed through the analysis of various parameters depending on the platform   s policy; such credit grade is then used to fix a loan interest rate. However other platforms employ marketdetermined pricing mechanisms such as auctions and many others apply fixed prices. Fintech credit firms usually suggest lenders to spread risks; they can decide  to spread their investment over multiple loans or be exposed to a portfolio of loans which is automatically tailored with respect to their selection in term of risk category. Around 95% of US peertopeer  lending  platforms  use  an  autoselection  system  to  offer  such  portfolios  while  the percentage is at 75% for Europe; such widespread service resulted in an increasing structuring of investments as units in a diversified loan pool.  Other than facilitating credit fintech companies can offer monitoring and servicing duties just as traditional banks do; the key difference stands in the absence of a balance sheet accounting for credit and other risks. Moreover fintech firms do not rely on the brickandmortar model of  distribution  having  no  physical  branches  available  and  a  total  digitalisation  of  the  loan origination processes; such processes include the assessment of customers    credit through the implementation of algorithms machine learning technologies and the use of a wide range of personal data from nontraditional sources which is used to better evaluate the credit grade of each  customer  by  following  his  digital  footprints.  Surely  traditional  banks  have  access  to exclusive  information  from  customers     deposits  and  credit  history  but  they  are  still  not  as innovative in data gathering. In the  next figure  are  summarized three different fintech lenders    business models to better comprehend each one   s functions in the facilitation of credit and the way of profiting which sustain their platforms.      39  Figure 13    Examples of different fintech lender business models    Source Congressional Research Service Report September 2018  40   Finally  from  the  perspective  of  a  retail  investor  fintech  credit  is  a  newly  emerging investment category  which  differs from the  classic  loweryielding bank  deposits; also this  type  of  credit  to  businesses  is  easily  diversifiable  and  tailored  to  the  investors    preferences regarding risk and maturity (Claessens et al 2018).  2.5 The fintech credit market development Available  data  evidence  that  the  fintech  credit  industry  has  grown    rapidly  through  many countries over the last years. The Cambridge Centre for Alternative Finance (CCAF) estimates that the sector provided credit globally for the amount of $284 billion in 2016 with respect to $11 billion in 2013.  Global volume of new fintech credit is represented in the following graph (lefthand panel) along with the volumes of a few selected countries in order to better assess the magnitude of this emerging sector. Figure 14    The rapid growth of the fintech credit market    Source BIS Quarterly Review September 2018.   As  shown  by  the  righthand  panel  fintech  credit  has  developed  quite  unevenly  across countries; China was the largest market by far in 2016 followed by the United States and the United  Kingdom.  However  fintech  credit  per  capita  was  relatively  high  in  many  smaller  41  economies such as New Zealand and Estonia. Recent data evidenced a slowdown of growth in several major countries following the rapid development between 2013 and 2016; China   s lending volumes have decreased in the past few quarters indeed. Despite the rapid growth fintech credit still constitute only a small share of the  worldwide  credit  flows;  WDZJ.com  estimates  that  it  represented  13%  of  Chinese  new lending market in the first half of 2018 and amounted  to only 4% of US    credit volume in 2016 according to the CCAF. Fintech credit seems to prevail in specific market sectors. For example it amounted to 15% of the  lending  volumes  to  consumers  and  SMEs  in  the  United  Kingdom  in  2016;  also  it constituted  about 36%  of unsecured  personal loans originated  in the  United  States in 2017. Fintech originated mortgages accounted for approximately 812% of the total US    amount in 2018 as the fintech lending firm Quicken Loans was the largest mortgage originator in 2017 (Claessens et al 2018). The  following  graphs  display  these  differences  across  countries  comparing  fintech  credit compositions among various jurisdictions. Figure 15    Different fintech credit characteristics    Source BIS Quarterly Review September 2018.  42   The  majority  of  consumers  join  fintech  providers  to  refinance  or  securing  already  existing debts  while  others  use  them  to  fund  major  purchases.  Fintech  credit  is  also  playing  an important role in the student loans market with increased borrowing from students both in the US and in China. In concern with businesses SMEs usually look for fundings addressed to working capital and investment projects; moreover investors are buying discounted claims on a firm   s receivables giving form to the    invoice trading    phenomenon.  How  credit  activity  is  composed  of  borrower  segments  differ  radically  between  countries. Consumers are the largest borrowers in the US Germany and New Zealand as showed in the lefthand  panel  in  Figure  15.  On  the  other  hand  business  lending  is  prevalent  in  Japan Singapore  and  the  Netherlands  while  invoice  trading  takes  on  an  important  share  of  both Australian  and  Italian  credit  markets.  The  righthand  panel  in  the  previous  figure  instead shows that business lending is the most popular type of credit for fintech credit platforms that keep loans on their own balance sheets (Claessens et al 2018).  Several countries present a majority of individual investors in the fintech market as the peertopeer branding of most platforms suggests; this is the case especially  for China. However many  countries  have  experienced  an  increase  in  the  activity  of  institutional  investors.  For instance available data evidence that in 2016 most of the new loans in the US and parts of Europe were funded by institutional investors. Notably the United States now usually refer to fintech  lending  as     marketplace  lending     instead  of  P2P  lending  given  their  significant involvement. The  next  graphs  display  these  dynamics  showing  investment  activity  in  the  fintech  credit markets. The left panel presents institutional creditor funding in peertopeer lending across various  macroareas  during  2016  whereas  the  righthand  panel  shows  a  more  general investment activity in fintech comparing a few major countries to other continents.  It  is  interesting  to  notice  how  Chinese  institutions  are  heavily  investing  in  venture  capital activities related to fintech this evidences the country   s high expectations on this emerging sector and highlights its strong dedication to innovate.   43  Figure 17    Institutional funding and fintech investment across economies    Source BIS Quarterly Review September 2018. It is also worth noticing how US    institutional investors are funding both P2P consumer and business loans on the same scale; this suggests an incoming wave of growth in both the market  segments. 2.6     Implications on the credit market Due to the youth of the industry it is hard to properly assess its effect on end users such as lenders and users nor on financial health or the economic stability. Also such assessment is hard because of the various frameworks characterizing each country. Given these premises it is possible to recognize some benefits and risks that the fintech credit market would embed. Relatively to the impact on users the implementation of innovative digital technologies and more precise customer data guarantee greater efficiency lower transaction costs and a better evaluation of credit risk.  There  are  few evidence  sustaining this notion;  Fuster et al (2018) found  that  US     fintech  lending  platforms  process  mortgages  1530%  faster  than  traditional lenders enhancing the borrowers    experience. Also there is no evidence of increased default rates.  LendingClub one of the most virtuous US platforms in the market was found to have a high 44  performing  grade  assessment  method;  the  platform  would  assign  ratings  relying  on  nontraditional data predicting loan performance accurately and often allowing borrowers to agree more  favourable  terms.  Similarly  a  German  P2P  platform  would  outperform  traditional lenders  relying  solely  on  credit  history  data  alone  by  incorporating  the  customers     digital footprints and data with the purpose of better assessing their default risk. It is also proven that fintech platforms have eased access to credit; in the US P2P lending has become  a  substitute  for  bank  lending  since  it  serves  inframarginal  borrowers  while supplementing  traditional  bank  lending  for  smallscale  loans.  As  for  China  these  new platforms would support the growth of small firms and less wealthy consumers which due to their  restrained  access  to  traditional  credit  channels  would  be  forced  to  resort  to  informal private lenders. Alibaba is playing a significant role in this process of development granting easy access to credit for firms with low credit score (BCBS 2018).  However a full economic cycle involving these new fintech firms has yet to be finished; thus it is hard to foresee how fintech credit will react in deteriorated economic conditions. There are admonishing indicators in a few countries; for example increased default rates have lowered investor returns in the US China and UK. Default rates have also rose more recently in Australia and Korea. Such phenomena have occurred in a period when nonperforming loans in the banking industry are historically low for the majority of these countries; therefore it is likely that with the purpose of a rapid expansion some platforms have targeted lowquality borrowers bearing higher risks. In  addition  to  lower  returns  investor  trust  has  also  been  affected  by  some  business misdemeanours  and  failures.  For  instance  demand  for  fintech  credit  plummeted  in  2016 because of LendingClub misbehaviour as it had to buy back loans which did not comply with buyers     requirements.  Also  many  Chinese  lending  platforms  had  problems  during  recent years as P2P industry players promised unfeasible returns; instances of fraud  took place as well. Such issues along with more stringent regulation and institutions    intervention to dismiss nonqualified  lending platforms  led  to a  significant decrease in entrants and a  peak of P2P companies    exits in 20152016.  The next figure displays three graphs highlighting the weakened performance of fintech credit  45  firms in the major markets. Figure 18    Weakened fintech credit performance in key markets      Source BIS Quarterly Review September 2018. Regarding  the  systemic  impact  of  fintech  credit  currently  the  small  size  of  the  industry  in many countries constrain its impact on the  financial stability; however as the  sector grows bigger it will present an array of various benefits and risks. The increased financial inclusion and alternative financing and investment options would be important sources of growth for the global economy affecting on a wider scale the emerging economies  which  are  currently  constrained  by  their  limited  access  to  credit.  Moreover  the presence of various actors in the credit market would lower the systemic risks caused by the current oligopoly of few traditional banks in the credit market. Commercial  banks  could  also  be  better  off  thanks  to  fintech  credit  thanks  to  the implementation of innovative creditrelated technologies to enhance efficiency; some banks already count on fintech firms    credit rating processes. Others are employing machine learning  46  techniques in the origination of retail credit portfolios. On the other hand the rise of fintech credit could bring additional risks. Lending standards could be  weakened by the fiercer competition in the industry and the  wider access to credit channels;  this  risk  would  be  amplified  in  the  case  of  quick  credit  growth.  Also  the impossibility to access the  safety nets provided  by various jurisdictions make  fintech credit more exposed to contractions in case of recession.  Overall the risks are limited  with respect to the broad potential benefits offered by fintech lending platforms; their growth would  optimize the credit market making it more efficient while  also  supporting  the  development  of  emergent  countries  through  microfinancing  and improved access to lines of credit.                   47  CONCLUSIONS  The  thesis  firstly  defined  what     financial  technology     is  tracing  its  boundaries  with  the banking  sector  and  its  potential  applications;  then  fintech   s  state  of  development  and upcoming trends have been analysed through a detailed study of  investments    flows toward the fintech sector. In conclusion of the first chapter the paper presents a wide range of different experts    opinions on the  topic  focusing on the  experts    expectations on the  impact of such disruptive technologies on the traditional banking industry. In the second chapter are presented five forwardlooking scenarios illustrating the future of the financial industry attempting to foresee what banking will look like in the future and including a thorough assessment of risks and benefits provided by fintech innovation. Next the focus of the research is moved on the fintech  credit  market  and  how  financial  technologies  might  boost  the  development  of emerging  countries  through  the  implementation  of  innovative  lending  platforms  and  new forms of financing. Answering the research question    how will fintech shape the future of banking?    is a hard task as  many  matters  regarding  the  topic  are  still  to  be  dealt  with  by  jurisdictions  and  financial regulations. However by conducting this research several potential benefits brough upon by fintech have emerged. First of all the implementation of financial technologies in the banking industry is inevitable as the economy moves closer to a total digitalisation on a daily basis; thus banking must undergo such process of modernisation as well to maintain their current position  in  the  market.  Of  the  five  scenarios  described  during  the  second  chapter  the    distributed bank    scenario seems the most likely to happen as bigtechs will certainly enter the market of financial services thanks to their stateoftheart technologies aimed at enhancing both the customer service and the financial industry; however it is odd to imagine banks losing their role to tech companies like Google. Therefore a financial market where banks fintech firms  and  bigtechs  all  compete  between  each  other  could  result  in  a  healthier  economic framework and an eased access to credit on global scale. To assure the success of such renovation regulators of each jurisdiction should work together to tackle the new risks attached to the increased presence of technology in the financial system; nonetheless the benefits arising from fintech as described in this research largely outweigh the risks leading to an improved and wider provision of financial services and products.  48  Bibliography       Barba  Navaretti  G.  et  al  (2017)     FinTech  and  Banking.
