We build a public permissioned chain for smallandmedium enterprise (SME) buyersand suppliers to create supply chain optimization tools andgain access to a   ordable capital sources to grow their businesses. Our smart contractbased ecosystem allows SMEs toquickly implement customized SCF solutions or issue digital tokens on a permissioned fork of Ethereum supportingdata privacy. We adopt a consensus protocol and quadraticvoting based governance model to provide practical    nitetime security guarantees on our public permissioned blockchain hybrid. From    nancing to procuretopay our productsutilize smart contracts to optimize the global supply chainfor buyers suppliers and    nanciers. Eximchain is an o   cialcandidate of the Blockchain Regulatory Sandbox Programin Guiyang China and a member of EEA (Enterprise Ethereum Alliance).1. ABOUT EXIMCHAINEximchain project was kicked o    in 2015 at MIT (Massachusetts Institute of Technology) by a team with decades ofacademic and industry experience in computer science banking and global supply chain across the world. Our visionis to use blockchain technology to bring the global supplychain into the digital era and lower    nancing barriers forSMEs. The project has received valuable mentorship andguidance from the MIT Media Lab Digital Currency Initiative MIT Center for Transportation and Logistics and PlugAnd Play Fintech Accelerator. The project was chosen as theGrand Champion of the 2016 Boston Seagull Entrepreneurship Contest the Engine of Innovation Prize of the 2016Rice Business Plan Competition and a Finalist of the 2017MIT $100K Business Plan Competition Accelerate.2. SUPPLY CHAIN FINANCE OVERVIEWTraditionally supply chain management has focused onthe material    ow of physical goods from manufacturers toend consumers. However the recent global economic downturn demonstrated that managing    nancial    ows within thesupply chain can be as important as managing physical    owsof goods and services[1]. Supply chain    nance (SCF) oneof the most exciting and promising new products emergingin the banking industry is a set of technologybased business and    nancing processes that allow    nanciers to fund anorganization   s operations through its supply chain relationships. SCF enables buyers to optimize working capital andsuppliers to generate additional operating cash    ow while simultaneously minimizing risk across the entire supply chain.More speci   cally SCF enables buyers and sellers to shrinktheir inventories collect money from customers faster anddelay payments to their suppliers. Citi recently completeda working capital study that showed companies managingworking capital through SCF were able to reduce these assets by 30% resulting in EPS (earning per share) increasesin the range of 1% to 4%. Furthermore the top 10% of companies that reduced their CCC (cash conversion cycle) wererewarded with a 30% stock price appreciation[2].3. THE PROBLEMAccording to the International Finance Corporation (IFC)small to mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) in developing countries face a    nancing gap totaling over $2 trillion[3]. In Chinaalone the vast majority of the 40 million SMEs remain unserved by existing    nancial resources[4]. This    nancing gapis particularly concerning because as cited by the WorldBank SMEs contribute up to 60% of total employment andup to 40% of GDP in developing markets[5]. Innovative SCFsolutions o   er a powerful tool for SME buyers suppliers and   nanciers to overcome this funding gap[6]. Innovations inthis space have traditionally been driven by large corporations and banks in the    eld; however cutting edge    nancial technologies o   er new opportunities to extend the bene   ts of SCF to businesses of all sizes. According to a 2015McKinsey Report of the $20 billion potential revenue poolthat exists for implemented SCF programs only $2 billionis being captured today[7]. One primary issue inhibiting thewidespread adoption of SCF programs among SMEs is thatthey currently lack a trusted tool that provides transparencyto eliminate information asymmetry problems. Beyond thisthere are quite a number of di   culties for adoption of SCFprograms on a global scaleFirst of all any supply chain strategy cannot be determinedin isolation. The market for SCF programs is inherently dynamic exogenous factors such as interest rates and endogenous factors such as inventory decisions and capital constraints in   uence the evolution of the system.Furthermore the complexity of implementing SCF acrossthe global supply chain limits its adoption. It takes tremendous e   ort to onboard suppliers and integrate the processwith the existing operational    ow by involving    nance procurement and IT departments inside the organization.1 ted information displayed in contracts it is hard for banksto understand the market expectation and real dynamic between buyers and suppliers to mitigate risk. In 2014 a Chinese trading company Dezheng Resources and its subsidiarieswere alleged to have used duplicate receipts to pledge metalas collateral for loans. The result was a    urry of lawsuitsincluding the UK High Court case between Mercuria andCiti over exposure to a $270 million    nancing deal[10]. TheEximchain platform provides access to smart contract history between two parties which grants banks more visibilityinto the supply chain operations and enables them to better estimate the risk of a transaction. Furthermore access tothis smart contract information will provide other    nanciersbeyond traditional banks and lenders with an opportunityto fund and generate value o    of these transactions.Eximchain allows developers to create variations on supplycontracts secured by the network and build solutions that arecustomized to their global supply chain. Currently supplychain partners use a variety of solutions to align incentivesand mitigate inventory risk including buybacks quantitydiscounts revenuesharing and twopart tari   s contracts. Onthe Eximchain platform developers can build customizedsolutions based on speci   c industry needs user dynamicsand market competition. Banks and anchor buyers can easily scale the solution on the global supply chain by involvingupstream and downstream players. Although these solutionswill be varied the contracting process will be highly standardized and can be seamlessly integrated into the biddingprocess and other supply chain management tools.Customized negotiation rulesEach graph represents one state transaction. The negotiation will end after all parties reach Nash Equilibrium basedon the negotiation rules set by each party. Grey arrows represent locked status while green arrows represent unlockedstatus.Private channel coordinationEach communication channel is private where only the involved parties can see the information provided during eachnegotiation. The system runs automatically based on presetinputs and only updates state of each negotiation cycle forinvolved parties.Last but not least it is di   cult to align incentives amongdi   erent participants. Suppliers buyers and    nanciers areindependent decision makers attempting to maximize pro   tsin the face of asymmetric cost structures and uncertainties.Such independent pro   t maximizations often lead to poorperformance of the entire supply chain.The Eximchain platform solves these challenges by o   eringseamless integration into the existing work   ow of SMEs andenabling developers to create customized tools for speci   cbusinesses and industry use cases.4. OUR SOLUTIONEximchain o   ers a platform to implement smart contractbased SCF solutions on a permissioned fork of Ethereumsupporting data privacy. Our ecosystem will enable SMEs togain access to a   ordable capital sources by giving    nanciersvisibility into the supply chain cash    ow. The    rst gametheorybased application we plan to build MultiPartyDynamic Contracting* (details to be described underAppendix Use Case Example) will be designed in such away that no partner can improve his pro   t by deciding todeviate from the optimal set of decisions. That is there isno incentive for the buyer the supplier nor the    nancier todeviate from the set of actions that will achieve the globally optimal solution. The implementation is executed by theconsensus of the network in a standard automated private and auditable fashion. From the user   s perspective aftermaking the initial input and setting up the negotiation rulethey can receive the negotiation result from a    black box   where the system automatically executes an optimizationengine through multistage coordination until Nash Equilibrium is reached and each participant   s incentive is aligned.Buyers and suppliers can automate contracting processeswith the Eximchain network. Suppliers and buyers normally have di   erent and con   icting objectives. For instancesuppliers want buyers to commit themselves to purchasinglarge quantities of products in stable volumes with    exible delivery dates. Conversely buyers need to be    exible totheir customers    needs and changing demands. The di   cultywith global optimization is that it requires    rms to surrender decisionmaking power to an unbiased decision maker.Additionally establishing trust between the supplier andthe buyer is di   cult to achieve. For example in January2013 the Walt Disney Company sued Blockbuster accusingthem of cheating its video unit of approximately $120 million under a fouryear revenuesharing agreement[8]. Throughthe Eximchain platform buyers and suppliers can carefullydesign supply contracts to maximize pro   t on the supplychain with more visibility into demand inventory and upstream/downstream operations through a trusted and secured network. Additionally interactions and agreements aresaved automatically with a traceable record.Financiers will be onboarded to the network with alignedincentives. In the real marketplace suppliers and buyers frequently    nance their working capital from a variety of creditsources such as banks and incur signi   cant    nancing costs.Studies have shown that under the assumption of positiveinventory    nancing costs traditional supply contracts failto achieve joint pro   t maximization[9]. Based on the limi2 5. VALUE FOR OUR STAKEHOLDERSFinanciersRisk MitigationWe enable dynamic realtime monitoring of supply chain   nancing processes to provide visibility into the whole supply chain   s operations. Lenders can now better understandthe actions taken by end purchasers and upstream suppliersof each deal to better assess risk. With the combination ofa    Purchase Money Security Agreement    (PMSA)[11] also known as purchase money security interest on the loanwhich makes the lender the    rst claimant of the collateralrelated to the loan in the case of default the    nanciers gainsa much better estimation on the risk and return of the investment despite all external uncertainties.Operational Ef   ciencyWith more information about the trade the    nancier couldmore accurately set the rating and risk factor. Increasedtransparency over trade transactions tends to lower the riskfactor and thus risk equivalent which improves e   ciencyin operation and management of the loan. By digitalizingand standardizing the contracting process    nanciers savethe overhead e   ort of processing paperwork understandingdi   erent terms and going through multiple levels of manualreview to make a    nal decision about the credit they areissuing.Investment OpportunityIn the traditional corporate    nancing scheme the    nanciers would be banks focused on assessing the borrower   shistorical credit capital position collaterals and guaranteesof the companies in the supply chain that they are providingcredit to. However in the SCF view    nanciers could be anyinvestor or anchor buyer who is capable of assessing and taking the credit risk of the SCF product. Our solution willlower the barrier to entry for    nanciers in the global supplychain and will allow institutional investors and accreditedindividual investors who are looking for shortduration lowrisk and highly collateralized credit products to o   er alternative funding sources to SMEs in the future.Buyers and SuppliersWorking Capital ManagementBy adopting our solutions suppliers facing di   culties obtaining a   ordable credit will now be able to access capitalthrough banks or alternative sources. Capitalconstrainedbuyers who rely on direct    nancing from a    nancial institution can obtain tradecredit in addition to standard contractsto subsidize their costs of inventory    nancing and improvetheir working capital.Given the lack of transparency of the supply chain we seethat most SMEs rely on margin money deposits for bankguarantees[12] or factoring houses to get loans. For examplein China banks normally require 520% of the loan amountas a margin deposit depending on the credit risk of a SME.Fees charged by factoring houses can run as high as 15%of the loan amount every year[13]. With the combinationof a PMSA and improved clarity on each deal potentiallyup to 15% of annual working capital loan for SMEs can beunlocked either by paying less to cover margin deposits orby eliminating the fee of the thirdparty guarantee company.On the buyer side a company with $10 million in revenueand a 60% cost of goods sold (COGS) ratio can experiencea cash    ow increase of $16.7k per day of extended payables ($10m * 60%/360 days=$16.7k). Parlaying that into a60day term extension on tradecredit would result in a potential annual working capital/cash    ow bene   t of $1 millionfor the buyer ($16.7k * 60=$1m).Credit Rate ArbitrationThe Eximchain platform enables anchor buyers to take advantage of their comparatively better credit ratings to o   erSCF programs to fund their suppliers in return for extendedterms lower prices and improved longterm relationships.In this    buyerdriven    model the anchor buyer becomes the   nancier in the ecosystem.For example if a supplier   s access to capital is 5 percentage points higher than the buyer   s 2.25%    nancing rate asimple calculation will show the buyer that a 30day invoicefor $500k can be extended to 96 days without adding costs tothe supplier. On the other hand if the buyer were to maintain the 30day payment terms the supplier could achieve areduced carrying cost of approximately $2083( representing0.4% of the $500k contract). Armed with this knowledgethe buyer could negotiate a price reduction based on all orsome portion of these savings. For a company with $10 billion in revenues and $600 million in COGS even a 0.4% dropwould equate to $2.4 million in savings[14].Supply Chain OptimizationThe Eximchain platform also helps participants achieveglobal optimization without the need for an unbiased decision maker by allowing them to share the supply chain   s riskand the potential bene   t. Below is an example to quantifythe value created for the supply chain based on a dynamiccontract between a supplier and buyerAssume the price of a product for the end customer is3 $125 per unit the wholesale price paid by the retailer to themanufacturer is $80 per unit the    xed production cost formanufacturer is $100k the variable production cost per unitis $35 and any item unsold in the end has a salvage valueof $20. This implies that the retailer   s marginal pro   t forselling a unit $45 is smaller than the marginal loss $60*.The optimal order quantity depends on marginal pro   t andmarginal loss. So the retailer   s optimal policy is to order12k units for an average pro   t of $470k as shown on belowgraph Pro   t vs. Order Quantity. If the retailer places thisorder the manufacturer   s pro   t is $400k ((12k*($80$35))$100k=$440k). Note that in this case the retailer assumesall of the risk of having more inventory than sales.By using a BuyBack Contract where the manufacturero   ers to buy unsold items from the retailer for $55 the retailer   s marginal pro   t $45 is now greater than its marginalloss $35 thus motivating the retailer to order more thanaverage demand. In this case the retailer has an incentiveto increase its order quantity to 14k units for a pro   t of$513.8k while the manufacturer   s average pro   t increasesto $471.9k. Thus the total average pro   t for the two partiesincreases from $910.7k (=$4707k+$440k) in the sequential supply chain to $985.7k (=$513.8k + $471.9k) when aBuyBack Contract is used. The Eximchain platform allowsthe retailer and manufacturer (i.e. the buyer and supplier)to share the additional $75k in pro   t generated from thiscontract based on their consensus[8].*    Marginal pro   t/loss is the pro   t/loss of a    rm or individual when oneadditional unit is produced and sold. Marginal pro   t and loss determine theoptimal ordering quantity the ordering quantity that gives the maximizedpro   t for a    rm or individual.Supply Chain ProvenanceUsing smart contracts and a token system Eximchain canexpand the supplierbuyer   nancier model and help buyersto gain visibility over the whole supply chain by interactingwith upstream suppliers.Process AutomationEximchain helps to automate the negotiation and contracting process through private communication channels. Bothbuyers and suppliers can stop wasting time on tracking thesupply chain process    ow manually and will instead be able to maintain an audit of the    nal agreed upon contract inrealtime through Eximchain   s trustless network and securedprotocol.6. ECOSYSTEMIntroductionEximchain streamlines complex multiparty transactionsin SCF by using blockchain to solve information asymmetry4problems. We recognize that partnerships and a minimumviable ecosystem (MVE) rather than a minimum viableproduct are crucial to successfully bringing a new blockchain solution to market.MVE The smallest con   guration of elements that can bebrought together and still create unique commercial valueMVECombining a Blockchain SDK and Platform layer is necessary to bring enough players to bear for a healthy minimum viable network. Eventually others will be able to develop solutions on our platform and make them immediatelyavailable to parties on the chain. In order for a blockchain towork the computers on the system must validate and agreethat a transaction was completed. This is accomplished byagreeing on a sequence of    blocks    which each contain a setof transactions. BTC for example incentivizes participation in consensus by rewarding the    rst user to propose andvalidate a new block at each canonical height. Importantly our design draws a distinction between nodes capable ofproposing and validating blocks.BlockchainTechnical challenges with blockchain technology have keptcorporate players at bay. At the time of this writing further research and development for the full potential of thistechnology to be realized are required on the Bitcoin andEthereum main nets. These areScalability All smart contract code must be executedby all participants on the network.Privacy All information on a public blockchain is visibleto all participants to read.Faced with the choice of waiting for Ethereum to end theIce Age[15] and release Casper in the coming years or building on recently produced viable solutions in this area wehave chosen to leapfrog the Ethereum Roadmap by leveraging Quorum an enterprise focused version of Ethereumreleased by JP Morgan. Quorum allows us to leverage Constellation[16] and a minimal Ethereum client fork to o   erCon   dentiality private transactions secured by the networkPerformance performance increases to handle the loadthat complex private transactions place on the network.Consensus permissioned consensus and governance rules to drive new economic incentives at the protocol level.Quorum and therefore Eximchain is designed to developand evolve alongside Ethereum. Because it only minimallymodi   es Ethereum   s core we are able to incorporate themajority of Ethereum updates quickly and seamlessly[17].At the lowest level we are modifying how the ethereum client protocol enables consensus and permissions theblockchain. Our blockchain distinguishes between participants that can validate blocks and participants that canpropose blocks. The latter allows us to both secure priva te transactions on the network and incentivize developers toparticipate in the evolution of our environment.Maker NodesMaker Nodes are responsible for proposing blocks andtheir addresses are registered in the BlockVoting contract.The initial set of Maker Nodes is precon   gured in the genesis block and will be comprised of our initial token holderswho we expect will add strategic value to the project however once the network is established this will begin to changeas described below.Maker Nodes will have the responsibility of voting in anew Maker Node every governance cycle. Nodes can opt tobecome Maker Nodes if they are KYC approved and votedin by an agreed threshold of existing Maker Nodes accordingto the Quadratic Voting Governance Mechanism.Validator NodesValidator Nodes help to secure the network and they arealso registered in the BlockVoting contract. They are responsible for voting to determine which block will be thecanonical hash at a particular height. Like Maker Nodesthe initial set of Validator Nodes is precon   gured in the genesis block.[18]Registered Voter NodesRegistered Voter Nodes tie real world identities of nodes.All nodes (including Maker Nodes Validator Nodes andother network participants) are required to register to votein order to participate in network governance mechanism.Registered Voter Nodes will have the responsibility of votingout a Maker Node every governance cycle and may be votedin as Maker Nodes once the network is established.Governance AnalysisIt is important to consider the evolution of the system andstakeholders in the face of dishonest nodes (traitors) and incentive driven collusion.Recent developments in permissioned distributed ledgertechnology (DLT) have enabled us to design novel consensusrules that allow for a fundamental change in the underlyingincentive mechanism and actors that underlie the consensusprotocol of permissioned public chains.The desired outcome is to keep a cohort of dishonest nodes from gaining control of the block proposal mechanismor forking the chain while bootstrapping a cohort of honestnodes with vested interest to protect the network and punishpotential traitors. In the face of an undefeatable adversaryleading to mechanism failure we analyze the time collusionand resources required for such an attack.While not strictly necessary for the purposes of this analysis it is important to keep in mind the real world identitiesbehind these nodes will largely represent corporate incentives in the global supply chain and development communities. Ultimately we believe the incentives of these stakeholders must be aligned at the protocol level. It follows thatdevelopers have a vested interest and duty to secure the infrastructure their applications clients and corporates relyon. Similarly clients and endusers have a vested interestConsensusRather than proofofwork (mining) Eximchain uses avotebased consensus algorithm that forks QuorumChain toadd a few governance rules. The governance mechanism isincluded in the appendix for completeness; implementationdetails can be found here.Settlement FinalityThe recent development on Istanbul BFT (Byzantine FaultTolerance) which will be incorporated into Quorum ensuressettlement    nality and speeds up settlement time to under 1second from the current tens of seconds to tens of minutes.7. GOVERNANCEThe reason why Eximchain chose to use Quorum is because the current proof of workbased blockchains like Bitcoinand Ethereum are not ready for enterprisegrade solutions(details to be described under Appendix Motivation). Webelieve the incentives of developer pools clients and corporates contributing value to the ecosystem must be alignedat the protocol level. This governance model can be appliedto other public permissioned blockchains that are lookingto address similar issues.Our proposed quadratic votingbased governance modelallows for a series of checks and balances between nodes. Weanalyze how a voting systembased consensus model drawsa clear line between safety and liveness the percent vote required for consensus trades safety for speed. We analyze thecounter balance of power between actors in the system proposing a model that discourages collusion and analyzes therobustness of the protocol to keep block proposers and validators in check under independent choice coordinatedchoice and a bribing adversary. We conclude by analyzing several failure modes of the system and subsequentrecovery.Voting Smart Contract[17]Quorum Consensus Process Flow [17]Quorum Consensus Block Creation [17]Quorum Consensus Block Voting [17]5 in ensuring honest development that improves the ecosystem as well as a vested interest in punishing freeloaders onthe network. The latter re   ects our view that Maker Nodes should represent developer pools motivating clients andendusers to become Registered Voter Nodes to participatein governance.In all cases while attacks on the network yield several failure cases the con   dentiality of private data stored on theblockchain is preserved. That is to say protocol or governance failure does not necessarily entail breach of securityto private data as long as private keys remain secure.Adversary under independent choiceThe consensus algorithm and governance is not fully opento any client issuing commands. Under independent choicestakeholders have no incentive to deviate from the protocolas their attack would be defeated by the network. Nodescannot singlehandedly con   rm the proposed block at eachcanonical height. Maker Nodes who deviate from the protocol would reveal their intentions to the network placingthemselves at risk of being voted o    the Maker Node pool inthe next governance cycle. Both Maker Nodes and ValidatorNodes have a history of who voted them into the system bya majority Maker Node vote and by invitation respectively; in this way the reputation of known traitors is linked toother nodes on the system (and real world entities) visibleto anyone in the voting smart contract.Adversary under coordinated choiceAssume an undefeatable coordinating racket of dishonestnodes who by a series of governance cycles gain control ofa majority of block maker nodes that would allow them tocontrol block proposal to deviate from the protocol. Theconsensus algorithm is not fully open to any client issuingcommands; taking control of block maker governance requires traitors to be voted into the block maker pool.Assume all nodes in the initial block maker pool of size kunder irrational choice consecutively vote into the pool anundefeatable coordinating racket of dishonest block makernodes of size m over a sequence of n governance cycles. Weanalyze the cost coordination and time required to launchan optimal attack and fool the network.Let b[1] b[2] . . .  b[n] denote the nodes added to theblock maker pool and s[1] s[2] . . .  s[n] the nodes removedfrom the block maker pool over n governance cycles lengthT. A kstrategy is a sequence that allows the coordinatedadversaries to control block proposal after a sequence of ngovernance cycles by voting in m nodes without replacement.(b1 s1)     (b2 s2)     ..... (bm sm) ; m     nwhere worst case m=n and m > 13 k assuming a traitoris added each cycle and an honest node is removed. If theadversaries can assure the above it is left up to the readerto see coordination of the attack requires collusion of 13 knodes over a minimum attack duration P = 13 kT beforeour strong assumption of k honest initial nodes fails.For a concrete example k= 2048 T = 2 weeks  a perfectlycoordinated attack to control block proposal would take 26years and coordination of 683 parties. Each must be capable of convincing honest nodes representing the developerpools clients and corporates that they are contributing value to the system throughout the duration of the attack tokeep any of them from being voted out at each governancecycle and extending the minimum attack period.Undefeatable Bribing AdversaryAssume an undefeatable bribing adversary who by a set ofhighly unlikely events knows exactly which nodes will propose the next sequence of n blocks and the price requiredto bribe each one to propose a tampered block. Assume allnodes will commit treason for a price the undefeatable bribing adversary has resources k at his disposal and is drivenby pro   t incentive. We analyze the cost of such an attackm over a sequence of n blocks.Let b[1] b[2] . . .  b[n] be nonnegative integers that denote the price required to bribe each blockproposer to con   rmthe proposed block at each canonical height over n blocks.A kstrategy is a sequence that allows the adversary to control block proposal over a sequence of n blocks for a price m.1     b1 < s1 < b2 < s2 < .... < bm < sm     nwhere m is a positive integer less than or equal to k. Thepro   t corresponding to the strategy is the total reward obtained if you bribe the network for b1 and pro   t s1 fromcontrolling a    xed number of transactions for one block bribing the network for 2 blocks at b2 pro   ting s2 from controlling a    xed number of transactions for two blocks and soforth. If the adversary can calculate the pro   t from controlling each proposed block p[1] . . .  p[n] it is trivial to designan algorithm for the adversary to compute a kstrategy withmaximum pro   t.Governance Level AttackA similar k strategy could be designed to control governance over n vote cycles at cost m to an undefeatable bribingadversary.Our governance model is unique in that nodes have theresponsibility of periodically voting out Block Maker nodescounterbalanced by block maker nodes being able to appointa replacement. We make an analogy to Block Makers asgenerals and other nodes registered to vote as soldiers toreason in laymen terms. You can say that governance levelattacks are part of the protocol and built into the systemto discourage majority collusion. Under similar assumptionsas above we expect generals (Block Makers) to appeal tosoldiers (registered voters) to defend their status. A coalitionthat controls over 12 of tokens could vote out any generalthey chose we expect this to incentivize generals to spin upsoldiers in their control to defend their status the only waythe protocol allows by voting out another general not intheir coalition simultaneously improving network security.Governance HardeningAssuming an initial token supply of X tokens we analyzethe case where an adversary owns X1 tokens and is attempting to gain control of the governance mechanism. Weanalyze the minimum cost of controlling a sequence of ngovernance cycles with length T of an undefeatable attack6 strategy. We analyze the cost and time required from anundefeatable adversary to maintain control of the network.Our governance model implements quadratic voting making the cost of each v votes for a governance decision cost v2tokens all tokens paid are then redistributed equally amongthe voting pool. To assure control of the    rst governancecycle the adversary must place 2 votes at a cost v[1]2 = 4tokens controlling X 5 of the token supply in the secondcycle to assure control of the next cycle the adversary mustplace 6 votes at cost v[2]2 = 36 to beat the possible 5 votesagainst his governance decision; this can continue to scalethis way until v[k] where the marginal cost of k nodes voting against the adversary increases(votes1 cost1)     (votes2 cost2) ...     (votesn costn)Optimal Defense  (1 1)     (4  4)     (25 25)     (676676)     (k1  k1)Optimal Attack (2 4)     (5  25)     (26 676)     (677458329)     (k k2)Sequence of optimal voting decisions for an attacker wouldcost1 + 4 + 25 + 676 + 458329 + 210066388900 + ... + v[k]2 <X     1/2By correctly parameterizing the system it is possible toprove an adversary can control a bounded number of governance cycles that can be defeated by k honest nodes.Counter MeasuresThe premise of attack from a bribing adversary is a validconcern if we are to expect the value of the network to scaleas the square of connected users [Metcalf   s Law]. Perhapsunsurprisingly distributed concentrations of wealth and asmaller block size discourage bribing people to deviate fromthe protocol for pro   t incentive. In practice the non deterministic choice of block proposers using random timeoutslimits the calculation of such a kstrategy by an undefeatable bribing adversary. The cost of the kstrategy to launcha governance or protocol level attack scales inversely to thepercentage of validators required for block con   rmation andnumber of nodes on the network. Our proposed governancemodel allows for a series of checks and balances between nodes. We are experimenting on mechanism design trade o   son our testnet and will make our results public in the comingyear.Bootstrap MechanismsQVEC Quadratic Voting on Ethereum ChainPeacekeepersThese are k = safety factor * initial token holders participant nodes originally launched as block makers to defend thenetwork and are registered in the voting contract as part ofthe bootstrap mechanism; these nodes participate in consensus but are forced to abstain at each governance cycle.They will be    rst to be voted o    the block proposer poolto make room for new Maker nodes allowing the ecosystemto become fully decentralized over time while ensuring theminimum attack period of an undefeatable adversary cannotbe realized in the infancy of the network.Quadratic VotingNodes can make v votes for a governance decision by paying v2 tokens from there it   s just a majority vote. All fundsraised are returned by giving back to each individual in thevoting pool1/(voting pool1) of the funds paid by the voter. The theory is that if someone gains x from a decisionbeing made and each vote has a probability p of being pivotal then they have the incentive to keep buying votes foras long as the price of the next vote is less than px. Becausethe total price of v votes is v2 and we know from calculusthat the derivative of v2 is 2v users will have the incentive to keep spending tokens until 2v > px; hence they willspend v = px/2 tokens. You can see from this math that thenumber of tokens that a voter buys should be proportionalto x ie. the amount that they gain from the decision beingmade. Hence the number of votes that a voter makes shouldactually re   ect the strength of their preference and not justwhich option they prefer.[19]Finite Attack WindowIt would be irresponsible of us to claim undefeatable adversaries are unlikely in practice* or claim that the protocol will defend the network inde   nitely rather we choose toerr toward practical guarantees that ensure network safetyby attempting to bound the minimum attack period andcost of an undefeatable adversary. It follows shortly thatgiven an unbounded amount of time a determined enoughundefeatable adversary would eventually be able to launcha successful attack. The only way to hedge against this is toensure a    nite possible attack period in a similar time scaleto the minimum attack period of an undefeatable adversary.In 100 years the voting contract will suicide halting all further change of state in the network triggering opensourcelicences on any remaining proprietary portions of our software.*For example a single blockchain enabling Export/Import (or any othervalue exchange for that matter) could become a military or terrorist target.8. APPLICATIONAt a higher level we are creating a smart contract SDK.The smart contract SDK layer will allow developers to buildapplications from basic components accelerating development of future SCF solutions.We want to enable the engineering of monetary systemsand make implementation of monetary theory economicsand law accessible to developers. The    rst step is enabling the implementation of systems that can be reducedto modeling the strategic interaction between two or mo7 re playersspeci   cally in situations containing a set of rules outcomes and desired objectives. Participants can buildsupply chain applications on top of the Eximchain smartcontract SDKOur aim is to show developers how our SDK easily supports complex multi party transactions enabling them tobuild applications and other supply chain    nance productson top of our ecosystem.Smart Contract SDKFinancing Through instant and transparent proof of order veri   cation on blockchain suppliers seize early paymentdiscounts to improve working capital and buyers seize creditarbitrage opportunity.ProcuretoPay Participatants can maintain an audit ofthe    nal agreed upon contract in each step of the procuretopay process in realtime through a trustless network andsecured protocol.Sourcing Sourcing platforms or rating agents can use theProof of Existence (PoE) functionality document time stamping verifying document integrity demonstrating data ownership without revealing data to provide independently veri   able reputation data.Inventory Management By sharing realtime demand information cross the supply chain participants can make better inventory plans and automate the reconciliation processacross di   erent ledgers and systems to save time and reducecost.Supply Chain Optimization Using MultiParty DynamicContracts  a combination of private channels and a con   gurable state machine to coordinate a con   dential bilevelstackelberg SCF negotiation (as described in Appendix).Supplier Management Using smart contracts and a tokensystem Eximchain can help buyers to gain visibility over thewhole supply chain by interacting with upstream suppliersbut still maintain privacy on each transaction level.Risk Mitigation Eximchain enables dynamic realtimemonitoring of supply chain processes to provide visibilityinto the whole supply chain   s operations. Participants canmanage risks in one place.Private channelsSeries of con   dential two way channels coordinated by theFSM (Finite State Machine).FSMStrategy Computation MachineWe consider the design of Computational GameTheoreticFrameworks  machine games where we replace strategies byTuring machines (smart contracts)[20].

TOKEN AND PARTICIPATIONEximchain Platform Native Tokens (Eximcoins) will beused to pay network fees validate state changes and execute governance. Eximcoins will also be used to access applications built on the Eximchain network developed with theEximchain SDK.Token StructureBecause Eximcoins will be native to the permissioned forkof the Quorum blockchain which will be integrated into theEximchain platform and will only be available when theplatform is deployed for commercial use (Mainnet Launch)(which is expected to occur in Q2 2018) Eximchain plans tosell a digital token native to the Etherium blockchain thatwill be a precursor to Eximcoins (EXC Tokens) (the sale ofEXC Tokens    Token Sale   ). EXC Tokens will be ERC20compatible tokens distributed on the Ethereum blockchainpursuant to a related ERC20 smart contract. Shortly before Mainnet Launch EXC Tokens will be permanently frozenand not capable of being used for any purpose in preparation for being converted into Eximcoins. Each EXC Tokenwill be automatically converted to one Eximcoin at MainnetLaunch.Total supply of EXC Tokens 75000000Fundraising target US$20m equivalentToken DistributionToken distributionSold during Token Sale 60000000Bonus Account (including airdrop) 15000000Sold during Token Sale No more than 60000000 EXC areto be sold to buyers. Each token will be sold for the ether equivalent of approximately US$0.33. There will be no bonus or discount available to contributors during the TokenSale.Bonus Account 15000000 EXC Tokens from the totalEXC Token supply will be allocated to a bonus account.Approximately 10% of the EXC Tokens in the bonus account will be allocated for an Airdrop as described below.The remaining EXC Tokens in the bonus account will bereserved for distribution by Eximchain in its discretion tomarketing and community partners during the EXC Tokengeneration event and participants in the Eximchain BountyProgram.Airdrop In conjunction with the private sale Eximchainplans to conduct an airdrop of EXC Tokens to persons whowere placed on a whitelist of persons who expressed an interest in purchasing EXC Tokens but who did not participatein the private sale. Eximchain will deliver a small quantityof EXC Tokens (valued at about US$200) to each such person for free.Conversion of EXC Tokens to EximcoinsShortly before Mainnet Launch the EXC Tokens will bepermanently frozen and not capable of being used or transferred for any purpose in preparation for being convertedinto Eximcoins. At Mainnet Launch all EXC Tokens willbe automatically converted to Eximcoins on a oneforonebasis. An additional 75000000 Eximcoins will also be created and distributed at Mainnet Launch as followso 30000000 Eximcoins will be allocated to a promotionalaccount that Eximchain will manage to promote the use ofthe platform by SMEs and early adopters to be selected byEximchain in its discretion over a 10year period. It is important that Eximchain token holders plan to use our supply chain solutions and participate in the early stages of theEximchain governance mechanism. Eximchain will distribute Eximcoins from the promotional account as an incentivefor early stage participants who will use the Eximchain platform to conduct contract negotiations build supply chainproducts and participate in network governance. SMEs interested in applying for tokens to cover development andprototype phases will need to sign a Commitment Letter orLetter of Intent to qualify.o 30000000 Eximcoins will be distributed to the Eximchain founding team and advisers.o 15000000 will be allocated to a reserve account thatEximchain will manage in its discretion to assure there aresu   cient Eximcoins in circulation for use on the platform.The Eximcoins allocated to the promotional account willbe locked (incapable of transfer or use) and will be unlockedduring the 10year period beginning at Mainnet Launch inequal monthly allotments.The Eximcoins distributed to Eximchain   s team and advisers will be locked and will be unlocked during the 4yearperiod beginning at Mainnet Launch in equal monthly allotments.10The Eximcoins distributed to the reserve account will belocked and will be unlocked at the end of the 2year periodbeginning at Mainnet Launch.Token Sale TimelineToken Sale Q1 2018Mainnet Launch and start token listing process Q1Q2 2018List tokens on multiple exchanges Q2Q3 2018Use of FundsEximchain intends to use the funds from the sale of EXCTokens at the Token Sale for the following primary purposesPlatform Development This includes maintaining competitive salaries for top talent in China and the U.S. paying forsoftware hosting accelerated development of legacy systemintegrations and acquisition of hardware. The hardware andhosting will be o   ered to anchor buyers and that will needstand alone computers to manage their respective supplychains on a global scale.Build the Supply Chain Ecosystem This includes e   ort toonboard SMEs through incentivizing early stage users andongoing business development to onboard suppliers buyersand    nanciers. Eximchain will reserve a proportion of tokensfor this purpose in a secured wallet to ensure fair distribution.Operational Expenses This includes basic operational costssuch as o   ce space legal costs to pursuing and obtaining required licenses and security measures.However Eximchain may in its discretion use those proceeds for any purpose whether or not consistent with theforegoing. Eximchain makes no undertaking representationor warranty in respect of its use of such proceeds.ParticipationEximcoins will only be minted in the genesis block associating them with the wallet addresses of the holders of EXCTokens. EXC Tokens will only be minted while the contractis active.The private sale registration was closed on Jan 11th 2018.In conjunction with the private sale a total US$500k worthof EXC Tokens are available for airdrop. Only participantson the whitelist can join the airdrop process. The Token Sale KYC process is scheduled to continue through to March2018. All participants in the Token Sale including airdropparticipants must complete our KYCAML process.The whitelist registration was closed on Jan 16th 2018.We invite engagement and dialog on our business modeland our ecosystem design. The opportunity that these technologies will unlock for businesses of all sizes is remarkableand we need public involvement to ful   ll that mission.To become a part of our community give us feedback onthe whitepaper or just to    nd out more about Eximchain Visit our website at www.eximchain.com .Join our Telegram channels.Follow us on Twitter.Or email us at hello@eximchain.com.11.

APPENDIXUse Case Example*MultiParty Dynamic ContractingInspired by the system proposed in    Optimal bilevel Stackelberg strategies for supply chain    nancing with both capitalconstrained buyers and sellers   [21] and    A partial credit guarantee contract in a capitalconstrained supply chain Financing equilibrium and coordinating strategy   [22] below weprovide an example of a Dynamic SCF system that can becreated through the Eximchain platform.In the supply chain    nancing system shown we formulatethe interactions between the capitalconstrained buyer (Retailer) the capitalconstrained supplier (Manufacturer) andthe    nancier (Bank) as privately executed smart contractsthat coordinate a bilevel Stackelberg game. The Bank actsas the leader in setting the    nancing rate for the Manufacturer and Retailer. The Manufacturer acts as the subleaderto make the best response according to Bank   s decision andto set the wholesale price for the Retailer at the same time. The Retailer acts as the follower to respond to both theBank and Manufacturer.Firstly the leader (Bank) will evaluate the Retailer   s andthe Manufacturer   s    nancing conditions (e.g. initial capitalbankruptcy risks and procurement/production quantities)and make optimal decisions to announce the interest rateRr and Rm respectively. Then in response to the Bankthe subleader (Manufacturer) will simultaneously update hisdecision and decide how much to charge the buyer for thewholesale price w. Acting as the follower the Retailer decides how much to order according to Bank   s interest rate13Rr and Manufacture   s wholesale price. To pursue the resultof the Stackelberg equilibrium Retailer and Manufacturerselect a bestreply policy denoted by (4) and (5).The model can be expressed as belowThe Eximchain ecosystem involves a single shared blockchain and a smart contract SDK. Besides the model mentioned above our software architecture is tailored to implementmany SCF products from basic components on our ecosystem. Ultimately developers can use our software to createvariations on Stackelberg Strategies or their own multi partySCF products.MOTIVATIONAs of writing large mining pools control and secure proofof work based blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum as thesystems shift toward transaction based economies and proofof stake respectively the    nancial incentive provided to devote a large amount of hash power or coin holdings to securethe network will drive decentralized networks into the palmsof a handful of mining pools. We believe it is important todistinguish the value these pools contribute to the chain bydevoting resources to add security to the network from thevalue developers contribute by adding novel functionality tothe ecosystem.Recent developments in permissionedDLT have enabledus to design novel consensus rules that allow for a fundamental change in the underlying incentive mechanism andactors that underlie the consensus protocol of permissionedpublic chains.We propose a system that grants developers and members of our Token Generation Event a privileged position inthe consensus protocol of the underlying blockchain incentivizing and funding developer pools to add functionality tothe system by allowing them to exclusively collect networkrewards at the protocol level from state changes driven byDapps on the network.Today* Ethereum and Bitcoin stakeholders (as a whole)keep miningrigs humming to the tune of $5M and $6M perday respectively. Bitcoin touted as the prime example ofsuccessful dPoW is majority controlled by a handful of mining pools with no roadmap to alleviate the centralizationof hash power. While the case is similar for Ethereum atpresent we will have to wait and see how their transitionto security deposit based dPoS will a   ect the distributionof block proposers and whether token holders begin to bondtheir ETH (which brings up peripheral concerns about illegitimate initial token holders who will have a huge incentive to raise as much ETH as possible).Hashrate Distribution  BTC March 2018Hashrate Distribution  ETH March 2018Considering a 66% attack is possible in both networks under collusion of less than 10 parties it becomes clearer thatthe security of these ecosystems are largely hinged on thebounties available to these miners each day none of whomcontribute to the codebase of the underlying system thatenables the creation of this value. The result is that miningpools have complete control over how the system evolves;in these networks developers are second class citizens constantly at risk of forks in a network that their applicationsclients and corporates rely on forks that are ultimately decided by the mining groups pro   ting from their innovationand market speculation. Perhaps due to the latter thesenetworks look more like security rackets every day whereeach additional dollar of network incentive gives you less security than the last dollar*. A new protocol is necessary toalign network incentives with those of developers clientsand corporates.*consider that only 5 months ago Ethereum miners were getting paid$500k/day to secure the network compared to today   s $5M/dayConsensus + Token FAQThe token functions to keep the network incentivized toparticipate in consensus and governance. Our native token   sprimary use is to pay gas a mechanism used to incentivize Block makers to process your transactions. Further allnodes registered to vote can make    passive income    (don   tparticularly love the term) by participating in governancesystem via quadratic voting. 1000 EXC min required to participate in consensus mechanism as a masternode but notethat this is not exactly PoS nodes can be voted o    the consensus mechanism irrespective of their wealth via quadraticvoting governance. Masternodes are required to have 1000EXC collateral a dedicated IP address and be able to run24 hours a day without a more than a 1 hr connection lossthey claim 100% of the transaction fees in blocks they make.14.
