Recognising the integral economic role of SMEs throughout the region the aim of this report is to identify how Caribbean businesses stand to bene\\xef\\xac\\x81t from the accelerating technological advances in \\xef\\xac\\x81nance.  The  report  synthesises  academic  literature  and  regional  surveys  to  highlight  the main factors that hinder SMEs from gaining access to traditional \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services particularly  loans  and  credit  from  Traditional  Incumbent  Banks  (TIBs).  These  are information  asymmetry  in  which  lenders  are  not  provided  with  suf\\xef\\xac\\x81cient  data  to accurately ascertain the risk of an applicant; the heavy dependence on collateral by TIBs to hedge risk of default; and the lack of Credit Reporting Agencies (CRAs) and information  sharing  arrangements  in  the  region.  As  the  Caribbean  moves  toward information digitisation one must consider with caution the presiding internetbased sharing  and  storage  of  information  which  has  disproportionately  problematic implications  for  SMEs.  It  is  evident  that  to  address  the  failures  of  the  Caribbean credit system a signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant dose of innovation is required.  In  recent  years  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  technology  (FinTech)  has  been  rapidly  expanding  the opportunities available for SMEs to access \\xef\\xac\\x81nance. Such advances are highlighted in  the  section  on  alternative  lines  of  credit  such  as  marketplace  lending  angel investing and crowdfunding. Alternative lenders differ from TIBs in their methods of assessing  risk  demonstrating  a  higher  degree  of  \\xef\\xac\\x82exibility  and  innovation.  Given the  dominance  of  TIBs  as  the  \\xef\\xac\\x81rstchoice  source  of  funding  the  report  aims  to promote the creation of a new system by which traditional and alternative lenders alike are better able to assess creditworthiness.  This  report  identi\\xef\\xac\\x81es  alternative  data  points  beyond  those  currently  assessed  by TIBs that are the most effective and ef\\xef\\xac\\x81cient indicators of creditworthiness. Three primary categories of information emerge when observing CRA and nontraditional lender  considerations  alternative  payment  data  social  data  and  psychometrics. Stakeholders have already used these alternative sources to determine whether the !7\\x0ccharacter  of  the  SME  or  individual  reliably  merits  their  services.  Incorporating  a wider array of data points directly addresses the transparency market failure and associated unfair credit allocation and has the potential to catalyse the growth of SMEs TIBs and the Caribbean as a whole.   The  main  criteria  in  assessing  the  most  viable  forms  of  alternative  data  are coverage  over  a  large  percentage  of  the  population  accuracy  regularity  and predictive capacity of desired outcomes. Alternative \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial payment data such as regular utility bill payments demonstrate a clear repayment capacity outside of previous banking. The combination of social media and mobile phone data covers all areas of an individual\'s life including social \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial and technical data and indicates repayment capacity through tracking of \\xe2\\x80\\x98digital footprints\\xe2\\x80\\x99. In the absence of  collateral  or  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  history  psychometric  testing  is  a  lowcost  way  to  make more information about the loan applicant available. These variables were selected based  on  their  consistent  popularity  across  case  studies  the  availability  of  the necessary  information  in  the  Caribbean  context  and  their  accuracy  in  informing creditworthiness.    Most importantly the report sets out the role that blockchain technology can play in devising  a  new  credential  management  system  that  will  aggregate  the aforementioned data points in the most secure innovative and costeffective way. We  propose  a  blockchainbased  SelfSovereign  Identi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation  (SSI)  system  to address the obstacles faced by SMEs in accessing \\xef\\xac\\x81nance. It would intercept the internet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  security  concerns  by  providing  incorruptible  controllable  and  portable creditworthiness  indicators  of  SMEs  for  banks  and  alternative  \\xef\\xac\\x81nanciers  alike. Fundamentally every incorporated person would hold ultimate authority over their own  data  meaning  that  they  have  the  bargaining  power  necessary  to  use  that record to maximise their own wellbeing. The \\xef\\xac\\x81nal section of this report highlights the ten de\\xef\\xac\\x81ning characteristics of SSI systems that can be summarised as security controllability and portability separating it from other blockchain solutions (Ferrarini 2017).  Finally  an  examination  of  algorithmic  human  rights  and  regulatory dimensions illustrate why a blockchainbased SSI solution is uniquely positioned to leapfrog the Caribbean economy (Ibid).  !8\\x0cThis research into the Caribbean has indicated that in order to advance the current credit system it is necessary to expand the networks of trust and facilitate greater data  sharing  of  the  right  type  of  data.  The  majority  of  alternative  data  points recommended are already in existence and thus must be effectively harnessed and aggregated to maximise their use to concerned parties. The application of a SSI system  will  require  blockchain  expertise  and  startup  capital  to  introduce  the necessary infrastructure. Broader efforts must also be made to further enhance the growing  blockchain  ecosystem  which  is  already  being  embraced  in  many Caribbean  countries.  Government  institutions  must  be  brought  in  as  partners  to provide both the adequate regulatory environments for data sharing as well as to support public education around FinTech and blockchain technology in particular. The potential users of this system including SMEs and the community at large will have  to  be  informed  of  the  value  of  participating  in  the  initial  stages  of implementation and possess full knowledge of their rights and options in granting information for assessment by creditors. \\xe2\\x80\\xa9!9\\x0cIntroduction \\tDuring the past decade economic growth in the Caribbean has stagnated causing declining productivity and competitiveness. Although small island economies and \\xef\\xac\\x81rms  struggle  with  sizespeci\\xef\\xac\\x81c  issues  such  as  diseconomies  of  scale  and indivisible \\xef\\xac\\x81xed costs the Caribbean\'s poor performance cannot be attributed to size alone. When compared to the ROSE countries with populations below three million  it  becomes  evident  that  the  Caribbean  suffers  from  a  particularly unfavourable business environment (Ruprah & Sierra 2016 2; IMF 2013a). The Caribbean economy is stunted by both exogenous and endogenous factors. Following  the  global  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  crisis  of  2008  the  trend  of  derisking  had  a detrimental  effect  on  the  region  destabilising  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  systems  slowing  growth and  limiting  innovation  (Williams  2017  8).  In  the  prolonged  aftermath correspondentbanking relationships fell by ten percent in 2016 (FSB 2017 2). This has  signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cantly  affected  economies  that  are  heavily  dependent  on  international trade such as Belize Barbados and St. Lucia (Torbati 2016). The threat of losing correspondent banking relationships has heightened the risk aversion of Caribbean TIBs  prompting  them  to  withdraw  accounts  and  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  services  to  customers deemed  high  risk.  Internal  policydriven  disadvantages  including  high  levels  of trade  protectionism  and  high  costs  of  labour  electricity  and  credit  cause  most Caribbean  countries  to  rank  poorly  on  the  WEF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Global  Competitiveness  Index (IMF 2013b 11).  As  SMEs  are  considered  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x98backbone\\xe2\\x80\\x99  of  the  economy  there  has  been  a preoccupation in fostering a more inclusive business climate. International regional and  local  actors  widely  encourage  entrepreneurship.  Their  initiatives  are  welltargeted  \\xe2\\x80\\x94  in  the  Caribbean  SMEs  constitute  69%  of  the  formal  sector  and contribute over 50% of GDP (Ruprah & Sierra 2016; CDB 2016). The majority of SMEs demonstrate high aspirations and potential to scale up and innovate but face substantial barriers (Dohnert Crespi & Maf\\xef\\xac\\x81oli 2017). The LACES and PROTEqIN surveys  identify  access  to  \\xef\\xac\\x81nance  as  the  most  prominent  limitation  to  \\xef\\xac\\x81rms\' productivity (Morris 2017 29). Increasing investment in SMEs could translate this potential into growth greater ef\\xef\\xac\\x81ciency increased competitiveness and economic diversi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation. While  there  are  several  channels  to  access  \\xef\\xac\\x81nance  in  the  Caribbean  for  formal sector growth and innovation TIBs are considered the most reliable source of loans !10\\x0c(Holden  &  Howell  2009  6).  However  SMEs  are  subject  to  high  interest  rates  to compensate  for  their  perceived  riskiness  owing  to  both  their  inability  to  provide reliable  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  information  and  assets  and  the  weak  legal  enforcement mechanisms in cases of default (Ibid14; Mohan et al. 2017 19; Morris 2017 31). To  this  end  new  and  innovative  ways  for  assessing  creditworthiness  are  being explored  around  the  world.  In  particular  three  primary  categories  of  information have  seen  positive  results  alternative  payment  data  social  data  and psychometrics. Using one or a combination of these components credit scores are being  calculated  and  provided  to  banks  helping  them  to  decrease  borrowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 portfolio  risk  and  to  increase  their  loan  portfolios  thus  making  the  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial environment  more  inclusive.  Currently  the  disaggregated  way  in  which  these alternative  data  are  available  complicates  the  process  of  determining creditworthiness.  With  these  new  avenues  of  assessing  creditworthiness  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  macroeconomic prosperity is increasingly subject to their ability to protect their data as it is the very instrument that leverages their access to credit. LAC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internet user population is growing  more  quickly  than  any  other  in  the  world  with  147  million  users  in  2013 (Anon. 2014). An increased incidence of cybercrime brings into question whether the internet is even equipped to share and store sensitive information. 77% of cyber attackers explicitly prey on SMEs as they are \\xe2\\x80\\x9ceasier targets\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (65% have no data security in place) \\xe2\\x80\\x9clow risk high return\\xe2\\x80\\x9d ventures outdated in their data protection systems and unaware of the real risk posed by hackers (Anon. 2016). The present internetbased system has problematic implications for Caribbean SME access to credit.  SME access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance stands to improve drastically with accelerating technological advances  in  the  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  services  industry.  Over  the  past  decade  FinTech  has successfully  created  faster  capital  markets  economic  growth  and  formalisation. Blockchain a type of DLT is an unprecedented platform to transparently record and store incorruptible information. It cannot be emphasised enough that the distributed nature of blockchain is advantageous beyond the usertouser veri\\xef\\xac\\x81cation process. It  lends  itself  to  greater  resistance  to  attacks  as  there  is  no  one  repository  of information  and  greater  resilience  of  personhood  as  attribute  information  from different providers can be synthesised. Even if providers were to log information on different  blockchains  superimposed  layers  can  establish  interoperability  for seamless  data  integration.  An  additional  advantage  of  the  usertoviewer  sharing !11\\x0cprocess is that of zeroknowledge technology. This means that a lender can have full con\\xef\\xac\\x81dence in whether or not a user meets a speci\\xef\\xac\\x81c lending criterion without having  seen  any  personal  details  that  support  how  they  meet  the  condition. Blockchain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  compatibility  with  data  minimisation  protocol  means  increased  user privacy  addressing  regulatory  and  human  rights  concerns.  Most  revolutionarily blockchain  has  the  potential  to  back  a  SSI  system.  A  SSI  system  grants entrepreneurs complete control over their identity so that they may disclose with maximum  privacy  alternative  information  that  accurately  demonstrates creditworthiness.\\xc2\\xa0 Just  as  the  internet  communicates  information  blockchain  communicates  value. Newcomers  to  the  technology  may  associate  it  with  Bitcoin  a  type  of cryptocurrency. While most blockchains today are associated with mining a digital currency Blockchain 1.0 records cryptocurrency exchanges while Blockchain 2.0 and 3.0 record all other value exchanges that can be digitised economic and social transactions respectively. Our proposed SSI system will run on Blockchain 2.0 and 3.0  of  which  there  are  several  leading  platforms.  A  common  misperception  of blockchain  is  that  it  is  a  glori\\xef\\xac\\x81ed  database  but  it  is  operationally  different  and superior  for  security  purposes.  It  is  a  distributed  peertopeer  platform  meaning transactions are never stored in a centralised reserve. Its distributed nature does not  compromise  privacy.  Blockchains  can  be  any  combination  of  characteristics between  permissioned  or  permissionless  (with  respect  to  users)  and  public  or private (with respect to viewers). Transactions added to the blockchain are hashed into an algorithm before being launched for crowdsourced veri\\xef\\xac\\x81cation. In this way entities  called  miners  who  verify  transactions  through  a  \\xef\\xac\\x81nanciallyincentivised consensus process interact with encrypted information rather than humanreadable content (See Appendix 2 regarding energy consumption concerns). Once validated and  digitally  signed  transactions  are  grouped  into  blocks.  The  blocks  are  linked into  a  chain  by  algorithms  called  cryptographic  hash  functions.  These  hash functions  feed  forward  one  into  another  but  cannot  be  undone.  Thus  they  are tamperproof and incorruptible. In other words to add information to a blockchain asset features are distributed timestamped validated and situated within history. Blockchain  is  able  to  operate  so  uniquely  because  of  digital  signatures  hashes and consensus protocols (Campos 2018).\\xe2\\x80\\xa9!12\\x0cMethodology  The scope of the project is limited to the 13 territories (Appendix 3) as identi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed by CC but elements could be extrapolated to other regions of the world. The paper is grounded  in  regional  primary  surveys  that  expose  underlying  problems  in  the Caribbean  business  environment  and  is  supported  by  academic  literature international organisations\\xe2\\x80\\x99 reports and private sector white papers. To supplement and  update  the  \\xef\\xac\\x81ndings  interviews  were  conducted  with  practitioners  and academics in the \\xef\\xac\\x81eld.  First  this  report  parses  out  key  issues  within  access  to  \\xef\\xac\\x81nance.  It  also  identi\\xef\\xac\\x81es universallyheld problems with data security on the internet that given the lack of a legacy internetbased \\xef\\xac\\x81nance system the region has the opportunity to overcome and circumvent.  Second the report identi\\xef\\xac\\x81es three categories of information that various companies are already using to accurately indicate a \\xef\\xac\\x81rm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability and willingness to pay. These three categories emerged from a comprehensive literature review and were af\\xef\\xac\\x81rmed through  conversations  with  practitioners.  Today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  FinTech  companies  aggregate thousands  of  data  points  and  assess  them  through  algorithmic  calculations  and machine  learning.  Thus  the  variables  we  present  have  been  selected  based  on three  factors  their  consistent  popularity  across  case  studies  their  accuracy  in informing  creditworthiness  and  the  availability  of  the  required  information  in  the Caribbean context. Due to the limited use of ecommerce in the territories observed this data point was omitted from our research. Finally we propose the use of blockchain technology partly inspired by the recent upsurge  in  popularity  in  the  Caribbean  but  mostly  owing  to  its  unique characteristics of transparency security and privacy. Due to the nascent nature of blockchain  technology  many  use  cases  are  still  in  the  inception  or  pilot  phases therefore  the  discussions  around  its  application  in  the  Caribbean  remain speculative. Based on white paper and websites examinations of a wide range of blockchain  solutions  we  recommend  a  SSI  system  as  the  foundation  for  the incorporation of nontraditional data in loan application decisions.  !13\\x0cOne  limitation  of  the  study  was  the  restricted  access  to  information  on  CC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  13 territories  which  many  regional  groupings  such  as  LAC  tend  to  exclude. Nonetheless  the  literature  on  LAC  is  encouraging  as  there  is  a  similar  focus  on increasing lines of credit speci\\xef\\xac\\x81cally to SMEs in comparison to other regions. The heterogeneity  of  the  Caribbean  region  also  means  that  greater  contextspeci\\xef\\xac\\x81c research is required to fully understand the nuances of SME pro\\xef\\xac\\x81les and the ease of implementing  such  technologies  in  each  of  the  territories  with  regards  to infrastructure and regulatory environments. \\xe2\\x80\\xa9!14\\x0cKey Problems in Access to Finance for Formal SMEs  Asymmetric Information\\xe2\\x80\\xa9Literature on SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance has long pinned down asymmetric information  as  the  culprit  behind  the  \\xef\\xac\\x81nance  gap  (Diamond  1984  394). Several  factors  hinder  lenders  from  ascertaining  a  small  \\xef\\xac\\x81rm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  ability  and willingness to pay as identi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed by Moro et al. (2014 526) primarily a \\xef\\xac\\x81rm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s apprehension  to  disclose  information  due  their  desire  to  maintain  control; disclosure requirements that vary according to the type of \\xef\\xac\\x81nance; differing accounting  standards  and  taxation  strategies;  and  the  limited  predictive capacity  of  retrospective  public  information  available.  Less  information available  on  a  borrower  translates  into  a  higher  risk  for  the  lender.  Thus TIBs either deny credit or exaggerate the cost of \\xef\\xac\\x81nance through elevated interest rates to hedge themselves against risk. SMEs in their vast majority cannot  afford  such  loan  spreads  (Ketterer  2017).  The  rami\\xef\\xac\\x81cations  of imperfect  information  reverberate  beyond  individual  SMEs  missed economic  opportunities  stunt  national  economic  growth.  Reducing information  asymmetry  would  have  substantial  multiplier  effects  banks would  lower  defaults  worthy  entrepreneurs  would  access  \\xef\\xac\\x81nance  more easily and business growth would provide macroeconomic stability (Moro et al. 2014 526).  Heavy Dependence on CollateralCollateral  is  \\xe2\\x80\\x9can  asset  that  serves  as  security  against  counterparty risk\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (Anderson  &  Joeveer  2014  50).  In  the  context  of  asymmetric information and moral hazard collateral requirements bring the interests of the borrower in line with those of banks (Godlewski & Weill 2011). Collateral is  also  viewed  as  a  sorting  device  wherein  lowrisk  borrowers  are  more likely  to  take  a  loan  against  collateral  while  highrisk  borrowers  knowing they  are  more  likely  to  default  are  reluctant  to  offer  collateral  against borrowing (Cowling 2012).  !15\\x0cConcerns  have  been  raised  in  several  theoretical  papers  that  highlight \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunfair  credit  allocations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (Coco  &  Pignataro  2013)  related  to  the  use  of collateral  as  a  determinant  for  accessing  secured  loans  (Anderson  & Joeveer  2014;  Coco  2000;  Coco  &  Pignataro  2014;  Besanko  &  Thakor 1987).  For  example  if  collateral  requirements  are  inversely  related  to interest rates lowrisk borrowers are led to select contracts with low interest rates and high collateral requirements and highrisk borrowers opt for the inverse (Besanko & Thakor 1987 672). As a result lowrisk borrowers who do not have suf\\xef\\xac\\x81cient collateral become creditrationed and are unable to access secured loans. This results in an inequitable distribution of credit in which poor goodquality entrepreneurs are excluded from the market. The structural  inef\\xef\\xac\\x81ciency  present  in  the  collateral  system  inhibits  SMEs  from accessing the necessary resources to catalyse their growth. Another  body  of  work  critically  examines  the  relationship  between  wealth and  entrepreneurial  ability.  Entrepreneurial  abilities  are  not  dependent  on wealth but rather on academic and jobrelated aspects of human capital (Cowling et al. 2003). Thus capable entrepreneurs who have inadequate assets  struggle  to  ful\\xef\\xac\\x81l  their  potential  while  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  institutions  lose  the opportunity to grow their customer base by excluding viable borrowers who otherwise  may  have  even  become  lifelong  clients.  It  is  evident  that  the present  dependence  on  collateral  is  a  poor  crutch  in  the  absence  of  a robust  alternative  system.  This  market  failure  has  particularly  detrimental effects in emerging economies and must be tackled if economic growth in the Caribbean is to accelerate.  Women  entrepreneurs  face  greater  dif\\xef\\xac\\x81culties  in  accessing  \\xef\\xac\\x81nance  than men in addition to the challenges described above (Ghosh et al. 2017; GPFI IFC 2011; Ahmad & Arif 2015; Richardson et al. 2004). Access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance  has  notably  been  identi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed  as  the  major  constraint  that  explains why  in  emerging  markets  women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  enterprises  experience  signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cantly lower  average  growth  rates  than  those  run  by  men  (Ahmad  &  Arif  2015 635).  This  disparity  has  been  linked  to  \\xef\\xac\\x81rm  size  as  women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  businesses tend to be from smaller and slowergrowing sectors \\xe2\\x80\\x93 as opposed to gaps in actual  gender  performance  (Bardasi  et  al.  2011).  Loan  of\\xef\\xac\\x81cers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 !16\\x0cperceptions of women entrepreneurs as presenting a slow or low return on loans or as less likely to succeed represent substantial barriers to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance (Veena  et  al.  2012;  Richardson  et  al.  2004).  Alternatively  some  female entrepreneurs  are  less  likely  to  seek  a  loan  than  their  male  counterparts (Bardasi et al. 2011). Unfortunately even when they are able to receive a loan  the  amount  can  be  insuf\\xef\\xac\\x81cient  (Ghosh  et  al.  2017  2).  These institutionalised inequalities at the macro and household levels encumber women entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to gain access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance (Mayoux 2001 52). This  is  another  market  failure  that  is  largely  impeding  the  pathway  to success for the Caribbean\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emerging economies. The regulatory frameworks in the Caribbean for private property pose major challenges for the use of collateral compared to most industrial countries (Holden & Howell 2009). In particular besides the use of \\xef\\xac\\x81xed property for collateral  the  use  of  moveable  property  as  collateral  is  in  most  cases impossible. On a similar note the legal bodies that can pledge collateral are also limited. Additionally the Companies Acts which operates across many  Caribbean  countries  requires  that  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompanies  pledge  their  entire asset  base  to  one  lender\\xe2\\x80\\xa6  making  it  costly  for  borrowers  to  switch lenders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Ibid 16) thus disincentivising bank competition. Such regulations represent  an  additional  obstacle  to  the  general  problems  associated  with collateral.  Lack of Credit Reporting SystemsCredit reporting plays an essential role in reducing information asymmetries and  circumventing  collateral  requirements.  CRAs  can  be  public  (credit registries)  or  private  but  publicly  regulated  (credit  bureaus).  They  collect \\xef\\xac\\x81le  and  distribute  information  voluntarily  supplied  by  their  members  and operate  on  the  principle  of  reciprocity;  lenders  who  provide  data  are granted  access  to  the  CRA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  \\xef\\xac\\x81les  (Jappelli  &  Pagano  1993  1693). Information sharing is essential to build trust and is a prerequisite for an advanced  credit  system.  There  is  great  incentive  to  create  CRAs  where lenders are confronted by large numbers of customers on whom they have no  previous  information  characteristic  of  less  developed  countries  (Ibid 1714). Transparent credit information can raise the portfolio quality of loan !17\\x0capplicants  deter  negligent  borrower  behaviour  and  ultimately  lower  the cost  of  credit.  The  most  advanced  informationsharing  arrangements include both positive and negative borrower data including all repayment history  not  only  defaults.  The  potential  of  CRAs  to  improve  access  to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance  is  considerable.  According  to  IFC  studies  on  5000  \\xef\\xac\\x81rms  in  51 countries  the  percentage  of  \\xef\\xac\\x81rms  complaining  of  constraints  in  obtaining \\xef\\xac\\x81nance declined from 49% to 27% after credit bureaus began operations in their regions (World Bank Group 2010).An  ef\\xef\\xac\\x81cient  and  inclusive  credit  reporting  system  instead  of  relying exclusively  on  pledged  physical  collateral  would  allow  lenders  to  base credit decisions on \\xe2\\x80\\x9creputational collateral\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the advantage of people with a strong borrowing history but few physical assets who would otherwise be unable to access loans from TIBs (Ibid 2010). Limited progress has been made in the Caribbean within the last decade. In 2010  both  Jamaica  and  Guyana  passed  credit  reporting  legislation. However according to the World Bank Doing Business data in 2017 0% of the  adult  populations  of  Antigua  and  Barbuda  the  Bahamas  Barbados Belize Grenada St. Lucia St. Vincent and the Grenadines and Suriname are covered by credit bureaus (World Bank 2017). Amongst the Compete Caribbean  members  only  Guyana  Jamaica  and  Trinidad  and  Tobago (52% 24% and 75% respectively) have coverage of credit bureaus (Ibid). Ramos (2009) indicates that several factors inhibit the presence of CRAs in the region primarily \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The  high  startup  costs  may  be  dif\\xef\\xac\\x81cult  to  justify  if  the  country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population is small. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Banks  and  credit  unions  within  a  country  may  not  have  a  strong tradition of structured information sharing. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Many  countries  may  lack  the  necessary  software  infrastructure  to support such a system.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 While regional cooperation could leverage economies of scale the heterogeneity  of  legal  frameworks  impedes  \\xef\\xac\\x81les  sharing  across borders. !18\\x0cIn  order  to  establish  an  ef\\xef\\xac\\x81cient  credit  reporting  system  throughout  the Caribbean the IFC recommends the following factors for success building awareness  in  the  community  establishing  an  appropriate  legal  and regulatory framework gathering support from market participants ensuring commercial  viability  training  regulators  and  identifying  appropriate operators  (including  technology  solutions  and  software)  and  housing  a wide  spectrum  of  data  that  is  relevant  accurate  complete  and  updated regularly (World Bank Group 2010).  Despite the indisputable importance of CRAs their internetbased means of collecting  and  sharing  information  makes  their  data  stores  vulnerable  to attack. Scandals such as Equifax\\xe2\\x80\\x99s data compromise of 148 million people (collectively  costing  consumers  $4.1  billion)  or  Yahoo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  hacked  3  billion users  indicate  the  need  for  more  secure  data  sharing  methods  (Sovrin Foundation  2018).  Given  that  the  Caribbean  does  not  have  a  legacy infrastructure  of  CRAs  it  is  advised  to  critically  evaluate  and  even circumvent the insecure foundation upon which they have run. Present Data Insecurity on the Internet SMEs  are  simultaneously  the  most  vulnerable  and  unprepared  when  it comes to data breaches (Steven 2017) both at the compromise points of CRAs  and  their  own  information  stores.  This  issue  is  particularly  worth consideration as LAC boasts the fastest growing internet user population in the world (Anon. 2014). Cybercrime is on the rise and there is a need for a coordinated  datastore  system  to  assess  creditworthiness.  The  general trajectory of information communication between lenders and borrowers has been to digitise it on the internet. Problematically however insecurity is bydefault designed into how the internet works.  SME Vulnerability to CybercrimeThe  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  stable  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  health  and  ability  to  repay  and  access  future loans is in large part contingent upon data security. Data breaches cause \\xe2\\x80\\x9creputational damage loss of trust and longterm loss of customers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to the extent  that  a  breach  would  discourage  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnearly  two  out  of  three  (64%) consumers\\xe2\\x80\\xa6 from using an SME again\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Experian 2016). Paradoxically not !19\\x0conly do SMEs underestimate direct costs by over 40% but the vast majority of SMEs (three of four) do not even consider data breaches to be a threat (Ibid). The 2017 results of the Hiscox Cyber Readiness Report estimate that cybercrime  and  data  breaches  drain  $450  billion  on  the  global  economy every  year  (Sovrin  Foundation  2018).  SMEs  only  stand  to  lose  with  the increasingly frequent data breaches. Internet Insecurity by DesignData breaches can be attributed to the centralisation of digital control \\xe2\\x80\\x93 a feature  of  standard  databases  and  internetbased  activity  but  not blockchainbased systems. The standard veri\\xef\\xac\\x81cation method (to prove that entities are who they say they are) has been a protocol called Public Key Infrastructure (PKI) that includes a set of rules on certi\\xef\\xac\\x81cates called X.509 (Allen  et  al.  2015).  In  PKI  each  internet  entity  has  a  key  pair  that  are algorithmically  related  the  public  key  (used  to  encrypt  information)  can unlock  the  corresponding  private  key  (used  to  digitally  sign  information) (Microsoft n.d.). To check that a connection is secure between two internet entities  a  third  party  called  a  Certi\\xef\\xac\\x81cate  Authority  (CA)  moderates  the exchange of public keys. The originator encrypts the information using the CA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  public  key  before  sending  it  to  the  CA.  The  CA  can  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csign\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  the information using their private key and generate a new certi\\xef\\xac\\x81cate. The CA has  veri\\xef\\xac\\x81ed  that  the  identity  of  both  the  originator  and  the  information recipient. As  it  stands  only  a  few  CAs  arbitrate  all  of  the  world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  clicks  and  digital communications  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  in  fact  most  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIT  Services  userfacing  services\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  are veri\\xef\\xac\\x81ed  by  only  two  companies  (GlobalSign  &  Comodo)  (Oxford  2017). While only several hundred Certi\\xef\\xac\\x81cate Authorities (CAs) exist to verify that a connection is secure (Sovrin Foundation 2018) their ranks are in no way comparable  to  the  vastness  of  the  internet  and  the  gravity  of  their responsibility they uphold. However browsers would not be able to handle any more CAs (Ibid). By design default the power to deem whether or not an entity can be trusted is highly concentrated.  Given  that  hackers  need  only  target  a  single  body  inherently  any communication  on  the  internet  is  vulnerable  to  maninthemiddle  (MITM) !20\\x0cattacks  (Allen  et.  al  2015).  Corrupt  entities  can  maliciously  leech information or lure users into scams by duping CAs with false certi\\xef\\xac\\x81cates. Likewise  CAs  could  make  a  mistake  or  go  out  of  business.  Corruptibility and fallibility intersects with all piecemeal fractions of an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s online identity.  Usernames  otherwise  called  namespaces  are  merely \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadministrative constructions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that are not even owned by the websites they occupy (Searls 2012). Rather \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdigital identities are owned by CAs domain registrars and individual sites and then rented to users or revoked at any time\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (Allen  et  al.  2015).  The  SME  thus  is  exposed  to  threats  from  many angles but has no way to effectively manage (or know) what information is sourced. The internet\\xe2\\x80\\x99s structure is unsecure liable to attacks and from a user  control  perspective  morally  unsound.  It  is  time  for  a  new  model  of identity control. !21\\x0cLines of Credit Banks as a Line of Credit\\xe2\\x80\\xa9Despite the universal problems that SMEs face in accessing \\xef\\xac\\x81nance banks are  still  the  most  popular  source  of  formal  credit  primarily  due  to  their prestige  and  the  lack  of  public  knowledge  regarding  alternative  forms  of \\xef\\xac\\x81nance (OECD 2015). Problems in accessing \\xef\\xac\\x81nance are exacerbated with weak  legal  and  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  institutions  that  dissuade  \\xef\\xac\\x81rms  from  accessing formal  bank  \\xef\\xac\\x81nance  (Beck  &  DemirgucKunt  2006;  Beck  et  al.  2008). When excluded from the formal system they often turn to predatory informal lenders such as payday lenders. To help \\xef\\xac\\x81ll the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing gap many banks have also tried alternative means of debt \\xef\\xac\\x81nance such as leasing factoring and trade \\xef\\xac\\x81nance. Such tools have been successful in certain sectors and regions (Beck & Cull 2014) but are reliant on established enterprises with assets and liquidity. To this end banks in emerging markets have intensi\\xef\\xac\\x81ed their  involvement  in  SME  lending  with  the  creation  of  new  technologies business models and risk management systems (de la Torre et al. 2010). However these new technologies have created many of the problems that SMEs face in borrowing. There is fear that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew normal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d will be one of credit  scarcity  for  businesses  if  banks  persist  with  their  archaic  tools (OECD 2015 18). Alternative Lines of CreditIt  is  estimated  that  half  of  all  SMEs  have  unmet  credit  needs  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  to  the cumulative  note  of  2  trillion  USD  (SMEFinanceForum  2017  2).  The disconnect between TIBs and SMEs in large part due to the lack of CRAs leaves many \\xef\\xac\\x81rms disenfranchised from the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial system. In pursuit of funding unattainable from TIBs SMEs can access \\xef\\xac\\x81nance through personal relationships investors or alternative lenders.  Equity \\xef\\xac\\x81nance is not appropriate for the majority of SMEs though it can be a popular  form  of  funding  for  startups  and  servicebased  enterprises.  This line  of  credit  relies  on  professional  private  investors  to  provide  seed  or venture  funding  with  stakeholder  buyin.  Such  funding  uniquely  nurtures high risk enterprises through investor expertise. Angel investment initiatives !22\\x0chave been popular in Jamaica with a number of programs such as First Angels Jamaica Alpha Angels and the World Bank and Caribbean Exportbacked LINKCaribbean (Divakaran et al. 2016; InfoDev 2016). However equity funding is the least favourable route for SMEs as many owners lack experience in negotiating fair terms and have a general opinion that equity investors are greedy (Kent Baker et al 2017). The trend is mirrored in LAC according  to  LACES  (2010)  as  equity  or  sale  of  stock  investment  only makes up 4.5% of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing sources.  Alternative  \\xef\\xac\\x81nance  can  be  de\\xef\\xac\\x81ned  as  channels  of  \\xef\\xac\\x81nance  that  emerge outside  of  the  regulated  banking  system  (Wardrop  et  al.  2016).  Online alternative \\xef\\xac\\x81nance has emerged as a solution to the market failure of TIBs and  credit  unions  to  serve  the  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  demands  of  the  underbanked community. It can encompass both debt and equity \\xef\\xac\\x81nance but lacks many of the regulations and standards applied to traditional \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing. In 2015 the online alternative \\xef\\xac\\x81nance market continued its rapid growth across the Americas generating a total market volume of $36.49 billion (Ibid 24). Most online alternative \\xef\\xac\\x81nance methods are investorled and can be referred to as  marketplace  lending  (MPL)  which  encompasses  a  variety  of  lending technologies including crowdfunding and peertopeer. This form of lending tends to be unsecured and will usually rely on a number of investors online. In LAC 70% of the overall online alternative \\xef\\xac\\x81nance market was attributed to business \\xef\\xac\\x81nance (Ibid 44). This endorsement by businesses emphasises the structural issues that prevent growth of SMEs in the traditional system. Alternative  lenders  such  as  CariLend  and  Term  Finance  are  already addressing  the  concerns  of  underserved  credit  consumers  in  the Caribbean.  Due to the lack of hard information available to alternative lenders investors have had to engage in a certain degree of innovation to assess credit risk and  provide  loans  to  SMEs  previously  rejected  by  banks  through  a frictionless online platform. Alternative lenders unlike TIBs are not loaning the  money  of  unknowing  depositors  and  can  be  more  \\xef\\xac\\x82exible  with  their requirements. However not wanting to be left behind banks have partnered up  with  alternative  lending  platforms.  Santander  UK  and  Funding  Circle !23\\x0chave  partnered  to  mutually  refer  applicants  to  each  other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  platforms (Dunkley  2016).  A  number  of  collaborations  with  TIBs  have  occurred  in different regions and are an encouraging sign that banks are open to these competitors  in  the  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  space.  Despite  their  increase  in  global popularity MPLs come with risks such as online fraud user data privacy and  unpro\\xef\\xac\\x81tability  of  businesses  (Ventura  et  al.  2015).  Moreover  the alternative lines of credit in the Caribbean have been unable to meet the loan  demands  of  SMEs.  The  uncertainty  of  formal  protections  and regulations in this space mean that TIBs are still considered a \\xef\\xac\\x81rstchoice destination for SMEs (Alibhai et al. 2017).\\xe2\\x80\\xa9!24\\x0cAlternative Data Given  the  disparate  hard  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  data  available  the  incorporation  of  alternative data  that  informs  creditworthiness  can  provide  a  more  nuanced  view  of  potential borrowers  mirroring  the  holistic  relationship  between  lender  and  borrower  that  is characteristic of relationship banks. Three primary categories of information emerge when observing CRA and nontraditional lender considerations alternative payment data social data and psychometrics. Taken on their own or in unique combinations stakeholders have already used these alternative sources to determine whether the character  of  the  SME  or  individual  reliably  merits  their  services.  Incorporating alternative  indicators  of  creditworthiness  directly  addresses  the  transparency market failure and associated insurmountable preloan requirements to the catalytic growth of SMEs TIBs and the Caribbean region as a whole. Many lenders have already begun to use alternative data to evaluate thin\\xef\\xac\\x81le or no\\xef\\xac\\x81le consumers. According to a 2015 survey of 317 lenders 87% used alternative data or any information that is not captured by a traditional credit score including property tax and deed records checking and debit account and payday lending information  (TransUnion  2016).  Their  incorporation  of  such  data  reveals  broader problems nearly threequarters cited increasing dif\\xef\\xac\\x81culty \\xef\\xac\\x81nding and acquiring new customers  competition  with  lower  lending  rates  of  other  companies  and consumers with acceptable credit scores becoming saturated with offers (Ibid). There  are  several  criteria  that  must  be  met  when  evaluating  the  usefulness  and applicability of alternative sources of data (Carroll & Rehmani 20179). A new data source will ideally \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Have broad and consistent coverage \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Contain detailed data elements about an individual (such as ontime and late payments over a signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cant time series) \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Be accurate and frequently updated \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Have a system for ongoing data veri\\xef\\xac\\x81cation and management \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Contain information relevant to the behaviour being predicted \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Be additive to the predictive accuracy of traditional CRA data  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Comply with existing regulations for consumer credit !25\\x0cAlternative Payment DataOne  of  the  most  promising  data  sets  stems  from  nontraditional  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services  that  incur  payment  obligations  not  typically  reported  in  the standardised  way.  Examples  include  regular  bill  payments  from telecommunications  utilities  and  rental  properties  and  even  alternative lending payments (e.g. payday instalment loan renttoown). Such sources demonstrate a clear repayment capacity outside of previous banking. As  aforementioned  the  world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  major  CRAs  have  already  begun incorporating  this  type  of  data.  Experian  (2014)  studied  how  the  positive payment  history  data  from  energyutility  companies  would  impact  the thickness of the consumer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit \\xef\\xac\\x81le (measured by the number of trades on  \\xef\\xac\\x81le).  Findings  showed  that  the  inclusion  of  positive  energyutility  trade lines  led  to  20%  of  thin\\xef\\xac\\x81le  consumers  in  the  study\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  sample  population migrating to the thick\\xef\\xac\\x81le category while thick \\xef\\xac\\x81les representing consumers with  \\xef\\xac\\x81ve  or  more  trade  lines  on  \\xef\\xac\\x81le  increased  from  55%  to  64%  of  the sample population. Consumers previously absent from the Experian credit database were able to leverage the existence of this alternative data trade line to begin building credit history. The ability for many consumers to build a  more  robust  credit  \\xef\\xac\\x81le  and  migrate  to  a  better  risk  segment  simply  by regularly paying their energy bill on time shows that there is an opportunity and  even  a  responsibility  for  energy  companies  to  help  their  consumers build  credit  history.  The  TransUnion  Credit  report  system  in  Trinidad  has already begun incorporating payment records from the national electricity retailer. Given that in most Caribbean islands there is only one often stateowned electricity provider data sharing coordination to this end should be relatively streamlined.  Experian was also the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst major CRA to incorporate positive rental payment data  through  RentBureau  a  data  arrangement  which  allows  rental payments  to  be  systematically  recorded  and  made  available  to  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services  \\xef\\xac\\x81rms.  In  an  Experian  study  simulating  rent  reporting  11%  of subsidised housing residents did not have a credit \\xef\\xac\\x81le but all transitioned to the thin\\xef\\xac\\x81le category once rental trade lines were incorporated and 23% of !26\\x0cthin\\xef\\xac\\x81le  residents  moved  to  the  thick\\xef\\xac\\x81le  category  (Experian  2015  2). Though rental payment can demonstrate a   consistent pattern of relatively large payments this market is far less concentrated than utilities. Given that landlords  represent  a  wider  pool  of  stakeholders  this  would  increase coordination costs and make data collection less feasible.  Credit scores are not without implication however and their accuracy and use  must  be  considered.  There  is  a  risk  that  the  credit  invisible  may  be better off without a credit score that can expose them to deepening forms of economic or \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial disenfranchisement (Aitken 2017 289). Thus beyond thin  to  thick  \\xef\\xac\\x81le  conversions  the  information  must  be  uptodate  and con\\xef\\xac\\x81dential. Data access is key in the use of non\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial payment streams (Ibid 283). Paying for data is usually the simplest way to gain access but this is not always ideal insofar as it increases costs. Furthermore payment information is owned by entities that are not allowed or incentivised to share it even with their customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 consent (Baer Goland & Schiff 2013).  Accounting Certi\\xef\\xac\\x81catesAccounting  certi\\xef\\xac\\x81cates  are  another  form  of  alternative  data  that  indicate \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial savviness. The pressing need to improve \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial education has been  widely  acknowledged  and  has  manifested  in  LAC  through  CEMLA\\xe2\\x80\\x99s annual Conference on Economic and Financial Education in Latin America and the Caribbean. SMEs suffer from low levels of \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial literacy which affects their ability to decide on appropriate sources of funding respond to the due diligence requirements  negotiate the terms and structuring of the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancing and manage accounts (Atkinson 2017). There is an opportunity for  an  organisation  like  Compete  Caribbean  to  issue  standardised  online \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  literacy  courses  that  would  result  in  certi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation  that  could  be added to an individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s or SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit pro\\xef\\xac\\x81le.  Mobile and Social DataIncreased  global  ICT  usage  offers  an  explosion  of  data  for  extrapolation. When  combined  the  internet  social  media  platforms  and  mobile  phones !27\\x0cleave \\xe2\\x80\\x98digital footprints\\xe2\\x80\\x99 that blueprint the behaviour patterns of individuals (Kumar & Muhota 2012). The combination of data covers all areas of an individual\'s  life  including  social  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  and  technical  patterns.  It  can present  itself  in  the  form  of  airtime  topup  payments  information  on outgoing and incoming calls and texts mobile internet usage epayments and transactions through mobile wallets and valueadded services such as textmessage subscriptions or downloads.\\xe2\\x80\\xa8Prepaid  mobiles  and  phone  history  are  effective  sources  of  realtime \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial information about an individual\'s spending habits. Information on the regularity and amount of credit paid for can be used to determine the \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial stability of an individual. Assumptions about employment type can also be made from such information. For example an individual that tops up a large amount once a week suggests regular salaried work whereas small but  frequent  amounts  indicates  a  \\xef\\xac\\x82exible  possibly  informal  worker (Scharwatt et al. 2014). Phone call information such as how often a user makes rather than receives calls the length of the conversation and the time  of  day  that  calls  are  made  can  all  be  effective  predictors  of creditworthiness  (McEvoy  n.d.).  Mobile  phone  activity  is  already  being collected by networks and operators at a relatively low cost and provides a rich  history  of  both  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  and  non\\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  information  that  credit bureaus  or  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  institutions  cannot  access  (Bjorkegren  &  Grissen 2018  3).  The  success  of  MPesa  propelled  the  use  of  mobile  money payments and transfers into the spotlight opening up another data channel that  predicts  repayment  behaviours  (Hieminga  Land  &  Nijboer  2016). Much of this information looks at the frequency of activities and from that determines  your  reliability  or  ability  to  repay  loans.  Mobile  information requires collaboration with telecoms operators and mobile money platforms. \\xe2\\x80\\xa8Social data can provide an even richer dataset on a borrower. It includes both  social  media  information  such  as  existing  relationships  and  size  of networks  and  other  online  information  such  as  websites  visited downloaded  apps  locations  visited  and  chat  history  (Ibid  2016). Historically  lending  has  relied  heavily  on  social  networks  attestation  and trust as a form of assessing creditworthiness. In academic literature this is !28\\xe2\\x80\\xa8\\xe2\\x80\\xa8\\x0creferred to as social capital which relies on trust norms and networks to improve  the  ef\\xef\\xac\\x81ciency  of  societal  activities  like  providing  local  credit  or ensuing  governance  of  a  locality  (Putnam  1993).  Lin  Prabhala  and Viswanathan  (2013)  \\xef\\xac\\x81nd  that  friendships  increase  the  likelihood  of  an individual  successfully  accessing  credit  and  having  a  lower  default  rate. However this is not just related to the number of friends one has but the quality  of  friends.    Based  on  the  idea  of  homophily  individuals  tend  to interact  with  similar  people  (Wei  et  al.  2016).  Therefore  there  is  the assumption that if you are connected with individuals who are lowrisk and have  successfully  repaid  loans  or  not  defaulted  then  you  are  also  more likely  to  repay.  Some  studies  claim  that  such  metrics  can  improve repayment predictions by 18% (Tan & Phan 2016). Social data is therefore a  useful  tool  for  credit  scoring  as  it  provides  and  veri\\xef\\xac\\x81es  important information about the borrower that tends to be unobservable by traditional \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  institutions  (Ibid  2016).  However  such  information  is  useful  only when there is a high and frequent amount of internet and social media users in a country to supply such information.\\xe2\\x80\\xa8While most FinTech platforms do not transparently weight their social data points  they  advertise  proven  success  compared  to  traditional  lenders evidenced  through  higher  repayment  rates  and  more  borrowers.  One mobile FinTech is TALA (2018) which provides \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial services such as credit  scores  and  microloans.  By  accessing  a  number  of  data  points  on their mobile device permissioned by the borrower the company examines daily  travel  patterns  the  regularity  of  calls  to  family  and  the  number  of individuals  that  the  borrower  is  communicating  with  on  a  daily  basis according to their data such information can increase the repayment rate of a  borrower  by  4%    5%  and  9%  respectively  (Siroya  2016).  Lenddo  a leading  company  using  nontraditional  data  for  credit  scoring  uses machine learning to analyse data points from social media platforms to form a  digital  personality  to  credit  score.  Through  their  \'LenddoScore\'  credit scoring  they  have  been  able  to  reduce  the  number  of  defaults  by  12% (Lenddo 2018).\\xe2\\x80\\xa8While this new data may be useful in providing greater access to credit to !29\\xe2\\x80\\xa8\\xe2\\x80\\xa8\\x0cpreviously  "unworthy"  individuals  and  can  solve  the  issue  of  information asymmetry it has certain limitations  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Internet coverage and usage of mobile phones and social media must be  substantial  to  provide  rich  and  useful  data  on  borrowers.  Some information is reliant on smartphones which are still not as widespread as regular "dummy" phones.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Gaining access to many diverse data sets can be dif\\xef\\xac\\x81cult and requires a  number  of  stakeholders  including  telecommunication  companies and  social  media  giants  that  may  not  have  an  incentive  to  share certain data about their users (Baer et al. 2013).  \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 FinTech  tends  to  be  dominated  by  a  few  key  players  with  natural monopolies  sti\\xef\\xac\\x82ing  competition  as  seen  in  Kenya  with  MPesa (Hieminga Lande & Njiboer 2016). \\xc2\\xa0 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Data  collection  can  be  used  for  biased  screeningout  of  applicants based on gender race or age (PYMNTS 2015; Franics Blumenstock & Robinson 2017). While alternative data can be empowering for individuals and businesses it also increases the risk of exploitation of private information (Ibid). Without strong  enforcement  or  protections  in  place  by  lenders  and  users  of  this data  then  individuals  providing  such  data  cannot  be  sure  that  this information is secure.  PsychometricsPsychometrics  is  the  \\xef\\xac\\x81eld  in  psychology  in  which  testing  measurement assessment and related activities occur (NCME 2017). In determining the quality  of  a  test  reliability  and  validity  are  two  of  the  most  important aspects.  The  former  refers  to  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe  extent  to  which  the  test  is  effectively measuring anything at all\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while the latter denotes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe extent to which the test is measuring what it is purported to measure\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Rust & Golombok 2009 162).  Today the use of such tests has expanded signi\\xef\\xac\\x81cantly into the arena of lending  where  the  corresponding  results  increasingly  play  a  role  in determining  creditworthiness.  In  addition  to  psychometric  answers  about attitudes beliefs integrity and performance how loan applicants interact !30\\x0cwith  the  psychometrics  tool  (metadata)  is  collected.  A  credit  score  is ultimately produced identifying a person\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability as well as willingness to repay a loan. Thus the loan applicant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s default behaviour is claimed to be illuminated.   In  the  absence  of  collateral  or  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  history  to  determine  whether  a borrower will repay a loan psychometric testing is a lowcost way to make more information about the loan applicant available (MIF 2015). Moreover psychometric  results  can  supplement  information  from  an  entrepreneur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s available  credit  history  lowering  banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99  portfolio  risk.  Additionally  banks can  open  access  to  credit  for  millions  of  underbanked  entrepreneurs without increasing their portfolio risk. Other  commentators  on  the  application  of  psychometrics  to  determine creditworthiness  caution  its  use.  First  psychometric  testing  methods  may bene\\xef\\xac\\x81t bettereducated technologypro\\xef\\xac\\x81cient loan applicants over people with less privileged backgrounds. Second applicants may provide answers to psychometric questions they believe will create ideal results eschewing their credit score. Third for applicants who test badly there is a risk of that information being used against them and this may occur even a few years after they completed that test. Given  the  novelty  of  psychometric  testing  as  a  credit  scoring  tool  few companies  currently  offer  the  product.  Rival  \\xef\\xac\\x81rms  CreditInfo  and Entrepreneurial  Finance  Lab  (EFL  Global  hereon  EFL)  are  two  key examples.  Both  companies  primarily  use  the  \\xef\\xac\\x81vefactor  model  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  the predominant  personality  model  in  the  \\xef\\xac\\x81eld  of  psychology  (Klinger  et  al. 2013 23) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to underpin their psychometric tests. This \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig Five\\xe2\\x80\\x9d personality structure (Costa & McCrae 1992 in Klinger et al. 2013 6) considers the following  factors  neuroticism  (perceived  degree  of  selfesteem) extraversion  (perceived  degree  of  selfcon\\xef\\xac\\x81dence  sociability  and  drive) openness  to  experience  (perceived  degree  of  creativity  and  intellectual interest)  agreeableness  (perceived  degree  of  belief  in  cooperation)  and conscientiousness  (perceived  degree  of  leadership  and  organisation) (Mccrae  &  John  1992).  This  model  has  been  found  to  be  strongly !31\\x0ccorrelated with becoming an entrepreneur (Seibert & Zhao (2006) in Klinger et al. 2013 19) and with entrepreneurial business survival (Ciavarella et al. (2004) in Klinger et al. 2013 19). However exactly which elements of the model are used or thoroughly tested for in the psychometric tests is not disclosed. Since its foundation in 2006 EFL has formalised partnerships across South America Africa and Asia with several publications on the progress of its work. One of the most comprehensive papers was released by the IDB in 2015  assessing  the  strengths  and  weaknesses  of  EFL\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  psychometrics testing tool for potential borrowers of a commercial bank the \\xef\\xac\\x81fth largest in Peru (EFL Global 2018a). For unbanked entrepreneurs the EFL tool was found  to  have  the  potential  effect  of  improving  their  portfolio  risk  thus opening up access to credit. The psychometrics tool clearly has potential to increase \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial inclusion and ultimately help commercial banks to grow their  customer  base.  For  example  a  year  after  adopting  the  EFL psychometrics tool Peru\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Banco Financiero experienced a 16% increase in its  micro  loans  (EFL  Global  2018a)  and  Guatemala\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  G&T\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  client  base increased by 53% (EFL Global 2018b). In the Caribbean the use of psychometrics is still in its early stages but initial  results  have  proved  positive.  In  particular  Haiti  saw  the  tool  being tested in 2013 a project carried out by MIF the IDB and SogeSol (FOMIN Member of the IDB Group 2013). In 2016 Scotiabank Jamaica and the MIF combined psychometric testing with a business and creditrisk rating model they had previously used for micro and small businesses with the aim of enhancing  their  creditscoring  assessment  methods  (Leslie  &  Beecher 2016).  These  examples  indicate  the  high  and  exciting  potential  that psychometric testing has for building risk pro\\xef\\xac\\x81les of SMEs. \\xe2\\x80\\xa9!32\\x0cThe Role of Blockchain  Despite their illustrative potential alternative payment information social data and psychometrics  have  yet  to  fully  transform  mainstream  loan  conversations.  Their vulnerability  to  manipulation  and  overall  disjointedness  results  in  their supplementary status within TIBs. To have suf\\xef\\xac\\x81cient leverage in credit applications this information needs to be veri\\xef\\xac\\x81ed and aggregated at the forefront of information requests.  Blockchain  is  uniquely  positioned  to  overcome  the  challenges  of  credit access. In particular a SSI is the best blockchain application to address obstacles.  A SSI system is a digital identity landscape where every incorporated human being holds ultimate and autonomous authority over all of their own data. SSI systems are the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst and only system currently that address the threepart need of SMEs to 1) showcase  alternative  data  indicating  creditworthiness  in  2)  a  noncorruptible controllable  and  portable  manner  that  necessarily  3)  empowers  the  business owners in the context of an increasing need for data security and digital autonomy. We propose a SSI system that begins with the incorporation of the alternative data above. Beyond its access to credit roots it would lay the foundation for all future blockchain use cases in development (Ferrarini 2017). The  SSI  is  the  next  step  in  granting  user  control  (Allen  2016;  See  Appendix  4). Revolutionarily it is the \\xef\\xac\\x81rst model to separate who con\\xef\\xac\\x81rms the information from what  is  being  con\\xef\\xac\\x81rmed  (the  veri\\xef\\xac\\x81cation  and  data  layers)  (Voshmgir  2018).  A blockchainbased  SSI  no  longer  needs  trusted  thirdparties  (TTPs)  to  verify information nor is information ever housed in a centralised CA repository.  Ten De\\xef\\xac\\x81ning Characteristics of SelfSovereign Identity The  discussions  and  initiatives  around  SSI  have  conceptually  evolved  and converged into ten tenants (Allen 2016; Voshmgir 2018). Together they make up the bedrock of a decentralised digital identity landscape based on blockchain that reassigns the locus of control to the individual. 1.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cExistence Users must have an independent existence.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d   Users are more than their digital identity. !33\\x0c2.3.4.5.6.7.8.9.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cControl Users must control their identities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  As approved by truth mechanisms (algorithms) the user is the presiding and \\xef\\xac\\x81nal purveyor of their identity which they can choose to hide or broadcast. Others\\xe2\\x80\\x99  claims  exist  but  are  peripheral  unless  the  individual  chooses otherwise. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAccess Users must have access to their own data.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d There  are  no  doorkeepers  patrolling  data  access;  users  are  aware  of  all placed claims on themselves; while they can choose to verify claims or not they  cannot  necessarily  alter  logged  claims;  they  can  retrieve  any  claim themselves. Users access their own data but their access to the select data of others\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is contingent upon permission from the requested party. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTransparency Systems and algorithms must be transparent.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Algorithms  are  understandable  opensource  and  agnostic.  The  network management procedures and updates are clear.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPersistence Identities must be longlived.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Digital  identities  should  last  as  long  as  the  user  desires.  If  forever  is  not possible  then  digital  identities  should  last  as  long  as  that  identity  system does.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPortability  Information  and  services  about  identity  must  be transportable.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Identity should not be consolidated by few TTPs as is currently the practice with internetbased databases. Prevalent schemes may change users may migrate to other platforms or the TTP may phase out of operation.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInteroperability Identities should be as widely usable as possible.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Blockchain  needs  an  agnostic  protocol  so  that  users  and  developers  may freely  choose  and  \\xef\\xac\\x82uidly  change  systems  (Allen  et  al.  2015  P11)  in  a competitively  developing  international  marketplace.  The  Decentralised Identity Foundation is in the early stages of creating a "Universal Resolver" that  sits  on  top  of  the  many  different  identi\\xef\\xac\\x81er  layers  like  the  Bitcoin blockchain Sovrin Ethereum and IPFS (Sabadello 2017). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cConsent Users must agree to the use of their identity.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The user must consent to claims if they are to become valid; only the user can consent to share data. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMinimisation Disclosure of claims must be minimised.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Selective  disclosure  range  proofs  and  other  zeroknowledge  (ZK) techniques exponentially enhance privacy. The individual releases only what !34\\x0c10.is  required.  Correlativity  is  acknowledged  but  notwithstanding  blockchain offers unprecedented potential in privacy.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cProtection The rights of users must be protected.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d If  contradicting  user  freedoms  are  valued  over  network  wants.  To  protect users  above  all  algorithms  should  be  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccensorshipresistant  and  forceresilient and \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 run in a decentralised manner\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Allen 2016). Figure 1 Visualising the SSI System Access to Finance Use CaseFigure 2 SSI Supports the Integrity of Digital IdentityA blockchainbased SelfSovereign Identi\\xef\\xac\\x81cation system best supports the integrity of digital identities along technological regulatory and human rights dimensions. !35\\x0cCryptography PerspectiveBlockchain solves the aforementioned corruptibility problems inherent to the current CA  system.  It  reduces  risk  for  organisations  and  individuals  by  ensuring  that  the data is "accurate up to date revocable and cannot be lost stolen or used illegally" (Sherriff 2017). As the Sovrin Foundation so aptly puts it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cblockchains replace trust in humans with trust in mathematics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Sovrin Foundation 2018). It does so through three cryptographic steps  1. The issuer of the transaction digitally signs the transaction. 2. A  digital  hash  or  function  links  the  transaction  to  the  previous  one  in  the chain. Hashes \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmap data of an arbitrary size to a \\xef\\xac\\x81xed size\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and their output cannot be reverted into a previous state (Campos 2018).  3. The consensus algorithm governs how the transaction is validated and added to  the  blockchain.  The  most  common  consensus  algorithm  Proof  of  Work (PoW) \\xef\\xac\\x81nancially incentivises miners in the peertopeer network to participate (Ibid). \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe  result  is  a  cryptographic  ledger  of  immutable  records  that  makes  it  very dif\\xef\\xac\\x81cult if not almost impossible to change past transactions or maliciously control future ones\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Sovrin Foundation 2018).  When the transaction issuer signs the transaction they do not need a CA to verify their  identity  as  necessitated  under  the  current  PKI  protocol  (Ibid).  Instead individuals can be owners of their own key pair. They can keep their private key securely  with  them  but  selfstore  their  public  key  on  the  blockchain.  This  means that  every  public  key  can  have  a  permanent  address  called  a  decentralised identi\\xef\\xac\\x81er (DID). The implication of having a personal address  unlike namespaces domain  names  and  IP  addresses  that  are  impermanent  and  outside  of  the individual\\xe2\\x80\\x99s control is that \\xe2\\x80\\x9canyone with a DID should be able to digitally issue and sign veri\\xef\\xac\\x81able claims and other documents\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Ibid). Moving to a decentralised PKI (DPKI)  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cis  the  same  progression  that  occurred  in  moving  from  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cislands  of networking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (local area networks) into the global Internet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Ibid).  DPKI has been lauded over the PKI system for its decentralisation interoperability integrity  and  process  for  key  recovery  (Abraham  2017).  It  is  evident  that blockchains  especially  when  incorporating  DPKI  offer  revolutionary  advantages over standard databases for security and widening participation.  !36\\x0cRegulatory PerspectiveThe  world  has  reached  a  critical  juncture  for  data  privacy.  Current  events  have perturbed all stakeholders into action. A blockchainbased SSI would embrace and anticipate current and upcoming legislation harness time and money for the private sector and address civil society concerns. Regulatory Concerns of the StatePassed in April 2016 by the European Parliament and due to go into effect in May 2017 the General Data Protection Regulation aims to tighten personal data security and  squarely  reassigns  data  rights  to  the  individual  (ID2020;  Abraham  2017).  It includes a penalty of up to 4% pretax revenues for noncompliant \\xef\\xac\\x81rms to a cap of 20 million euros (GDPR & Beyond 2017). The gravity of the penalty can be best seen  in  juxtaposition  to  the  previous  Data  Protection  Act  of  1998  the  GDPR maximum \\xef\\xac\\x81ne is 40 times greater (Sherriff 2017). Aside from indicating a globallyfelt tide of government scrutiny on data use and abuse GDPR will have an effect in the Caribbean though exactly how is unclear. GDPR \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwill affect \\xef\\xac\\x81rms both inside and  outside  of  the  EU.  In  fact  any  company  dealing  with  EU  businesses\\xe2\\x80\\x99 residents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 or citizens\\xe2\\x80\\x99 data will have to comply with the GDPR\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (GDPR & Beyond 2017). Luckily a SSI system prioritises consent pseudonymisation data portability and data protection by design and default in a way that is advanced even beyond GDPR requirements (Abraham 2017). While blockchain prides itself on immutability if  that  property  is  to  be  moderated  by  Sovrin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  suggestion  to  store  some  identity information  \\xe2\\x80\\x9coff  ledger\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  a  blockchainbased  SSI  still  overcomplies  with  GDPR mandates (Reed et al. 2017).  Regulatory Concerns of the Private SectorKYC  stems  from  the  lack  of  a  trusted  and  veri\\xef\\xac\\x81ed  identity  and  causes  massive \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccost friction and inef\\xef\\xac\\x81ciency\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Sherriff 2017). Information \\xe2\\x80\\x98pulled from the shelves\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is not trusted at all and the second organisation duplicates efforts and time during their own vetting process. It is reported that some \\xef\\xac\\x81rms spent up to $500 million on KYC  compliance  (Sovrin  Foundation  2018).  Meanwhile  AML  initiatives  need greater ef\\xef\\xac\\x81ciency in their processes. SSI would allow banks to transfer KYC work within  a  jurisdiction  saving  money  and  time  (Preukschat  2018).  SSI  can  reduce tedious  bureaucracy  over  days  of  processing  to  a  series  of  clicks  over  seconds (Sovrin Foundation 2018). !37\\x0cRegulatory Concerns of Civil Society As increasing masses of data are harvested about each individual consumers are actively  demanding  and  reclaiming  privacy  rights  (Allen  2016;  ID2020).  Recent CRA scandals and most recently Cambridge Analytica\\xe2\\x80\\x99s breach of what could be almost  90  million  FaceBook  users  have  shaken  the  public  into  radical reconsiderations  of  what  privacy  does  and  should  mean  (Kelly  2018).  In  a blockchainbased SSI the centre of identity control is completely inverted  in the future Facebook may be the one to pay its users to post their content. Human Rights PerspectiveFrom  a  human  rights  perspective  the  lack  of  autonomy  over  one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  own  identity unfairly  prohibits  the  marginalised  from  accessing  basic  services.  The  multiple refugee crises continue to see in\\xef\\xac\\x82uxes of people who lack any recognised identity. The UN\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Universal Declaration of Human Rights already acknowledges sovereignty and  privacy  as  fundamental  rights  but  there  remains  a  painful  gap  between aspiration and infrastructure (Voshmgir 2018). The SSI would grant control access and empowerment to the marginalised by reassigning the identity locus of control (See Appendix 5).\\xe2\\x80\\xa9!38\\x0cRecommendations  This research\\xc2\\xa0into the Caribbean has indicated that in order to advance the current credit system it is necessary to expand the networks of trust and facilitate greater data  sharing\\xc2\\xa0 of  the  right  type  of  data.\\xc2\\xa0 Lending  institutions  must  overcome  their absolute  risk  aversion  by  observing  the  value  of  a  broader  wealth  of  data  that informs a borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to repay\\xc2\\xa0which in turn\\xc2\\xa0mitigates risk.\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0 Therefore\\xc2\\xa0 the  blockchainbased  SSI  system\\xc2\\xa0 a\\xc2\\xa0 new  information  sharing  platform that is accessible and highly secure is suggested for the region.\\xc2\\xa0This credit risk management system\\xc2\\xa0will be able to \\xef\\xac\\x81ll the void\\xc2\\xa0of credit bureaus in the region and address  the  shortcomings  of  current  practice  in  assessing  narrow  data  points.

In fact between 2010 and 2013 the Caribbean growth rate fell to an average of 0.8% while ROSE grew by 3.6% (IMF 2015 in IDB 2016 7).  The particularly unfriendly business environment is largely to blame characterised by a general lack of transparency heavy reliance on collateral and near absence of CRAs. Concurrently SMEs disproportionately suffer from the increase in cybercrime in parallel with expanding internet usage. The current TIB accessto\\xef\\xac\\x81nance model systematically excludes many creditworthy individuals and security issues threaten to inhibit the ability of alreadycredited SMEs to repay secured loans and access future  funds.  The  present  business  environment  and  looming  risk  of  cybercrime disadvantage SMEs TIBs and Caribbean economies.  This report has investigated alternative data that has gradually been brought into consideration  by  some  lenders  and  CRAs.  Meanwhile  as  evidenced  by  the insecurity  of  present  databases  regulatory  movements  sweeping  governments private sectors and civil society around the world and the increasingly important role  of  digital  identity  a  revolutionary  new  system  is  needed  to  assess creditworthiness.  Blockchain  has  the  potential  to  combine  dimensions  of  digital  identity  like  never before  not  only  aggregating  alternative  information  but  doing  so  in  a  way  that maximises  frictionless  transactions  security  and  individual  autonomy.  Creating  a SSI system on the blockchain would democratise economic participation anticipate future  regulatory  standards  and  lay  the  foundation  for  all  future  use  cases  for blockchain in development.  !42\\x0cBibliography Abraham  A.  2017.

The program jointly funded by the InterAmerican Development Bank (IDB) and the United Kingdom Department for International Development (DFID) supports projects in 13 Caribbean countries. Projects in the OECS countries are implemented in partnership with the Caribbean Development Bank.Project Title Blockchain for Small and Medium Enterprise (SME) development in the Caribbean Access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nanceBackground The growth in productivity of the Caribbean private sector has been falling behind that of the Rest Of Small Economies of the world over the past three decades. Compete Caribbean uses diverse instruments to help SMEs (which represent 69% of Caribbean \\xef\\xac\\x81rms) become more productive and innovative while fostering inclusive and sustainable development. However SMEs face huge cost and \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial barriers that inhibit their ability to innovate upgrade and scale up. Commercial banks play an important role in helping to address this problem but portfolio risks associated with the lack of collateral and \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial history hamper their actions to extend credit to potential borrowers. Given the potential that blockchain technology offers to achieve these goals especially in the Caribbean given the emergence of local expertise and \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech companies such as Bitt.com the program is seeking advice and latest research \\xef\\xac\\x81ndings on how blockchain technologies can be used in the Caribbean to increase credit \\xef\\xac\\x82ows to enterprises across the region. Question How can blockchain technology be used to overcome barriers and enhance access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance for Caribbean SMEs? Objective The research \\xef\\xac\\x81ndings could help Compete Caribbean and its partners understand the opportunities for catalytic and sustainable impact in the region. Students should \\xef\\xac\\x81rst establish the barriers that SMEs face in accessing credit and current lines of credit in the region. Next the students should \\xef\\xac\\x81nd what alternative data is currently being used to circumvent traditional incumbent bank lending procedures and how to incorporate this into a blockchain solution. This alternative information if applicable to the regional context can then be used as a proxy for traditional \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial data regularly requested by lending institutions. Understanding how blockchain can address the related concerns and justifying those claims will be pivotal in determining if the technology has a unique use case for SMEs and access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance in the Caribbean. The research \\xef\\xac\\x81ndings should lead to !52\\x0crecommendations about what should be done and how and why to optimize the impact on the Caribbean economy and people.Methodology The students will have to conduct desk research and become familiar with the following topics access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance blockchain uses and information privacy. The expertise developed will have to be applied to the Caribbean context. To better understand the evolving \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial technology landscape interviews will have to be conducted with various stakeholders and experts in the \\xef\\xac\\x81elds of research.Contact Annie Bertrand Productivity and Innovation Coordinator  Private Sector DevelopmentOf\\xef\\xac\\x81ce 2466278549 \\xe2\\x94\\x82 Fax 2464298869 \\xe2\\x94\\x82Cell 2462554783\\xe2\\x94\\x82annieb@iadb.orgAppendix 2 Limitation of Blockchain High Energy Consumption Blockchain  technology  has  been  \\xef\\xac\\x82agged  as  having  serious  repercussions  on  the climate  and  greenhouse  gas  emissions  by  greatly  increasing  carbon  emissions through its energy consumption. This is largely a result of blockchain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s use of the proofofwork consensus protocol which is currently the mechanism that gives it its unique security and infallibility characteristics. In this system blocks are generated when data entered into the distributed ledgers is scrutinised (i.e. mined) by miners who  compete  for  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancially  convertible  tokens.  Essentially  the  more  electricity  a miner  burns  the  more  hashes  for  mining  are  produced  and  the  greater  his/her chances  become  of  earning  tokens.  Incentives  can  be  huge;  a  miner  of  the cryptocurrency  bitcoin  can  win  12.5  tokens  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  possibly  worth  over  USD$100000 (Hern  2018).  Consequently  the  demand  for  coal  power  has  increased  (Begum 2017). For perspective one transaction on Ethereum can power the equivalent of 2.5 households for one day. Solutions to the blockchain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s high levels of energy consumption are being explored to take on the challenge of reducing its greenhouse gas emissions (Flipo & Berne 2017). One alternative system on the rise is that of the proofofstake algorithm (Lilic 2017).  In  this  scenario  coin  owners  as  opposed  to  miners  create  blocks.  Thus without the need for the intensive production of hashes energy requirements would be  much  lower  (Digiconomist  2018a).  Currently  several  versions  of  the  proofofstake  system  exist.  Ethereum  aims  to  shift  to  the  proofofstake  system  Casper although this has yet to be realised (Lilic 2017).!53\\x0cBitcoin and Ethereum Network Statistics (Digiconomist 2018a) (Digiconomist 2018b)Appendix 3 Compete Caribbean Territory ListCompete Caribbean implements projects in the following 13 territories (Anon. 2017)\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Antigua & Barbuda\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The Bahamas\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Barbados\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Belize\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Dominica\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Grenada\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Guyana\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Jamaica\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Saint Kitts & Nevis\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Saint Lucia\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Saint Vincent & the Grenadines\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Suriname\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Trinidad & Tobago!54\\x0cAppendix 4 Evolution of Digital IdentityWhile most of the internet is still centralised movements toward federated and usercentric modi\\xef\\xac\\x81cations acknowledge the corruptibility and failure risk associated with housing information with CAs and other TTPs.A  Federated  Identity  means  that  several  federated  authorities  control  the  user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s experience and the individuals use the same username and password for multiple platforms. Microsoft Passport (now Windows Hello) released in 1999 was an early example  of  federated  identity  where  the  user  could  sign  into  Microsoft  apps websites  and  devices  using  one  account.  Since  Microsoft  was  central  to  the Federation they created the oligarchical Liberty Alliance in 2001 (Allen 2016)A UserCentric Identity is where there is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cindividual or administrative control across multiple  authorities  without  requiring  a  federation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (Allen  2016).  The  UserCentric identity  which  originally  developed  out  of  the  desire  to  improve  a  super\\xef\\xac\\x81cial experience rather than autonomy is where the credentials from one website can be used to automatically sign into others without an account on the home website. For example  FaceBook  Connect  lends  users  to  ability  to  intercommunicate  on  other websites through the \\xe2\\x80\\x9csign in with FaceBook\\xe2\\x80\\x9d option.Finally SelfSovereign Identity is a radical departure from previous attempts to lasso control  of  digital  communication. The  individual  controls  their  own  identity  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cacross any number of authorities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Allen 2016). The concept and word SSI emerged in the 2010s and has been gaining recognition.Keyp Evolution of Digital Identities Chart   !55\\x0cAppendix 5 The Importance of Autonomous Digital Identity ControlWhile  proponents  of  SSI  embrace  the  principles  of  egalitarianism  and  democracy there is no consensus that pinpoints its de\\xef\\xac\\x81nition. Rather than wrangle a singular meaning  of  identity  it  is  more  useful  to  foundationally  understand  the  identity landscape.  Identity  can  be  conceptualised  as  unidirectional  or  relational.  A unidirectional  identity  may  be  a  personal  identity  or  how  an  individual  sees themselves. It may be selfdeclared and socially conceived by others or it may be imposed  by  a  higher  authority.  Meanwhile  relational  identities  are  de\\xef\\xac\\x81ned  by transactions  reputation  vouching  attestations  of  functional  attributes  or  a combination (Morris 2018; Preukschat 2018). It is important to remember that a SSI system allows the individual to govern relational identities rather than unidirectional. This is because the SSI information requires both the attestation of an external party (or parties) and the individual. To  put  one\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  identity  on  blockchain  as  a  part  of  an  SSI  system  means  that  the individual has the bargaining power necessary to use that record as they wish to maximise  their  own  wellbeing.  Not  only  does  a  blockchainbased  SSI  address access to \\xef\\xac\\x81nance for SMEs in the Caribbean but it also sets the infrastructure for other use cases like access to better insurance packages.Appendix 6 Examples of Other SSI systemsSovrin White Paper   !56\\x0cSelfkey White Paper  Appendix 7 Examples of Other BlockchainBased Access to Finance ProjectsDifferent  combinations  of  alternative  data  have  been  integrated  into  blockchain platforms to produce innovative and secure credit risk management. For example with  Bloom  powered  by  Ethereum  and  IPFS  (Leimgruber  et  al.  2018)  the  user establishes a Bloom ID by gaining attestation about his/her identity and/or ability to act responsibly with credit from of\\xef\\xac\\x81cial organisations and/or peers. The Bloom IQ then  records  the  user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial  history  and  thereon  records  current  \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial information. Finally a Bloom Score is created using an algorithm created by Bloom which combines data from the two previous elements. This ultimately is provided to lenders but only with permission from the user. Bloom is currently in its early stages and has not yet been launched. Alternatively PayPie powered by its own PayPie platform  (PPP)  caters  speci\\xef\\xac\\x81cally  to  SMEs  who  opt  to  connect  their  accounting software to the PPP. The result is a score based on live \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial transactions which can be provided to banks without the permission of the SME. PayPie has not yet begun operations. While both companies guarantee the security of data they gather and the scores the produce a foreseeable challenge for them would be to raise trust and  credibility  with  TIBs  speci\\xef\\xac\\x81cally  with  regard  to  the  design  of  their  algorithms. !57\\x0cPayPie may also be faced with a barrier convincing SMEs to permit full access to their accounts. In March this year the Royal Bank of Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (RBC) patent application for a creditscoring platform built on a blockchain was of\\xef\\xac\\x81cially released (Clay 2018). The early released information reveals a CRM system which employs smart contracts to arise with borrowers based on a RBC algorithmic score. The score would consider both \\xef\\xac\\x81nancial history and data from a wider range of sources and greater transparency will apparently be provided to users as to how their credit score is calculated. User permission would not be necessary here given that the bank would be creating its own credit scoring system.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa9!58\\x0c!59\\x0c'
