Spinoffs diversify the applicable knowledge base in a region; especially spinoffs are an important mechanism to pass on and develop competitive routines (examples A and B).     Analytical framework of Global Production Networks (GPN).     IFCs like Luxembourg with their diversified    expert systems    and    knowledge structures    represent important parts of the knowledge structure of the world   s financial economy.     Conditions for growth and (sustainable) development in IFCs are difficult to capture through even the most innovative policy measures unless certain basic structures are already in place.
