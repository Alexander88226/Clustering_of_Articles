What   s  more  S&T  enterprises  of  this  kind  also  take  an  active  role  in  technological innovation. In view of the poor technological innovation ability of small and mediumsized enterprises in China such an analysis will be helpful for their sound development.   Keywords Small and mediumsized enterprises Technological innovation Difficulties in financing   1. Causes for Poor Technological Innovation in SME in China 1.1 Imperfect Policies and Regulations Promoting SME   s Technological Innovation Ever since the reform and openingup some regulations and policies relevant to technological innovation have been established  and  implemented  in  China  such  as  On  Strengthening  the  Construction  of  Service  System  for  SME   s Technological Innovation and The Law of SME Development and have exerted favorable effects in promoting S&T development and technological innovation. However some problems also exist (1) relevant laws and regulations seem empty with some contents repeated omitted and contradicted. (2) Most of the current policies and regulations relevant to technological innovation in SME support those S&T enterprises especially the technological innovation programs in hightechnology  enterprises  such  as  Torch  Program  SME  incubators  and  funds  for  the  technological  innovation  of small  and  mediumsized  S&T  enterprises.  However  insufficient  importance  has  been  attached  to  SME  in  the manufacturing industry especially the technological innovation of SME in the tertiary industry. (3) In relevant policies more emphasis is put on the favorable terms for enterprises in the late period of their industrialization than on R&D of technological  innovation  the  incubation  of  the  achievements  in  the  early  period  of  industrialization  relevant experiments and so on.   1.2 Having not Established Effective IndustryUniversityResearch Cooperation System   Currently it is very difficult to construct an innovative system focused on enterprises and sticking to the combination of industry university and research. Due to relevant system  in China industry university and research have long been separated  from  each  other  scientific  research  funds  and  staff  are  over  concentrated  in  national  scientific  research universities and institutions and the value of scientific achievements is evaluated according to the funds they gain the number of issued essays the academic status of the participants and the level of awards they win. Such an evaluation system succeeds in reflecting the academic value of scientific achievements while neglecting their market value hence leading  to  the  failure  to  lead  the  market  or  the  infeasibility  of  industrial  production.  This  is  a  source  of  scientific resource waste as well as one of the main reasons for Chinese enterprises    poor innovative abilities.   1.3 Incomplete Protection System for Intellectual Property Rights At present the incomplete laws and administrative systems relevant to the protection of intellectual property rights in China have resulted in some problems such as multifarious administrations ineffective strike against torts low cost for torts  high  cost  for  safeguarding  legal  rights  unscientific  evaluation  system  and  so  on  hence  leading  to  the  current 209  Vol. 5 No. 2                                                                                      International Journal of Business and Management indifferent consciousness of protecting intellectual property rights all over China low protection level and unbearably high cost for safeguarding legal rights.   1.4 Lacking in Agencies and Collaborative Networks Beneficial for Innovation in SME Currently agencies for technological innovation in China include productivity promotion centers innovation service centers  engineering  technology  research  centers  information  centers  intellectual  property  rights  affairs  centers  all kinds  of  technological  consultation  institutions  permanent  technological  markets  human  resource  markets technological  property  rights  transaction  institutions  and  so  on.  In  spite  of  their  driving  force  these  institutions  are mainly concentrated in large and mediumsized cities suffering from low level of specialization poor collaboration onefold service function poor functions of an innovation service system including feasibility argumentation financing guarantee patent agency mediation of disputes and so on hence failing to provide excellent allout services for small and medium enterprises. Besides because most service institutions are established in governmental departments only a few of them are directly open to enterprises. What   s more only those large enterprises can be served. The high charges of commercial agencies have also prevented SME from getting necessary guidance in their technological innovation.   In  addition  insufficient  collaboration  and  communication  among  small  and  medium  enterprises  independent production  the  shortage  of  necessary  techniques  during  the  development  process  or  of  formal  and  informal communication and the shortage of specialized collaboration and technological and sales networks have increased the cost  for  the  transactions  among  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  and  therefore  that  for  their  technological innovation.   1.5 Impassable Financing Channels for SME   s Technological Innovation A common problem is harassing the whole world that is great difficulties for SME to finance. It was shown in U.S. in 1999  that  those  commercial  banks  with  their  assets  less  than  $100000000  gave  96.7%  of  their  loans  to  small  and medium enterprises; those with assets between $100000000 and $300000000 gave 85% of their loans to them; the data for those banks with assets between $300000000 and $10000000000 went down to 63.2%; for those with assets between $10000000000 and $50000000000 it was 37.8%; for those over $50000000000 it was 16.9%. It is also shown in relevant surveys that 62% of small and mediumsized enterprises in China regard difficulties in financing as the top obstacle. Faced with the common problem in gaining capital most small and mediumsized enterprises regard impassable financing channels as their biggest enemy. 1.5.1 Difficulties in Direct Financing   Small and mediumsized enterprises are restricted from being listed on the main board market while the second market hasn   t been opened up; they are also unable to finance by issuing bonds due to some policy restrictions.   Risk  investment  is  a  financing  channel  fit  for  hightech  enterprises  but  in  China  those  established  companies specialized in risk investment have also found it hard to run their business in accordance with the given risk investment mechanism due to incomplete systems and laws as well as imperfect mechanism for capital exit. Not like in U.S. where different  investment  companies  invest  different  quotas  in  different  stages  of  a  project  in  order  to  spread  risks  one company is in charge of the whole process in China. It is well known that risk investment must be companied by risks or  even  failures.  However  this  hasn   t  got  fully  realized  in  China  where  risk  investment  companies  pursue  the zerofailure record and therefore there are not many projects able to gain investment from them finally. In addition the administrative division of local governments at all levels has also made it hard for investment companies to recover their capital.   Private  investment  hasn   t  been  started  up  to  now.  In  spite  of  the  overall  resident  savings  over  17000000000000 private capital has no access to small and mediumsized S&T enterprises in the form of risk investment funds or Angel Capital due to the shortage of effective financial institutional arrangements. Now private funds are still forbidden by Chinese policies.   1.5.2 Difficulties in Indirect Financing This problem is mainly manifested in the great difficulties in getting loans and guarantee. In 2005 the shortterm loans for all small and medium enterprises were 1008300000000 yuan taking up only 11.49% of the total shortterm loans. Compared with their roles and their demands for investment and loans such a proportion seems too low.   2. The Supportive Role of Financing in SME   s Technological Innovation With  capital  being  an  indispensable  element  for  SME   s  innovation  especially  their  technological  innovation  stable financing channels can provide effective guarantee for their innovation process because their technological innovation is not only of high growth and effectiveness but a highly risky economic behavior and therefore is closely related to their survival in such a society based on knowledge economy. In addition since technological achievements are transformed into commodities in the innovation process uncertain factors due to technologies as well as market exert influences on this process. In this case risk investment comes into being and becomes the major force in SME   s innovation as well as 210   International Journal of Business and Management                                                                                      February 2010 the main channel for SME   s financing.   3. Financing Countermeasures to Strengthen Chinese SME   s Technological Innovation Ability 3.1 Exerting the role of Fiscal Taxation Policies to Compensate for SME   s shortage of capital and to Encourage their Technological Innovation 3.1.1 Increasing Financial Input in Science and Technology A system of stably increasing financial input in science and technology should be gradually established to guarantee higher  growth  of  the  input  in  science  and  technology  than  that  of  the  national  regular  revenue.  Financial  allocation should be focused on SME   s independent innovation projects.   3.1.2 Establishing SME   s Diversified Financing System   Funds  for  SME   s  growth  should  be  established  to  deal  with  special  loans  interest  subsidies  financial  aids  for technological  innovation  R&D  and  legal  aids  for  SME;  commercial  banks     service  should  be  improved  and  their direction of loans should be adjusted to increase the proportion of loans for SME; private official or mixed institutions guaranteeing  SME   s  credit  should  also  be  established;  finance  lease  should  be  developed  to  support  SME   s  facility renewal  and  technological  renovation;  risk  investment  mechanism  should  be  perfected  and  favorable  policy environment should be created to guarantee the sound operation of this mechanism due to the particular importance of risk investment for SME; SME should be promoted to be listed on exchange and in order to do that these enterprises    direct  financing  system  should  be  perfected;  a  real  SME  policy  bank  should  be  established  to  change  the  current asymmetry between the existing policy bank system and SME   s development.   3.1.3 Perfecting Taxation Policies and Strengthening Taxation Services for SME In order to relieve Chinese SME   s heavy burden the current taxation system should be normalized to transform those unreasonable charges into taxes and maintain enterprises    burden at a reasonable level.   3.1.4 Establishing Preferential Taxation Policies Related to Risk Investment.   Necessary  preferences  can  be  given  to  risk  investment  from  the  added  value  of  the  transfer  gained  by  hightech enterprises  and  private  capital  should  be  encouraged  to  participate  in  risk  investment  in  order  to  expand  the  capital channels for it and therefore for SME.   3.2 Developing Risk Investment and Capital Market The guiding demonstrating and leading role of risk investment and capital market for SME   s technological innovation should  be  exerted.  The  prosperity  of  the  whole  risk  investment  industry  should  begin  with  a  solution  to  the  exit mechanism which calls for the help of capital market. Capital market is able to offer sufficient capital support for SME to  encourage  them  to  strength  their  normalized  operation  and  basic  management  to  promote  SME   s  rapid  growth through acquisition and merger and to facilitate the transformation and industrialization of S&T achievements.   3.2.1 Vigorously Pushing the Construction of Multilevel Capital Market System The  carveout  board  market  should  be  pushed  actively.  The  current  SME  board  market  is  a  part  of  the  main  board market instead of a real carveout board market. It is helpful to establish investors    confidence in Chinese stock market by encouraging more vigorous and prospective enterprises to be listed through great efforts in establishing the carveout board market.   Meanwhile the SME board market should also be innovated with faster pace. According to the latest Act of Company and Securities Law as well as the development rules and features of new small enterprises new standards of issuance and verification different from the traditional ones should be established with emphasis on small innovative enterprises    abilities in R&D independent knowledge property rights and their potentials for growth. The role of recommending and guaranteeing institutions and the stock exchanges should be fully exerted to improve the marketization of issuance and verification. In addition exit mechanism stock incentive mechanism and smallsum financing mechanism should be established in accordance with the principle of    the survival of the fittest    to promote the innovation of transactions and administration systems in the alltradable system and form the strong vitality of the SME board market.   3.2.2 Strengthening Guidance for Risk Investment Development and Establishing National Guidance Capital for Risk Investment (Mother Funds) The significance of this measure can be reflected in two ways government   s demonstrative capital will encourage all kinds of capital to establish risk investment institutions and therefore enlarge the capital source for risk investment and strengthen the capital or cash of Chinese risk investment institutions; guidance capital will draw more investment in small and mediumsized S&T enterprises in seed phase and at the initial stage (especially those enterprises with strong independent innovative ability) and therefore improve Chinese enterprises    independent innovative ability.     211 Vol. 5 No. 2                                                                                      International Journal of Business and Management 3.2.3 Establishing Preferential Policies for Risk Investment Necessary  preferences  can  be  given  to  risk  investment  from  the  added  value  of  the  transfer  gained  by  hightech enterprises to encourage more individuals to participate in risk investment.
