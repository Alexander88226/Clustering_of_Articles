b'herein fileTHE IMPORTANCE OF LEASING FOR SME FINANCINGThe importance of leasing for SME financingBy Helmut KraemerEis & Frank Lang1 European Investment FundThe  ability  of  SMEs  to  accessfinance is important for fundingbusiness  investment  ensuringbusinesses  reach  their  growth  potentialand  for  facilitating  new  business  startups; a lack of finance can constrain cashflow  and  hamper  businesses     survivalprospects (BIS 2012). Typically  SMEs  are  not  able  to  raisemoney  directly  in  the  capital  marketsand are therefore     with regard to external sources     mainly dependent on traditional  bank  financing  which  is  itselflimited by constraints due to banks    refinancing capacity their risk appetite andcapital  adequacy  (see  e.g.  KraemerEisLang and Gvetadze 2013).An important element of SME financeis  not  directly  provided  by  banksthrough  traditional  loans  but  rather  byleasing  or  factoring  companies.  Theintention of this article is to enhance theawareness of leasing and its importanceas  additional  financing  technique  forSMEs  that  expands  the  access  to  shortand  mediumterm  financing  for  capitalequipment. Leasing as integral part of the financing toolset. To what extent do SMEs use leasing?SMEs  finance  themselves  to  a  greatextent by internal sources both from thebusiness  owner  and  through  retainedprofit.  Many  SMEs  also  use  externalsources  of  finance  informal  sources(such  as  family  and  friends  and  sometypes  of  business  angel  investment)  andformal sources such as bank loans leasing  trade  credits  factoring  and  more   formal     venture  capital.  Neverthelessas mentioned above SMEs have usuallymore  difficulties  in  accessing  externalfinancing  than  large  enterprises.  Wecould even simplify that the smaller andyounger  a  company  is  the  bigger  itsfinancing  challenge  (Pelly  and  KraemerEis 2012).This  general  picture  is  confirmed  byrecent  empirical  evidence.  According  tothe  ECB   s     survey  on  the  access  tofinance of SMEs in the Euro area    covering  April  to  September  2013  (ECB2013)  access  to  finance  remained  thesecond  most  pressing  problem  for  Euroarea SMEs and it appears to be a moresevere  concern  for  SMEs  than  for  largefirms. However the most pressing problem  for  SMEs  was  still     finding  customers   . The  composition  of  external  sourcesof finance has changed somewhat duringthe  past  years  (see  Table  1).  While  theECB data does not isolate leasing products  specifically     leasing  hirepurchaseand  factoring     taken  together2 hasalways  ranked  either  second  or  thirdamong  the  categories  of  mostlyusedexternal financing sources preceded onlyby     bank  overdrafts  credit  lines  andcredit card overdrafts    and several timesalso  by     bank  loans   .  Compared  to2009  the  importance  of     leasing  hirepurchase and factoring    even increased.The  relatively  high  importance  ofleasing  for  the  external  financing  ofSMEs  is  confirmed  by  the  study     TheUse  of  Leasing  Amongst  EuropeanSMEs    (prepared by Oxford Economics(2011)  on  behalf  of  Leaseurope).3 In2010  according  to  the  survey  leasingwas the most popular source of externalfinancing which was used by 40% of thesurveyed  SMEs.4 The  second  mostimportant external financing source wasbank loans of more than three years. However  even  if  a  large  number  ofSMEs  use  leasing  the  share  of  investTable 1 Sources of external financing of Euro area SMEs5040302010      009/HY1                                          10/HY110/HY211/HY111/HY212/HY112/HY213/HY1      09/HY2Bank overdafts credit lines credit card overdrafts       Bank loans Trade credits       Leasing hirepurchase and factoringGrants or subsidised bank loan       Debt securities issuedSubordinated or participation loans or similar instrumentEquity investments in your firm       Other loan      Note Over the preceding six months; percentage of respondents.

Bank  loans  (allmaturities  taken  together  plus  otherforms of bank loans) are used to financea  larger  part  of  SMEs     investments(31.2%). However when looking only at thoseSMEs that actually used leasing in 2010the share of investment financed by leasing  is  higher  (32.4%)  and  exceeds  theshares  of  investment  financed  by  bankloans (30.1%) or by any other financingsource. Thus for SMEs which decide tolease  an  asset  this  instrument  becomeson  average  the  most  important  part  oftheir financing tool set.Scaling  up  the  figures  from  the  eightcountry  sample  Oxford  Economics(2011) estimates the SME leasing volumefor the whole EU to be e100bn for 2010which corresponds to 52% of total leasing to businesses.

In contrast SME leasing  plays  a theNetherlands.smaller role in What  kind  of  SMEs  use  leasing?When looking at different enterprise sizeclasses in the EU the use of most external sources  on  averageincreases  with  company  size  (see  Table4); the same applies to leasing (includinghire purchase and factoring).financing According  to  the  2013  results  of  theEuropean  Commission   s  (2013a)  SMEs   Access  to  Finance  Survey  only  19%  ofSMEs  with  one  to  nine  employees  usedleasing (including hire purchase and factoring) as a funding source compared to43% of business with 10 to 49 employees  54%  of  businesses  with  50  to  249employees and 60% of large enterprises(with 250 or more employees). to the According EuropeanCommission  (2013a)  there  was  also  adifference  by  turnover  While  approximately  half  of  the  companies  with  aturnover  greater  than  e2m  made  use  ofleasing hire purchase or factoring only24%  of  SMEs  with  a  smaller  turnoverused this type of financing. SMEs in theindustry  sector  were  more  likely  thanthose  in  other  sectors  to  have  used  thissource     42% had done so while thosein  the  trade  sector  were  least  likely(31%). These results are broadly in linewith  the  findings  of  Oxford  Economics(2011).2While  it  is  generally  difficult  foryoung firms to access external financingsources SMEs    access to leasing seems todevelop quicker than the access to othersources of external financing as depictedin  Table  5.  According  to  the  OxfordEconomics  (2011)  survey  the  relativeimportance of leasing was highest for relatively  young  enterprises  aged  betweentwo and five years.The  advantage  of  leasing  for  youngSMEs and other enterprises that are considered  to  bear  comparably  high  creditrisk is also shown by relatively low rejection rates. Despite an increase from 2007to  2010  leasing  remained  the  financingsource with the lowest rate of unsuccessful applications. Moreover the success rates in obtaining  leasing  finance  are  relatively  similarbetween  the  so  called  gazelles  i.e.  theyoung  highgrowth  enterprises  and  allSMEs.  For  other  forms  of  finance  (e.g.bank  overdrafts  or  credit  lines)  gazellesshow  considerably  lower  approval  ratesthan other enterprises in most countries(see  also  Table  6).  Thus  the  OECD(2012)  concludes  that     [l]easing  is  theform  of  finance  that  appears  to  beequally suitable for enterprises with difTable 3 Estimated new SME leasing volumes by country in 2010nbc20 18 16 14 12 10 8 6 4 2 0 NL  PL  SE  ES  UK  IT  DE  FR  Source Oxford Economics (2011).

When looking at country level largedifferences  in  the  use  of  leasing  appear(see Table 7). In the latest period (Augustto  October  2013) theEuropean Commission (2013ab) surveywas  conducted  34.5%  of  SMEs  usedleasing hire purchase or factoring in thewhole  EU.  However  while  approximately  half  of  all  SMEs  made  use  offor  which instruments these in  Germany  andEstonia  their  use  was  relatively  smallamong  SMEs  in  Cyprus  but  also  inRomania and Greece. Why  and  how  do  SMEs  use  leasing?According to Oxford Economics (2011)SMEs  on  average  have  a  variety  of  reasons  for  their  decision  to  lease  an  asset(see Table 8)     the main reason seems tobe  price  considerations  (price  of  leasingrelative to other financing forms). The  importance  of  different  reasonsfor  using  leasing  becomes  clearer  whenTable 5 Use of financing source by SME age class in 2010 70% 60% 50% 40% 30% 20% 10% 0% PersonalfundsLeasingFactoringLoan <3yearsOverdraft Loan >3yearsTradecreditRetainedearningsPrivateequity<2 years       2   5 years       5   10 years       >10 yearsSource Oxford Economics (2011).looking at different SME size classes. Forexample mediumsized enterprises seemto  lease  due  to  price  considerationsbetter  cash  flow  management  and  theabsence of the need to provide collateral.In  contrast  microenterprises  stated  taxbenefits  next  to  price  considerations  asmain reasons to use leasing. Interestinglythe  absence  of  collateral  requirementsseems  to  be  less  important  for  microenterprises  than  for  small  or  mediumsized firms.Reasons  for  leasing  vary  more  overcountries than over sectors; this could bedue to different tax and regulatory environments.  For  instance  collateral  considerations  were  most inFrance and Italy while tax benefits weremainly stated in the UK. important The  choice  of  a  particular  financingsource  can  also  depend  on  the  specificinvestment type e.g. on the asset whichis financed. SMEs typically lease a broadrange of assets; however vehicles of various types account by far for the biggestshare. Support  measures  in  favour  of  leasing  forSMEs. Leasing  is  an  important  financingtool for SMEs which provides financingclose  to  the  investment  periods  of  theleased  assets.  However  in  the  currentfinancial  and  regulatory  environmentalso  the  leasing  companies  themselveshave  distorted  access  to  (re)financing.Public  support  of  this  instrument  canhelp to mitigate market weaknesses andto  enhance  the  access  to  finance  forSMEs.The problems are different dependingon  the  ownership  model  of  the  leasingcompanies. According to Leaseurope andKPMG (2012) 50% of European leasingcompanies were bank related 18% captives  and  32%  independent  in  2010.5However in terms of shares of new volumes     90%  of  the  European  leasingmarket  is  in  the  hands  of  bankownedleasing  companies     (Mignerey  2012).Moreover     whether  bankowned  captive  or  independent  European  leasingcompanies  heavily  rely  on  the  bankingsector fund their  operations   (Mignerey 2012).to The  financial  crisis  has  not  onlyaffected banks and their leasing affiliatesbut the leasing market in general has beenparticularly affected by the worsening ofrefinancing  conditions.  According  to  asurvey among German leasing companies(HartmannWendels  and  Pytlik  2010)leasing companies which are independentfrom  banks  and  manufacturers  were  hitthe  most.  Several  banks  have  reduced  orfully abandoned the refinancing of leasing3 THE IMPORTANCE OF LEASING FOR SME FINANCINGTable 6 Success rates in obtaining leasing in 2010  100  %90 80 70 60 50 40 30 20 10 0 BelgiumBulgariaDenm arkGerm anyIrelandGreeceSpainFranceItalyLatviaLithuaniaNetherlandsPolandSlovakiaFinlandSwedenUK Young highgrowth enterprises (gazelles)       Other highgrowth enterprises       Other enterprisesSource OECD (2012) and Eurostat.companies due to scarcity of banks    ownresources  regulatory  requirements  ormanagement  decisions  to  stronger  concentrate on core business activities.HartmannWendels  and  Pytlik  (2010)state that a significant reduction of activerefinancing partners was reported by leasing  companies  in  particular  by  smallerones.  Moreover  collateral  requirementshave considerably increased.According  to  Mignerey  (2012)  thedecision of some parent banks to downgrade  leasing  to  the  status  of  a     noncore    tounderstand  leasing  did  not  bring  whatbanks  needed leasingrequired  what  banks  were  lacking  i.e.capital and liquidity   .business  was i.e.  deposits;    simple These  developments  are  differentfrom past recessions when leasing companies were    only    hit by reduced overall  investment  activities  which  couldoften  be  compensated  by  an  increase  inleasing  penetration  rates  (HartmannWendels  and  Pytlik  2010).  This  timethe  deterioration  in  the  access  to  refinancing  came  on  top.  Moreover  manyindependent  leasing  companies  are  alsohit by structural problems such as a lowequity  base  or  a  lack  of  specialisationwhich often leads to relatively low residual  values  of  the  leased  assets  in  theirbalance sheets. Support  by  the  European  InvestmentFund (EIF) can mitigate such market distortions  thereby  enabling  the  financingof new leases to SMEs and contributingto  enhance  their  access  to  longtermfinancing.64The  following  section  describes  arange of EIF guarantee products that areavailable  to  help  the  leasing  industrysupport European SMEs. The focus is onthose  products  where  the  EIF  uses  itsown resources (in full or in part) to fulfilits  central  mission  to  support  Europe   sSMEs (see Tables 9 and 10).In addition to these products the EIFalso  operates  mandates  (including  fromthe  European  Commission)  to  channelEU  and  governmental  funding  to  SMEsthrough instrument  programmes  such  as  CIP  JEREMIE  andProgress Microfinance. financial Further options for leasing companiesunder  new  mandates  at  Europeannational  and  regional  levels  can  beexpected in the future.Concluding remarks. The intention of thispaper  was  to  enhance  the  awareness  ofleasing (and its importance) as additionalfinancing thatexpands the access to short and mediumterm financing for capital equipment. for  SMEs technique Leasing is an alternative instrument tofacilitate  access  to  finance;  it  enables  inparticular new/young enterprises (including  the  so  called     gazelles     (OECD2012  and  2014))  without  credit  trackrecord  and  limited  possibilities  to  provide  collateral  the  use  of  capital  equipment.  As  such  it  also  mitigates  marketweaknesses of SME lending.SMEs  expect  leasing  to  stay  of  highrelevance as integral part of their financing tool set.

An originated portfolio of leases can be sold to a separatebankruptcyremote entity and funds can be raised in the capital market via the issuance of debt. EIF can facilitate the placement of debt with thirdparty investors byguaranteeing the timely payment of debt   s interest and principal.

Lessor typically retains equity piece Target originatorsHow can EIF help?EIF targets financial institutions committed to SME financing. This includesleasing originators of all types and sizes such as    Banks    leasing subsidiaries;    Banks;     Independent leasing companies including smaller unrated companiestypically funded through bank lending. EIF typically guarantees senior debt sized between c50m and c100m.EIF can help leasing companies find financing in challenging times. EIF has a pool ofinvestors keen to invest in products guaranteed by EIF with an attractive allin cost for theoriginators. The confidence given by EIF   s participation in a transaction as a guarantor could also makeit easier to find third party investors.EIF will be involved in the early stages of any transaction and will help guide firsttimeissuers through the process.RequirementsEIF has a flexible approach aimed at facilitating deal execution. The EIF Guarantee is charged at a market rate dependent on the risk taken by EIF. EIF will also request aletter from the leasing company committing to lend a certain amount to SMEs as a function of the Guarantee. EIF will always perform its own due diligence and requirecertain data from leasing companies in order to assess the risk of the transaction.5 THE IMPORTANCE OF LEASING FOR SME FINANCING                     die und 2012. im  Leasing.

It enables leasing companies to share their risk with EIF on their new leasing activity in exchange for an attractive fixed fee. Under RSI EIF provides uncapped guarantees to leasing companies (including thosementioned under Structured Finance) on 50% of each eligible lease.

Mechanics of the guaranteeRSI supports SMEs and small midcaps (companies with fewer than 500employees) that have innovation potential or a focus on R&D. These are definedas companies that meet one of the following criteria     They invest in producing or developing innovative products processes and/orservices that present a risk of technological or industrial failure; or     They are innovationdriven    fast growing enterprises    i.e. their workforce orturnover has increased by at least 20% p.a. over the last three years; or    They are    innovative    enterprises i.e. satisfying at least one    innovationcriterion    out of a set of predefined eligibility criteria.Benefits to leasing companiesThe origination credit analysis decision process and servicing are fully delegated tothe leasing company based eligibility criteria set ex ante. The Guarantee is fully automated and as such automatically covers leases for 50% ofany principal and interest loss. Payments under the Guarantee will be made upondefault with a prorata sharing of recoveries.EIF has developed a lean and pragmatic quarterly reporting system.By reducing their risk leasing companies can reduce their risk margins and increase both competitiveness and market share. Leasing companies not active or less activein the innovative SMEs and small midcap space can venture into this area with the knowledge that losses can be minimised with the help of RSI.6 '
