Journal of Islamic Social Economics and Development (JISED) 4(17) 7488. ___________________________________________________________________________  Abstract In a recent survey conducted by PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) on Global Banking and Capital Markets (BCM) a vast majority of CEOs (93%) identified technology changes as a key contributor to transforming the sector over the next five years. The financial services sector must be able to respond to this transformation and therefore will require labour talent that combines strong financial and digital skills. Through this report the study explore the  financial technology (Fintech) industry to understand how the industry and educational institutions have responded to the increasing need for sustaining the Islamic finance curriculum and improving the talents. The objective of this research is twofold; first the research turns to highlight Malaysia responses on the role of fintech in sustaining the education and the issues of talent shortages. The responses have been categorized into three primary themes (1) Educational Interventions (2) Incubators and ExtraCurricular Events; and (3) Government and Policy Interventions. Secondly the research consolidates and reframes the discussion by acknowledging that multiple opportunities for improvement exist within Malaysia   s Islamic Fintech ecosystem helping to identify a series of suggestions that could be considered by the local industry and education institutions.   Keywords Fintech Islamic Finance Education Talent Malaysia ___________________________________________________________________________  Introduction  Financial technology or  fintech is fast gaining traction in the financial services and products industry  as  both  startups  and  traditional  finance  companies  such  as  banks  or  insurance companies  proactively  incorporate  methods  to  stay  in  the  lead.  Meanwhile  KPMG  defines Fintech as technologybased businesses that compete against enable and or collaborate with financial institutions. According to    Fintech and Financial Services Initial Considerations    a  74             report  prepared  by  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF)  staff  team  fintech  leverages  the explosion  of  big  data  on  individuals  and  firms  advances  in  artificial  intelligence  (AI) computing  power  cryptography  and  the  reach  of  the  internet  (EY  2016a).  The  strong complementarities  among  these  technologies  are  giving  rise  to  an  impressive  array  of  new applications touching on services from payments to financing asset management insurance and advice.  This paper focuses in Malaysia as part of the ASEAN region as well as its unique mix of rural suburban and urban population is what makes it the ideal environment for the testing and even launching  of  the  Fintech  solutions  that  targets  the  global  Islamic  Finance  market.  The  chief executive  officer  of  Malaysia  Digital  Economy  Corp  (MDEC)  called  Datuk  Yasmin Mohamood readily opened Malaysia   s doors to  Fintech   s companies and startups. Malaysia Digital Economy Corp (MDEC) can be defined as a government institution that is charged with the  responsibility  of  pushing  forward  the  country   s  technologyforward  agenda.  A  huge percentage of the country   s population are Muslims this is because Islam is recognized as the official  religion  for  the  country.  In  fact  approximately  61%  of  its  people  or  even  more  are Muslims i.e. 18.4 million people in numerical form. This fact is what offers a great opportunity for all the financial technology solutions which are fully compliant with Islamic law prevalent in the country. Talent development solutions may go beyond the circle of the financial services community  to  include  other  business  communities  such  as  legal  fraternity  Government officials and IT solution providers. The advancement of the industry is also dependent on these parts of the private and public sector. Their training needs must also be met through structured training programmes to facilitate their understanding of the specifics of Islamic finance and its value propositions. Malaysia is such one prime example in leading the    talent    charge. This has culminated in a thriving Islamic finance environment with numerous institutions catering to a wide range of industry needs. These institutions such as the International Centre for Education in  Islamic  Finance  (INCEIF)  and  the  International  Shariah  Research  Academy  for  Islamic finance (ISRA) are gaining worldwide recognition in producing talent  and research needs to support the growth of the vibrant industry. In putting in place talent development strategies the vision moving forward for human capital development in Islamic finance is to ensure a steady stream  of  competent  and  versatile  talent to  support  greater  innovation  and  dynamism  of  the Islamic finance industry.  Problem Statement While interest in the global fintech landscape has expanded at pace in recent years propelled by  the  ubiquity  of  smartphones  shariacompliant  fintech  has  lagged  behind  as  potential investors remain cautious. Yet those involved in the sector believe it offers strong opportunities and that steps being taken to develop fintech ecosystems in key markets will help to grow the industry. According to consultancy Accenture of the more than $50bn that has been invested in fintech globally  since 2010 just 1% has gone to companies in the Middle East and north Africa region which is home to onequarter of the world   s Muslim population. Globally the number of institutions offering Islamic finance degrees has risen from 141 in 2014 to 191 in 2016  according  to  ICDThomson  Reuters  Islamic  Finance  Development  reports.  Some employers are demanding that graduates have specialist knowledge of shariacompliant finance according to Celia de Anca the director of IE   s SaudiSpanish Center for Islamic Economics and Finance. In addition employers have identified skill gaps to the experiences and training of graduates whom likely to be employed in fintech organization. This create issues of shortages among  the  graduates  especially  from  social  sciences  field  such  as  finance  and  business  and information technology background. The integration of advanced technology skills is required 75              by  the  financial  services  industry.  The  clear  gap  can  be  seen  here  is  the  absence of  balance educational  curriculum  combining  the  integration  of  skills  that  can  fulfill  the  demand  of industries.  Thus the study discusses the role of Fintech in Islamic Finance to understand how the industry and  have  responded  to  the  increasing  need  for  the  talents  and  sustaining  the  education.  The objectives of this study is twofold; first examines the current challenges industry stakeholders are facing and secondly the paper compiles and reframes the discussion by acknowledging that multiple opportunities for improvement exist within Malaysia   s Fintech ecosystem helping to identify a series of suggestions that could be considered by the local industry and educational institutions.   Figure 1 Main Types of Services Offered by Fintech  Sources Fintech Survey Report CFA Institute 2016   Literature Review    The growth of Fintech in Islamic Finance  Fintech   s penetration into Islamic finance is still in its infancy with a relatively small number of participants. However the potential disruptions to traditional Islamic finance should not be underestimated.  The  disruptions  can  swing  both  ways.  From  the  Islamic  finance  consumer perspective fintech disruptions are largely positive. Fintech innovation provides choices which are more aligned to individual needs. With more options consumers enjoy more competitive financial services cost. Latest technology embraced by fintech leveraging on Internet mobile devices  and  social  media  integrations  make  financial  transactions  more  automated  userfriendly and more convenient thus a superior customer experience.  Ghazali  and  Yasuoka  (2018) mentioned in  their  study  that  crowdfunding  and  P2P  financing options from fintech are also a blessing for individuals or SMEs (small and medium enterprises) that  require  financing  but  do  not  qualify  for  financing  from  traditional  Islamic  financial institutions (IFIs).  Investors are also entitled to higher potential returns by investing directly into the business ventures that they finance via the online financing marketplace. Furthermore one  of  the  best  things  that  has  happened  with  fintech  is  that  it  is  able  to  provide  access  to financial solutions for the roughly two billion adults who are currently unbanked as reported by  World  Bank.  On  the  flip  side  traditional  Islamic  finance  providers  face  more  intensified 76              competition with fintech sharing their pies. In order to remain competitive they have to reduce financing profit margins and service fees.  The rise of Fintech has opened up a world of possibilities for Islamic Financial Institution (IFIs). It  is  a  winwin  for  both  parties  whereby  IFIs  can  leverage  on  their  ATM  Network  Branch Infrastructure and integrate with Fintech   s platform to increase their offerings and services. IFIs will have to be at the forefront of the latest development in Fintech financial business models and collaborate with them to grow the products and services offerings. There is also potential for  IFIs  to  have  their  own  venture  capital  funding  initiatives  under  equity  financing (Musharakah  or  Mudharabah)  to  potential  Fintech  and  make  them  part  of  their  internal innovation team. On the other hand Fintech can also leverage on ethical banking offered by IFIs  to  scale  up  their  offerings  using  collaboration  approach  and  can  tap  wider  markets including Muslims and NonMuslims.  It provides an amazing platform and opportunity for banks to promote financial inclusion  by serving  underbanked  and  unbanked  communities.  Fintech  is  also  associated  with  disrupting traditional models by creating services with or without intervention of financial intermediaries. In order to remain competitive financial sectors and especially banks should be proactive in adopting Fintech. A recent Boston Consulting Group study showed that over the next five years corporate banks that remain digital laggards could see profits drop by as much as 1530 per cent relative to their digitally fastmoving competitors. Islamic fintech companies are also appearing in  Muslimmajority  countries  in  Asia  and  in  more  established  fintech  hubs  in  Europe  and beyond  with  areas  such  as  crowdfunding  peertopeer  (P2P)  lending  and  digital  wealth management considered the most promising. Despite this so far overall numbers with regards to Islamic fintech are small with limited investment in the sector.  According to Digital Finance Institute (2016) attracting and retaining high quality talent is very significantly give most prevalent challenges for the  Fintech companies. This is because from the financial services view leveraging technology is critical in creating sustainable advantage in distribution efficiency of business processes and sales and marketing. Therefore this create a  systemic  challenges  as  current  literature  indicates  that  the  shortage  of  technical  talent  is directly  associated  with the  growing  demand  for  diverse  and  increasingly  complex  software system and the demand for technical talent is growing much faster than the educational capacity of current institution (Digital Finance Institute 2016). In addition Wolfe (2016) and Nordicity (2012) mentioned one of the most challenging and underlying issues to address is whether a sufficient supply of graduates is interested in pursuing education that will train them to work within the digital technologies across the economy.  Challenges in Sustaining Islamic Finance Education and Talent in Malaysia In Malaysia the growing momentum of IFSI suggests that a significant portion of the remaining workforce  of  56000  to  be  employed  by  the  Financial  Services  Industry  (FSI)  by  2020  will comprise  Islamic  Finance  professionals.  Through  the  Economic  Transformation  Programme (ETP) student enrolment in Islamic Finance will increase from the current 6000 students to 54000. The ETP also targets to increase the number of employable Islamic Finance graduates from 64.8% to 80% by 2015. The recent establishment of the Financial Services Talent Council will be pivotal in developing attracting and retaining talent in the sector through engagements with the FSI the private sector as well as education and training institutes.   77             A report on Global Islamic Finance Education 2013 (Yurizk Academy 2013) indicates that whilst the Asian region hosts about 43% of the global Islamic Finance education and knowledge service  providers  Malaysia  ranks  behind  Pakistan  as  the  second  highest  Islamic  Finance education provider with over 86 institutions offering Islamic Finance education of which 48 are  academic  institutions.  Malaysia  ranks  highest  amongst  38  providers  for  professional development  programmes  including  certification  training  seminars  and  workshops.  These notable  institutions  include  Islamic  Banking  and  Finance  Institute  Malaysia  (IBFIM) International Islamic University Malaysia (IIUM) and the International Centre for   Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF). Besides academic programmes a number of professionalbased and  certification  programmes  are  offered  to  cater  to  the  needs  of  the  IFSI.  Malaysia  is  also recognised  to  be at the  forefront  of  research  with  the  setting  up  of  the  International  Shariah Research Academy to promote applied research in the area of Shariah and Islamic Finance. The Academy  acts  as  a  repository  of  knowledge  for  Shariah  views  and  undertakes  studies  on contemporary  issues  in  the  IFSI.  Attempts  have  been  made  to  professionalise  the  Islamic Finance practitioners through the setting up of The Association of Chartered Islamic Finance Professionals (ACIFP). Besides serving as a professional membership body ACIFP also aims to conduct Continuous Professional Development programmes for its members.  Human  capital  development  best  practice  begins  at  the  education  level.  Despite  over  378 institutions providing Islamic finance education globally there is a lack of consistency in the delivery of courses; in academic information and definitions; in assessments curriculum and even the competencies candidates acquire. Many courses from reputable universities are heavy on  the  Islamic  finance  knowledge  but  lack  the  practical  knowledge  needed  to  work  in  the industry  and  innovate  through  technology.  It  is  essential  for  the  industry  to  address  this mismatch between education and skills and to work with educators to formulate develop and agree  on  professional  standards  and  the  use  of  Fintech  and  digital  expertise  to  raise competencies.  Thus the  problem  requires  a more  structured  approach towards  establishing  a feeder  education  system  for  the  industry.  There  needs  to  be  greater  collaboration  between academia and industry to define the types of research and curricula that will produce the skills and expertise that the industry would need. Professional associations for Islamic bankers and Shariah  experts  need  to  be  established  with  a  certification  system  to  encourage  continuous professional development in the industry. The human capital managers of Islamic banks would also  need  to  define  and  enforce  the  specific  technical  competency  requirements  for  Islamic bankers.  Methodology  Data Collection In determining the scope of this study the focus is on reviewed articles that central and relevant to the context of Fintech and Islamic Accounting and Finance education.  The majority of the resources  leveraged  in  this  paper  were  found  through  online  research  and  publicly  available documents including but not limited to academic peer reviewed literature government (local regional and national) publications and papers university websites financial sector reports and leading  industry  program  websites.  Based  on  an  extensive  literature  review  of  the  Islamic Fintech talent shortage and the industry strategies that have been employed in response to the talent  shortage  the  following  three  strategies  categories  were  developed  and  employed  as framework for investigation in this study.   78             Figure 2 Strategies to Overcome Talent Shortage Educational InterventionsIncubators and Extra Curricular EventsGovernment and Policy InterventionsNote The three strategies are the suggestions for overcoming the talent shortage.  Educational Interventions  The educational institutions have taken multiple approaches towards increasing the interest and competency of students in Islamic Fin Tech related skills. Universities and colleges are strongly considering  the  industry  need  with  respect  to  employable  skills  to  ensure  that the  education being  delivered  is  directly  assisting  students  in  gaining  the  appropriate  skills  needed  to  find employment  within  the  Islamic  Fintech  sector.  Common  university  responses  to  the  Fintech skill shortage which are examined further in this study curriculum reviews  Fintech courses and various policy provided by the Ministries of Education and universities.  Incubators and Extra Curricular Events Educational institutions government and industry partners have responded to the Fintech talent shortage and sustaining the education by financing and promoting various forms of programs and extra curricular activities to students. These can include hackathons mentorship programs independent course offerings for specific skill enhancement conferences and both privatelyfunded  and  publiclyfunded  events.  Additionally  recent  trends  in  attracting  and  developing financial  technology  talent  include  the  establishment  of  incubators  and  seed  accelerator programs.  These  programs  are  meant  to  accelerate  successful  venture  creation  by  providing specific incubation services focused on education and mentoring during an intensive program of limited duration (Cohen and Hochberg 2014; Miller and Bound 2011). This report discusses several incubator programs that have been created in an effort to grow the Fintech industry and reduce the  current  talent  shortage. Each program  is  diverse  in  format  and  purpose  differing greatly  based  on  which  sector  finances  the  program.  This  ranges  from  private  industry  to government  and  universities.  More  specifically  universities  have  introduced  progressive incubator programs and promote them as a means to facilitate student entrepreneurship provide industry with a direct connection to student startup innovation and talent and give recruitment agencies a way to identify employable talent (Pauwels et al. 2016).  Government and Policy Interventions The rise of recent government and policy interventions has become a prominent response to closing the talent shortage within the  Fintech sector. One of the biggest challenges facing the Malaysia  Fintech  ecosystem  is  the  lack  of  ability  to  engage  with  the  government  and  to collaborate  at  a  national  level  (Digital  Finance  Institute  2016).  Therefore  purposebased interventions have been recommended and introduced to directly address the skills gap. These interventions  include  financial  incentives  for  new  graduate  startup  networks  streamlined immigration processes meant to attract foreign talent and various policy papers that illustrate the  many  opportunities  that  local  national  and  regional  governments  could  implement  to support the Fintech sector. 79               Result and Finding In this section the study provides an overview of Malaysia to examine the contribution that the country  has  made  towards  sustaining  Islamic  Finance  education  and  lessening  the  talent shortage within its respective Fintech system. This will also help identify where gaps currently exist  and  how  industry  educational  institutions  and  level  of  government  can  collaborate  to produce well equipped and suitable employees for the emerging Fintech sector.  Malaysia  Responses  in  Sustaining  the  Islamic  Finance  Education  and  Talent Shortage Islamic  banks  and  financial  service  providers  in  Malaysia  which  is  currently  riding  out  a slowdown in global growth of the sector have been told they should develop more new products and  embrace  innovative  tools  from  financial  technology  (fintech)  startups  in  order  to  better navigate  through  the  current  disruptive  phase  the  global  financial  sector  is  experiencing. Islamic finance fintech has indeed already found influential supporters.   Japan  are  doing  Omar in  Europe  America  and According to Marzunisham Omar the assistant governor of Malaysia   s central bank the growth of fintech provides    innovative opportunities    within the entire financial sector and thus cannot be  ignored  by  the  Islamic  finance industry  particularly  in  Malaysia  where  Islamic  banking assets  are  at  close  to  30%  of  the  entire  banking  system  and  where  the  number  of  digitally knowledgeable consumers and mobile banking users is rapidly growing in line with most other Southeast countries. Omar who spoke at the Islamic Fintech Dialogue 2017 held on October 10 in Kuala Lumpur said that the Islamic finance industry in Malaysia should invest more in financial technology and support fintech startups and talent while at the same time they would have  to  reassess  and  reengineer  their  traditional  business  models  and  open  up  to  digital transformation as a new strategy on all company levels be it operational structural or cultural. This could best be done by entering digital partnerships and alliances with  fintech like many conventional  banks said. He noted that while the number of Islamic fintech startups innovation labs and incubators are generally on the rise they are not as visible in the Islamic finance world as their conventional counterparts.  This  would  underline  the  necessity  of  established  Islamic  finance  institutions supporting  the  upcoming  segment  and  help  develop  solutions  that  make  Islamic  banking quicker cheaper simpler more efficient and more convenient. This would enable them to open up  new  digital  markets  that  were  barely  thinkable just  a  few  years  ago  by  deploying  digital financing platforms for small and medium companies or robot advisory for Islamic investors or online takaful just to quote a few examples of what would be possible.               80                Figure 3 Number of Islamic fintech startups by country   Educational Interventions Malaysia has a high density of top ranked education institutions which including to be listed in top ranked universities in the world (World University Rankings 2016). Efforts are underway to  develop  a  blueprint  for  an  lslamic  finance  (IF)based  investment  technology  platform marking yet another effort for Islamic financial technology (fintech). As technology is playing an increasing role in the banking and financial world businesses universities and organizations have  started  offering  seminars  masterclasses  and  courses  covering  the  emerging  fintech ecosystem.  For  instance  to  strengthen  the  Fintech  talent  pipeline  many  universities  have promoted Science Technology Engineering Mathematic (STEM) programs as well as specific Fintech  education  within  universities  through  specialized  course  programs  apprenticeships and sponsored work placements (EY 2016b). The Malaysia expressed similar support towards STEM education as the United States actively integrating web development and coding into curricula  as  part  of  national  innovation  programs  (EY  2016b).  Among  the  first  steps  to strengthen STEM education is through the Malaysia Education Blueprint (20132025) namely to increase the interest of students and teachers awareness of STEM education.  STEM  Integration  elaborate  definition  Johnson  et  al.  (2016)  details  the  six  core  STEM integration namely  1. Using meaningful learning context and relate to student real life 2.  Challenge  student  potential  using  design  approach  Engineering  to  develop  critical  and creative thinking through activities that be related 3. Student aided design technology can learn from failure in designing solutions in engineering design with existing design. 4.  Implementing  teaching  and  learning  that  is  integrated  with  science  and  mathematics  and subjects relevant like Literature Humanities and Social Studies 5. Implementing teaching and learning activities that are student centered so that students are actively involved in teaching and learning 6. Train students to collaborate and communicate in conducting educational activities  According to Bahrum et al. (2017) curriculum transformation refers to efforts to improve the learning  program  to  improve  student  outcomes  to  achieve  six  student  aspirations  namely knowledge thinking skills leadership skills bilingual proficiency ethics and spirituality and 81              national identity as recommended in the Malaysian Education Blueprint (MEB) 2013  2025. this transformation is performed on content pedagogy and assessment as follows  1.  Content restructured and improved to ensure students are provided with the knowledge skills and values that are relevant to the current needs for the challenges of the 21st century.  2.  Pedagogical  emphasis  on  learning  in  depth  approach  to  teaching  and  learning  based  on higher order thinking skills (HOTS). Focus is given to the inquirybased learning problem solving  contextual  learning  collaborative  learning  projectbased  learning  and  STEM approach. 3.  Assessment is carried out continuously to ensure the progress and achievement of student learning. Assessment in teaching and learning is conducted in the form of summative and formative. Teachers assess the extent to which students master the learning standards with reference to the prescribed performance standards. Development and actual achievement level of students recorded and reported descriptively to students and parents  On  the  other  hand  at  higher  education  institutional  level  Global  Islamic  university International  Centre  for  Education  in  Islamic  Finance  (INCEIF)  and  national  research  and development (R&D) centre in information and communications technology (ICT) Mimos Bhd will collaborate in R&D of ICT in particular the big data analytics deep learning and fintech. Both institutions would seek to exchange personnel for purposes that include teaching research training study visits internships or attachment. Furthermore INCEIF and MIMOS may also cooperate  in  undertaking  other  activities  such  as  fieldtesting  technology  transfer  and commercialisation  of  technological  products  according  to  a  statement  released  by  INCEIF. INCEIF president/CEO Prof Datuk Dr Azmi Omar said the collaboration was a fine example of likeminded partners budding on each other   s strengths and strategic focus.   Due to the very recent development of the field the skills pertaining to the fintech sector have not  yet  been  organised  in  a  widelyrecognised  supporting  body  of  knowledge  to  be  used  by taught programmes. The natural first step in the development of academic fintech programmes pertains to efforts for the integration of the distinctive disciplines into comprehensive applied programmes. This development can again be seen as an opportunity to enhance the domains of interdisciplinarity industryrelevance knowledge exchange and social impact by the academic programmes of business schools. A large number of existing nonfintech programmes stems from  a  single  background  i.e.  ICT  engineering  finance  accounting  business  economics management or law. The finance and business curriculum is largely unknown in ICT disciplines and an integrated ICT curriculum is largely absent or limited in most finance programmes and business schools. The study found that the approach needed is a synthesis of the educational curriculum in finance and ICT bringing the two strands together in a more cohesive way. This involves a greater emphasis by business schools on the planning integration and delivery of courses  related  to  data  processing  and  analytics    programming  languages  along  with  new elements  regarding  the  digital  transfer  of  value  such  as  blockchain  and  distributed  ledger technologies. Hence this synthesis of a curriculum must rely on multidisciplinary collaboration between  academic  experts.  In  addition  there  are  various  initiative  to  form  industry collaboration with education institutions through hosting internship programmes for students.  The study have been conducted by  Zaidi et al. (2017) also revealed that fintech firms find talent shortages an acute issue with over half (60 per cent) saying that there was a lack of startup or fintech talent in the markets they operate in skills gaps are in technology and software product management and sales and marketing. Most of the fintech firms are still relying on personal 82              connections (57 per cent) and recommendations (48 per cent) to hire talent. Respondents also believe  that  the  government  can  do  more  to  enable  the  growth  of  the  sector  in  particular increasing  tax  incentives  for  angel  investors  in  early  stage  investment  (78  per  cent)  and introducing policy reforms to make it easier to hire employees (78 per cent). Locally all the Malaysian Fintech firms surveyed say they have trouble hiring the talent to meet the needs and growth of the industry with 73 per cent saying that there is a shortage of fintech talent in the country.  The  top  three  areas  of  talent  shortage  for  Malaysian  fintech  are  in  technology  and software (73 per cent) sales (27 per cent) and compliance (27 per cent). Unfortunately skills are  in  short  supply  in  the  local  banking  industry  94  per  cent  of  banks  find  that  the  lack  of competent talents is affecting the productivity of their business according to a survey by the Asian Institute of Finance (AIF) last year.   Figure 4 Current Form of Collaboration Between Industry and Education Institution Source Frost and Sullivan (2018) Analysis Based On Demand Side Survey Data  Incubators and Extra Curricular Event  In order to attract and grow the skills of available talent within the Malaysia Fintech ecosystem multiple institutions and organizations have developed Fintech related programs and events. In Malaysia  there  is  an  association  so  called  Fintech  Association  of  Malaysia  (FAOM)  which aspires to be the key enabler and a national platform to support Malaysia to be the leading hub for  Fintech  innovation  and  investment  in  the  region.    The  association  also  help  facilitate ecosystem collaboration between Fintech stakeholders in Malaysia with the key objectives to support  the  Malaysian  Fintech  community  build  awareness  and  trust  in  Fintech  startups  to advocate for better policy on behalf of the members. Founding members of FAOM included companies  like  payment  solution  services  GHL  System  Bhd  and  SoftSpace  online  insurer GetCover financial comparison services Jirnexu and GoBear. The association which launched in  conjunction  with  the  Fintech  Payment  Conference  on  Saturday  was  approved  by  the Registrar of Societies (ROS) on October 24 and consisted of members 57 members so far. The FAOM   s formation comes on the heels of the Equity Crowd Funding (ECF) and PeertoPeer (P2P) Lending operators announcing their own association the Registered Digital Markets of Malaysia.  The  Malaysian  central  bank  governor  has  been  extremely  vocal  and  proactive  in  fintech initiatives. The conducive environment for  fintech development and Malaysia   s proven track record in Islamic finance make Malaysia a good candidate to lead Islamic  fintech movement. As one of the    bigfour    global centers in Islamic finance Malaysia is well positioned to take 83              advantage  of  the  opportunities.  Malaysia   s  vibrant  Islamic  finance industry  which  has  been attributed to the strong government and regulatory support could be leveraged further to push for Islamic fintech agenda. With the rising importance of Islamic Finance in the global financial services industry the University of Reading Malaysia is positioning itself to be a leader in the delivery of higher education programmes centred on the discipline. Henley Business School at the  University  of  Reading  Malaysia  acknowledges  the  growing  demand  from  financial institutions  worldwide  for  specialist  professionals  trained  in  Islamic  finance  practices.  In February 2017 it signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) paving the way for the two organisations to offer a Master   s degree in Investment Banking and Islamic Finance along with INCEIF   s Professional Certificate in Islamic Finance specialising in Islamic Capital Market. In April the university formed a similar partnership with Islamic Banking and Finance Institute Malaysia (IBFIM) to collaborate on tertiary level training programmes on Islamic finance. The partnership aimed to produce  graduates  accustomed  to  developments  in  the  Islamic  financial  services  sector equipped  with  strong  foundations  and  good  basic  skill  sets  with  the  ability  to  meet  current industry needs and trends. In line with the university   s aim in promoting education on Islamic Finance Associate Professor in Finance at Henley Business School at the University of Reading Malaysia Dr Nafis Alam was invited as a workshop director on Fintech and Islamic Finance at the 2018 Gulf Research Meeting hosted at the University of Cambridge.  Meanwhile a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) was signed by MIMOS Bhd (MIMOS) and the International Centre for Education in Islamic Finance (INCEIF) to develop a blueprint for an Islamic financebased investment technology platform. INCIEF was established in 2005 by  Bank Negara Malaysia the Central Bank of Malaysia to develop and nurture talents and expertise in the area of Islamic finance under the MIFC (Malaysia International Islamic Finance Centre). MIMOS a strategic agency under the Ministry of Science Technology and Innovation (MOSTI) is Malaysia   s premier Applied Research and Development Centre in Information and Communications  Technology  Industrial  Electronics  Technology  and  NanoSemiconductor Technology. The MOU was signed by INCEIF President & CEO Prof. Dato    Dr Azmi Omar and  MIMOS  President  &  CEO  Mr  Ahmad  Rizan  Ibrahim.  The  collaboration  is  expected  to drive greater Islamic Finance development and facilitate exploration of its potential. Under the MOU INCEIF and MIMOS will collaborate in research and development of information and communications technology (ICT) in particular the areas of Big Data Analytics Deep Learning and  Fintech. The two institutions would seek to exchange personnel for a range of purposes including teaching research training study visits internships or attachment. Further INCEIF and MIMOS may also cooperate in undertaking other activities such as fieldtesting technology transfer and commercialisation of technological products.  Government and Policy Interventions In June 2016 BNM established Financial Technology Exposure Group (FTEG) which would serve as the focal point on fintechrelated queries that include matters related to regulation and adoption of fintech by the FSI (financial services industry) sector. The momentum continued with  a  discussion  paper  on  fintech  regulatory  sandbox  framework  issued  on  July  29  2016.    Regulatory  sandbox     is  a  concept  where  businesses  can  test  innovative  products  services business models and delivery mechanisms in a live environment without immediately incurring all  the  normal  regulatory  consequences  of  engaging  in  the  related  activities.  The  discussion paper sets out the key principles and the proposed approach in operationalising the socalled sandbox. The central bank had invited written comments on the specific questions set out in the paper  as  well  as  any  general  comments.  Finally  after  incorporating  public  feedback  on  the 84              discussion paper BNM issued Financial Technology Regulatory Sandbox Framework (FTRSF) on Oct 18 2016 which took effect immediately. The sandbox framework is applicable to all financial  institutions  licensed  under  Financial  Services  Act  (FSA)  2013  Islamic  Financial Services  Act  (IFSA)  2013  Money  Services  Business  Act  (MBSA)  2011  and  Development Financial Institutions Act (DFIA) and all fintech companies intending to carry out businesses defined in all the Acts stated above. Applicants to participate in the sandbox programme can be a financial institution on its own a fintech company on its own or a collaboration of a financial institution with a fintech company.  One of the key objectives of the FTRSF is for BNM to provide a regulatory environment that is  conducive  for  fintech  innovations  to  be  deployed  and  tested  in  a live  environment  within specified  parameters  and  timeframes.  To  participate  in  the  sandbox  programme  interested parties must fulfil the eligibility criteria and submit the required documents as specified in the framework. In addition the applicants must identify risks that may arise from the testing of the product service or solution in the sandbox and propose the necessary safeguards. For Islamic financial services it is stated that in assessing the risks and evaluating the proposed safeguards BNM will give due regard to ensuring innovative solutions for Islamic financial services are consistent with prevailing Shariah standards.  Fintech companies that collaborate with Islamic financial institutions (IFIs) could leverage on the respective IFIs    existing Shariah governance processes. Fintech companies that intend to provide services within the purview of IFSA 2013 need  to  ensure  that  they  are  well  versed  with  the  prevailing  Shariah  standards  either  by employing  people  with  the  required  knowledge  or  by  engaging  services  from  Shariah consultants. A group of eight fintech companies operating across eight different countries had already recognised this prospect when they chose Malaysia to launch Islamic Fintech Alliance a  reference  point  for  knowledge  and  advice  and  facilitate  business  matching  between entrepreneurs  and  investors  to  develop  a  Shariahcompliant  fintech  ecosystem.  Malaysian startup companies and IFIs should collaborate to seize the opportunity and help to accelerate the development of Islamic fintech ecosystem.  Gap Analysis Opportunities for Improving Islamic Fintech Ecosystem in Malaysia Upon  consideration  of  the  global  industry  and  responses  to  the  Fintech  talent  shortage  this research identified various opportunities that could be considered for improving Islamic Fintech ecosystem in Malaysia. To amend inconsistencies and build upon demonstrated strategies in developing and attracting high quality talent this study presents the following suggestion for strengthening Malaysia   s position as a global leader in Islamic Fintech.

The findings provide an overview of how global Fintech programs are innovating and leveraging expertise to attract and train high quality talent revealing  multiple  opportunities  for  improvement  for  the  Malaysia  region.  To  analyze  the situation  the  study  categorized  the  multiple  response  strategies  into  three major  themes  (1) Educational Interventions (2) Incubators and ExtraCurricular Events and (3) Government and Policy Interventions.   Within Educational Interventions the findings demonstrate how educational institutions have taken  progressive  steps  towards  enhancing  the  technical  skill  set  of  students.  Noteworthy strategies included curriculum reviews promotion of STEMrelated education and careers and the integration of Islamic  Fintech into university programs like MBA programs. The second theme  Incubators  and  ExtraCurricular  Events  outlines  how  Fintech  stakeholders  have developed skill enhancement programs for postsecondary students adult learners and startup entrepreneurs. Multiple programs aimed at growing local technical and financial talent  and encouraged  students  to  pursue  Fintech  related careers.  These  programs  include  hackathons startup  accelerators  independent  course offerings  and  industry/university  conferences.  The last theme addressed Government and Policy  Interventions. Notable strategies from the case studies included financial incentives for new graduate startup networks immigration process reform and mobilizing policy papers directly addressing the chronic skill shortage.   As Fintech is a relatively new phenomenon and the talent shortage is only beginning to gain international attention response and interest limitations to this research include a lack of peerreviewed  sources  and  a  heavy  reliance  on  recent  reports  that  were  written  by  private  sector companies. This research offers multiple suggestions for improving and developing Malaysia   s Fintech ecosystem. This research also pinpoints particular opportunities that local stakeholders could adopt in order to attract and develop high quality Fintech education and talent. To validate these  suggestions  stakeholders  (Malaysia   s  government  the  industry  and  educational institutions) should conduct a rigorous assessment of each and provide feedback regarding the suitability towards the Malaysia Islamic Fintech ecosystem.
