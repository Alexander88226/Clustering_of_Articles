INTRODUCTION  Our paper examines a strategic concern for banking business \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x9chow to manage digitalization?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and offers an integrated view analyzing relevant aspects both at the macro and micro/bankbased level. We  approach  mainly  the  European  banking  sector  Europe  remaining  dependent  on  bank  finance. The  new  way  of  doing  business  for  banks  involves  also  the  digital  transformation.  Every  bank should  mix  a  strategic  vision  on  the  future  operating  model  with  a  strong  commitment  to  fix legacies from the past. Banking  organizations  are  diverse  small  medium  or  large  sized  active  only  in  local  markets  or crossborder  running  different  business  models  to  support  diverse  segments  of  customers  retail customers SMEs and large companies public authorities and governments. Within  the  post  crisis  environment  digitalization  is  one  of  the  key  topics  in  boardrooms everywhere for banking organizations regulators authorities and also for the society as a whole. The  new  European  ecosystem  built  after  the  2008  financial  crisis  includes  a  strong  regulatory response  reflected  in  a  better  capitalized  banking  sector  with  higher  levels  of  liquidity  and  a strong  support  offered  to  the  public  oversight  via  the  creation  of  different  structures  and mechanisms  such  as  European  Single  Resolution  Board  European  Supervisory  Authorities  the Single  Supervisory  Mechanism  and  the  Single  Resolution  Mechanism  European  Stability Mechanism Single Resolution Fund.( Various regulations and directives to increase resilience such as EMIR AIFMD BRRD Solvency II MiFID II) New  regulations  and  standards  new  governance  actors  for  the  financial  sector  new  reporting requirements technological developments affect banking industry and banking business models.                                                  * Corresponding author.

Studies  emphasize  that  the  decade  of  regulation  (10  years  after  the 2008  financial  crisis)  will  be  followed  by  a  decade  of  digital  transformation  of  the  financial industry. Within the related literature part of the paper we explore relevant research and studies reflecting the digitalization impact on financial and banking industry. The third part of the paper present our analysis for a selection of challenges identified at the banks level within the digitalization process. Technology and digitalization present both opportunities and vulnerabilities  for  banks  and  their  customers.  Present  applications  propose  improvement  for  the existing  processes  banking  products  and  services.  Digitalization  and  FinTech\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  support  also  the introduction of new business models new competitors new markets(Computer programs and other technology used to support or enable banking and financial services). The fourth part reflects the most relevant implications for banking organizations in order to manage the adoption of digitalization.  At  the  European  level  relevant  trends  include  the  need  to  accommodate  and  balance  financial stability  objectives  promotion  of  financial  innovation  the  need  to  insure  customer  protection cooperation between innovators and authorities more financial integration using digitalization as a catalyzer  a  different  approach  to  financial  supervision  for  tech  companies  (FinTech  Big  Tech) entering the financial industry and competing with banks.  2. RELATED LITERATURE  Banking business models are constantly changing today from the commercial and financial policies that have direct impact on financial markets to a new digital landscape that reshapes the traditional banking \\xe2\\x80\\x9cecosystem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in line with the technology developments. The digitalization trend is gaining momentum to the change totally the banking system via leading innovations  such  as  informational  and  operational  computing  algorithms  quantum  computing Artificial  Intelligence  (AI)  block  chain technology  process  automatization  biometrical technologies  (both  fingerprint  and  facial  recognition)  big  data  mobile  banking  branch digitalization  (digital  bank;  a  digital  ledger  in  which  transactions  made  in  bitcoin  or  another cryptocurrency are recorded chronologically and publicly). The relationships between banks companies between banks and different segments of customers will  be  considerably  different  in  terms  of  interaction  satisfaction  feedback  decision  making process  services  provided.    The  transformation  implies  a  new  set  of  interactions  from  human  to human  towards  human  and  machine  reaching  machine  to  machine.  In  this  respect  backoffice operations payment services individual/retail lending services will be entirely different cutting out the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmiddle man\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where the concept of branch networks will be deleveraging. On  the other hand these rules may not entirely apply for the corporate business sector where human interaction is still very important (a human interaction in the form of personal counseling) but new technologies will change  indefinably  the  traditional  structure  of  the  banking  system  into  a  more  open  fast  and digitalized one. The banking areas that have been touched in an early stage and continues to develop in this digital progress  are  the  deposits  the  lending  (more  for  retail  banking)  payments  asset  management portfolios  (in  regard  to  the  investment  banking  sector)  equity  and  capital  reshaping  the  internal architecture  of  the  banks  from  traditional  way  of  doing  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbanking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  to  a  more  digital  one  where Fintech  starts  to  get  along  and  coexist  (in  some  cases  harmonize)  with  the  core  activity  of  banks (Kobler et. al. 2016). In  accordance  with  the  prior  changes  mentioned  the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdigital  era\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  of  the  banking  system  has  also started to redefine the behavior of the clients concerning their needs and expectations. The online 340 \\x0cPROCEEDINGS OF THE 12th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManagement Perspectives in the Digital Era\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  November 1st2nd 2018 BUCHAREST ROMANIA payment  solutions  have  gained  popularity  in  the  past  years  facilitating  faster  speed  in  interaction with the common/basis services of a bank. The  transformation  of  the  digital  world  has  an  impact  on  the  financial  industries  nowadays reshaping the banking business model. The steps towards digital banking include business process developments new business models and furthermore an entire change of the banking value chain with  predilection  on  six  interest  areas  the  banking  operational  processes  the  banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99  clients  the revenue models the digital platforms database driven models and banking value chain (Gasser et. al. 2017). From  moving  banking  business  \\xe2\\x80\\x9con  the  cloud\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  to  digital  rise  innovation  technologies  in  the financial  services  field  all  the  changes  occur  rapidly  influencing  the  traditional  way  of  doing banking.  Generating  important  added  value  in  time  effectiveness  and  combining  all  relevant resources such as financial investing transactions the digital trend starts to facilitate new lines of services  for  banks.  It  impacts  also  via  proving  lower  margins  in  different  areas  credit  or  foreign transactions fees (including investment management) thus being more sustainable and desirable for a large number of clientele (Dietz et. al. 2016). Digital transformation is more about how customers will adopt the new technological enhancements than  how  the  impact  of  technological  development  will  reshape  the  internal  processes  of  banking systems. The digital customer behavior their pattern and choices along with needs and capabilities to  adapt  to  the  occurring  changes  are  one  of  the  biggest  challenges.    The  major  transformation comes also from the internal management structure within the banks that will have to adapt to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnew digital picture\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in a fast proven prosses through transparency and efficiency (Kamra 2014). In assessing the impact on banking business considering the size of each bank that can be either big  or  small  timeline  response  capabilities  are  key  element  in  assessing  productive  business solutions for customers. In order to do so the change through process management implementation stands  in  the  center  of  this  transformation  along  with  process  change  and  IT  development (Piirainen 2016). Regarding business banking models of tomorrow remodeled by the age of technology and digital frame  changes  will  appear  not  only  for  retail  client  sector  of  banks  but  most  probably  also  for SMEs (small and medium enterprises) and corporate clients with impact on areas such as money flow  implementation  within  credit  application  processes  payments  KYC  (know  your  customer procedures)  and  AML  (antimoney  laundering)  application  forms  completed  on  digital  platforms regulation  in  money  creation  as  current  case  for  banks  vs.  Fintech  companies  not  yet  fully regulated compared to traditional banks (Lipton et al. 2017).  3. ANALYSIS  Together with policy adjustments regulatory and supervisory changes digitalization and financial technology impacts on every segment of the banking business. Considering  the  trends  presented  within  the  introduction  part  a  banking  organization  should analyze and manage change in a digital environment. Our  analysis  proposes  a  selection  that  includes  10  of  the  most  relevant  challenges  for  a  banking organization  in  order  to  support  the  transformation  process  to  comply  with  the  change  in regulations to benefit of digitalization better serve the customers and provide value added for the shareholders on the long run in a sustainable manner. Our  analysis  emphasizes  the  need  to consider  and  manage  the  digitalization  process  as  a  strategic project for every bank representing in fact a transformation project for the operating model of the bank.  The  project  should  be  conducted  by  a  project  team  having  clear  roles  and  responsibilities using management instruments and tools involving key people from the banking organizations but also strategic partners from outside the banking organization.  341 \\x0cPROCEEDINGS OF THE 12th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManagement Perspectives in the Digital Era\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  November 1st2nd 2018 BUCHAREST ROMANIA This  transformation  process  should  be  part  of  a  new  strategic  vision  both  at  banks  level  and systemic level. The  output  of  our  analysis  includes  strategic  tasks  to  focus  and  manage  within  the  banking organizations but also input for future policy actions.  Challenge 1 Transformation of existing processes as a way to improve efficiency. Challenge 2  Change in customer behavior/digital customer experience. Challenge 3 Technological innovations.   Challenge 4 Data governance and reporting requirements. Challenge 5 Improved solutions for the bank analysis (Big Data Advanced Analytics). Challenge 6 Cyber Security(Examples such as ransomware attacks Petya and WannaCry reaching more than 150 countries reflect the importance of managing cyber risks) Cyber  security  is  a  top  priority  for  banking  business.  Banks  are  using  biometrics  behavioral analytics when proving services to the customers. Challenge 7 Regulatory and supervisory requirements (FinTech Internet of Things \\xe2\\x80\\x93 IoT). Challenge 8 How to balance and mix Human Capital and Technological Capital. Challenge  9  New  Architecture  to  accommodate  the  dynamic  development  for  the  ICT infrastructure within a lively banking organization. Challenge 10 Strategic relationships with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe right partners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Our analysis provides input for the 10 challenges.  Managing the transformation process at the bank organization  level  requires  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransformation  team\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  with  blended  competencies  both  banking business and technological competencies. Change  in  customer  behavior  willingness  to  replicate  pleasant  experiences  from  other  industries quality service speed security data protection competitive cost availability 24/7/365. Customers wants  that  the  bank  manages  incidents  and  provide  adequate  advice.  Digital  relationships  with customers involve a permanent contact and a proactive management of any incident. A  concern  related  also  with  the  transformation  of  existing  processes  but  also  with  the  data governance  and  reporting  is  reflected  by  the  need  to  avoid  redundancy  reporting  by  developing strategies to cope with complexity in processes and quality assurances. Standardization of the data and a common view over the data extracted and needed by various departments of the bank will add consistency and quality. Another aspect in data governance is related to the aggregate data obtained from  the  current  systems  of  the  banking  organizations  and  the  need  for  more  granular  data. Integration  of  data  change  in  processes  and  management  of  the  whole  cycle  at  the  banking organization level via cooperative platforms may support data gathering processing and using for different reporting requirements and business decisions. The approach of \\xe2\\x80\\x9esilos\\xe2\\x80\\x9d within the banking organizations should be changed and transformed towards a new integrated approach. Concerning the existent applications systems data (including customer relationships branches) it is necessary to automate processes and to integrate/migrate gradually towards the new systems. The integration process should be managed in order to anticipate changes to react proactively to future developments via a modular approach.  In  order  to  use  digitalization  to  comply  with  the  regulatory  and  supervisory  requirements  banks should  promote  flexibility  and  cooperation  in  implementation.  RegTech  and  SupTech  solutions include  balanced  planning  proactive  information  and  communication  allignment  with  modeling activities. One of the key points is to create a functional communication chain between the central bank and the banks regulated and supervised. Resilience  is  another  topic  that  requires  specific  attention  within  the  transformation  process  of  a bank  while  managing  digitalization.  Data  governance  involves  the  need  to  insure  capability  of resilient  workaround  for  different  solutions  development  of  prototypes  for  analysis  and  testing detailed business concepts provided by the business side to identify modelling issues. Complex requirements from the regulators central banks supervisory authorities impose banks to provide accurate data. The IT department is transforming from being an infrastructure provider to 342 \\x0cPROCEEDINGS OF THE 12th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManagement Perspectives in the Digital Era\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  November 1st2nd 2018 BUCHAREST ROMANIA becoming  a  strategic  partner  with the  Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  business  lines that  depend  on  technology  to  achieve priorities tied to the Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s areas of responsibility. Cyber  is  inside  most  of  the  bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  processes  as  support  to  protect  bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  reputation  customers business.  Digitalization  implies  the  need  to  know  cyber  risk  tolerance  cyber  risk  appetite  of  the bank  strong  authentications  methods  of  the  customers  when  using  the  systems  of  the  bank. Biometrics solutions such as fingerprint scanner iris scanner face recognition voice recognition or typing patterns are already used to support authentication processes and mitigate cyber risks.  Cyber  security  should  be  integrated  in  a  broader  Resilience  and  Business  Continuity  Strategy stressing on the resilience of both people and infrastructures/systems. In order to present the transformation of the banking business model from traditional to digital we have  drafted  a  scheme  presented  below  in  Figure  no.  1.  The  structure  and  typology  of  branch network  have  changed  changing  the  banking  models  impacting  strategically  on  the  three  footed relationship customer \\xe2\\x80\\x93 bank \\xe2\\x80\\x93 real economy. In addition greeneconomy/bioeconomy has started to be developed being also related to the technological progress and compliance towards efficiency effectiveness and sustainability.  Figure 1 From traditional to digital banking model Source authors \\xe2\\x80\\x98own processing   The disrupted areas in which the digital process makes an impact in redefining banking models are especially  oriented  to  the  customer  but  also  to  the  internal  structure  of  the  banks  including operational and revenue models data management corporate governance human resource. Big Data and customer profiling represent key focus within the digitalization process reshaping the business models proposing cloud solutions to the existing systems. New  communication  protocols  between  banks  and  customers  are  developed  transformed  from physical proximity to digital proximity (through social media channels the digital world makes the interaction  with  banks  quicker  and  more  accessible  on  a  large  scale  not  considering geographical/time zone or age discrepancies).  Considering  the  related  information  of  technological  development  in  digital  area  the  business models of banks are evolving especially in fields such as (a)  Mobile  banking  a  game  changer  in  retail  activity  where  services  and  solutions  are  provided quicker  by  the  usage  of  online  capabilities  making  the  interaction  with  client  much  more convenient. 343 \\x0cPROCEEDINGS OF THE 12th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManagement Perspectives in the Digital Era\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  November 1st2nd 2018 BUCHAREST ROMANIA (b) Credit applications online because nowadays banks use integrated solutions to survey and asses specific  information  of  individuals  in  order  to  grant  credits  applicability  of  AI  components combined with data base usage makes scoring profile availability more easer; in this way banks can assure the customer with a less paper base and high complexity document processing for obtaining a loan. (c)  Fastimproved  operational  payments  platforms  speed  and  digital  traffic  capabilities  are transforming the payment sector improving the work flow not only for the final beneficiary of this type of service (the consumer) but also for the bank. (d) New branch models rethinking the role and addressability of products and services provided by branches through the network sales channel making experiences more in accordance with the needs of  the  21th  century  banking  models  new  paradigm  with  highly  focus  on  creativity  in  delivering added value advisory to the clients. In order to adequately summarize some of the main challenges and implication that arise from the digital  development  in  reshaping  the  business  models  of  the  banks  we  include  below  in  Figure no.2  the  description  of  some  of  the  processes  transforming  the  banking  market  from  2007  to perspectives upon future until 2020.  Figure 2 Acceleration process of digital development in the banking market Source A.T. Kearney Analysis  Because  going  digital  is more  about  individuals  than  corporate  businesses  it  might  be considered that banking digitalization is more about HumantoHuman relation than BusinesstoBusiness one.  Some of the changes presented previously can be found in a graphical representation in Figure no. 3 below where a forwardlooking approach in the digital banking transformation models is detailed from technology trends to evolving customer behavior and changing branch networks.   344 \\x0cPROCEEDINGS OF THE 12th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManagement Perspectives in the Digital Era\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  November 1st2nd 2018 BUCHAREST ROMANIA  Figure 3 Looking ahead digital transformation until 2020 Source A.T. Kearney Analysis  As a previous decisionbased conclusion it can be stated that the path for redefining the traditional banking models into a more digitalized online hightech ones has been a past proven concern from the  financial  industry.  Nevertheless  where  there  is  change  there  is  reluctance  presented  upon diverse  aspects  of  business  nature  whether  in  the  form  of  policy  making  security  reliability reasons  value  chain  processes  corporate  governance  management  productivity  human  resource capability all in direct connection with revenues and profitability margins through gaining of more customers (age wise risk wise profile wise) and market share.  4. FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS  One  of  the  key  questions  related  to  the  digitalization  process  is  the  future  role  for  FinTechs  \\xe2\\x80\\x9e FinTechs  act as  competitors  or  business  partners  for  banking  organizations?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  The  answer  will  be confirmed  by  the  market  realities  customer  experience  and  regulatory  framework  being  the  main influencers.  Banks  are  enjoying  trust  from  the  society/customers  to  store  their  data.  FinTech  adoption  is in  payments/other  areas(* important  within  financial  markets  developments  were  done Digitalization extended the number of gadgets used as channel for payments laptops smartphones smartwatches fitness trackers and even via cars). A  partial  answer  to  the  above  mentioned  question  may  be  Cooperation.  Under  a  banking organization umbrella benefiting of a client data base the bank may increase  quality/speed for its services  by  inviting  Fintechs  to  develop  synergies.  The  bank  offeres  access  to  the  data  base provides  compliance  services  products  and  services  (e.g.  bank  accounts  cards)  and  the  Fintechs may  offer  payments  crowdfunding  remittances.    The  bank  should  analyse  and  uunderstand benefits risks and impact on its business from new technologies and collaborative partnerships.

Managing digitalization in banking requires time flexibility huge testing effort money regulatory restrictions.  The  bank  organizations  should  allocate  financial  and  time  resources  train  their  staff parachute  external  expertise  measure  and  adopt  the  right  balance  between  online  and  offline insuring  data  privacy  managing  security  risks  and  in  the  same  time  keeping  up  with  the  current business.  Building  strategic  partnerships  with  technological  companies  buying  and  adapting  business solutions  but  also  developing  internal  capacities  and  knowledge  may  support  the  change  in paradigm and the digitalization process in banking. Traditional  banks  versus  digital  banks  traditional  banks  with  digital  banking  arms  represent strategic options for the banking organizations. New concepts as Open banking Internetonly banks (e.g. direct banks) mobile onlybanks (e.g. mobile banks) are digital entities that offer accelerated business practices providing banking products and services. Concerning  the  positive  technological  and  digital  transformation  of  the  banking  system  and financial  markets  along  with  influence  comes  great  responsibilities.  Authorities  regulators supervisors in the banking industry are constantly trying to recalibrate the rules of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe game\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in order to balance the impact of the innovating technologies on the realworld base economy. From  data  security  to  human  resources  and  corporate  governance  management  policy  has  to  be drafted and markets should be regulated and supervised to reach equilibria where the comfort and secure  line  transactions  go  hand in  hand with  transparency  quick  processing  and mobility  for  the final beneficiary \\xe2\\x80\\x93 the client. In this respect managing big data security patterns is a challenge for an industry where information is a key element that defines profitability in the line with the massmarket client and market share overviews. In order to obtain a regulatory requirement banks have to provide storage of their data for many  years after collection but facing specific policy changes such as provided by the recent statements of the General Data Protection Regulation staring at 25th May 2018 (known as GDPR The  first  European  regulation  on  data  protection).  Trust  is  essential  in  banking  and  specifically when adopting new technologies and the new regulations may have a positive effect. The  banking  industry  is  among  the  most  datadriven  of  industries.  Regulatory  and  supervisory requirements  impose  banks  must  store  many  years  of  transaction  data.  The  challenge  is  knowing how to translate that information into meaningful insights. Big  Data  provides  significant  opportunities  for  banks  to  outshine  their  competition.  Moving  data onto  a  cloud  platform  provides  a  360degree  view  of  every  customer.  This  deep insight  reflects  a sort of border where banks may provide a higher level of service and create value added. Big Data allows also the use of disruptive technologies such as artificial intelligence block chain to map the customer journey and gain a competitive edge. Digital  proximity  from  branch  network  to  digital  banking  from  paperbased  processes  to  pocket (IT) Internet mobile bank represent several of the changing aspects of the new digital paradigm.  In  this  cultural  and  technological  environment  based  on  the  interaction  between  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cman  and machine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the banks business functions and IT ecosystem are working together on primordial tools of  enhancing  and  building  a  oneoff  microsystem  towards  digitalization as  follows  mobile  tools Digital Analytical Zone Fintech and Ecurrency. But the concern comes in the eyes of product digitalization beneficiaries that work on developing a culture  of  innovation    supporting  capabilities  towards  the  customers  realiance  and  realibility  on new digital banking products and servicies by creating an increase bank organization familiariation with all types of business related digitalization processes. In  banking  there  is  the  need  to  Reengineer  many  aspects  to  invert  relationships  (cyber  being inside most of the processes) to  get an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cagreement wise pact\\xe2\\x80\\x9d between human and digital. Cyber should  not  be  considered  only  an  IT  problem.  Cyber  focus  on  business  must  provide  in  the  near 346 \\x0cPROCEEDINGS OF THE 12th INTERNATIONAL MANAGEMENT CONFERENCE  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cManagement Perspectives in the Digital Era\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  November 1st2nd 2018 BUCHAREST ROMANIA future  specific  documentation  and  contribute  to  prioritize  the  most  important  outcomes  of  the banking organization. From  a  risk  approach  both  top  down  and  bottom  up  efforts  should  be  done  to  identify  risks  to understand the insights of digital connection between \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe old and the new\\xe2\\x80\\x9d how it will impact the customer  generations  of  tomorrow.  External  events  may  change  present  environment  change behaviors but regulators authorities and banks should build an integrated educational strategy to support a gradual implementation of digitalization across the banking organization. Strong business area partnerships are being developed upon the new digital era in order to extend also the security expertise  related  to  business  areas  and  enhance  cooperation  sharing  information  and  the understanding of the impact of new technologies for critical activities of the banking business. Banks  provide  continuous  flows  of  data  combine  data  sets  and  perform  analysis  Stress  Tests necessary  in  creating  a  stability  performance  platform  evolving  to  a  new  level  towards  an \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIntelligent  Era\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Those  capabilities  should  act  within  a  proper  law  and  regulatory  framework insuring stability and business continuity. The valuable interactions between human and machine between machine and machine assisted by humans  represent  key  elements  of  the  business  models  in  many  industries  including  banking. Digital banks and especially leading innovators such as FinTech companies provide a mix between technology IT development and banking related tasks that are being operated within minutes and processed constantly without and delay in the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpocket & hand\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the final beneficiary of products and services the consumer.  Technologies  have  evolved  in  a  rapid  manner  increasing  pressure  on  banking  models  to  change and adopt the new digital environment (such as mobile banking Internet Banking System Process payment compatibilities through digital smart banking process automatization) in order to remain competitive.    Alongside  with  the  FinTech  concept  almost  in  the  same  timeline  period  came  the concept of digital money/currency (e.g.  Bitcoin Ethereum Ripple) creating a  new market called cryptocurrency  market  which  is  in  a  very  significant  proportion  related  to  the  digital  innovation (That  have  started  to  be  used  broadly  since  2016).  The  pattern  to  which  the  system  of cryptocurrency  works  is  almost  entirely  based  upon  a  mathematical  enhanced  IT  algorithm  called block chain.  Other  relevant  innovating  technology  for  banking  is  represented  by  Artificial  Intelligence  (AI). From software products that work with less and less human input to IT applications that can take over processes managed by human workers  AI is  gaining momentum. AI today is present almost every  ware  in  mobile  applications  in  banking  applications  almost  in  every  aspect  of  our  daily interaction with services and products in order to facilitate and ease our life.
