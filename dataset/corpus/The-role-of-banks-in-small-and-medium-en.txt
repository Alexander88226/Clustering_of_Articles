Data are gathered from interviews based on a selforganized questionnaire with 150 SMEs in Kosovo. Based on the econometric model of linear regression key factors are identified which influence the investment growth financed by debt. The results indicate that there is mutual correlation among the firm   s age size business plan sector number of owners sources of financing and  the  investment  growth  financed  from  banks  in  Kosovo.  Therefore  findings  in  this  work suggest  that  the access to external sources of financing through bank loan is an important factor that influences the investment growth. The paper provides some important conclusions and implications for policymakers and entrepreneurs. Keywords SME entrepreneurship financing through debt investment Kosovo 1. Introduction It is explicitly accepted that SMEs present a pivotal element in the economic activity in both developed and developing countries (Acs & Audretsch 1990; Johnson & Loweman 1995). Numerous authors from academic and professional world designate SMEs as generators of both economic growth and overall social development (Audretsch & Klepper 2000; World Bank Group 2005; McMillan & Woodruff 2002).   The  discussion  of  the  relevant  literature  related  to  the  access  of  SMEs  to  finance  as  well  as  to  investment finance is of particular importance (Krasniqi 2007). According to Beck et al. (2007) the SMEs access to and cost of finances is quite often characterized as a major difficulty up to the extent of 35 percent. It should also be stressed that the small firms come with more difficulty to loans since they encounter higher transaction costs and  higher  premium  risks  for  they  are  more  fragile  and  they  offer  lower  collaterals  (Beck  et  al.  2006). Audretsch and Elston (2006) also stress that small firms confronted higher financial difficulties than large ones. Similar conclusions can be found among other authors who have worked in this direction (Beck et al. 2006; Oliveira & Fortunato 2006).   Brinckmann et al. (2011) finds that small firms have higher limitations to access external sources of financing than bigger firms and thus they become more dependent on internal funds for financing their investment needs. A major obstacle in financial markets to the access on finances by SMEs is also the asymmetry of information. Thus based on Zhao et al. (2006) one from the  major difficulties for accessing finance is the asymmetry of information among lenders and debtors; for instance borrowers have private information on the firm that lenders do  not  possess.  Because  of  their  small  size  short  history  and  inconsistent  accounting  data  the  issue  of asymmetric information for SMEs becomes more serious (Deakins et al. 2008; EBRD 1999; Pissardies et al. 2003; Klapper et al. 2002).   Difficulties of this kind are expressed also among SMEs of Kosovo as one from the last countries in transition. In  spite  of  the  fact  that  the SME  sector  in  Kosovo  is  relatively  new  it  constitutes 98%  of  all  the  firms  thus representing a huge potential for generation of new jobs and for economic development of the country. Based on data of the World Bank (2010) the major obstacle to the development of SMEs in Kosovo is access to bank loans. Only 10% of investments made by SMEs are financed through bank loans and above 85% of investments are financed from private sources (World Bank 2010).    94  www.ccsenet.org/ijef International Journal of Economics and Finance Vol. 5 No. 12; 2013 Objective of this work is to empirically investigate the role and importance of the firms and entrepreneurship characteristics  that  influence  the  investment  growth  through  debt  finance  (loans)  in  Kosovo.  Therefore  the research  question  in  this  study  is  How  does  the  investment  growth  impact  the  performance  of  SMEs  by discussing the firm and entrepreneurship characteristics of the investment growth of SMEs in Kosovo?   The  organization  of  the  work  is  as  following  Part  one  discusses  the  context  of  the  research  part  two  the theoretical aspect and the summary of literature. In part three we provide the research methodology and model. Part four contains the results and empirical findings. And part five deals with the conclusions.   2. Theory and Literature Review Until now there is no single and unique theoretical model that explains the financing of SMEs which influences the  performance  of  investments  their  growth  and  development.  The  theoretical  principles  underlying  capital structure can generally be describes in terms of the static trade off theory by Modigliani and Miller (1958) the pecking order theory (Myers & Majluf 1984) managerial theory of investments (Marris 1963; Baumol 1967) agency theory by Jensen and Meckling (1976) and extended by Stiglitz and Weiss (1981).   According to neoclassical theory of investments (MM) which affirms the attitude on the irrelevance of the capital structure for the value of the firm internal and external sources of financing are perfect substitutes. In the world of the perfect functioning of the market the choice between financing through capital or debt is irrelevant. Therefore the cost of capital and the market value of the firm are independent from the value of the firm (Modigliani & Miller 1958). The theory of MM is based on the following premises there are no taxes there are no transaction costs there are no bankruptcy costs the equal cost of debt for companies and for investors symmetrical information in the market there is no influence of debt in the profit of the company before interest and taxation.   Modigliani and Miller (1958) modify their theory by introducing the tax on profit. In this case the value of the firm is positively related to debt. After introducing the tax on profit in their analysis they ascertain that the financial leverage increases the value of the firm since the interest decreases the tax base (it is deduced from the business profit) and therefore we have savings which have the value of the interest. From this ascertainment the value of the  firm  grows  bigger  as  the  financial  leverage  increases  which  means  that  the  highest  value  of  the  firm  is achieved if the burden of debt becomes 100%. In this way the firm attains absolute advantage given that it is defended from taxes.   Scott (1972) emphasizes that 100% tax shield does not exist in reality because of distress costs. Debt leads to legal obligation to pay interest and principal. If a firm cannot meet its debt obligation it is forced in to bankruptcy an incurs associated costs (Fatoki & Asah 2011). This theory in fact does not take into the consideration all the other factors such as the costs of the bankruptcy of the firm the costs of the agency the impact of debt in profit the asymmetry of information and therefore this theory is challenged by other theories (Harris & Raviv 1991).   Thus the static trade off theory which is based on the MM theory and is its complementary except savings from the tax on profit incorporates into the discussion also the cost of bankruptcy such as judicial taxes attorney costs administrative  costs and also the agency costs (the firms  managers damage the interests of the creditors by working in the interest of shareholders) and this can reduce the value of the firm (Jensen and Meckling 1976). This theory is in fact the dominant theory regarding the determination of the financial structure of the firm and it is founded on the premise that it is the firm that chooses how much it will be financed from debt and how much from the capital by balancing the cost of profits. According to this theory the optimal level of the structure of capital is the one which equates the profit and costs from debt.   According to pecking order theory the firm initially prefers internal sources of financing to external ones and regarding  external  sources  they  prefer  debt  to  capital  (Donaldson  1961).  Thus  initially  we  have  the  use  of accumulated profit amortization debt and finally the equity capital. According to this theory the firms finance their investment requirements based on a hierarchic order. This can direct also to existence of the asymmetry of information  between  managers  (insiders)  and  investors  (outsiders).  As  a  result  of  this  managers  have  more information then investors (Myers & Majluf 1984).   Based on the agency theory Stiglitz and Weiss (1981) present the problem that as a consequence of asymmetrical information  occur  between  managers  and  shareholders  on  one  hand  and  the  problem  among  shareholders managers and creditors on the other. They argue that only SMEs knows the real financial structure of their own the real strength of their investment projects and the tendencies for settling up the debt and therefore the firm possesses superior private information (Mazanai & Fatoki 2012).      95  www.ccsenet.org/ijef International Journal of Economics and Finance Vol. 5 No. 12; 2013 3. Hypothesis 3.1 Business Plan According to Guffey the business plan is a necessary requirement at the beginning of business and it is used as an important element to acquire financial support during application to banking institutions (Guffey 2008). An increase  in  the  level  of  skills  of  those  who  are  looking  for  credits  in  the  compilation  of  business  plans  will increase their opportunities to have properly prepared documentation and to have a clear idea on the course of their business. According to Maziku (2012) the asymmetric information between the debtseeking SMEs and the bank is reflected in the incapability of the majority of SMEs to provide consistent financial data and real business plans which increases the operational cost during the decision making for permitting the loans by the a bank (Maziku 2012). Thus the business plan does not have an impact only in reduction of operational costs but it is also a key instrument in the decision making regarding the use of banking loans by the firms (Zhang 2008; Madura 2007). This is valid particularly for startup businesses.   Therefore the following hypothesis is generated H1 SMEs which have business plans are more likely to use bank loans than SMEs without written business plans.   3.2 The Growth of the Firm The growth of SMEs depends on the level of investments. The growth of SMEs can be measured in different ways  including  the  growth  of  sales  profits  or  number  of  employees  (McPerson  1996).  We  measure  this variable through the growth of the number of employees. The ability of SMEs to grow depends on a large measure from their potential to invest in the restructuring and innovations.  All  these  investments  require  capital  that  is  they  require  access  to  finance  (Mazanai  &  Fatoki 2012). According  to Ganbold (2008)  in  a  research  of  the World  Bank  one  among  the  key difficulties  in  the growth of the firm is access to financial services which reflects in economic growth employment generation and  reduction  of  poverty  in  the  developing  countries  (Ganbold  2008).  Based  on  the  theory  of  firm  growth (Jovanovic 1982) new enterprises grow faster which means that these have to invest more.   Therefore the following hypothesis is generated   H2 SMEs that grow faster invest more than those with low level of growth. 3.3 Gender In the professional literature there are contradictory opinions regarding the impact that gender of the owner of the firm has into the access to finance. While a group of thinkers assert that gender of the owner has an impact into  the  capital  structure  of  the  firm  the  other  group  denies  this  ascertaining  that  gender  doesn   t  have  any impact into the determination of the capital structure.   On one hand Abor (2008) argues that businesses owned by female owners use the debt (loans) less for different reasons  including  discrimination  and  aversion  to  risk.  Watson  et  al.  (2009)  emphasize  that  a  key  factor  in determining the capital structure in businesses owned by female owners is their propensity towards not accepting risk from the desire to keep things under control. Female clients are more hesitant to seek loans since they feel discriminated and discouraged (Kon & Storey 2003).   On the other hand Coleman (2000) find that there ar no important differences in the use of debt (banking loan) between female and male owners and that gender is not an important predictor of the financial leverage of the firm.  Whereas  Irving  and  Scott  (2008)  analyzing  400  SMEs  and  based  on  the  questionare  prepared  by Barclays  Bank  in  the  most  surprising  way  ascertain  that  female  have  easier  access  to  finance  then  male. Therefore based on the findings reported above the following hypothesis is generated   H3 The male owners of firms are more likely to use bank loans then the female owners of firms.   3.4 Sources of Financing The  larger  participation  of  investment  finance  from  internal  sources  of  SMEs  increases  the  probability  for acquiring of bank loans since the internal sources carry the opportunity cost of financing of the project. Thus SMEs provide higher level of trust to banks since in the case of failure the unexpected burden falls on SMEs themselves. In their research conducted in 16 countries of OECD Japelli and Pagano (1994) ascertain that banks don   t finance 100% of the property value in any of these countries but they do that with a certain coeficient loan/property. This is not equal for all the countries and it differs from country to country starting from the minimum financing of 50% in Turkey and Greece up to 95% in Denmark.    96  www.ccsenet.org/ijef International Journal of Economics and Finance Vol. 5 No. 12; 2013 to  credit  arguing influence  between  education  of  ownersmanagers  and  access Thus  authors  Lee  and  Ratti  (2008)  and  Ahn  et  al.  (2006)  reports  negative  relationship  between  debt  and investments.  This  relationship  is  stronger  among  smaller  firms.  As  the  debt  (loans)  grows  the  cash  flow  is increasingly used for settling up the loan and its interest. Consequently firms fulfill their obligations to creditors with more difficulties and on the other hand the possibility for new investments is reduced.   Therefore the following hypothesis is generated   H4  The  higher  the  internal  sources  of  SMEs  the  higher  probability  to  acquire  bank  loans  for  investment finance. 3.5 Education   Education  is  one  of  the  important  factors  that  influence  the  growth  of  the  firm.  Therefore  the  high  level  of human capital (education and experience) has a positive impact in the growth of the firm. The owners of the firm who are of young age and low level of education are more active in using the external sources of financing in spite of the fact that higher education reduces the fear for refusing the loans. In the meantime the owners of more mature age and with higher education the so called    wiser    ones can be found as less interested for external sources of financing (Vos et al. 2007). Therefore the majorities of owners of SMEs prefer to keep the control and do not apply for external capital (Curran 1986; Jarvis 2000).   Thus the internal capital is the major source of financing the SMEs (Ou & Haynes 2003). Rand (2007) finds also  negative that ownersmanagers with higher education can understand easier that their requirements for credits can be refused. Therefore these ownersmanagers are for this reason discouraged and hesitate to apply for loans. In their study on new firms Hartarska and Gonzales Vega (2006) find that education does not have an important role in the decisionmaking of the banks for lending.   Therefore the following hypothesis is generated   H5  Owners/managers  with  high  level  of  education  use  less  bank  loans  for  financing  the  investment requirements.   4. Methodology   4.1. Sources of Data   The organization of data gathering from the questionnaire was developed in the period MarchJuly 2012 and data  processing  based  on  the  answers  was  conducted  in  November  and  December  2012.  On  this  occasion  a database  was  developed  which  includes  characteristics  of  SMEs  in  general  and  characteristics  related  to investments and their financing in particular. Data processing was conducted with the STATA software.   The questionnaire is specially designed for this scientific research with 150 SMEs in Kosovo and it includes years  2010  and  2011.  The  sample  selection  is  made  randomly  from  database  at  the  Agency  for  Businesses Registration in the Ministry of Industry and Trade of Kosovo and it is stratified in three basic sectors in order to reflect eventual changes among the production trade and service firms. Interviews were conducted directly (face to face) with owners/managers or financial managers of the firms.   4.2 Questionnaire   The questionnaire consisted of 4 major sections. The first section included data on the owner/manager of the firm and general data about the firm (location the year of establishment type of activity and qualification of owners/managers). Second section included the orientation regarding the development in the future as well as investments  and  here  are  presented  data  regarding  volume  of  investments  sources  of  investment  the  use  of bank  loans  in  realization  of  investments  conditions  of  financing  activities  that  are  conducted  during  the realization of investments and investment plans for the future. The third section covers information regarding business activities of the firms inside and outside of the country that is whether a certain firm imports or exports merchandise.  The  fourth  section  includes  data  regarding  the  business  plans  of  the  firms  possession  of  the business  plan  its  impact  on  the  decisions  of  the  banks.  Information  gathered  from  the  questionnaire  was important for determining the variables in the econometric model of linear regression.   5. Research Model   The determination of the key variables enables us to definie the structure of the model with which we test the volume of investments and their growth in the Kosovan SMEs.   The structure of the econometric model is presented as following    97  www.ccsenet.org/ijef International Journal of Economics and Finance Y =(cid2009)(cid2868)+(cid2010)(cid2869)entre_edu+(cid2010)(cid2870)inter_exter+(cid2010)(cid2871)business_plan+(cid2010)(cid2872)production+(cid2010)(cid2873)trade+(cid2010)(cid2874)firm_age\\t Y  =(cid2009)(cid2868)+(cid2010)(cid2869)(cid1876)(cid2869)+(cid2010)(cid2870)(cid1876)(cid2870)+(cid2010)(cid2871)(cid1876)(cid2871)+(cid2010)(cid2872)(cid1876)(cid2872)+(cid2010)(cid2873)(cid1876)(cid2873)+(cid2010)(cid2874)(cid1876)(cid2874)+(cid2010)(cid2875)(cid1876)(cid2875)+(cid2010)(cid2876)(cid1876)(cid2876)+(cid2010)(cid2877)(cid1876)(cid2877)+                                    (1) +\\t(cid2010)(cid2875)+no_own+(cid2010)(cid2876)size_emp+(cid2010)(cid2877)gender+                                                              (2) Vol. 5 No. 12; 2013 Dependent variable Y= invest_growth   Thus dependent variable is invest_growth and it presents the growth of investment in 2011.   Independent variables are coded as following entre_edu   coded  as  1  for  entrepreneurs  who  have  finished  university  education  and  coded  as  zero  for entrepreneurs who don   t have university education.   inter_exter   is measured as a ratio between investments made from internal sources with those financed from external sources.   business_plan   is coded as 1 for the firms that have business plan and 0 otherwise.   production   is coded as 1 for the firms in the sector of production and 0 otherwise.   trade   is coded as 1 for the firms in the sector of trade and 0 otherwise.   firm_age   expresses the number of years that the firm is in business activity.   no_own   indicates the number of owners.   size_emp   indicates the size of the firm expressed through the number of employees.   gender   indicates the gender of the owner/manager of the firm.   6. Survey Results Based on the results we conclude that the regression linear model mentioned above is specified good given that Adj Rsquared 0.36 which shows that the variation in independent variables explains the variation in dependent variable for more than 36%. In addition the statistical Ftest shows that all the independent variables jointly which are statistically significant are different from zero.   Also the correlation analysis shows that the problem of correlation in independent variables is not present in our data  given  that  there  no  higher  coefficients  in  our  estimation.  Also  the  dependent  variable  has  a  normal distribution and does not represent a statistical problem that requires treatment.    Table 1.

N=150 Adj.R2=0.36%.  According to results the variable business_plan is statistically significant and with positive sign. This means that the firms that have business plans on average have investment growths that are bigger than those of the firms that do not have business plans. Similar ascertainments can be found among other authors who emphasize that the business plan serves as a mean for increasing financing from external sources (Zhang 2008).   The variable trade is statistically significant and with negative impact in the investment growth when compared with the firms that belong to the service sector. This has the meaning that services on average invest more than other sectors. In addition the variable production is also statistically significant and with negative impact on the increase of investments when compared with the firms that belong to the sector of services. This has the meaning that  when  compared  with  the  services  the  sector  of  production  invests  less  than  other  sectors.  Similar ascertainments for the case of Kosovo can be found in the work of the author Krasniqi (2010).   The next variable no_own which indicates the number of owners is statistically significant and with positive impact which means that the greater the number of owners the greater will be the investments. We have also size_emp as a variable that shows the size of the firm expressed by the number of employees and is statistically significant  and  with  inverse  impact  on  the  growth  of  investments.  This  means  that  smaller  firms  have  larger investment  growths.  This  finding  clearly  reflects  that  as  the  number  of  employee   s  grows  the  firms  grow slowlier. This is in full accordance with findings of other authors (Audretsch & Klepper 2000; Caves 1998). These  results  are  the  same  with  other  studies  that  oppose  the  Gibrat  Law  (Krasniqi  2006;  Harris  &  Trainor 2005).   The firm_age as an independent variable is statistically significant and with negative sign which means that new firms grow faster than older firms. This ascertainment is in accordance with findings of many authors who ascertain  that  younger  firms  grow  faster  than  the  older  ones  and  therefore  have  higher  investment  growth (Woldie et al. 2008; Storey 1994; Barkham et al. 1996).   The gender of the owner of the firm in the presented model as a variable is not statistically significant which means  that  the  owners  of  the  businesses  of  both  genders  have  the  same  probability  to  obtain  bank  loans  for SMEs investments. These results are in accordance with the studies conducted by Kalleberg and Leicht (1991) who in a study conducted with 300 firms in three sectors ascertain that female owners were as successful as male  owners.  We  find  similar  ascertainment  in  the  study  of  298  businesses  in  United  Kingdom  which emphasizes  that  gender  is  not  a  determinant  for  financing  the  business  (Johnson  &  Storey  1993).  Coleman (2000) emphasizes that there are no important differences in the use of debt (bank loans) between males and females and that gender is not an important predictor for financial leverage of the firm.   Finally education represents a variable which is not statistically significant and has negative sign which means that the level of education of the managers/owners doesn   t impact external sources of financing (bank loans) for SMEs investments. This is explained by the fact that Kosovan SMEs suffer from permanent lack of capital and on  average  the  time  frame  of  establishment  is  short  and  the  means  that  are  accumulated  from  the  profits  are insufficient for financing the investments. Therefore the only alternative that remains to them is financing from banking credits taking into the consideration that the capital market does not function in Kosovo which causes  99  www.ccsenet.org/ijef International Journal of Economics and Finance Vol. 5 No. 12; 2013 that  the  possibility  to  use  other  forms  of  external  financing  is  very  difficult.  Similar  results  can  be  found  at Krasniqi (2010).   7. Conclusions In this study we have investigated empirically the key factors of the firms and entrepreneurship which influence the  increase  of  investment  growth  through bank  loans.  The  data  gathered  by  the  self  organized questionnaire with 150 SMEs in the entire territory  of Kosovo for the years 2010 and 2011 are used to test the impact of certain factors in the increase of investments through the use of financial means from debt (bank loans). Based on  the  statistical  analysis  and  the  method  of  linear  regression  key  factors  are  identified  as  indicators  that influence the growth of investments of SMEs in Kosovo.   The findings of this work stress that the business plan is a factor with statistical importance which has positive influence in the access to the bank loans for financing the SMEs investment. This means that the firms  that posses  business  plan  and  use  it  for  seeking  bank  loans  necessary  for  financing  investments  on  average  have higher growth of investments than the firms who do not have a business plan.   The variables trade and production are statistically significant but they have negative influence in the growth of investments. This means that the firms that use bank loans for investment in the sector of trade and production on average have lower chance to grow than firms in the service sector. This is an indicator that shows that the sector  of  services  is  more  attractive  in  the  aspect  of  investments  of  Kosovan  firms  than  other  sectors  of  the economy  and this  results  from  faster  returns of  investments  and  consequently  faster  settling  up of  the  bank loans.   The next variable named as the number of owners also results positive and significant in the statistical aspect which means that the larger the number of owners the greater the investments. This is explained by the fact that in Kosovo firms have started to use other forms of organization that influence the growth of business and of firm through larger number of owners who use investment as another opportunity for the growth and development of the firm.   The  size  of  the  firm  expressed  by  the  number  of  employees  results  with  inverse  influence  in  the  growth  of investments  and  is  statistically  significant.  The  meaning  of  this  is  that  smaller  firms  have  bigger  growth  of investment on average than other firms. This result is in accordance with other studies that oppose the Gibrat   s Law for the case of Kosovo (Krasniqi 2010). Similar results are attained regarding the variable the age of the firm which is statistically significant and has a negative sign which means that the younger firms invest more on average than older firms.   Empirical evidence and findings in this work can be used as recommendations for a broad spectrum of users. The problems  of  asymmetric  information  between  ownersmanagers  and  creditors  (banks)  are  of  particular importance. This represents a clear signal for policy makers to create conditions for favorable environment for stimulating the sources of external financing of SMEs in Kosovo such as the creation of the guarantee fund for SMEs  the  increase  of  banking  supply  through  licensing  of  new  banks  in  the  financial  market  which  will increase  the  competition  between  the  existing  banks  and  which  will  in  turn  enable  the  improvement  of  the conditions of financing of SMEs with the reduction of the interest reduction of managerial costs increase of the grace period softening of the conditions for collateral longer periods of use of financial means particularly for SMEs that have longer investment plans. Also in the institutional aspect initiatives should be undertaken for the creation of conditions for development of entrepreneurial capabilities and for other forms of cooperating networks of firms that will facilitate the growth of businesses in general and investment growth in particular   References Abor J.
