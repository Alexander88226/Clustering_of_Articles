KENZHEGULOVA***1)AbstractThis  study  aims  is  to  analyze  of  existing  concepts  of  gender  stereotypes  and  gender  differences  in  wages  defining  of  gender  pay  gap determinants  and  to  evaluate  the  level  of  discrimination  against  women  in  Kazakhstan.  In  the  proposed  study  the  authors  explore  the  conceptual framework  and  basic  directions  of  the  problem  of  gender  wage  differentials.  In  this  research  authors  propose  the  methodological  tools  for presenting  a  standard  form  of  evaluation  of  gender  pay  gap.  The  developed  methodological  tools  will  allow  providing  authentic  and  formal analysis  on  gender  pay  gap  and  identifying  the  main  determinants  of  gender  pay  differences.  Further  the  obtained  results  showed  the  distribution of  wage  gap  in  Kazakhstan\'s  regions  and  the  Duncan\'s  dissimilation  index  allows  us  to  trace  the  dynamics  of  changes  in  the  professional structure  between  men  and  women.  According  to  the  results  gender  pay  gap  is  narrowing  with  the  reduction  of  the  job  level  and  discrimination is  related  to  differences  in  human  capital  and  education.  Wages  in  the  industrial  sector  are  higher  for  men  than  for  women  because  men\'s professions  are  characterized  by  severe  and  unhealthy  working  conditions.  In  addition  employers  prefer  male  managers  but  if  they  take  woman managers  they  give  them  salary  3  times  less.Keywords  Gender  Gender  Economy  Gender  Policy  Segregation  Gender  Pay  Gap  Kazakhstan.1.  IntroductionAt  present  there  is  a  cardinal  rethinking  of  the  social  role  of women  in  society  and  the  need  arises  to  find  measures  to  ensure their  rights  and  opportunities.  Ensuring  gender  equality  is  one  of  the factors  of  economic  growth  and the  achievement  of  sustainable development  of  the  country  and  the  region.  It  has  been  established that  equal  involvement  of  women  in  political  social  economic  life of  a  country  is  considered  as  a  necessary  condition  for  achieving progress  in  socioeconomic  growth  solving  of  urgent  cultural  social ethnic  and  other  issues.  Thus  one  of  the  main  tasks  is  to  ensure equality  between  a  man  and  a  woman  in  all  spheres  of  life  and work  including  in  the  issues  of  the  gender  pay  gap.These  days  gender  differences  in  wages  are  among  most  debated topics  of  socioeconomic  research.  This is  proved  by  numerous scientific  studies  and  publications  as  well  as  numerous  reports  done by  wellknown  international  research  organizations  (IMF  UN  OECD World  Bank  etc.)  for  different  countries.  Herewith  a  vast  number  of the  researches  are  focused  on  gender  analysis  of  women  and  men  in labor  market  as    majority  of  men  and  women  are  hired  workers  for whom  earnings  and  job  opportunities  to  a  large  extend  determines their  economic  situation.    * This research have supported by the Narxoz University and Soros Foundation (Kazakhstan).  ** Institute of Economics of the Ministry Education and Science of the Republic of Kazakhstan Kazakhstan.

The  current  position  of  Kazakhstani  women  in  the  labor market  is  characterized  by  the  fact  that  women\'s  labor  is  very  much in  demand  but  its  payment  remains  low.  Therefore  for  Kazakhstan the  gender  pay  gap  has  been  and  remains  the  main     female  gender issue   .the The  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  analyze  of  existing  concepts  of in  wages  defining  of gender  stereotypes  and  gender  differences gender  pay  gap  determinants  and level  of discrimination  against  women  in  Kazakhstan.  This  paper  is  among the  scientific  works  which  identify  primary  factors  of  gender  wage differences  between  men  and  women  and  analyze level  of gender  inequality  and  discrimination. to  evaluate the the 2.  Theoretical  Background  and  Literature  OverviewThe  literature  review  of  studies  on  gender  stereotype  problems  and gender  pay  gap  will  cover  the  results  of  research  conducted  by scientists  from  foreign  and  neighboring  countries.  The  review  to  a greater  extend  will  be  conducted  not  according  to  the  territorial principle  (country  of  publication)  but  according  to  the  problem thematic  (orientation  conceptual  basis  of  the  study).  In  the  proposed literature  review  the  task  is  to  explore  conceptual  framework  and basic  directions  of  the  problem  of  gender  wage  differences.Some  scientific  researches  on  gender  stereotyping  about  capability of  men  and  women  (Pheterson  et  al.  1971;  Kisler  1975;  Goldberg in 1983;  Kunda  &  Thagard  1996).  They  have found that  158Anel  A.  KIREYEVA  Zaira  T.  SATPAYEVA  Gaukhar  K.  KENZHEGULOVA  /  KODISA  INTERNATIONAL  CONFERENCE  ICBE  2019  157159stereotypes task  performance accordance  with  gender success achieved  by  men  are  mostly  due  to  their  capability  whereas  the same  success  achieved  by  women  is  regarded  as  efforts  luck  and  so on  (Pheterson  et  al.  1971).  At  the  same  time  according  to  Kissler the  factor  of     effort     in  men  is  regarded  as  a  stable  necessary condition  of  natural  male  need  in  achieving  as  means  of  barrier  and difficulties  overcoming  arising  in  the  way  of    a  goal  achievement (Kisler  1975).  In  cases  where  a  woman  performs  socalled     male work     she  performs  it  competently  then  in  the  perception  of  others she  deserves  more  respect  that  men  (Goldberg  1983).In  general  the  economic  theory  of  gender  segregation  presence  as is  explained  by  several the  behavior  of  employers a  result  of reasonsis in this Firstly the  underinvestment the  human  capital  of women  in  comparison  with  investment  in  human  capital  of  men  due to  shorter  expected  return  on  financial investments  (Becker  & Lindsay  1994).  As  a  result  women  and  men  have  the  opportunity to  occupy  jobs  that  impose  fundamentally  different  requirements  on the  professional  qualification  characteristics  of  an  employee.Secondly  the  discriminative  practice  of  hiring  and  promoting  of women  which  leads  to  the  fact  that    workers  of  different  sexes  are concentrated  on  different  positions  (Wirth  2001;  Kireyeva  2014). Thirdly  one  of  the  critical  moments  of  gender  segregation  is    glass  ceiling     model  for  women.  The  concept     glass  ceiling    describes  employment  practice  of  women  for  positions  which  do  not imply  further  career  advancement  (Coate  &  Loury  1993).  Such  a manifestation  is  typical  enough  for  many  CIS  countries  including Kazakhstan. There  through  above  mentioned  causes  have  an  impact  of  the sphere  of  employment  and  lays  the  foundation  for  gender  inequalities in  earnings.  At  the  same  time  discrimination  against  women  is detrimental  to  the  economy  due  to  the  incomplete  use  of  women\'s abilities  reducing  the  attractiveness  of  career  growth  for  women which  has  a  negative  impact  on  their  work.3.  Analysis  and  ResultsThe  difference  in  wages  between  men  and  women  is  determined as  a  difference  between  average  monthly  salary  between  men  and women i.e.  as  a  percentage  of  men   s  average  monthly  salary. Gender  politics  of  the  Republic  of  Kazakhstan  leads  to  situations  in which     emancipation     among  women  expands  for  them  the  repertoire of  possible  roles  and  lifestyles  but  affects  men  little.  As  a  result the  role  of     breadwinner     is  the  normative  male  model  and  does  not imply  equal  participation  of  men in  homework  childcare  and nurturing.Until  recently  gendersensitive  wage  statistic  was  absent.  Now there  is  a  sufficient  amount  of  static  data  to  conduct  a  full  analysis. In  the  international  context  according  to  the  World  Economic  Forum (WEF)  Kazakhstan  in  2018  took  60th  place  in  the  global  gender equality  ranking.  According  to  this  rating  opportunities  for  women in  the  labor  market  in  Kazakhstan  (chances  for  equal  wages  and careers)  make  up  70%  of  men\'s  opportunities.The  distribution  of  gender  wage  differences  by  economic  activity has  a  number  of  features.Firstly  a  woman  has  to  choose  lowpaid  areas  such  as  health care  education  and  social  services.Secondly  the  highest  level  of  underpayments  is  observed  among art  workers  professional  and  scientific  and  technical  activities.Thirdly  interindustry  differences  in  wages  among  men  are  higher than  among  women.  Salaries  in  financial  and  insurance  sectors  for men  are  3.5  times  more  in  comparison  with  the  field  of  education. On  the  one  hand  this  may  be  the  reason  for  the  separation  of  jobs into     male  professions     and     female  professions   .  On  the  other  hand this  may  be  the  reason  for  the  uneven  distribution  of  women  and men i.e.  manifestation  of  gender  occupational segregation.the  economy in 4.  ConclusionsThe  problems  which  related  to  the  study  of  gender  stereotypes and  gender  gaps  in  the  labor  market  are  quite  extensive  dynamically developing  and  cover  many  areas  of  society.  Generally  the  analysis of  the  distribution  of  gender  wage  gaps  has  led  to  the  following conclusions. Firstly  the  gender  pay  gap  is  reduced  with  the  reduction  of  the job  level  it  is  minimal  for  the  general  group  of  workers  and employees  it  is  reduced  with  the  transition  to  the  middle  and  higher level  of  qualification. Secondly  discrimination  is  linked  to  differences  in  human  capital and  education.  Wages  in  the  industrial  sector  are  higher  for  men than  for  women  because  men\'s  professions  (milling  in  oil  refining mechanical  engineers  chemical technologist)  are  characterized  by severe  and  unhealthy  working  conditions.  This  situation  is  typical  not only  for  Kazakhstan  but  also  for  most  other  countries.Thirdly  the  Duncan\'s  dissimilation  index  allows  us  to  trace  the dynamics  of  changes  in  the  professional  and  sectoral  structure  of men  and  women.  The  data  obtained  indicate  positive  trends  in  the field  of  gender  policy  in  Kazakhstan.  However  full  integration  will be  achieved  if  26%  of  men  move  into  feminized  employment  or  if 26%  of  women  move  into  maledominated  employmentIf  we  compare  with  the  indicators  of  number  of  countries  the situation  is  not  in  favor  of  Kazakhstan.  This  is  evidenced  by  the data  of  the  global  ranking  of  gender  equality  of  the  WEF.  Thus  in Kazakhstan  income  equality  between  men  and  women  lags  behind developed  economies  by  at in Norway  Sweden  Iceland  and  Finland  women  and  men  who  perform the  same  work  receive  the  same  salary.least  1012  years.
