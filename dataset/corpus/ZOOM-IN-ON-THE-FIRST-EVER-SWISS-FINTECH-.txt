Sven Bossu Head of Sibos Abstract Type of meeting Swiss Fintech Corner an exposition of 24 Swiss startups at the Sibos conference from 26 to 29 September 2016. Size of meeting 8300 attendees from 158 different countries at the Sibos conference. Geographical location of meeting Palexpo Geneva    Switzerland. Industry sector Financial industry in general Fintech in particular. Methodological  approach  Primary  data  semistructured  interviews  with  stakeholders  and  policy makers; secondary data survey carried out during the event addressed to the startups metrics of social media namely Twitter. Key benefits realised Key benefits were realized on three different levels. Firstly the event benefited Geneva  as  a  Meetings  Industry  (MI)  destination  and  as  an  important  financial  market  place  in general and a Fintech hub in particular. Secondly from a macroeconomic point of view the event could  raise  awareness  of  the  Swiss  Fintech  sector  not  only  among  professionals  but  also  among policy makers and the public. Finally at the microeconomic level the participation in the event could help the startups to easily approach venture capital companies at the local and international level and provided opportunities to present their services to a broad and international audience.  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 1    Main beneficiaries Geneva as a destination (business level); Geneva as a financial innovation place and Fintech hub (macroeconomic level) Swiss Fintech startup exhibitors at the Swiss Fintech Corner (microeconomic level). Relevance/Implications/Lessons Learnt (if applicable) The results should shed some light      On  Geneva  as  a  destination  The  cluster  policy  linking  local  economic  development knowledge (research & developmentR&D) and MI is fruitful for a finance innovation sector such as Fintech.      The policy of the Geneva Convention Bureau which mainly markets to MI events in relation with the local key clusters of industry. In this way the benefits dynamic is a feedback virtues loop.  On  the  one  hand  the  local  sector  cluster  industry  of  Geneva  (knowledge  R&D innovation  etc.)  spreads  its  excellence  to  the  international  audience  participating  in  an event  while  on  the  other  hand  the  industry  sector  of  the  events  provides  benefits  to Geneva   s  knowledge  and  research  &  development  and  adds  valued  skills.  This  policy generates a dynamic of virtues feedback loop between Geneva   s economic and knowledge environment and the industrial sector involved in an event. In other words the MI policy is a tool  for  promoting  Geneva  not  only  as  a  destination  but  also  as  a  center  of  economic knowledge and innovation excellence. Future  research  (if  applicable)  Develop  a  Delphi  survey  in  order  to  measure  the  strength  of  the perceived benefits at the microeconomic level.  Key words Fintech startup ecosystem Swiss Fintech Corner Meetings Industry (MI) MICE        JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 2   1 Introduction 1.1  About Sibos  Sibos  (Swift  International  Banking  Operations  Seminar)  is  the  annual  conference  exhibition  and networking  event  organised  for  the  financial  industry  by  SWIFT  (Society  for  Worldwide  Interbank Financial  Telecommunication)  a  global  provider  of  secure  financial  messaging  services.  Sibos originally started out as a banking operations seminar in 1978 and has since evolved into a premier business forum for the global financial community to facilitate debate collaboration and networking around  the  future  of  payments  securities  cash  management  and  trade  and  financial  crime compliance.  Each  year  the  event  is  hosted  in  a  different  destination  around  the  world  bringing together  approximately  8000  participants  including  business  leaders  decision  makers  and  topic experts from financial institutions market infrastructures multinational corporations and technology partners. The event boasts hundreds of speakers and conference sessions nearly 200 exhibitors and multiple networking events over a fourday program with underlying goals of creating discussions of business  strategy  and  network  building  to  collectively  shape  the  future  of  the  financial  industry (Sibos n.d.).  Sibos 2016 took place in PalexpoGeneva from 26 to 29 September. For the first time in Sibos    history the  event  hosted  a  Swiss  Fintech  Corner  which  was  set  up  with  the  help  of  the  Economic Development Office of Geneva (EDO) Alp ICT and the Swiss Finance & Technology Association.   The Sibos team currently headed by Sven Bossu worked closely together with the local economic minister Pierre Maudet  who  saw  the  event  as  a  special  opportunity  to  bring  the  banking  research  and innovation  communities  together  to  collaborate  and  drive  positive  change in Switzerland   s financial services industry. Mr. Maudet was a great friend to Sibos and brought some of his country   s leading bankers to the Swiss Lounge on the exhibition floor.  He  introduced  the  local  FinTech  community  to  some  of  the  world   s  industry  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 3  experts who were happy to share their knowledge with those eager to learn. (Bossu 2017).    It  was  the  second  largest  Sibos  conference  to  date  with  over  8300  attendees  from  158  different countries. The Sibos survey (Sibos 2017) showed that for 93% of the sampled attendees this event met  or  exceeded  their  expectations.  49%  of  the  participants  were  from  Europe  Middle  East  and Africa regions 24% from UK/Nordics 14% from Americas and 13% from Asia and Pacific. The main business focus represented in the fourday event was payments. Other primary business focus areas included trade service cash management and securities. Different institutions were involved in the event such as commercial banks and software vendors/consultancies. Finally the survey showed that the  main  reasons  for  attending  Sibos  were  networking  keeping  up  to  date  with  industry  trends conducting business and listening to debates.   1.2  The Swiss Fintech Corner FinTech  short  for  Financial  Technology  has  become  an  important  sector  in  its  own right in the wake of the global financial crisis. Technological innovation has created the opportunity  for  significant  widening  choice  of  financial  services  for  consumers. (Deloitte 2016 3)   Instead  of  traditional  financial  services  offering  packages  of  services  new  innovative  Fintech companies offer customised solutions to consumers which are often seen as more efficient and costeffective. The loss of confidence in banks has allowed for consumers to rethink    who    the authority of financial services should belong to (Arner et al. 2015 4) but as the president of the Swiss National Bank  Mr.  Thomas  J.  Jordan  highlighted  in  the  opening  speech  at  Sibos  in  Geneva  with  all  these innovations  one must understand the opportunities and risks that  come with it (Strategic Insight 2016 4ff.).    JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 4    24  Swiss  startups  pursuing  the  Swiss  traditions  of  financial  services  excellence  and  technical innovation were invited to the Swiss Fintech Corner in order to showcase their technical innovations in a wide range of financial product categories (Etienne 2016). These companies were selected by a committee out of the 216 startups registered in Switzerland. The criteria used for the selection were the  company   s  upandrunning  solution  clear  pricing  plan  office  located  in  Switzerland  and relevance  of  their  solution  (Swiss  Finance  &  Technology  Association  2016).  Five  cantons  were represented  by  these  different  startups  as  well  as  three  of  the  five  main  sectors  of  activity institutional investment banking infrastructure and cryptofinance & blockchain (Perron 2016).

Switzerland   s status as a financial centre is integral to its national identity    (Ernst & Young Ltd 2016 3) and the importance of the industry for the national economy is evident given  that  it  contributes  directly  to  approximately  10%  of  the  national  economy  as  well  as  6% (218000)  of  fulltime  equivalent  jobs  (BAK  Basel  Economics  AG  2015  3f.).  When  looking  at  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 5    Switzerland  as  a  Fintech  hub  it  has  lagged  in  terms  of  startup  activity  outside  the  scope  of  life sciences  which  accounts  for  78%  of  the  total  CHF470  million  invested  capital  in  Swiss  startups compared  to  that  of  other  innovationdriven  hubs  such  as  New  York  City  London  and  Singapore (Ernst & Young Ltd 2016).   According  to  the  Global  Financial  Centres  Index  (GFCI)  which  is  used  to  measure  financial  centres globally in  terms of  competitiveness  Switzerland   s two financial  centres Zurich and  Geneva have both  been  losing  ground  with  Zurich  down  from  7th  to  9th  position  in  2016  and  Geneva  more significantly down from 13th to 23rd position in 2016 (Z/Yen Group 2016). Nevertheless Switzerland still has potential for improvement due to its leading position as an innovation hub its centralised geographic location high level of security reliability quality and stability along with its large financial centre  an  excellent  infrastructure  legal  system  and  protection  of  consumers  (Deloitte  2016). Furthermore developments such as Doodle Local.ch and Homegate in 2013 followed by grassroots initiatives namely the formation of the Swiss Finance & Technology Association in 2014 to further encourage and support the Fintech ecosystem (Ernst & Young Ltd 2016).   1.4  Geneva as Meetings Industry destination An MI destination should have certain factors to be successful which include but are not limited to service providers price/value meeting room facilities access additional services leisure facilities location  and  image  (Boo  et  al.  2008).  Another  important  issue  is  the  quality  of  the  supplier management (Weber and Ladkin 2003). In the case of Geneva as a MI destination it has an ideal venue  boasting  over  106000  square  metres  of  contiguous  exhibition  space.  It  is  home  to  one  of Europe   s  largest  fullyintegrated  international  convention  and  exhibition  centres  Palexpo  (Sibos 2016).  In  2016  the  Geneva  Convention  Bureau  confirmed  49  different  MI  events  of  various international and national organisations including organizations from Asia the US and Europe which took place in 21 different venues across Geneva. There was a total of 32853 people attending one or  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 6    more of these MI events with the Sibos Conference contributing over 27% (9000) attendees. The conference also generated just over 31% (35000) of the total overnight stays ( 111671) making Sibos the largest contributor of the 2016 MI events in terms of number of attendees and overnight stays followed  by  the  European  Congress  on  Orthopedics  (EFORT)  with  6000  participants  and  18000 overnight stays (Geneva Convention Bureau 2016).  Since  its  reorganisation  in  2014  the  policy  of  the  Geneva  Convention  Bureau  has  focused  on  the promotion  of  events  belonging  to  local  clusters  of  high  added  value  competences  defined  by  the Economic  Development  Office  (EDO)    (The  Iceberg  2017).  The  attraction  of  Geneva  as  a  MI destination is not only based on lifestyle and landscape but also on the excellence of knowledge and innovation capacities in those clusters.   1.5  Rationality of the research The Sibos conference and the Swiss Fintech Corner were targets of the Geneva MI policy as Banking and  Finance  is  one  of  Geneva   s  excellence  clusters.  The  aim  of  this  research  is  to  highlight  the benefits  of  the  abovementioned  policy  which  goes  beyond  landscape  attractions  by  strategically bidding  for  events  that  link  to  the  local  knowledge  and  innovation.  On  the  one  hand  Geneva reinforces its position and visibility as a Fintech innovation hub (benefit for Geneva as a destination) on the other hand the general excellence of the Swiss innovation environment. Finance & Banking and Fintech innovation have the possibility to gain visibility among professionals policy makers and the  general  public  (macroeconomic  level).  Last  but  not  least  the  startups  presented  had  the possibility to significantly increase their audience such as possible customers and investors to one that  is  broader  and  more  international.  The  rest  of  the  paper  is  structured  as  follows  Section  2 describes  the  methodology  section  3  outlines  and  discusses  the  results  focussing  on  the  benefits realized and finally section 4 presents the conclusion and suggestions for future research.   JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 7   2  Methodology 2.1  Data sources  Primary and secondary data have been used in this research. The primary data was collected using exploratory  techniques  namely  semistructured  interviews.  They  were  guided  by  a  questionnaire which  focused  primarily  on  the  benefits  for  Geneva  at  the  macroeconomic  level  (Appendix).  The interviews were carried out during the month of March 2017. The interviewees were Anja Loetscher (Director of the Geneva Convention Bureau DGCB) Michael Kleiner (Economic Development Officer State of Geneva EDO) Sven Bossu (Head of Sibos Sibos) and John Hucker (President Swiss Finance &  Technology  Association  SFTA).  The  group  included  at  least  one  member  of  each  of  the  main stakeholder groups. From hereafter reference will be made to the respective interviewees with the assigned acronyms that are indicated in italics following their respective titles in parentheses above.  The  secondary  data  are  from  two  difference  sources.  To  examine  the  benefits  realized  on  a microeconomic level a questionnaire capturing the satisfaction of startups presented at the Swiss Fintech  Corner  was  reanalyzed  for  the  purposes  of  this  study.  The  questionnaire  design  and collection was carried out jointly by Geneva EDO and Alp ICT1. 16 out of the 24 companies answered it.  Geneva  EDO  provided  the  raw  data  for  this  study.  The  other  source  of  secondary  data  is  the metrics  of  social  media  communication  during  the  exhibition  at  the  Swiss  Fintech  Corner  with specific attention to Twitter. The communication strategy was led conjointly by the Swiss Finance & Technology Association and Alp ICT.  The  metrics2  concern  the  tweets  the  Swiss  Finance  &  Technology  Association  and  other  parties posted during the Swiss Fintech Corner using the hashtag #swissfintechcorner. The data yielded are                                                             1    Alp ICT is a startup accelerator for technology enterprises in Switzerland.

All the series are monthly. The series length is one year from March 2016 to March 2017 except for the    new followers    data where the data starts from July 2016. Unfortunately one year or even less is not enough to measure or filter seasonal effects or patterns.   2.2  Data analysis The interviews were collected and recorded via Skype and manually transcribed. The only exception was the interview with Sven Bossu in which case Sibos handled the recording through Cisco WebEX but unfortunately the process failed. The interviewee then agreed to answer the interview questions again in writing. The authors acknowledge the limitations in the methodology but this was beyond their will.  The interviews were analysed using SphinxIQ2 Quali software (Boughzala et al. 2014) using a lexical and  statistical  approach.  The  lexical  approach  identifies  the  most  frequently  used  words  and expressions  (i.e.  Swiss  Fintech  Corner).    One  of  the  main  goals  is  to  show  the  homogeneity  of opinions across the interviewees. The statistical approach helps to estimate the level of homogeneity across interviewees. To this end crosstabulations between the main words or expressions yielded by the lexical analysis and the interviews were calculated (i.e. principal components analysis   2 test).   The satisfaction survey among the startups was analysed using descriptive statistics. For the social media data structural time series was used (Koopman et al. 2009). However in most of the cases the reduced length of the time series only allows estimation using a classical ordinary least squares (OLS) model. A model was built for each of the variables. All the models have the independent variable time (t) and the dependent variable which is each of the variables listed in 2.1. Finally in order to estimate  the  strength  of  the  effect  of  the  Swiss  Fintech  Corner  dummy  or  intervention  variables  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 9   were added to September 2016 the time when the event took place.    3  Results 3.1 Interview analysis The first question of the interview (see Appendix) addressed the possible effect of the Swiss Fintech Corner on the visibility of Geneva. The lexical analysis shows three slightly different groups.  DGCB and Sibos show a significant level of homogeneity and a broadly positive evaluation. DGCB has the highest lexical richness in that the terms used referred almost entirely to mass media impact. This shows that she was exclusively fully aware of the importance of including Geneva in global mass media     For  us  to  have  had  SIBOS  here  in  Geneva  gave  us  wide  local  and  international  press coverage.    (DGCB)  The second group of the lexical component to be analysed is Sibos. For the Head of Sibos the impact of the event on Geneva as a MI destination was not significant    personally I don   t think the Fintech corner  had  any  impact  on  the  visibility  of  Geneva  as  a  destination  and  that  was  not  its  purpose neither    (Sibos). Rather  the aim was  to showcase  Switzerland and Geneva as a Fintech hub.    The entire idea around the Fintech corner was to promote Switzerland as a Fintech hub and to connect local  Fintech  companies  with  the  global  financial  institutions.     (Sibos)  The  abovementioned observation is in line with the aim of the Geneva Convention Bureau (GCB)    we as the Convention Bureau align our work according the EDOs clusters     one of them being finance.    (DGCB)  The two other interviewees are also close to each other and form the third group. For SFTA there was an impact but more on Geneva as a canton and not on the city itself For a destination in general I think people could see just how high quality it was but also in terms of the scale of the city ... Well I think in general it was good to bring the  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 10    global audience on that scale to a city like Geneva. (SFTA)  Finally  the  EDO  focuses  on  the  direct  impacts  such  as  the  fact  that  the  number  of  overnights generated specifically by the Swiss Fintech Corner (SFC) was limited Well it's very difficult to say because the audience that we were catering for was very specific startups Fintech audience which has not much to do with tourism industry in general and ... because they very rarely meet in large meetings ... The startups we had on our corner were not people who either organise such large meetings or who usually take part in such large meetings     They rather meet in little demo days and pitching days and meetings with VCs etc. but not necessarily in large events. (EDO)  Nevertheless and in line with the preceding interviews the EDO agrees on the importance of the event  for  the  startups  reinforcing  the  position  of  the  SFTA     so  for  the  startups  this  was  quite  a unique opportunity to be in such a large event.    (EDO)  Therefore  the  impact  of  the  SFC  on  the  image  of  Geneva  as  a  destination  in  general  or  a  MI destination in particular was limited. The impact was on the whole of Switzerland as a Fintech hub connecting    local Fintech companies with the global financial institutions.    (Sibos)   The aim of the second question was to study the inverse effect how Geneva as a global financial market  affects  the  visibility  and/or  synergies  of  startups.  The  DGCB  did  not  answer  this  question Sibos gave a limited answer of only 18 main lexical elements whereas the EDO   s number was 70 and the SFTA   s was 145. The big imbalance in the number of lexical elements invalidated the statistical analysis of homogeneity.  Geneva being a financial center was one of the key determinants for Sibos to choose it as its 2016 location    The fact that Geneva is an important banking market place was one of the reasons why Sibos came to Geneva.    (Sibos)  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 11     In  regards  to  increasing  awareness  among  the  public  and  political  authorities  of  the  existence  of Fintech  startups  and  their  importance  Sibos  thinks  it  was  positive     In  that  sense  it  did  boost awareness with the public opinion and local political authorities.    (Sibos)   In line with this opinion SFTA sees an impact on public opinion and recognises the role of Geneva on this impact I  think  Geneva  and  Fintech  are  sometimes  surprised  to  hear  there  is  a  startup community and I think honestly speaking it is not the most vibrant or large scale one and it is something that could be further developed and improved even if you just look at it in contrast to Lausanne for example   . I think the fact that it   s a financial centre can be a real advantage and that   s a huge strength. (SFTA)  EDO as a member of the government of Geneva has a slightly different opinion  the public opinion has not changed a lot but the awareness of the Fintech startups among traditional Genevan financial actors has increased the  link  between  Fintech  and  Sibos  was  made  but  I  don't  think  in  terms  of  public opinion this has really made a big difference. For the political awareness what is also interesting  is  the  business  awareness  because  our  main  issue  was  to  sensitise  the bankers  the  financial  actors  about  Fintech       we  could  invite  Swiss  bankers  private bankers from Geneva we could invite them for an evening to an event on that Fintech Corner.  This  allowed  us  to  make  a  link  between  the  local  Geneva  bankers  and  the startup  companies  that  were  on  the  corner  and  that  was  for  us  maybe  the  biggest challenge is to create that link between the local finance industry and the local startup industry. Because the political awareness is there. Our politicians they are aware and they really want to advance Fintech. (EDO)  In  the  literature  review  it  was  pointed  out  that  Switzerland  has  two  financial  centres  Zurich  and Geneva which raise the question of a possible change of their relative position.  The repositioning of Geneva respective to Zurich was generally rejected but there is consensus of the whole country of  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 12   Switzerland at the international level.    There  is  broad  consensus  that  Geneva  provided  good  opportunities  to  link  startups  to  traditional actors which was shown in the precedent quote of EDO and in the quote here below by SFTA It   s  [Switzerland]  a  huge  financial  centre  here  whether  you  speak  of  Geneva  or Switzerland as a whole and there is really this demand for innovation and a lot of the banks here are not necessarily innovative they were traditional in a lot of ways and the cultures weren't about rocking the boat or doing things differently and that is I think why in particular not only is it about startups doing things but it's about how startups enable  corporates  to  do  things  and  that's  something  I  think  has  a  rich  history  in  all parts of Switzerland where you marry the tradition with innovation and so yes I think the fact that's it   s such a huge financial centre and such a unique financial centre in Geneva creates a truly unique opportunity in a global context and that's something we say not only locally but we also tell that to the world and yeah you can probably tell that's something I am a little bit excited about. (SFTA)  The third interview question examined the effect of the SFC on the Geneva startups    ecosystem. The question  was  not  answered  by  the  DGCB  but  the  statistical  analysis  of  the  other  three  shows heterogeneity  of  the  lexical  elements.    The  positive  role  Geneva  has  as  an  ecosystem  yielded different  strength  of  consensus.  The  EDO  partially  credits  the  SFC  but  focuses  more  on  the  Sibos conference overall than on the SFC event. There  were  other  places    there  was  one  from  Belgium  one  from  Luxemburg  there was  one  from  Singapore  and  so  you  had  different  places  where  startups  were concentrated  and  so  people  could  go  and  meet  each  other.       It  also  gave  them  the opportunity to walk around and meet other startups because as I said we were not the only Fintech Corner. (EDO)  Sibos and the SFTA have the most positive opinion about Geneva as a Fintech ecosystem The  global  financial  community  loved  the  idea  because  it  allowed  them  to  connect directly  to  smaller  companies  with  bright  ideas  on  how  to  tackle  big  issues  for  our  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 13   industry.  ... And the feedback I got from the Swiss Fintechs was really positive as well they  were  given  access  to  the  global  banks  and  privileged  contacts  with  very  senior persons of those institutions     And the events organised around the corner (such as networking presentations etc.) did only boost this. The startup corner was something we had never done before and it proved very successful     As for whether it creates competition or synergies we actually saw both. (Sibos)   For the SFTA the focus is put on Switzerland as a whole to be an innovative Fintech ecosystem  one of the more prolific influencers on social media a man named Pascal Bouvier said that he was going to come to Switzerland to find things out in part because he started to hear stuff through his Innotribe network because he was at Sibos every year and because people told him about some of these companies in the Crypto Valley or in the blockchain  community  and  he  didn   t  actually  invest  in  that  but  he  got  involved  in  a syndicate  that  invested  in  Knip  which  was  a  wellknown  Zurich  startup       There's events  there's  an  association  there   s  some  other  things  like  that  but  a  big international event like Sibos and a platform like the Swiss Fintech Corner in particular gets the best 25 startups all in one place and they get to see each other in a really high level environment and what   s great is they get to not only represent themselves and 'wrestle  shoulders     against  each  other  but  they  stand  'shoulder  to  shoulder' representing Switzerland which was really great. (SFTA)  In  conclusion  the  representative  of  the  government  seems  to  pay  attention  to  the     big  picture    namely the Sibos conference overall whereas for the Sibos and SFTA representatives focus is put on the  positioning  of  Switzerland  and  not  specifically  Geneva  as  a  Fintech  ecosystem.  For  them  the event was a real success in this regard.  The fourth question concerns general remarks about the event. This question was answered by all the  interviewees  with  the  exception  of  Sibos  which  is  why  the  heterogeneity  analysis  will  not  be included  in  the  analysis.  The  DGCB  highlighted  the  innovative  character  of  the  SFC  at  the  Sibos conference  and  also  linked  the  success  of  the  events  both  the  Sibos  conference  and  SFC  to  the  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 14    importance of Geneva as a financial market place.    Organizers will prefer to come to the congress if the topic is relevant to the destination.    (DGCB)    The  EDO  points  out  the  good  coordination  efforts  of  the  cantonal  authorities  with  the  DGCB  for having succeeded in bringing the event to Geneva. In line with this the SFTA noted the coordination between different stakeholders being a key aspect of the success I think the Swiss Fintech Corner was a fantastic example of the power of a coordinated effort  to  really  highlight  the  economic  benefit  of  all  this  and  the  commercial opportunities  for  Swiss  stakeholders  in  an  international  context  and  what  I  would challenge the audience to help with is something that actually for groups involved took great  coordination  and  it  wasn   t  without  special  extraordinary  effort  that  it  was possible. (SFTA)  The  final  question  explored  points  for  improvement.  The  DGCB  and  the  EDO  identified  some challenges with local tourism actors such as hotels transportation providers and so on. The DGCB agreed that one of the problems was the cost of the event    our pricing was on average too high.    (DGCB)     I  mean  there  was  a  postmortem  you  know  discussion  with  the  hotels  with  the  public transport  with  all  the  different  actors.     (EDO)  EDO  have  made  an  effort  in  order  to  reduce  the participation cost for startups And  in  the  end  we  managed  to  make  something  that  didn't  cost  anything  for  the startups  themselves.  Thanks  to  the  sponsors  we  found  we  could  reimburse  the startups with the amount they had given us so in the end it didn't cost them hardly anything. (EDO)  Sibos wants to improve governance by expanding their data collection before and during the event in order to better assess the event    To be changed make sure governance is clear as from start and also  set  up  the  follow  up  study  before  starting  the  event  allowing  to  collect  data  also  during  the event.    (Sibos)  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 15    3.2  SFC Startups survey  16  out  of  the  24  Fintech  startups  answered  the  satisfaction  survey  with  some  of  them  providing incomplete responses.  According to the survey results just under 50% of the participants spent two days  at  the  Fintech  Corner  while  the  majority  spent  only  one  day  at  the  SFC.  The  mean  overall satisfaction level was 4.43 on a rating scale from 1 (unsatisfied) to 5 (extremely satisfied) so most were either very satisfied or extremely satisfied overall.   Some points which participants felt could be improved include       Preparation to be done earlier more in advance       More media coverage and focused articles of the startups       Asking private banks to visit the Corner and spend some time at each booth       Allowing startups to have the opportunity to participate in the innovation talks       Better location of the SFC and more space for each startup.   Despite  these  suggestions  the  average  ranking  for  the  following  SFC  aspects  all  received  a  score above 4 preparation of the associations involved in organising the Fintech Corner the Swiss Fintech Corner communication location design and layout as well as the relevance of participation.  In  terms  of  the  amount  of  media  coverage  due  to  the  participants     presence  at  the  Swiss  Fintech Corner the main platform was social media representing over 60% of the total media coverage. 75 pieces  of  media  coverage  related  to  10  of  the  participants  however  just  under  half  of  this  social media coverage was linked to a single participant. The online press represented 22% (27 pieces) of the total media coverage and the same participant mentioned above was responsible for almost half of  those  pieces  too.  The  printed  press  radio  and  TV  followed  with  considerably  lower  figures.  It must be noted that this question can be interpreted in many ways especially with regards to social  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 16    media where the same post is shared multiple times and the inclusion or exclusion of retweets may significantly  affect  the  figures  provided.  Therefore  there  is  not  enough  data  to  interpret  the effectiveness of each type of media coverage.   There was a very low amount of technical leads with a total of nine. A possible reason for this may be that    getting technical leads    was not the aim of all the startups present and the audience may not have been suitable. Despite the fact that the participants had on average roughly five commercial leads each the quality of commercial leads were rated as average with a score of 3.44 out of 5. A possible  hypothesis  may  be  that  many  commercial  leads  were  considered  as  early  leads  and  not converted leads. Missing information such as the specific field each Fintech participant is in as well as how old the startup company is may explain some of the abovementioned factors.   In conclusion the overall satisfaction ranged from good to excellent. The items to improve for the Startup Corner included  better organisation in advance location more advertising and other pull factors to be put in place to attract the right visitors a more egalitarian participation of the startups with  regards  to  participation  in  interviews  and  innovation  talks  more  media  coverage  and  finally. from an academic point of view it would be useful to improve the quality of the followup with the startups in order to see the evolution if any that may be related to the impact of such an event on the participants.  3.3  Social media metrics analysis The reader should be aware that the hashtag #swissfintechcorner was only used during the event. Therefore some of the conclusions below should be considered with caution.  The Twitter analysis of the SFC effects yields the following conclusions  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 17        Firstly no positive effect is observed on New Followers and Average Engagement Rate. In the  former  case  the  number  of  followers  is  steadily  and  exponentially  increasing.  In  the latter  case  unfortunately  the  trend  shows  a  slow  decrease  with  a  negative  effect immediately after the event (October 2016).      Secondly Tweets Retweets and Link Clicks show a positive punctual effect. Punctual means that the effect only persisted during September 2016 disappearing afterwards. In the case of Tweets and Retweets added effects on average were 65% and the development of Link Clicks in September 2016 were half of what would have been observed if the SFC had not occurred.      Thirdly for both Total Tweet Impressions and Likes the effect was positive for September 2016. In both cases the SFC doubled the longrun trend. Unfortunately the positive effect was shortlived with the numbers decreasing during the four months following the event.   Even though the startups participating in the SFC showed a high level of satisfaction in the survey (3.2) regarding the social media campaigns the positive effects were difficult to maintain after the hashtag  was  no  longer  used.  This  proves  the  good  quality  of  the  strategy  of  the  community management by the association during the duration of the event. The lesson of these analyses is that the event increases visibility (retweets likes links clicks) but making these effects last over time is still a challenge. The analysis of social media metrics during other business events will be necessary not only to confirm this fact but also to find strategies to cope with this issue.  4  Benefits Realised Firstly it is important to mention the difficulty of isolating the Swiss Fintech Corner from the Sibos conference which has especially been demonstrated during the interviews carried out for this study. Nevertheless benefits related to the SFC have been concluded based on three levels which follow below  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 18    1. On Geneva as a MI destination  While little evidence shows the specific benefit of the SFC on Geneva as a MI destination the Sibos conference  has  been  seen  to  further  the  image  of  Geneva  as  an  important  financial  centre.  The Fintech hub relevance was not limited to Geneva but instead spread over the whole of Switzerland.  2. On a macroeconomic level According  to  the  SFTA  traditional  bankers  were  able  to  connect  with  and  be  made  aware  of  the existence and importance of Fintechs for the financial sector. The SFC also enabled the creation of links between the local startup industry and the local finance industry (EDO).  3. On a microeconomic level a.  The  startups  who  participated  at  the  SFC.  The  interviews  and  survey  analysis  document stakeholders     optimism  that  the  SFC  will  contribute  to  the  future  success  of  the  startup companies  through  the  eventrelated  exposure/visibility  and  the  direct  contact  with audiences  that  may  potentially  lead  to  partnerships/collaboration.  Despite  the  fact  that some  startups  showed  a  highly  successful  outcome  in  terms  of  social  media  coverage converted  leads  and  exposure  in  general  it  must  be  noted  that  these  benefits  were  not distributed evenly among the startups who participated in the survey. This was mainly due to some of the startups not being directly involved in the banking sector.  b.  The Swiss Finance & Technology Association. The hashtag created and used during the event (#swissfintechcorner) was able to drive meaningful traffic in terms of social media exposure for the association with specific regards to Twitter.    JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 19   5  Discussion and Conclusions  The benefits derived from the SFC have proven difficult to isolate and identify in many situations whereas  the  entire  Sibos  event  has  been  clearly  linked  to  many  benefits  identified  by  the interviewees.  Furthermore  the  interviewees  have  shown  to  have  notably  different  points  of  view based on their position in relation to the event and their overall profession. The most contrasting viewpoint  was  that  of  the  EDO  who  focused  on  the  main  event  (i.e.  Sibos)  rather  than  the  SFC. Another  demarcated  opinion  was  that  of  the  DGCB  who  is  more  focused  on  the  development  of Geneva as a successful MI destination. For the DGCB the importance of global mass media coverage was significantly higher which is understandable given its links to the image of a destination.   The findings of this study did not yield enough evidence to support the statement that    Organizers will prefer to come to the congress if the topic is relevant to the destination.    It appears that it may depend  on  the  kind  of  event  such  as  the  field  (i.e.  scientific  industrial)  or  the  customer  (i.e. corporation  association).  Furthermore  the  authors  believe  that  even  if  this  is  correct  it  cannot supersede  other  factors  such  as  competitive  position  in  price/value  access  additional  services leisure facilities (Boo et al. 2008) nor the quality of supplier management (Weber and Ladkin 2003). In fact the latter statement about the relevance of the event topic to the destination appears as a push factor; however the authors believe that instead it is a pull factor.  Therefore the destination could employ this factor as a means to increase its appeal and subsequently increase the chance of hosting  more  events.  Some  of  the  interviews  point  out  the  difficulty  in  engaging  with  different providers such as the accommodation or the transportation sectors despite the benefits this event yielded.   Finally evidence shows that the Virtues feedback loop is existent. As noted in the benefits section some  startups  were  seen  to  get  opportunities  while  the  SFTA  was  able  to  increase  its  publicity. Moreover  while  Geneva  may  not  have  gained  visibility  specifically  the  Fintech  ecosystem  of  JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 20   Switzerland as a whole has indeed succeeded in this way.     Limitations of the research   The  primary  data more specifically the interviews  that were  carried out for  this study had a few issues namely some questions were not answered by all the interviewees and secondly one of the recordings failed. In terms of the secondary data the survey that was sent to the Fintech startups who participated at the event was answered by 16 out of 24. Furthermore given that there was a lapse of time between the event and the survey answers there was a need to recall certain answers and  this  could  have  changed  the  evaluation.  The  time  series  evolution  metrics  used  in  the  social media metrics analysis was less than one year therefore some sophisticated statistical tools namely the structural time series could not be applied and seasonality patterns could not be filtered. Future research  could  be  to  carry  out  a  Delphi  study  with  all  the  Fintech  startup  participants  in  order  to evaluate the actual SFC effectiveness which was beyond the scope of this paper.

JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 23   Appendix Interview questions  We  are  writing  a  case  study  about  the  impact  of  the  Swiss  Fintech  corner  during  the  Sibos Conference  which  took  place  in  Geneva  last  year  in  September.  We  focus  on  impacts  other  than economic ones. Our aim is to measure these impacts from three different perspectives namely  on the image of Geneva as a Meeting Incentives and Convention destination  on the Fintech ecosystem in Geneva  and finally at the microeconomic level which is on the startups of the Fintech sector. 1. 2. 3.  The interview will last from 30 to 45 minutes. Let's begin with the image of Geneva as a MI destination.  Question 1 [Introduction] Geneva is very well known on an international level as a financial centre as well as a Meeting  Incentives  and  Convention  destination.  From  you  point  of  view  How  do  you  think  the Fintech corner that was set up during the Sibos event affected the visibility of Geneva as a) a tourism destination in general ? b) a MI destination in particular?  Question 2 [Introduction]  Now  may  we  talk  about  the     otherwayaround     effect  which  means  given  that Geneva  is  an  important  finance/banking  market  place  how  does  Geneva  as  the  host  site  of  the Swiss  Fintech  startup  corner  affect  the  visibility  and/or  synergies  of  the  startups  in  the  following aspects 1. 2.  the public opinion in general and the political authority   s awareness in particular  Related companies (such as banks insurance health etc.) JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 24   3. 4. Education and research at the universities and applied universities level Competitive position with Zurich as a Fintech hub and competitive position at an International level (i.e. the ranking of GFCI global financial centres index)    Question 3 [Introduction] From the point of view of the startups and the Geneva Fintech ecosystem 1.  Do you think that the Startup Corner affected the role/involvement of traditional sectors (banking insurance health others) and in which way/sense?  What about Venture Capital companies? 2.  Do you think that the event creates news synergies between startups or increase their competition?  Question 4 [Introduction] We would like to ask you if you would like to add more general remarks to our study. 1. 2.     Which were the strong points about the Swiss Fintech Corner? If there were a new edition in Geneva which aspects do you think should be change? JMIC Value of Meetings Case Study Series  Page 25  "
