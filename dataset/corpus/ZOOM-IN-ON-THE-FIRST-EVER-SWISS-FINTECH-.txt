jmic valu meet case studi seri page global audienc that scale citi like geneva sfta final the edo focu the direct impact such the fact that the number overnight gener specif the swiss fintech corner sfc limit well veri difficult say becaus the audienc that were cater for veri specif startup fintech audienc which not much with tourism industri gener and becaus they veri rare meet larg meet the startup had our corner were not peopl who either organis such larg meet who usual take part such larg meet they rather meet littl demo day and pitch day and meet with etc but not necessarili larg event edo nevertheless and line with the preced interview the edo agre the import the event for the startup reinforc the posit the sfta for the startup thi quit uniqu opportun such larg event edo therefor the impact the sfc the imag geneva destin gener destin particular limit the impact the whole switzerland fintech hub connect local fintech compani with the global financi institut sibo the

geneva import bank market place one the reason whi sibo came geneva sibo jmic valu meet case studi seri page regard increas awar among the public and polit author the exist fintech startup and their import sibo think posit that sens did boost awar with the public opinion and local polit author sibo line with thi opinion sfta see impact public opinion and recognis the role geneva thi impact think geneva and fintech are sometim surpris hear there startup commun and think honestli speak not the most vibrant larg scale one and someth that could further develop and improv even you just look contrast lausann for exampl think the fact that financi centr can real advantag and that huge strength sfta edo member the govern geneva slightli differ opinion the public opinion not chang lot but the awar the fintech startup among tradit genevan financi actor increas the link between fintech and sibo made but think term public opinion thi realli made big differ for the polit awar what also interest the busi awar becaus our main issu sensitis the banker the financi actor about fintech could invit swiss banker privat banker from geneva could invit them for even event that fintech corner thi allow make link between the local geneva banker and the startup compani that were the corner and that for mayb the biggest challeng creat that link between the local financ industri and the local startup industri becaus the polit awar there our politician they are awar and they realli want advanc fintech edo the literatur review point out that switzerland two financi centr zurich and geneva which rais the question possibl chang their rel posit the reposit geneva respect zurich gener reject but there consensu the whole countri jmic valu meet case studi seri page switzerland the intern level there broad consensu that geneva provid good opportun link startup tradit actor which shown the preced quot edo and the quot here below sfta switzerland huge financi centr here whether you speak geneva switzerland whole and there realli thi demand for innov and lot the bank here are not necessarili innov they were tradit lot way and the cultur were about rock the boat thing differ and that think whi particular not onli about startup thing but about how startup enabl corpor thing and that someth think rich histori all part switzerland where you marri the tradit with innov and think the fact that such huge financi centr and such uniqu financi centr geneva creat truli uniqu opportun global context and that someth say not onli local but also tell that the world and yeah you can probabl tell that someth littl bit excit about sfta the third interview question examin the effect the sfc the geneva startup ecosystem the question not answer the dgcb but the statist analysi the other three show heterogen the lexic element the posit role geneva ecosystem yield differ strength consensu the edo partial credit the sfc but focu more the sibo confer overal than the sfc event there were other place there one from belgium one from luxemburg there one from singapor and you had differ place where startup were concentr and peopl could and meet each other also gave them the opportun walk around and meet other startup becaus said were not the onli fintech corner edo sibo and the sfta have the most posit opinion about geneva fintech ecosystem the global financi commun love the idea becaus allow them connect directli smaller compani with bright idea how tackl big issu for our jmic valu meet case studi seri page industri and the feedback got from the swiss fintech realli posit well they were given access the global bank and privileg contact with veri senior person those institut and the event organis around the corner such network present etc did onli boost thi the startup corner someth had never done befor and prove veri success for whether creat competit synergi actual saw both sibo for the sfta the focu put switzerland whole innov fintech ecosystem one the more prolif influenc social medium man name pascal bouvier said that come switzerland find thing out part becaus start hear stuff through innotrib network becaus sibo everi year and becaus peopl told him about some these compani the crypto valley the blockchain commun and didn actual invest that but got involv syndic that invest knip which wellknown zurich startup there event there associ there some other thing like that but big intern event like sibo and platform like the swiss fintech corner particular get the best startup all one place and they get see each other realli high level environ and what
