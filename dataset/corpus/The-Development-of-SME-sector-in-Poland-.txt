Introduction  The development of small and medium sized enterprises1 in Poland  has  received  lately  bigger  attention  in  comparison  with other  aspects  of  the  economic  processes.  Small  and  medium enterprises have a key role to play in the restructuring economies. The establishment of a broad ownership through the development of  independent  commercial  enterprises  a  good  number  of  which are  SMEs  creates  the  social  basis  for  a  competitive  economic system. SMEs moreover are absorbing a considerable proportion of the labour force released by state firms in their adaptation to the new economic system. The creation of a healthy SME culture also helps  to  work  against  the  distorted  firm  size  structure  typical  of central planning a structure characterized by a dominance of large firms  and  allocation  decisions  made  by  central  authorities. Emergence  of  SMEs  needs  to  evaluate  the  policies  that  rendered their growth possible such as the development of the institutional and  macroeconomic  framework;  the  rise  of  selfemployment                                                  1  Enterprise category mediumsized small micro Headcount < 250 < 50 < 10 Turnover \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 \\xe2\\x82\\xac 50 million \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 \\xe2\\x82\\xac 10 million \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 \\xe2\\x82\\xac 2 million or Balance sheet total \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 \\xe2\\x82\\xac 43 million \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 \\xe2\\x82\\xac 10 million \\xe2\\x89\\xa4 \\xe2\\x82\\xac 2 million http//ec.europa.eu/enterprise/enterprise_policy/sme_definition/index_en.htm       2  \\x0c  limitations and barriers to the development of private sector SMEs; state  policies  regarding  SMEs;  the  development  of  support networks.   2.  SME sector development in Poland  After disintegration of centrally planned economies East European countries  ended  up  with  an  over  industrialized  system  with  a predominance of a state sector employment overextensive social welfare deep penetration of central planning and in many cases macroeconomic  instability  From  the  ownership\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  point  of  view Polish  economy  was  divided  into  three  sectors  state  cooperative and  private.  The  existence  of  three  sectors  was  not  equivalent  to the  fact  that  all  of  them  are  equal  concerning  their  economic potential  assets  turnover  and  employment.  In  general  the  state and cooperative sector predominated over the private one. On the other  hand  private  farms  remained  the  dominant  form  of agriculture in Poland covering approximately 70% of the total areas of  farms.  The  share  of  the  private  sector  in  other  spheres  of economy was much smaller then in agriculture. An example may be some date concerning industry        3  \\x0c     48 Gross output 90 0 100 Value of assets 93 6   64  Employment   Sector  State and cooperative  95 2   Private  Source Informacja Statystyczna GUS 1990 p.388  In  state  sector  predominated  big  enterprises  employing  over  200 people. Approximately 20 per cent of employees in 1989 worked in enterprises employing more than 5000 people and 60 per cent in those  having  more  than  1000  employees.  A  more  favorable situation  was  in  the  cooperative  sector  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  about  85  per  cent  of employees  worked in  enterprises  having  50500  employees although it should be taken into consideration that state industrial enterprises employed approximately seven times more people than the cooperative ones. The relation was similar in the case of state and private sectors. This partly resulted from the law obligatory till the  end  of  1988  that  private  enterprises  could  employ  at  the maximum 50 persons. The only exception was foreign enterprises (Polishforeign joint venture) which could employ up to 100 people. These limitations have been abolished since 23rd December 1988.  The  government  policy  during  the  first  period  of  economic transformation was particularly focused on macroeconomic issues.      4  \\x0c  Among  the  whole  number  of  legislative  regulations  only  a  small part was directly determining the activity of the small and medium enterprises.  In  1988  was  established  the  Act  on  Business  Activity and there was no other document influencing the development of this sector. The document was not directly focusing on the SMEs however  it  permitted  entrepreneurs  to  start  their  action  without any  governmental  obstacles.  That  was  the  beginning  of  so  called entrepreneurship  explosion  in  the  beginning  of  the  90s.  In generally the activity of entrepreneurs within SMEs was favoured but  none  of  the  priorities  of  the  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  socioeconomic strategy  referred  directly  to  this  sector.  First  attempts  to  define state  policy  towards  SMEs  were  undertaken  in  1995  when  the Council  of  Ministries  approved  the  document  prepared  in  cross departmental  consultations  SME  in  the  national  economy  policy towards  SMEs  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  it  described  the  former  policy  as  ineffective. However first document that was clearly defining as government strategy  towards  SMEs  sector  was  published  in  1999  and  was entitled  Government  Policy  towards  Small  and  Medium  size Enterprises until 2002.  In  Poland  the  1980s  were  marked  by  a  steady  growth  of  the private  sector.  A  significant  rise  in  its  growth  occurred  in  1989 when  the  government  removed  the  majority  of  administrative barriers preventing private firms from entering the market. Further changes  in  economic  environment  caused  next  increase  of  the      5  \\x0c  number  of  private  firms.  In  1990  the  number  of  private  firms increased by 250% while the number of state enterprises grew by 3%. In 1990 the industrial output of the private sector increased by 8%. At the same time industrial output in State sector fall by 23%. As a result private firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s share in total industrial output was over 11% in 1990 as against only 4 8% in 1989. Some estimates put its importance  at  about  20%.  This  difference      is  caused  by  the existence  of  shadow  economy  in  Poland2.  Employment  in  the Private  sector  outside  agriculture  reached  about  16%  of  total employment in 1990 (GUS 1991).  In the end of the 90s in the GDP structure a number of 69% of Gross  Value  Added  was  generated  by  private  enterprises.  Within these 69% of GDP generated by private firms 36% was created by small enterprises and 9% by medium enterprises. These data bring us to the conclusion that 45% of Polish GDP was generated by the SMEs sector when only 24% of total GDP was generated by large companies.  According  to  the  structure  of  SMEs  output  we  can observe  a  trend  that  great  part  of  them  operates  with  Trade  and Repairs Sector (around 40%). The other branches are construction and industry communication (10%) real estate (12%) and other service activities (13%) (Gemini 2000). (12%)  manufacturing transport (13%)                                                  2  On  Poland\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  shadow  economy  see  also  Gikas  1992  pp.2125  Wisniewski  1985  pp.913936 Landau 1987 Charemza Gronicki Quandt 1988 pp. 881884 and Schneider 2002        6  \\x0c  The second important figure is the number of people working in SMEs comparing to the whole economy. In 1999 there were slightly above  11  4  millions  people  employed  in  the  economy  (excluding agriculture fishery and forestry) whereas almost 7 millions people i.e.  61  1%  working  in  small  and  medium  enterprises  (Gemini 1999). Looking at SMEs essential contribution in generating Polish GDP  and  the  employment  of  more  than  half  of  the  working population  clearly  shows  the  sectors  real  importance  for  the development of the economy. The last point is the total number of small firms operating on the market  in  Poland.  In  1999  there  were  1.567.413  small  active enterprises.  Medium  and  large  enterprises  numbered  12.774  and 3.419 respectively (Gemini 2000). In 2002 Polish SME represented 99 8% of all active enterprises and  provides  for  almost  7  million  jobs.  For  the  last  three  years Polish SMEs have experiences negative factors. Due to the general slowdown of economy a decrease in number of small firms and in SME employment was recorded. However the SME sector turned out  to  be  more  resistant  to  unfavorable  conditions  than  bigger enterprises.  Comparing  statistical  data  (number  of  companies  per  ten thousand inhabitants) in Polish economy and European Union of 15 members  we  can  observe  that  in  2003  there  were  46  companies with 50249 employees in EU (32 in Poland) 317 companies 1049      7  \\x0c  employees in EU (67 in Poland) and 451 companies 19 employees (435 in Poland).    3.  Barriers development to  small  and  medium  sized  enterprises  One  of  the  most  important  conditions  for  the  success  of  the economic transformation is the existence of entrepreneurial talent in  the  population  and  the  influence  of  the  cultural  and  social environment (Cornwall 1998). Some experts consider that the era of central administration and economic planning has considerably shaped  the  norms  value  judgments  and  social  orientation  of  the population  and  in  consequence  has  negatively  influenced  their entrepreneurial  spirit.  The  opposite  view  concludes  that  cultural influences do not have a fundamental effect on the entrepreneurial ability is evident in many types of society. Differences are caused rather  by  the  framework  conditions  for  economic  activity  such  as the nature of property rights. for In  Poland instance  relatively  small  steps towards liberalization  in  the  1980s  led  to  a  rapid  increase  in  private economic  activity.  The  population therefore  was  reacting positively to changes in the framework conditions. However many preconditions  which  would  allow  entrepreneurial  potential  to develop and grow freely are not met. Problems can be identified in      8  \\x0c  lack  of  human  capital  with  marketing  or  business  management knowhow strategic planning experience of an enterprise culture employee  motivation  training  systems  and  lack  of  qualified managers  as  well  as  in  the  financing  of  SMEs.  A  further  serious obstacle to development entrepreneurial potential is the continued deformed  market  structure  in  the  industrial  sector  and  the resulting lack  of  competition.  Other  obstacles  are  state bureaucracy and administration and the difficulties of applying new economic laws. The employees of the state administration were as unable to deal with the new economic legislation as the owners of private  firms  and  potential  entrepreneurs.  The  essential  problem still  is  the  rather  stressed  relationship  between  state  employees and  the  commercial  sector.  Individual  entrepreneurs  who  often suffer  mistreatment  by  representatives  of  state  institutions  have great  difficulty  in  recognizing  in  their  counterparts  the  supposed helping hand of the state for private initiative. During the era of central planning private savings and capital achievements were permitted in Poland though they were limited in range. Entrepreneurs cannot usually develop a longterm stable financial basis from personal savings nor does selffinancing tend to provide sufficient capital for investment. The access of small and medium  sized  enterprises  to  credit  facilities  from  banks  and financial  support  programmes  is  still  limited.  In  addition  there remains a general lack of risk capital. This situation not only slows      9  \\x0c  down  the  creation  of  firms  but  also  it  has  a  negative  impact  on business  operations  such  as financing  working  capital  or investment (Ribnikar 1997). There are a number of reasons for the financial difficulties faced by SMEs. A large part of the problem is rooted in the role of the banking system. Many of the new banks were illiquid as they had inadequate equity capital and unwilling or unable to service their loans. The lack of institutional infrastructure at the regional level the absence of branch office creates further difficulties for  SMEs.  The  still  underdeveloped  competitive structures  in  the  banking  industry  create  a  further  financial blockage.  The  lack  of  expertise  in  the  banks  in  smallscale  credit provision  as  well  as  the  continued  existence  in  many  banks  of centralized  and inflexible  decisionmaking  mechanisms  are important factors in the frequent negative credit decisions against small and medium sized enterprises. As they are usually to provide the  demanded  level  of  security  the  banks  are  often  cautious  in their negotiations with the firms and tend to avoid risk.  The factors that spur Polish SMEs to improve innovativeness as apposed to Table 1 (in descending order) seem to concern mainly the easier access to capital and the possibility to export goods and services.

Despite  the persistence of obstacles to small business development remarkable progress is being made in constructing a macroeconomic and legal framework  within  which  private  entrepreneurs  can  prosper.  The next  step  that  policymakers  should  do  is  to  consolidate  these achievements and design specific policies for SMEs to reduce the remaining  barriers  to  small  business  expansion.  Good  legal  and economic  framework  conditions  are  required  to  support  the entrepreneurial  spirit  that  has  developed  since  economic  reforms were introduced. The barriers however to the development of an effective SME sector are various 1.  There  are  gaps  in  the  financing  of  small  and  medium  sized enterprises  both  in  the  startup  phase  and  in  later  growth. Although  considerable  progress  has  been  made  in  the banking and financial system since the abolition of monopoly banks  and  central  planning    financial  systems  have  not  yet fully developed to meet the new needs of business financing. Small  and  medium  sized  enterprises  are  in  a  more  difficult credit position than the large state enterprises. 2.  Vocational  and  technical  training  systems  have  improved substantially.  Considerable  gaps  still  exist  in  the  area  of      11  \\x0c  finance commerce entrepreneurial training. business management and 3.  The  competitive  situation  is  far  from  positive  for  small  and medium sized enterprises in particular in the manufacturing sector which is still dominated by large companies. 4.  The  practical  implementation  of  the  legal  framework  for  a market  economy  is  still  lacking.  Long  periods  of  adaptation should be expected before the new legal norms are rooted in the thinking of entrepreneurs and the population in general and before they are fully implemented by legal authorities. In  most  recent  years  national  government  as  well  as  regional administrative authorities has implemented local state consultancy facilities  business  development  centers  technology  parks  and economic  development  agencies  in  economically  disadvantaged regions.  The  effective  implementation  of  assistance  measures  has been  in  many  cases  stopped  by  financial  and  administrative difficulties. Despite these obstacles more effort has to be made to include the local and regional dimension of small and medium sized enterprises  policies  by  adapting  assistance  measures  to  specific needs and situations. The partnership between support institutions banks  private  suppliers  of  business  related  services  and  further training  facilities  in  particular  at  the  local  level  needs  to  be notably  improved.  The  same  applies  to  combined  action  between municipal  local  regional  and  national  facilities  in  the  vertical      12  \\x0c  cooperation  between  support organizations and authorities of the state administration.  institutions  economic  selfhelp  5.  Leasing  as  a  new  instrument  of  financing  of  SMEs  in Poland A  leasing  is  a  relatively  new  financial  instrument  which  since 2002  has  been  gradually  gaining  the  acknowledgement  of  the market. It was launched in the turbulent context. The initial lack of systemic regulations resulted in great freedom of interpretation of the imperfect law which had consequences difficult to anticipate. The  principle  of  economic  freedom  allowed  the  possibility  of running  an  enterprise  providing  leasing  by  entities  with  limited financial base. These factors led to differing interpretations of the history  of  leasing  services  in  different  groups.  In  view  of  this context the branch of leasing has undergone quite a radical change mainly due to new legal regulations.  Until the second half of the 1990s the leasing market in Poland was  dominated  by  small  contracts  especially  leasing  of  trucks telecommunications and IT equipment. Finally in December 2000 leasing was fully regulated in civil tax and accounting aspects. The most  popular  forms  of  leasing  in  Poland  are  operating  leasing finance  leasing  with  automatic  transfer  of  ownership  or  purchase option and sale and lease back. Polish accounting law has its own property attribution principles that differentiate between operating      13  \\x0c  leasing  and  finance  leasing.  These  criteria  closely  follow  the  US GAAP.  According  to  Polish  law  operating  lease  structures  ensure onbalance financing (in terms of accounting) and tax deductibility of  lease  payments  (including  upfront  payments).  As  a  result  this financing  instrument  improve  the  lessee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  liquidity  ensure  tax benefits due to accelerated lease payments and purchase option at a value lower than book value. On the other hand financial leasing ensure  benefits  from  economical  ownership  of  a  lease  object (depreciation  and  interest  on  a  lease  payment  is  tax  deductible) and assets from 36 group of Assets Classification (under Polish tax regulations)  possibility  of  accelerated  depreciation  up  to  60 months. Hire purchase and leasing can provide considerable benefits to businesses but they are not suitable for every business or for every purchase. There are a number of considerations to be made. A hire purchase  or  leasing  agreement  is  a  medium  term  facility  that cannot  be  withdrawn  provided  the  payments  are  made.  The uncertainty  that  may  be  associated  with  facilities  such  as overdrafts which are repayable on demand is removed. However long  term both  hire  purchase  and commitments and it may not be possible or could prove costly to terminate them early. On the other hand the regular nature of the payments  and  their  usually  fixed  amount  helps  a  business  to forecast cash flow. The business is able to compare the payments leasing  agreements  are      14  \\x0c  with the expected revenues and profits generated by the use of the asset.  If  however  the  company  wishes  to  alter  the  payment frequency or amount this will have to be agreed in advance with the  finance  company.  In  most  cases  the  payments  are  fixed throughout the hire purchase or lease agreement so a business will know at the beginning of the agreement what their repayments will be. This can be beneficial in times of low stable or rising interest rates  but  may  appear  expensive  if  interest  rates  are  falling.  On some  agreements  such  as  those  for  a  longer  term  the  finance company  may  offer  the  option  of  variable  rate  interest.  In  such cases rentals or installments will vary with current interest rates; hence it may be more difficult to budget for the level of payment. Also  under  both  hire  purchase  and  leasing  the  finance  company retains legal ownership of the equipment at least until the end of the  agreement.  This  normally  gives  the  finance      company  better security than lenders of other types of loan or overdraft facilities. The finance company may therefore be able to offer better terms. The decision to provide finance to a small or medium sized business depends  on  that  business\\xe2\\x80\\x99  credit  standing  and  potential.  Because the finance company has security in the equipment it could tip the balance  in  favor  of  a  positive  credit  decision.  Hire  purchase  and leasing could provide finance for the entire cost of the equipment. There  may  however  he  a  need  to  put  down  a  deposit  for  hire purchase  or  to  make  one  or  more  payments  in  advance  under  a      15  \\x0c  lease. It may be possible for the business to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctradein\\xe2\\x80\\x9d other assets which  they  own  as  a  means  of  raising  the  deposit.  If  small  and medium  sized  businesses  wish  to  rely  on  a  mix  of  finance  hire purchase  and  leasing  can  extend  the  range  of  facilities  available and  give  them  access  to  medium  term  finance.  It  is  however important to weigh up the interest and other costs of the different forms of finance available against the benefits provided. Hire purchase and leasing remove the need to tie up resources in  capital  equipment  by  spreading  the  cost  and  timing  of  the expenditure to coincide with the expected future revenues flows of the business. Hire purchase and leasing give the business the choice of how to take advantage of capital allowances. If the business is profitable it can  claim  its  own  capital  allowances  through  hire  purchase  or outright  purchase.  If  it  is  not  a  tax  paying  position  or  pays corporation tax at the small companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rate then a lease could be more beneficial to the business. The leasing company will claim the capital allowances and pass the benefits on to the business by way of reduced rentals.  The  data  collected  leads  to  the  conclusion  that  most  of  SME companies  financed  their  companies  using  own  resources  (92%). 23% of companies used bank credit and 21% leasing.  Examining  the  reasons  for  using  leasing  by  the  Polish  SMEs which  constitute  our  sample  we  find  that  26%  mentioned  tax      16  \\x0c  benefits  21%  simplicity  of  procedures  21%  good  financial conditions  3%  difficulties  with  acquiring  of  bank  credits.  Among the  reasons  of  not  using  leasing  most  executives  of  the  SME enterprises classify lack of financial needs (47%) high cost (20%) and  fear  of  excessive  increase  in  the  companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99  liability  (14%) lack  of  information  about  this  form  of  financing  (7%)  bad experiences with leasing companies (3%) and others (9%).  Most  of  the  firms  of  our  sample  consider  as  the  best  way  to finance a new investment a bank credit (36 5%) and EU funds (22 3%).  About  10%  believes  that  the  leasing  is  the  best  form  of financing.  The most frequently financed facilities are machinery industrial equipment  and  means  of  transportation  production  facilities logistic  centers  and  office  buildings.  The  average  percentage  of new  investments  financed  by  leasing  in  Poland  is  growing  by around  56  per  cent.  According  to  the  data  by  the  Polish Association  of  Leasing  Companies  the  value  of  new  leasing transactions in 2006 reached 4 5 billion euros an increase of 26% in  comparison  to  the  previous  year.  The  estimated  percentage share  of  leased  assets  in  the  wholesale  portfolio  was  means  of transportation  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  72  1%  machinery  and  industrial  equipment  23 2%  computers  and  office  equipment  2  4%  other  means  of transportation  1  3%  other  assets  1%.  The  last  results  strongly indicate the dynamic growth of the Polish leasing sector which is      17  \\x0c  systematically  improving.  In  last  year  there  was  a  significant decrease in demand for car leasing with a simultaneous increase in machinery and industrial equipment leasing.    Conclusions Small and medium enterprises have a key role to play in the Polish  economy  since  they  are  a  dynamic  factor  in  support  of economic revival. Despite the persistence of obstacles to small business  development  remarkable  progress  is  being  made  in constructing  a  macroeconomic  and  legal  framework  within which private entrepreneurs can prosper. In most recent years national  government  as  well  as  regional  administrative authorities  has  implemented  local  state  consultancy  facilities business  development  centers  technology  parks  and  economic development agencies in economically disadvantaged regions.    One  of  the  most  important  barriers  in  development  of  an effective  SME  sector  is  the  gaps  in  the  financing  of  small  and medium sized enterprises both in the startup phase and in later growth.  Although  considerable  progress  has  been  made  in  the banking  and  financial  system  since  the  abolition  of  monopoly banks and central planning financial systems have not yet fully developed to meet the new needs of business financing.       18  \\x0c    A  leasing  is  a  relatively  new  financial  instrument  on  Polish market.  In  December  2000  leasing  was  fully  regulated  in  civil tax and accounting aspects. The most popular forms of leasing in Poland  are  operating  leasing  finance  leasing  with  automatic transfer  of  ownership  or  purchase  option  and  sale  and  lease back. According to the data by the Polish Association of Leasing Companies  the  value  of  new  leasing  transactions  in  2006 reached 4 5 billion euros an increase of 26% in comparison to the previous year. Despite of this more efforts have to be made to  provide  information  about  this  form  of  financing  and  its advantages.   Bibliography  Brus W.
