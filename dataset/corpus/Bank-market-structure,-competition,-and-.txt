Recent  empirical  evidence suggests  that  concentration  and  competition  capture  different  characteristics  of  banking  systems. Using a unique dataset on SMEs for selected European regions we empirically investigate the impact of increasing consolidation and competition on the number of lending relationships maintained by SMEs. We find that the  negative effect on the number of lending relationships arising from more concentrated banking systems is offset by a positive impact from increased competition. Our results also suggest that characteristics of the local banking market considerably impact on the number of lending relationships.

(Steve  Mercieca);  Klaus.Schaeck.1@city.ac.uk (Klaus  Schaeck);  1IntroductionAn  accelerating  number  of  mergers  and  acquisitions  (M&As)  over  the  past  decade  and changes  in  the  regulatory  and  institutional  environment  financial  institutions  operate  in  havemarkedly  affected  the  structure  and  competitive  nature  of  banking  markets.  As  the  industry continues to shift and consolidate relationships between banks and their customers may be altered possibly impacting on the provision of banking services. This is of particular concern to small and medium size enterprises (SMEs) in Europe1 since they predominately depend on bank financing.  Numerous studies focus on the nature of relationships established by different types of banks (Berger et al. forthcoming) the determinants of the role of banks (Elsas 2005; Harhoff and K  rting 1998;  Elsas  and  Krahnen  1998)  the  benefits  of  bankborrower  relationships  (Berger  and  Udell 2006;  Elyasiani  and  Goldberg  2004;  Farinha  and  Santos  2002;  Ongena  and  Smith  2001;  Boot 2000; Petersen  and  Rajan  1995;  Brick  and  Palia  2007)the  effect  of  competition  on  bank orientation (Degryse and Ongena 2007) and the number of bank relationships maintained by large corporations (Ongena and Smith 2000). To  the  best  of  our  knowledge  however  the  extant  literature  has  not  yet  investigated  the determinants of the number of bank relationships maintained by SMEs. Moreover how do observed changes  in  bank  market  structures  affect  the  number  of  bank  relationships  maintained  by  SMEs? Further how do characteristics of the local banking market impact on the number of bank financing relationships? This paper seeks to answer exactly these questions.2In  Europe  23  million  SMEs  account  for  99%  of  all  companies  employ  around  75  million people  and  generate  one  in  every  two  new  jobs.3 Given  their  important  role  these  institutional changes in  banking  systems  give  rise  to  major  policy  concerns. Our  empirical  enquiry  focuses  on SMEs since informationbased intermediation theory (Diamond 1984; Ramakrishnan and Thakor                                                 1 The EU defines SMEs as enterprises that employ fewer than 250 people have an annual turnover not exceeding    50 million and/or annual balance sheet total not exceeding    43 million. 2 For the purpose of our research    bank financing relationship    refers to SME financing for the following purposes firm startup; product development; purchases of fixed assets; cash flow; reduction/avoidance of overdraft facilities; trading and trading costs; other business/company acquisition; expansion/growth; share capital; working capital; retirement of codirector;  management  buyin/buyout;  bridge  financing;  seasonal  production/trading;  research;  general  corporate purposes;  staffing;  debtors  financing;  bills  payable;  work  in  progress  funding;  stock  purchase;  tax  payments; replacement machinery; acquisitions; and business development.3 Observatory for European SMEs Enterprise DirectorateGeneral of the European Commission (2004) Brussels. 2  1984;  Bhattacharya  and  Thakor  1993;  Stein  2002) suggests  that  SMEs  are  less  likely  to  have  as many bank relationships as have large corporations.First  SMEs  and  their  lenders  frequently  belong  to  the  same  socioeconomic  setting  which reduces  information  asymmetries  eases  monitoring  and  reduces  costly  information  acquisition information about borrowers. This implies that opaque firms like SMEs find it optimal to borrow from one bank. However    hold up    problems arise with repeated lending from only one bank if therelationship lender extracts rents from the firm (Sharpe 1990; Rajan 1992). Thus a limited number of bank relationships is  optimal for SMEs this also reduces the probability  of being denied credit (Thakor 1996; von Thadden 1995). Second  empirical  evidence  indicates  that  the  number  of  bank  relationships  is  increasing although not uniformly in firm size (Petersen and Rajan 1994; Berger and Udell 1995; Houston and James 1996; Ongena and Smith 2000).Third another reason why SMEs are less likely to maintain many bank relationships relate to their typical rural locations where sophisticated intermediaries. Typically large banks do not have a physical  presence  in  these  rural  locations  because  SMEs  do  not  demand  diversified  supplies  of financial services (Ferri and Messori 2000). Finally  SMEs  are  less  likely  to  maintain  relationships  with  larger  institutions  as  the  lending technology  required  for  processing     soft     information  is  less  well  developed  in  larger  banks(Williamson  1988;  Stein  2002;  Berger  and  Udell  2002;  Cole  et  al  2004;  Berger  et  al.  2005a).4These final  two  arguments  indicate  that  SMEs  have  a  reduced  pool  of  banks  to  obtain  financing from.Our crosscountry analysis is also related to the literature on financial system architecture. Firstwhile Staikouras and KoutsomanoliFillipaki (2006) and Schaeck and Cihak (2007) report increasing degrees  of  competition  in  European  banking  systems  Goddard  et  al.  (2007)  de  Guevara  et  al.                                                 4 Relatedly  the  literature  on  relationships  maintained  by  local  and  regional  banks  proposes  a     long  term  interaction hypothesis     according  to  which  banks  taking  part  in  community  life  share  relationships  of  various  kinds  not  solely economic (Bannerjee et al. 1994; Besley and Coate 1995). Through such relationships they can acquire information that would be available to  an outsider only at a cost.  Consequently banks operating in local and rural communities may  take  advantage  of  such  information  in  their  financing  activities  placing  them  in  a  better  position  to  deal  with asymmetric information and agency problems. 3  (2005)  and  Amel  et  al.  (2004)  simultaneously  observe  a  wave  of  consolidation  across  European banking systems resulting from an increasing number of M&As. This raises fears that consolidation decreases  the  number  of  banks  specialising  in  relationship  banking  (e.g.  community  banks)  with possibly  detrimental  welfare  effects  for  local  firms  especially  SMEs  these  firms     access  to  credit and ultimately economic growth.5 As a result positive effects for the provision of banking services arising  from  increased  competition  in  banking  systems  may  be  offset  by  higher  degrees  of concentration. As  part  of  our empirical  investigation  we  seek  to  answer  this  question  because  the  extant literature on the effect of market structure and competition on SME financing offers two competing theories  Whereas  proponents  of  the     market  power     notion  (Elsas  2005;  Boot  2000;  Boot  and Thakor  2000  Ongena  and  Smith  2000)  contend  that  concentration decreases  firms    access  to credit  advocates  of  the     information  hypothesis     (Dell   Ariccia  and  Marquez  2005;  Petersen  and Rajan 1995) argue that less competition improves credit availability. We propose that these contrasting findings may be due to the way competition is determined in empirical studies that frequently proxy competition with concentration measures. This assertion places our paper into a growing body of work by Beck et al. (2006) Claessens and Laeven (2004) Carbo et al. (2006) Schaeck et al. (2006) and de Guevara et al. (2005) indicating that concentration is  a  poor  proxy  for  competition  and  that  concentration  and  competition  describe  different characteristics of banking systems.Second  following  Ongena  and  Smith  (2000)  who  report  evidence  that  well  developed financial  systems  with  stronger  protection  of  creditor  rights  help  explain  the  number  of  bank relationships we also test for the effect of differences in legal and financial system arrangements in the  spirit  of  the  studies  motivated  by  La  Porta  et  al.  (1997)  Levine  (1999)  Demirg    Kunt  and Maksimovic  (1998)  and  Beck  et  al.  (2006).  Our  analysis  helps  evaluate  whether  the  effects uncovered by Ongena and Smith (2000) are also valid for SMEs in Europe.                                                 5 Such developments have been extensively studied for the US see for instance Craig and Hardee (2007) Berger and Udell (2002) Cole et al. (2004) and Berger and Frame (2005). 4  Third  we  focus  on  Europe  since  EU  banking  systems  have  been  undergoing  significant changes following the launch of the Single Market Programme transition to the Euro and recent EU enlargements. While these developments are aimed at creating a level playing field for competition in European banking the EU banking landscape is still largely influenced by linguistic and cultural differences  that thwart  setting  up  banking  relationships  across  national  boundaries.  Such impediments may be due to    exogenous economic borders    i.e. legal origin and system supervisory and  corporate  governance  practices  political  framework  language  and  culture  and     endogenous economic  borders   .  These  are  informationbased  and  arise  from  bankfirm  relationships  adverse selection and information sharing between intermediaries (Buch 2001). Evidence for the conjecture that linguistic minorities and smaller nonfinancial firms prefer a more local character of the banks they  do  business with across  EU regions is  provided by  Affinito  and  Piazza  (2005). We  therefore also  explore  whether  differences  across  European  regions  help  explain  the  number  of  bank relationships. The  purpose  of  our  paper  is  to  extend  the  literature  on  bank  relationships  in  three  distinct ways  First  this  research  is  to  the  best  of  our  knowledge  the  first  empirical  analysis  of  the determinants  of  the  number  of  SMEbank  financing  relationships  exclusively  based  on  European data. Second to disentangle effects from competition and concentration we simultaneously consider independent effects arising from competition and concentration for SMEbank relationships. Third we  focus  on  selected  European  regions  to  investigate  the  importance  of  the  socioeconomic environment for SMEbank financing relationships. As Guiso et al. (2004 p. 937) point out    if local market  conditions  matter  they  should  matter  the  most  for  small  firms  which  have  difficulty  in raising funds at a distance than for large firms   .We  obtain  data  from  the  Centre  for  Business  Research  of  the  University  of  Cambridge regarding  scope  and  scale  of  the  relationship  between  552  SME  borrowers  and  their  banks  from EmiliaRomagna  in  the  northeast  of  Italy  Bavaria  in  the  south  of  Germany  and  the  southeastregion of the UK. These regions are traditionally characterised by areas rich in innovative SMEs as  5  well as  local  and  regional  banks  which are  the  main  source  of  financing  for  SMEs.6 This dataset augmented with information on financial system architecture and local market conditions provides an excellent setting to conduct  our empirical investigation  as the  survey data  can  be matched with local bank market data. As detailed further below this is particularly beneficial since we anticipate socioeconomic  factors  to  be  paralleled  by  local  financial  systems.  In  addition  a  regional  focus permits  better  accounting  for  information  asymmetries  banks  are  exposed  to  when  aiming  to establish relationships with SMEs. Four key findings emerge from our analysis (1) Adverse effects of increasing consolidation for the number of bank relationships maintained by SMEs are fully offset by increased competition. To this extent our results highlight that concentration measures do not serve as a proxy for competition in banking systems. (2) Factors such as regional GDP growth regional population and an innovative environment  are  positively  related  to  the  number  of  bank  relationships.  (3)  The  number  of  bank relationships is increasing in the amount of bank finance used and if the bank plays an active role in advising  SMEs.  (4)  Regulatory  restrictions  on  banking  activities  and  financing  and  legal  obstacles decrease the probability of maintaining multiple bank relationships. The  plan  for  the  paper  is  as  follows  Section  2  briefly  explains  the  methodology  and  also describes the dataset. We present empirical results in Section 3. Section 4 contains sensitivity checks and Section 5 offers concluding remarks. 2 Data and VariablesWe explain in Section 2.1 the information on SMEs obtained from survey data. Section 2.2 presents  the  motivation  and  description  for  the  choice  of  the  firm  bank  regional  and  countryspecific variables. 2.1Survey DataOur primary source for firm information is the Survey of the Financing of Small and Mediumsized Enterprises in Western Europe  conducted  by  the  Centre  for  Business  Research  at  the                                                 6 Further details regarding composition of these three regions are provided in Martin et al. (2001). Ferri and Messori (2000) present additional details regarding socioeconomic characteristics and regional financial subsystems in Italy.  6  University of Cambridge in 2001.7 This survey focuses on the financing of SMEs in three different regions  of  Europe EmiliaRomagna  in  Italy  Bavaria  in  Southern  Germany  and  the  southeast  of England. The survey is based on a questionnaire containing 191 questions for Germany and the UK and  188  questions  for  Italy.8 The  questionnaire  was  sent  out  to  over  800  SMEs  and  yielded  247 responses for the UK 161 for Italy and 114 for Germany. Questions from the survey cover a variety of  topics  including  the  main  markets  serviced  the  type  of  finance  used  whether  firms  have  used bank finance and the role that banks play. Moreover the questionnaire also provides details about the nature of the SMEs    type of business size employment growth and turnover.Summary statistics for the survey (and the other explanatory variables) are presented in Table 1.  The  UK  makes  up  47%  of  the  sample  with  Germany  and  Italy  accounting  for  22%  and  31% respectively. Italy shows the highest incidence of multibank relationships with the UK exhibiting the lowest.9 Our definition of bank financing includes financing that is intended for inter alia acquisition investment cashflow tax and for enabling the SME to remain a going concern. It excludes SMEs having a relationship solely  through having a checking or savings account with a bank. 42% of the SMEs in the sample do not use banks for their financing activities. This implies that they either use other forms of financing such as borrowing from family and friends or use their own reserves for financing purposes. Such notion of selffinancing is consistent with Beck et al. (2005a) who show that small firms finance a lesser proportion of their investment with formal sources of external finance.The survey does not provide actual figures for turnover. Rather the SMEs are classified into five categories whereby higher values indicate greater turnover. Both average turnover and average number of employees for all SMEs are greater for those that move from zero to one and from one to more than one bank financing relationships. This is in line with previous studies highlighting that size is positively correlated with the number of bank relationships e.g. Petersen and Rajan (1994).Descriptive statistics for the countryspecific and regional variables are also presented in Table 1.                                                 7 The survey data can be obtained from http//www.dataarchive.ac.uk/findingData/snDescription.asp?sn=4955. 8 The of  Cambridge  website the  University archive.ac.uk/doc/4955%5Cmrdoc%5Cpdf%5C4955userguide.pdf).questionnaire accessible on is (http//www.data9 These figures corroborate results obtained by other authors. For Italy Pagano et al. (1998) report the mean number of bank credit relationships per firm to be 13.9 and Ongena and Smith (2000) report a mean of 15.2. For German firms Elsas and Krahnen (1998) and Ongena and Smith (2000) report mean figures of 6.0 and 8.1 respectively. Ongena and Smith (2000) report mean figures of 2.9 relationships for UK firms. 7  [TABLE 1 about here]2.2 Other Explanatory Variables10Bank market structure variablesIn  order  to  test  our  hypothesis  that  concentration  and  competition  among  banks  have independent effects for the number of financing relationships maintained by SMEs we include the HerfindahlHirschman index (HHI) calculated as the sum of the squared market shares. This index is  widely  used  as  a  measure  to  describe  concentration  in  banking  markets  (Cetorelli  1999).  In addition we use the 3bank concentration ratio for a sensitivity test provided in Section 4 below. To disentangle the effects arising from concentration and competition we include the Panzar and Rosse (1987) HStatistic to gauge competition. Claessens and Laeven (2004) argue that H is a more  appropriate  measure  for  the  degree  of  competition  than  previously  used  proxies  ofcompetition. Shaffer (2004) highlights the analytical strength and superiority of the HStatistic over other  measures  of  competition  since  it  is  formally  derived  from  profitmaximising  equilibrium conditions.11 It overcomes criticism put forward against concentration ratios that are frequently used to infer competition as it  does not require assumptions about the  market.12 The HStatistic gauges market  power  by  the  extent  to  which  changes  in  factor  input  prices  translate  into  equilibrium revenues. Vesala (1995) has shown that higher values of H signify more competition. We anticipate that concentration is inversely related to the number of relationships maintained by SMEs whereas the HStatistic is expected to be positively related. Appendix II presents the calculations for the HStatistic.  Regional market structure variablesRegional indicators for EmiliaRomagna Bavaria and the southeast of the UK are retrieved from  REGIO  Eurostat   s  harmonised  regional  statistical  database.  We  extract  information  on Regional GDP  Regional Population  and Regional Patent Applications to  the  European  Patent                                                 10 We present definitions for the explanatory variables in Appendix I.11 For a detailed overview on computation of the HStatistic see Claessens and Laeven (2004).12 Shaffer (2004) stresses that the definition of a banking market is likely to affect inferences regarding competition when competition is inferred from concentration ratios. This is due to the fact that banking markets in small countries are likely to extend beyond a single nation   s borders and because large banks operate globally. Moreover Cetorelli (1999) underscores that competition cannot be determined by simply looking at market structure since bank behaviour can only be measured accurately through direct empirical analysis of individual bank data. 8  Office.  We  expect  these  variables  to  positively  impact  upon  the  number  of  bank  financing relationships. To  control  for  the  nexus  between  SMEs  and  the  business  environment  we  obtain  the variables Time to start Business and Cost to start Business from the World Bank Doing Business Survey  (2005).  These  regressors  capture  important  factors  that  enhance  or  constrain  business investment  productivity  and  growth  respectively.  We  expect  them  to  be  positively  related  to  the number of bank relationships. Control variablesWe also adapt variables from the World Business Environment Survey (WBES)13 survey that assesses  whether  financial  and  legal  obstacles  affect  firm  growth.  The  survey  asks  enterprise managers to rate the extent to which financing and legal problems present obstacles to the operation of businesses. The variables take values of 14 with 1 indicating no obstacle and 4 indicating a major obstacle. The variables Financing and Legalobstacle are incorporated into the model to examine the impact such obstacles have on SME financing relationships as Schiffer and Weder (2001) maintain that small firms are more likely to face obstacles in obtaining finance and accessing legal systems.We  include  Banking Freedom  (obtained  from  the  Heritage  Foundation)  to  assess  the openness of the banking system. Higher values indicate fewer restrictions on banking freedom. It is a composite index of whether foreign banks are allowed to operate freely the difficulties faced when setting up domestic banks government influence over the allocation of credit and whether banks are free  to  provide  insurance  products  and  securities  to  customers.  The  index  is  expected  to  be positively associated with the number of financing relationships. Additionally we use Access to Financial Services to capture the geographic penetration of the banking  system  measured  by  the  number  of  bank  branches  relative  to  area  and  Stock Market Capitalization/GDP  to  gauge  the  influence  of  stock  market  development  on  the  number  of  bank relationships  given  that  well  developed  securities  markets  might  function  as  a  substitute  for  the                                                 13 The World Business Environment Survey was conducted in 1999 and 2000 over 10000 firms in 80 countries (World Bank database). Variables include financing constraints GDP growth private credit domestic bank share and foreign bank share. A detailed discussion of the survey is provided by Batra et al. (2003). 9  transaction  services  of  banks.  We  assume  that Access to Finance  is  positively  correlated  with  the number  of  relationships  as  countries  with  better  access  to  financial  services  providers  offer  more opportunities  for  SMEs  to  set  up  multiple  lending  relationships.  By  contrast  if  SMEs  can  obtain funds  from  the  stock  market  we  anticipate  that  a  well  developed  equity  market  will  be  negatively related to the number of financing relationships. We  employ  Turnover  as  a  measure  of  firm  size  as  we  expect  SMEs  to  maintain  more financing relationships as they increase in size. Moreover Detragiache et al. (2000) have shown that larger firms may have to rely on multiple banking to allow banks to diversify firmspecific credit risk. Additionally  firm  complexity  and  growth  opportunities  are  likely  to  increase  with  size  and  larger borrowing requirements also induce SMEs to rely on multiple banking. To  determine the  impact  of  entrepreneurial innovation  on  SME  bank  financing  we  make use of a Research and Development (R&D) dummy variable that takes on the value one if the SME engages  in  R&D  or  zero  otherwise.  Von  Thadden  (1995)  uses  a  measure  of  R&D  to  denote  the amount  of  innovation  intensity  to  capture  entrepreneurial  control  rents.  A  negative  correlation between  entrepreneurial  control  rents  and  the  probability  of  single  banking  also  supports  the hypothesis that multiple banking serves to reduce rent appropriation by banks. Conversely Yosha (1995)  shows  that  R&D  intensity  may  be  associated  with  single  banking  if  information  leakages  to competitors are more likely with multiple lenders. We  use Age  to  assess  whether  the  year  of  incorporation  impacts  the  number  of  financing relationships. Older firms may face less severe adverse selection problems when seeking finance and should be more likely to have access to financial services as they have survived the critical startup period and have generated reputational effects throughout the intervening years (Diamond 1991). To  capture  organisational  form  and  distinguish  between  firm  type  we  include  a  dummy variable Firm Type that takes on the value one if the SME is private or zero otherwise. Public firms will have easier access to the capital markets and this might impact the number of bank relationships they  maintain.  As  in  Degryse  and  van  Cayseele  (2000)  we  include  this  variable  as  the  degree  of  10  informational  asymmetry  varies  with  organisational  form  due  to  agency  conflicts  between  owners managers and creditors.We also investigate Ownership Change on the number of bank relationships as changes in ownership structure tend to coincide with changes in financing relationships. The Amount of Bank Finance Used is employed to assess how much the SME depends on financing from banks.To account for the banks    bargain power over the borrowers and the degree of monitoring exerted  by  the  bank  we  employ  the  variable  Bank Role  (Elsas  2005).  This  regressor  provides information  on  whether  the  bank  has  a  seat  on  the  SMEs  board  and  whether  it  offers  sales marketing technical or management advice to the firm. Distance determines whether proximity between borrower and lender has any impact on the number of relationships. Given that SMEs are considered opaque and given that the collection of    soft    information is facilitated by geographic proximity we anticipate that distance will be positivelyrelated  to  the  number  of  bank  relationships.14 As  a  measure  of  relationship  strengths  we  utilize  a dummy variable BankTerms that takes on the value one if the SME views the terms given by the bank as favourable or zero otherwise. We also employ two dummy variables for bank type which take on the value one if the bank is a regional or a national bank respectively or zero otherwise. Since a particular SME can obtain bank financing from either Regional or National banks or both the two bank types are not mutually exclusive  and  are  both  included  in  the  quantitative  analysis.  Banks  with  different  organisational structures may use different lending technologies to produce soft information. Small regional banks may  have  a  comparative  advantage  in  producing  soft  information  while  banks  with  multilayered hierarchies may perceive this as a comparative disadvantage.                                                14 Several studies examine whether distance between lender and borrower has been changing over time and provide contrasting results. Petersen and Rajan (2002) Cyrnak and Hannan (2000) and Wolken and Rohde (2000) all find that distance has increased whilst Degryse and Ongena (2004) in contrast find that distance has not increased. 11  3ResultsConcentration and competitionWe use firmlevel regressions of the number of bank relationships on firm market structure and  regional  and  countryspecific  variables.  The  dependent  variable  is  the  multibank  relationship variable. SMEs are classified as having no bank financing relationship having one relationship and having  multiple  bank  financing  relationships.15  We  employ  a  Tobit  specification  because  the dependent variable is discretevalued and truncated at the number of bank relationships below one.[TABLE 2 about here]Table 2 presents the main results. Column (1) is the canonical model. To examine the effects of  concentration  and  competition  we  include  the  HHI  the  HStatistic  and  an  interaction  term between HHI and the HStatistic in columns (2)(5). The objective of these regression specifications is  to  establish  whether  concentration  and  competition  capture  the  same  characteristics  of  banking systems  (and  hence  can  be  used  interchangeably)  or  if  they  independently  affect  the  number  of bank  relationships.  If  so  this  would  suggest  that  it  is  inappropriate  to  proxy  the  degree  of competition in banking systems with measures of market structure such as the HHI. The HHI enters in column (2) positively and significantly  highlighting  that  SMEs in more concentrated  markets  are more  likely  to  engage  in  more  than  one  bank  relationship. One  reason may  be  that  SMEs  try  to  avoid  holdup  problems  in  concentrated  markets  (Berger  et  al. forthcoming). This result  however is reversed once  the direct  measure of  competition the Panzar and  Rosse  (1987)  HStatistic  is  included  in  the  regression  specification.  In  column  (3)  we  only include  the  HStatistic  to  gauge  competition.  This  variable  enters  significantly  with  a  positive  sign indicating  that  SMEs  maintain  more  bank  relationships  in  more  competitive  systems.  Greater competition  widens  the  spectrum  of  banks  to  choose  from.  Moreover  SMEs  that  might  be experiencing difficulties could potentially find it easier to develop new bank relationships in a more competitive environment. Likewise banks might also start providing better terms to clients in a bid to  attract  further  business  in  a  competitive  environment.  Our  results  contrast  with  Farinha  and                                                 15 The  survey  data  do  not  provide  the  precise  number  of  bank  relationships  beyond  one.  This  hampers  the  use  of  a Poisson model that could otherwise be used to estimate the actual number of lending relationships.  12  Santos (2002) who do not find that bank competition in the region where the firm is located plays a role in its decision to switch from single to multiple relationships.Importantly when these two variables enter the regression simultaneously in column (4) the HHI  changes  the  sign  of  the  coefficient  and  retains  its  significance.  This  key  finding  persiststhroughout the remainder of the paper. In line with previous work by Ongena and Smith (2000) and Dewatripont and Maskin (1995) concentration reduces the number of relationships.16 Moreover if the banking market is concentrated and if an SME   s existing relationship is experiencing difficulties for one reason or another then it will be harder to obtain services when the number of players in the market  is  limited.  This  result  is  aligned  with  the  StructureConductPerformance  (SCP)  paradigm which states that market power reduces access to credit. By contrast competition continues to positively affect the number of bank relationships. The results  concerning  HHI  and  the  HStatistic  are  intuitive  Firms  operating  in  concentrated  markets can only choose between a few providers of financing and therefore have fewer bank relationships whereas  competition  increases  the  number  of  bank  relationships.  This  result  provides  important evidence that  independent  effects  arise  from  market  structure  and  competition. Thus  our  finding suggests  that  competition  should  not  be  proxied  by  the  degree  of  concentration.  In  addition  this result is related to the results by Craig and Hardee (2007) who demonstrate that credit availability for  small  firms  declines  as  a  result  of  consolidation  in  banking.  This  adverse  effect  is  however mitigated by the fact that small businesses substitute bank financing through alternative sources such as capital leasing firms mortgage companies and financial brokers. To shed more light on the effects attributable to competition and concentration we include an  interaction  term  between  the  HStatistic  and  the  HHI.  The  two  variables  are  centered  on  the mean  in  this  regression  to mitigate  collinearity  problems  arising  from  correlations  between  the interaction  term  and  its  components  (Zou  and  Adams  2006).17 If  centered  the  individual                                                 16 In a related study Craig and Hardee (2007) show that small businesses operating in areas dominated by large banks tend to hold less debt than firms in areas with fewer large banks. They interpret this result as suggestive evidence for a negative effect of consolidation on access to credit.17 Centering  variables  involves  subtracting  from  each  observation  of  the  component  parts  the  mean  of  that  variable before constructing the interaction term.   13  components reflect the effect of competition when concentration is held at the mean value (and vice versa). Thus the total effect of H or the HHI on the number of bank relationships depends on the estimated coefficient of the interaction term. For instance a negative coefficient for the interaction term indicates that the higher the degree of competition the lower the effect of concentration on the number  of  bank  relationships  (and  vice  versa).  Column  (5)  shows  that  both  HStatistic  and  HHI retain  their  respective  signs  and  level  of  significance  when  the  interaction  term  is  included.  The interaction term enters positively and significantly implying that the effect of H on the number of relationships is greater in more concentrated markets.Visual inspection of the magnitude of the coefficients for H and HHI in column (4) already indicates that their respective positive and negative effects cancel out. To further investigate this we evaluate  the  independent  effects  arising  from  competition  and  concentration  using  a  logit  model with marginal effects and compute the impact of increasing these two variables by one percent on the probability of engaging in an additional relationship. The dependent variable is recoded for this test to take on the value zero if the SME only maintains one bank financing relationship or one if the SME  makes  use  of  more  than  one  bank  relationships.  We  report  marginal  effects  because  the magnitude of the change in the probability of setting up an additional lending relationship depends on the initial values of all the independent variables and their coefficients. The results are provided in Appendix III column (4). While increasing the HHI by one percent (0.001*0.3542) decreases the probability of having an  additional  bank  relationship  by  0.04  percent  this  effect  is  more  than  offset  by  increasing competition.  In  fact  increasing  the  HStatistic  by  one  percent  (0.001*0.4737)  increases  the probability of having an additional bank relationship by 0.05 percent. This calculation illustrates that the adverse ramifications arising from increased consolidation in banking are totally offset by greater competition in banking.Among the control variables in Table 2 we find that Firm Age increases the number of bank relationships and so do Turnover Distance and the Amount of Bank Finance Used. The dummy variables  for Bank Role  and Bank Terms also  enter  significantly  with  a  positive  sign.  The  more  14  influential a bank the more likely the SME seeks additional bank relationships. This could reflect the SMEs    awareness that the lender is trying to extract rents. Likewise if firms perceive banks    terms to  be  favourable  they  increasingly  establish  multiple  lending  relationships  (Harhoff  and  K  rting 1998). The dummy variables for National and RegionalBank also enter positively and significantly. Doing business with a regional bank increases the number of bank relationships as the regional bank may  not  be  able  to  provide  as  broad  a  range  of  services  as  required  by  the  SME  (Berger  et  al. forthcoming). On the other hand doing business with a national bank may not be sufficient as the SME  may  want  to  retain  a  relationship  with  a  local  lender  that  is  better  able  to  process     soft    information.By  contrast Firm Type Ownership change and R&D investment  enter  negatively  and significantly in Table 2. Private firms are less likely to have more than one bank relationship when compared to public firms suggesting that more opaque firms tend to have less bank relationships as providers of funds that do not have access to    soft    information will incur greater monitoring costs. The negative effect of ownership change may reflect banks    reluctance to provide services to firms that change ownership and require an assessment of whether the new SME management is able to provide them  with the  necessary  creditworthiness requirements. The weakly  inverse association of bank  relationships  with  R&D  investment  could  be  driven  by  the  SMEs     concern  about  possible information leakages.It  is  important  to  acknowledge  that  including  variables  that  capture  competition  andconcentration considerably improve upon the fit of the model. While the regression in column (2) only explains about 40 percent of the variation in the number of bank relationships the pseudo R2increases  to  46  percent  when  both  H  and  HHI  enter  the  regression  equation  simultaneously  in column (4). Regional and financial system characteristicsIn Table 3 we investigate the effect of characteristics of the local banking market and of the wider financial system. As we are not specifically interested in the control variables we constrain the subsequent  discussion  to  regional  and  financial  system  characteristics  and  the  effects  of  the  HStatistic and the HHI.  15  [TABLE 3 about here]In terms of Access to Financial Services measured by the ratio of bank branches per sq km we find that a higher density of branch offices makes it easier to access providers of financial services.  The econometric tests corroborate our conjecture that regional factors affect the number of bank relationships. Higher Regional GDP growth a larger Regional Population and more Regional Patents  are  all  significantly  positively  associated  with  our  dependent  variable.  SMEs  are  likely  to expand  in  scope  and  scale  when  the  local  economy  prospers  and  innovates.  This  makes  them diversify their financing relationships. Moreover our result concerning regional population is aligned with Affinito and Piazza (2005) whose results indicate  that an economically active local population requires wider access to banking services. Stock Market Capitalization/GDP shows negative and significant association with multibank relationships. We  attribute  this result to  the  fact  that  SMEs operating  in  environments with  better developed  stock  markets  have  a  substantial  part  of  their  financial  needs  met  through  equity.  A similar result although not significant is reported by Ongena and Smith (2000).Both HStatistic and HHI retain their respective sign and level of significance throughout all regressions in Table 3 suggesting that our inferences also hold when regional and financial system characteristics are accounted for. Institutional characteristicsWe examine the effects of the institutional environment and design features of the regulatory system in Table 4.[TABLE 4 about here]Both Financing and Legal obstacles are negatively related to the number of bank financing relationships. As financing obstacles increase SMEs are less inclined to have more than one bank relationship since the environment makes it harder to develop new opportunities. Moreover SMEs with one relationship are likely to be prone to maintain and nurture an existing bank relationship anticipating that having one healthy banking relationship benefits the firm. Likewise legal obstacles require greater knowledge of the legal environment (something which SMEs might not have or only  16  develop over time of being in business given their local/community nature). As shown in Beck et al. (2005a) the extent to which financial and legal underdevelopment constrain a firm   s growth depends very  much  on  a  firm   s  size.  Smallest  firms  are  consistently  the  most  adversely  affected  by  all obstacles. In fact our results are aligned with the    soft budget    constraint hypothesis (see also Ongena and Smith 2000) proposing that inefficient judicial systems motivate firms to maintain more bank relationships. With respect to the Cost to start a business we find that higher costs induce firms to engage in  multiple  relationships.  As anticipated  the  more  costs  businesses  incur  towards  their  setup  the more use of financial support they will need particularly in instances where they do not have selffinancing.  The  advice  provided  by  banks  that  have  assisted  SMEs  during  their  setup  may  prove invaluable  for  SMEs.  Similarly  Time to start a business  also  increases  the  number  of  financing relationship. This could be due to the fact that financing working capital is spread across a number of lenders in the early stages of a business as each lender individually may not be keen on committing large volume loans to the startup company. In line with our expectation Banking freedom enters positively and significantly suggesting that  institutional  factors  conducive  to  a  more  open  environment  facilitate  the  establishment  of multiple bank relationships. The HHI retains its sign and level of significance throughout all regressions in Table 4. The HStatistic  also  remains  significant  with  the  anticipated  sign  in  all  but  one  specification.  It  is  only rendered  insignificant  when  Banking freedom  is  controlled  for.  Thus  our  inferences  regarding concentration and competition are insensitive to controlling for the institutional setting. 4Sensitivity TestsWe embark on a set of robustness tests to investigate if our results are sensitive to the way competition and concentration are measured.18[TABLE 5 about here]                                                18 We  also  ran  the  regressions  for  regional  and  financial  system  characteristics  (Table  3)  and  for  the  institutional environment (Table 4) with the alternative measures of concentration  and competition. We obtain virtually identical results with respect to the effects of competition and concentration. The results can be obtained from the authors on request.  17  Table  5  presents  four  regressions.  In  column  (1)  and  (2)  we  employ  an  alternatively computed  HStatistic  as  a  measure  of  competiton.  This  HStatistic  is  calculated  using  the  ratio  of interest  revenue  to  total  assets  instead  of  the  ratio  of  total  revenue  to  total  assets  as  dependent variable  (see  also  Molyneux  et  al.  1994).    The  alternative  HStatistic  enters  significantly  with  a positive sign suggesting that the way H is calculated does not affect the inferences. Columns (3) and (4) replace the HHI with the 3bank concentration ratio to gauge the degree of  concentration  in  banking  systems.  This  variable  is  frequently  used  in  studies  of  bank concentration  (e.g.  Beck  et  al.  2006).  The  findings  are  not  affected.  We  therefore  conclude  that measurement errors of concentration do not drive our findings. Finally we exploit the fact that out dataset only provides information on the number of bank relationships for zero one or multiple bank relationships and test the sensitivity of our results to the specification of the  econometric  model. As alluded  to in  Section  3  we employ  a logit  model and calculate marginal effects. Our findings regarding the effects of competition concentration and the regional  financial  system  and  institutional  characteristics  are  corroborated.  The  results  from  this final sensitivity check are presented in Appendix III.5 Concluding RemarksAgainst  a  background  of  increasing  concentration  and  competition  in  European  banking systems and marked changes in the regulatory  environment which financial institutions operate in this paper seeks to establish the effect of such changes on the determinants of the number of SME bank financing relationships in three distinct European regions. To the best of our knowledge this study provides the first insight of the determinants of financing relationship of SMEs in Europe.Employing  a  new  dataset  from  a  crosssectional  survey  of  SMEs  we  uncover  independent effects  arising  from  competition  and  concentration  on  the  number  of  lending  relationships maintained  by  SMEs. Small  and  medium  sized  firms  maintain  more  relationships  in  more competitive  banking  systems.  This  result  is  consistent  with  the     market  power     hypothesis  in  the literature. 18  Importantly our results substantiate the assertion in recent empirical work that competition and concentration describe different characteristics of banking systems. More precisely the findings underscore  that  decreasing  effects  on  the  number  of  bank  relationships  arising  from  increased consolidation in banking are offset by increased competition. Furthermore this conclusion is robust to alternative measures of competiton and concentration.Our  study  also  analyses  measures  that  capture  information  on  the  local  economic environment and  regarding  design features  of  the  institutional system on  the  countrylevel. In  that respect  we  find  that  regional  GDP  growth  regional  population  and  a  stimulating  local entrepreneurial environment foster the establishment of multiple lending relationships whereas legal and financing obstacles are an impediment to multiple relationships. These  findings  bear  important  policy  implications  In  particular  the  results  imply  that measures  of  market  structure  such  as  the  HHI  and  the  3bank  concentration  ratio  may  be inappropriate proxies for the degree of competition in banking as we reveal that both structure and conduct affect SMEs    financing relationships in opposite directions. Moreover the frequently raised concern among policymakers and in the media about the adverse ramifications from an increase ofconsolidation in banking concerning the provision of banking services to SMEs is not justified given that these negative effects are fully offset by the increased competition in banking. In addition thefinding  that  legal  obstacles  are  an  impediment  to  diversifying  lending  relationships  indicates  that policies aimed at encouraging SMEs to expand in scope and scale (which often requires setting up additional  bank  relationships)  are  bound  to  be  unsuccessful  if  legal  institutions  are  not  amended accordingly.  Finally  removing  barriers  and  obstacles  that  hamper  setting  up  multiple  bank relationships imposed on  banks will enable SMEs  to develop and mature  by making use of more sophisticated financial services thus ultimately promoting economic growth. Data limitations concerning the comparatively small sample size suggest that our results have to  be  taken  with  a  note  of  caution.  Nonetheless  our  findings  complement  a  growing  body  of empirical  work  in  the  banking  literature  suggesting  that  concentration  and  competition  describe different characteristics of banking systems.  19  This  paper  can  be  extended  in  other  directions.  Obviously  it  would  be  interesting  to examine  our  hypotheses  with  a  larger  crosscountry  sample  including  less  developed  economies. Another  intellectually  appealing  avenue  for  future  work  would  be  to  analyse  the  effect  of  the availability of venture capital and private equity on SME financing and the way SMEs interact with their  banks.  Finally  an  examination  of  how  different  lending  technologies  are  affected  by concentration and competition also seems worthwhile.  20  ReferencesAffinito M. and M.

The index ranges in value from 1 (very low) to 5 (very  high)  calculated  as  6  minus  the  banking  freedom  index  of  the  Heritage Foundation.Firms to rate on scale of 14 how problematic specific financing issues are for the operation  and  growth  of  their  business.  These  are  i)  collateral  requirements  of banks  and  financial  institutions;  ii)  bank  paperwork  and  bureaucracy;  iii)  high interest rates; iv) need for special connections with banks and financial institutions; v) banks lacking money to lend; vi) access to foreign banks; vii) access to nonbank equity; viii) access to export finance; ix) access to financing for leasing equipment; x)  inadequate  credit  and  financial  information  on  customers;  and  xi)  access  to longterm loans.Businesses asked whether i) information on laws and regulations was available; ii) if  the  interpretation  of  laws  and  regulations  was  consistent;  and  iii)  if  they were confident  that  the  legal  system  upheld  their  contract  and  property  rights  in business  disputes  3  years  ago  and  continues  to  do  so  now.  Businesses  asked whether their country   s courts are i) fair and impartial; ii) quick; iii) affordable; iv) consistent; and v) enforced decisions.Barth et al. (2001)Beck et al. (2005a)Beck et al.

This  statistic  is  widely  used  in  empirical  work  to  test  for  banking competition (e.g. Shaffer 2004; Molyneux et al. 1994; Claessens and Laeven 2004).The HStatistic is derived from reducedform revenue equations and measures market power by  the  extent  to  which  changes  in  factor  input prices  are  reflected  in  revenue.  Assuming  longrun equilibrium a proportional increase in factor prices will be mirrored by an equiproportional increase in revenue under perfect competition. Under monopolistic competition however revenues increase less than proportionally to changes in input prices. In the monopoly case increases in factor input prices will be either not reflected in revenue or will tend to decrease revenue.19 The magnitude of Hcan be interpreted in the following wayH     00 < H <1H = 1indicates monopoly equilibriumindicates monopolistic competitionindicates perfect competitionWe obtain data from BankScope and include all savings cooperative and commercial banks operating in Italy Germany and in the UK in 2001. To estimate HStatistics we follow the method in  Schaeck  and  Cihak  (2007)  and  split  our  sample  into small  and  large  banks  since  potential differences in the way these banks compete will bias H. Small banks often operate locally and tend to face stronger competition from other small banks in retail markets. By contrast large institutions compete in different lines of business e.g. corporate and investment banking and compete globally. We  use  a  cutoff  point  of  450  million  EUR  to  distinguish  between  small  and  large  banks20 and estimate  the  following  reducedform  revenue  equation  crosssectionally  for  each  one  of  the  three countries in 2001ln(R)          1ln(W1)     2ln(W2)     3ln(W3) (A.1)     1ln(Y1)     2ln(Y2)     3ln(Y   )3  4ln(Y4)     .                                                1920Therefore the magnitude of the HStatistic can serve as a measure for the degree of competition assuming that the bank faces a demand with constant elasticity and a CobbDouglas production technology (Vesala 1995).This cutoff point is aligned with the literature on small banks in Europe (Mercieca et al. 2007). 27  R   is  the  ratio  of  total  revenue  to  total  assets  (as  a  proxy  for  the  output  price  of  loans  and  other services). This dependent variable includes total interest revenue fee income commission incomeand other operating income to reflect that banks compete in many different activities. The variable 1W  is the ratio of interest expenses to total deposits and money market funding (as a proxy for input price  of  deposits) 2W   is  the  ratio  of  personnel  expenses  to  total  assets  (proxy  for  input  price  of labour) and 3W denotes the ratio of other operating and administrative expense to total assets (proxy for input price of equipment and fixed assets). To take account of risktaking behaviour and size 1Ycaptures the ratio of deposits to deposits and money market funding 2Y  is the ratio of net loans to total  assets 3Y   is  the  ratio  of  equity  to  total  assets  and 4Y   captures  bank  size  measured  as  total balance sheet assets. All variables enter the equation in logs. The HStatistic is calculated as the sum of the coefficients         3      21.It  is  well  known  that  the  HStatistic  assumes  longrun  equilibrium  (Molyneux  et  al.  1994). Consequently  we  perform  the  following  analysis  to  investigate  longrun  equilibrium  and  estimate Equation (1) with the pretax return on assets as dependent variable.ln(ROA)         1   ln(W1)      2ln(W)      32ln(W3)   (A.2)      1ln(Y1)      2ln(Y2)      3ln(Y)3      4ln(Y4)      The modified HStatistic  is the  equilibrium  statistic  and it  is again  calculated as          3      21. We test if the equilibrium statistic0   E using an Ftest. This test aims to establish whether input prices  are  uncorrelated  with industry  returns  since  a  competitive system  will equalise  riskadjusted rates of return across banks in equilibrium. If this hypothesis is rejected the market is assumed to be in  disequilibrium. The  results  from  our  equilibrium  test  indicate  that  the  three  markets  under consideration are in long run equilibrium. 28  Appendix III Logit model with marginal effectsFirm AgeFirm TypeOwnership changeR&D investmentTurnover DistanceBank Role Bank TermsAmount of bank finance used Regional bankNational bankHHIHStatisticHHI*HStatistic(1)0.3419(0.3916)2.1840***0.3521)1.3149***(0.3131)0.5234(0.3305)0.6384**(0.1753)0.4761(0.3444)0.2015**(0.3658)0.7253*(0.4110)0.0248(0.1360)2.6376***(0.7082)2.1809***(0.6108)(2)0.2842*(0.4015)0.6639(0.4317)0.2647***(0.3762)0.4272(0.3536)0.4051(0.1848)0.2207*(0.3767)1.0787*(0.4484)1.1786***0.4919)0.2266**(0.1496)2.8666***(0.7426)2.9124***(0.6259)0.8680***(0.5558)(3)0.1577(0.4153)0.9274**(0.4019)0.5539(0.3541)0.3190(0.3584)0.2010*(0.1006)0.1843*(0.4027)0.6395***(0.4054)0.8404*(0.4942)0.1096**(0.1404)2.7788***(0.7533)1.6683**(0.6935)0.6129***(0.8737)(4)0.21960.4116)0.3444**(0.4430)0.1538(0.3837)0.3422(0.3662)0.3916(0.1891)0.0440***(0.4112)0.2040***(0.5028)1.1305**(0.5341)0.1793*(0.1524)2.8243***(0.7427)2.2350***(0.6879)0.3542**(0.7479)0.4737***(0.1486)(5)0.2192(0.4118)0.3630*(0.4415)0.1681(0.3821)0.3203(0.3649)0.6859(0.0266)0.0558***(0.4112)0.1922***(0.5021)1.1129**(0.5346)0.2102**0.1481)2.8171***(0.7416)2.2420**(0.6878)0.9709***(0.4806)0.3427*(0.3634)0.9833(0.5541)Pseudo R2Observations0.443050.533050.543050.573050.56305Dependent variable Multibank relationships with 0 being a firm with one bank relationship 1 being a firm with more than one bank relationship. *** ** * indicates statistical significance at the 1% 5% and 10% level respectively.
