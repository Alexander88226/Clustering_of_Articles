b'herein fileUniversity of Tampere FinlandZheng HuangSME strategic management and innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x94a comparative study betweenFinland and ChinaAbstractThis research addresses innovation strategy management concerning a number of small andmediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs).  It is  an  exploratory  research  with  an extensive literaturereview and knowledge development.   The phenomenon of SME innovation has captured theinterest of many scholars there is a growing consensus that innovation system approach areimportant for fostering innovation in developing as much as developed countries. This paper istrying to make a valuable contribution to current thinking which fills the blank of contemporaryscholars\\xe2\\x80\\x99 topic. The objective of this study is to obtain a deep insight into innovation trajectoryin Finnish  companies  and  in  comparison  with  Chinese  companies(cid712)  focusing  on the majorsimilarities  and  differences  across  the  regional  areas.  The  study  attempts  to  examine  thecritical  driving  forces  of  innovation  and  to  analyze  different  innovation  patterns  based  ontheoretical and empirical  studies. It provides a conceptual framework to describe innovationactivities  on  the  background  of  countryspecific  especially  identifying  various  factorsdeterminant the innovativeness of SMEs. The project targets the experience gain from a pilotresearch  which  is  carried  out  in  cooperation  with  other  researchers  in  the  Department  ofManagement Studies at the University of Tampere also close collaboration with professors atFudan  University.  The  findings  would  help  managers  and  policy  makers  to  better  fosterinnovation and researchers to better channel their efforts in studying the phenomenon. Prior toempirical  studies  this  study  was  started  by  theoretical  studies  and  collecting  availablestatistical database.Key  words    SME  Strategic  Management  Innovation  System  Comparative  study  FinlandChina1. IntroductionInnovation  is regarded  as  one  of  the  most  critical  factors for  success  in  a rapidly  changingmarket.  In  an  overview  of  the  study  of  innovative  strategy  management  there  is  a  newtendency of growing interest in business strategy in which more and more scholars start byexamining some of the assumptions underlying the current innovation strategic managementdomains. As we know strategy influences on company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance growth profitability andmarket  share  (Gellatly  1999  Baldwin  1994)  thereby  increasing  the  awareness  of  theinnovation strategy research.  In general innovation can be defined as the transition from anovel idea to a successful product in the market. By far strategic innovation is regarded as themost important factor that has relative impact on a firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s sustainable competitive advantage.1\\x0cMany  enterprises  are  facing  a  number  of  typical  problems  with  regard  to  their  innovationprocess.  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInnovation is not flash of  genius  it is hard work.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d1  Quinn (2002  P.13)  states that\\xe2\\x80\\x9ctrue innovation is complex and tumultuous full of spurts frustrations and sudden insights\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Ineconomics  terms  strategic  innovation  management  shifts  from  a  static  to  a  dynamicperspective. Innovation is usually conceptualized in terms of ideas learning and the creationof knowledge. In other words innovation is the implementation of new ideas in an attempt tocreate  value  therefore  creating  new  customer  expectations  setting  new  standards  andmaking  possible  new  satisfactions.  Innovation  as  a  subject  that  all  companies  should  befocused  on  regardless  of  their  size  and  industry  they  are  involved  in.  By  implementingdynamic  innovation  strategies  a firm  has  the  ability to  enhance  its activities in  pursuit  of  amore complex and advantageous strategy configuration. SME must respond by adopting moreinnovativeness to establish or sustain competitive advantage in the market place (Mosy et al2002). This research also reflects a theorydevelopment process. It is often argued that SMEsinnovate in a different way to larger firms. The innovative advantages of large firms are in termsof  material  or  resource  factors  while  small  firms  are  attributed  with  behavioral  advantages(Rothwell 1985).  However  the  region  or  immediate  local  environment is more  important  toSMEs than to large firms (Asheim 2002; T\\xc3\\xb6dtling 2002).1.1 Purpose and Scope of the researchThe  ambition  of this  scientific  research  is  to  cross  theoretical  boundaries  and  toreconceptualize the study field. In order to create research my task is to develop a theory ofIntegrative Innovation Management combined with market organizational and technologicalchanges.  An  additional  aim  of  the  study  is  to  analyze  a  set  of  strategic  models  forstrengthening  the  innovation  knowledge  in  action.    This  paper  will  follow  the  line  of  acomparative analysis exploring the underlying determinants of  SMEs innovation disparity atthe  national  /regional  and  firm  level.  This  pilot  study  will  increase  the  understanding  andknowledge of the integrated approach and to develop new business innovative patterns.1.2 Problem formulationThis  study  targets  innovation  strategy  management  problems  and  focuses on  a  number  ofsmall  and  mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs) and  attempts  to  investigate  underlyinginnovation factors in two specific countries. Unlike large firms small firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 innovativeness isstrongly  influenced  by  the  national  or  regional  systems  of  innovation  in  which  they  areembedded. The investigation is related to a cluster of distinct features between Finnish SMEand  Chinese  SME.  The  academic  theme  is  based  on  describing  and  interpreting  thephenomenon of  innovative SMEs in real. Why  did they  innovate? What types of  innovationwere they involved in?   How those innovation activities affect the operational performance offirms? And which sorts of determining factors are significant for SME in efficiency of innovation?Moreover a comparative framework of growthorientation and propensities toward innovation1  Peter Drucker2\\x0cbetween two geographic enterprises will be illustrated.2. The definition of SMEThe definition of  SME varies from countries to countries and in different size ranges (Peresand  Stumpo  2000).  Employee  numbers  are  not  the  sole  defining  criterion.  In  Europeanlegislation the upper limit of a SME is 250 employees and financial assets are also used todefine  SMEs.  This  definition  has been  widely  applied throughout  the  European  Union  (seewebsite links2).   In Finland a small and mediumsized enterprise is defined as a firm with lessthan 250 employees and either an annual turnover of maximum \\xe2\\x82\\xac 40 million or a balance sheettotal of maximum \\xe2\\x82\\xac 27 million. Businesses larger than this may not own more than 25% of thecapital of an SME. A small business is defined as a firm with less than 50 employees and eitheran annual turnover of maximum \\xe2\\x82\\xac 7 million or a balance sheet total of maximum \\xe2\\x82\\xac 5 million.Businesses larger than this may not own more than 25% of the capital of a small business. 3In  contrast  according  to  the  Chinese  latest  law  on  promotion  of  small  and  mediumsizedenterprises  manufacturing  SMEs  are those  with fewer  than 2000  employees  or  an  annualturnover of less than or equal to RMB Yuan 300 million  or total assets of less than or equal toRMB Yuan 400 million. In this study I will limit the size of the sample of Chinese firms to lessthan 500 employees.3. Theoretical background and literature review3.1 What is innovation?First  of  all  the  conceptual  background  of  innovation  should  be  described.  The  concept\\xe2\\x80\\x9cinnovation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d can be explained in many ways. Innovation is often associated with concepts ofchange  invention  creative  behavior  and  adaptation  (Pierce  and  Delbecq  1977).  Nord  andTucker (1987 p. 6) defined innovation as a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctechnology strategy or management practice thata firm is using for the first time whether or not other organizations or users have previouslyadopted it or as a significant  restructuring or improvements in a process\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  New technologyalways needs new markets which were not even conceivable until the new technology creatednew demands.4  In this context innovation can be defined as attempts \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto create competitiveadvantage by perceiving or discovering new and improved ways of competing in an industryand bringing them to market\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Porter 1990 p45). Moreover the concept of innovation refers\\xe2\\x80\\x98the  transformation  of  an  idea  into  a  marketable  product  or  service  a  new  or  improvedmanufacturing  or  distribution  process  or  a  new  method  of  social  service\\xe2\\x80\\x99  (EuropeanCommission  1995  4).    Schumpeter  classifies five  categories  of  innovation  new  productsnew methods of production new source of supply the exploitation of new markets and newways to organize business.2 http//ec.europa.eu/enterprise/policies/sme/factsfiguresanalysis/smedefinition/index_en.htm3 http//www.expatfinland.com/entrepreneurship/development_and_finance.html4  Drucker 1969 pp. 52\\xe2\\x80\\x9353.3\\x0cFreeman and Perez (1998) categorized two types of innovations based on the characters ofdegree.  There  are  incremental  innovations  and  radical  innovations.  Christensen  (2003)distinguishes  as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdisruptive innovations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csustaining  innovations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Radical  innovation  inwhich both the technology and the market are new and customer needs are  unknown;  andincremental  innovation  is  consisting  of  the  improved  use  of  existing  technologies  to  meetknown customer needs (Henderson and Clark 1990). Radical innovations refer to significantchange  that  simultaneously  affects  both  the  business  model  and  the  technology  of  thecompany pathbreaking discontinuous and pioneering. Incremental innovations refer to smallbut useful improvements. Incremental innovation is the most prevalent style of innovation.Concepts  of  innovation  have  been  changed  greatly  in  recent  years.  The  dimension  ofinnovation  appears  complex  and  broadly  and  it  can  be  understood  from  a  linear  processtowards  an  interactive  dynamic  process  (Kline  and  Rosenberg  1986;  Dosi  1998;  Malecki1997). The different explanation of innovation is based on three common elements 1) Changeor doing things in a different way; 2) Newness that is mostly related to the technical approachand  3) Performance  improvement that  links  to  economic  achievement  (Jorna  &  Waalkens2006). Four innovation dimensions will be applied to classify the innovation behaviors of SME.These four aspects of  innovation performance are the number of innovations  the speed ofinnovation the level of innovativeness (novelty newness) and the level of aggressiveness inadopting or generating innovation. 5Innovation  has  been  identified  as  a  powerful  way  for  attaining  and  sustaining  competitiveadvantage. Nowadays it is becoming a more complex interactive and dynamic context whatis  commonly  labeled  as  the  system  of  innovation  (Edquist  1997).  Innovationbasedcompetitive  strategy  emphasizes  on  the  creative  improvement  of  appealing  new  productsprocesses  or  services  or  in the  crafting  of  efficient  new business  models  or  organizationalinnovation.  Furthermore  the  strategic  innovation  process  should  be  adopted  for  bettermanagement  and  more  access  to  resources  in  order  to  compete  and  survive.  It  is  avaluecreating activity which determines to what extent actual change and performance matchto desired change and performance.Innovation is seen as a process of interaction between firms and their external environments.This  external  environment  has  usually  been  dimensioned  in  terms  of  national  or  regional\\xe2\\x80\\x98systems  of  innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  Therefore  we  should  understand  in  the  context  of  the  innovationsystem.  Dosi(1988b)  Lundvall(1988)  and  Thomas  (1985)  note  that  innovation  may  have  astrong geographic dimension due to the specific and cumulative nature of knowledgebasedinnovative inputs. Firmlevel innovation occurs in the context of an \\xe2\\x80\\x98innovation system\\xe2\\x80\\x99. In otherwords SMEs innovation is embedded in a regional or national innovation system. The national5  FirmsDaniel  I.

Camagni and Capello (2000) found that within an innovative local milieu interSMElinks  provide  channels for  knowledge  acquisition  uncertainty  reduction  and local  collectivelearning.innovation firms 3.2 Strengthening the knowledge of systematic innovationKeizer et al. (2002) note the factors that having effect on innovation can be divided into internaland  external.  The  innovation  factors  between  firmlevel  and  the  external  environmentrepresent the important focus in this research. I am interested in critical factors that relevant tosuccess or failure in  SME innovation (in Figure 1). Internal variables refer to characteristicsand  strategies  of  SMEs  and  external  variables  refer  to  environment  impact  on  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99innovation  activities.  Internal  factors  are  determined  by  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  specific  resources  andtechnology  competencies  innovation  strategies  and  entrepreneurship.    Resource  andcapabilities  play  major  roles  in  establishing  special  competitiveness.  To  build  a  set  oftechnological  competences  and  capabilities  based  on  resources  firms  enable  to  createdistinctive  areas  of  competitive  advantage.  Strategy  indicates  innovativeness  among  ofcommercialization  and  marketing  effort  the  degree  of  marketing  involvement  in  productplanning and firm competence in the area of technology strategy and technology management(Hoffman  et  al.  1998).  New  innovation  knowledge  development  should  adopt  a  variety  ofstrategies and make sure which strategic options can be optimally matched. Entrepreneurshipis SME owners or leaders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 attitudes vision and decisions toward innovation activities. On theother hand the external environment in which a firm involved that conducts its business andalso  influences  its  innovative  capability  (King  and  Anderson  1995).  Concerning  externalfactors there are Market scope firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regional technology infrastructure networking (supplierscustomers  etc)  and  government  policy.  Market  growth  is  very  significant  in  fosteringinnovativeness. It means firms operating in fastgrowing markets are more likely to innovate.The  market  spurs  firms  to  innovate  through  competition.  Governmental  support  is  anotherimportant element for SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 innovation. Government through regulation can both encourageand discourage the adoption of innovation (Tornatzky and Fleischer 1990; Lai et al. 2005).The traits of SME innovation are associated with internal factors and external factors. In otherwords the strategies of SME innovation need to be conceived in relation to the firm sectorand countryspecific advantages and disadvantages in the different parts.   Building a dynamicstrategy  framework  setting  up  various  innovational  strategy  models  and  evaluating  theinteraction  of  strategic  factors  are  based  on  the  total  business  performance  analysis  thatincludes assessment of current markets products and management processes.5\\x0cRegional innovation systemExternal FactorsMarket  scope  and  development  ofdemandFirm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s regionNetworkingGovernment and public policiesFinance resourceSurrounding cultureInnovation patternsInnovation strategiesInternal FactorsFirm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s market positionFirm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s resources and core capabilitiesFirm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innovation strategiesEntrepreneurshipFirm level innovationFigure 1 the framework of strategic innovation (Determinants of a firm\'s innovation behaviorinternal and external factors Source Zheng Huang)4. Research MethodologyThe  research  methodology  draws  on  the  concepts  of  the  research  wheel  (Wallace  1971).Methodology is an important scientific way in creating knowledge. Methodology is defined as amethod or technique approach that is to be applied in the conducting of research. The mostuseful  of  three  scientific  research  methods  in  the  business  area  were  defined  by  Arbnor&Bjerke in  1997.  They  introduced  three  different  methodological  approaches  for  generatingbusiness knowledge which are analytical approach systems approach and actors approach.Each of these is based on different assumptions about their subject areas and different validprocesses of knowledge creation. Systems research methodology will be chosen because thesystems  thinking  create  a  better  understanding  of  the  big  picture  of  phenomena.  Systemsapproach is a proven methodology to view how specific elements can be combined to create awhole that is greater than the sum of the individual parts or functions. In the systems approachreality is viewed as a social construction formed by systems.4.1 Research method and Data sourcesThe  goal  of  this  paper  is to  discover  which factors  contribute to  SME  innovation.  The coreresearch topic concerning the importance factors of firmlevel and nationallevel determinant ofinnovation activity is addressed through a comparative analysis of two countries. To effectivelyconduct  crossregional  studies  in  this  project  I  should  take  into  account  of  crossregional6\\x0ccomparability establishing data/case equivalence (Reynolds Simintiras and Diamantopoulos2003).My  research  approach  is  consistent  with  the  basic  assumptions  and  definitions  ofcrossregional  research.  At  this  stage  Secondary  data  are  utilized  in  the  comparison  ofdifferent types of innovation patterns where demonstrated in this paper. OECD (Organizationfor Economic CoOperation and Development) Statistics reports provide one of the importantresources for international comparison of innovative output at country level.The  analysis is mainly  based  on  data from  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStatistical  Finland\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOECD  SMEs  reports\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  andother relevant research articles from various academic journals etc. I try to draw some generalconclusions in this paper. Analyze the extent to which structural differences between the twoinnovation systems can be explained by underlying characteristics in a framework. Empiricalresearch  will  be  conducted  later  by  further  investigation  which  applying  case  studies.  Thisresearch  represents  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csystems  innovation  management\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  argues  that  an  appropriateinnovation strategy will usually depend on the specific circumstances and situations.5. The analysis of SME innovation in Finland and ChinaComparative  analysis  shows  significant  differences  of  national  innovation  system  acrosscountries  (Nelson  1993;  OECD  2002a).  My  discussion  addresses  SME  from  the  nationalinnovation  system  to  the  business  strategies  in  relevant  to  innovative  management.  Ideveloped  a  conceptual  framework  to  highlight  the  key  differences  in  genetic  innovationpatterns between Finnish and Chinese SMEs. It maps out the generic strategies in nationalinnovation  systems  as  well  as  the  linkages  to  the  innovative  performance  of  firms  in  twocountries.

Compared  to  FinlandChina  is  a  laterindustrializing  country.  Chinese  SMEs  are  primarily  involved  in  thelaborintensive  or  resourceintensive  manufactories  focusing  more  on  process  innovationsand cost reduction. Many of them  are steered by inexperienced owners and managers andoperate with relatively low capital intensity and simple technology.industries  mainly China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic growth has received world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s attention recently.  China moves from centralplanning toward a more marketdriven economy since 1979. The development of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SMEis fueled by a high pace of market growth and economy booming. On the other hand China\\xe2\\x80\\x99sSMEs provide the main sources of rapid and sustainable economic growth (Yeung 2004) andjob creation especially in the private sector (Li  2004).  By the end of June 2009 China has9978.8  thousand  enterprises  increasing  264.2  thousand  than  last  year  It  has  30636.3thousand individual holders and small enterprises the growth 5.01% than last year (P.R.netJuly 31 2009). Small and mediumsized enterprises occupy the 99% of the total enterprisesnumber; enterprises accounted for 60% of contribution to GDP 50% of the tax and provide 80%of jobs. SMEs are also changed from  scattered operations to concentrated operations fromthe early developing in the domestic market mainly to both of the domestic and internationalmarkets.6  Chen (2006) identifies three major economic development stages of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SMEs.The first  phase  (19781992)  that  was  characterized  by  the  rapid  expansion  of  the  ChineseSME sector after reforming and opening up to the world private economy and different sorts ofownerships were highly encouraged during that period. The second stage (19922002) was areform  of  stateowned  SMEs  in  restructuring  merger  and  acquisition.  Chinese  SMEs  wasgetting rapid growing after 1992 Chinese government emphasized on improving the overallquality and competitiveness of  the domestic SME sector (Chen 2006). The third stage wasfrom  2002 it refers to setup government law and supporting policies aimed at consolidatingand  further  fostering  the  expending  Chinese  SME  sector.  The  promotion  of  scientific  andtechnological innovation and upgrading has been regarded as one of the most important tasks.Since  then  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  SMEs  innovative  capabilities  and  research  output  have  been  growingdramatically.  Many  areas  were  opened  up  for  bottomup  innovation  and  entrepreneurship.China is moving successfully from imitation to innovation. In addition Chinese government haschosen clusterbased SMEs innovation policies. National clusters and incubators which were6  ZHOU  Jun  GUO  Tuxin  LU  Shan  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSME  law and  policy analysis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Journal  of  USChina  PublicAdministration May. 2010 Volume 7 No.5 (Serial No.55)8\\x0cestablished  by  the central  government  and local  governments  provide diverse  supports  forspinoffs and hightechnology startups.  By  2008  China has established over 200 businessenterprise  incubators  53  hightech  development  zones  over  62  university  scientific  andtechnological parks over 20 enterprise parks for returned overseas students over 40 servicecenters for SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 technology innovation and more than 500 productivity promotion centers.7China\'s expenditures on scientific and technical activities and R&D of GDP have continuallyarisen year by year from 1994 to 2007 (see appendix I). Although those measured figures arestill lower than the  world average (1.6 percent) and developed countries (2.2 percent) (seeappendix II).As for opening innovation milieu Finnish innovation system is encompassing the support andconduct  of  R&D  and  innovation  technology  diffusion  where  embedded  in  networkinggovernance  structures.  It  is  becoming  more  involved  in  international  scientific  cooperationcompared  to China  (see appendix  III). Nearly onethird collaboration innovation projects arecarried  out  with  international  partners.8  Finland  has  a  welldeveloped  system  of  innovationwith R&D intensive cluster. From the late 1980s nationwide networks of technology parks andcenters  of  expertise  were  set  up  in  Finland.  The  technology  parks  have  initiated  spinoffprojects  and  incubators.9  Finland  has  the  good  technology  infrastructure  in  shaping  theirinnovativeness and has accumulated a plenty of experiences. A systemic supporting schemeof  SMEs  innovation  activities  and  entrepreneurship  is  applied  as  part  of  broad  nationalinnovation  strategies  aim  at  promoting innovation  and  strengthening  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 prosperity.  Forinstance  regional  industryacademiagovernment  cooperation  projects  it  assists  SME  incollecting  innovationrelated  information  and  working  on  cooperative  innovation  projects.Through supplying external risk capital the projects not only encourage SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 willing but alsoenable them to take the risks of technology innovation. These efforts are focused on helpingSMEs  become  more  innovative  more  qualityconscious  and  more  efficient.  In  Chinainnovation governance system for SME is still  at  a nascent  stage. The Innovation Fund forTechnologyBased Firms was established by the Chinese central government in 1999. Policymakers in China began to setup the task of  crafting regulations to support  SME innovationsince  2003.  National  innovation  system  is  not functioning  well  enough  and  the  supportinginnovation  service  is  still  in  an  early  stage.  The  institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x99  services  for  technologicalinnovation in China are mainly concentrated on large and mediumsized firms. The promotionof  overall  competitiveness  of  Chinese  SMEs  is  still  challenging  tasks  for  the  Chinesegovernment.  In  a  recent  study  the  AllChina  Federation  of  Industry  and  Commerce  (theChinese  chamber  of  commerce)  found  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  private  enterprises  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnot  interested  in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  or7  Annual report on \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTorch Program\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of 2003 released by the Torch Hightech industry Developmentcentre Ministry of Science and Technology8  Statistics Finland \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInnovation survey 2008 report\\xe2\\x80\\x9d published by 20109  G \\xc3\\x96 R A N R O O S  L I S A F E R N S T R \\xc3\\x96 M A N D O L I V E R G U P T A    (2005)\\xe2\\x80\\x9cNATIONAL INNOVATION SYSTEMS FINLAND SWEDEN & AUSTRALIA COMPARED\\xe2\\x80\\x9d9\\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cunwilling  to  engage  in\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  innovation. 10 A  very  small  portion  of  total  Chinese  SMEs  haveentered hightech and high valueadded fields.to  education  and training  forFinnish  government  has  given  increasingly  attention entrepreneurship  teaching  people  how  to  start  their  own  business  and  willingness  ofrisktaking. It aims to stimulate entrepreneurship and new firm startup. In financing of SMEaspect  Finnish  government  also  provides  financial  support  in  knowledgecreating  and  newideas of application offering a range of financial programmes to help entrepreneurs managerisks  and  raise  innovations.  The purpose of  national policy intervention is to assist SMEs toenhance their innovative capability therefore to overcome sizerelated innovation barriers. Onthe contrary Chinese SMEs can not get such benefactions. It is difficult for them to either directfinancing (bonds IPO) or indirect financing (mainly refers to bank loans). Selffinancing playsan important source of the financing of the innovation activities of Chinese SMEs.   It is alsowidely reported that Chinese SMEs have great difficulties in obtaining bank loan because theChinese  banking  system  has  been  designed  for  large  stateowned  enterprises  rather  thanSMEs particularly privately owned SMEs. The financing problems of SMEs are solved throughconnection with friends family or selffinancing. It is also shown in relevant surveys that 62%of  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  in  China  regard  difficulties  in  direct  and  indirectfinancing. Less than 10% of private enterprises are supported by bank loans and less than 1%has access to other forms of  external financing. Established by  central government in June1999  the  Innovation  Fund  for  Small  Technologybased  Firms  (Innofund)  is  a  specialgovernment fund in support of technological innovations for small techbased firms. Venturecapital  scarcity  is  a major  constraint  for  Chinese  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  thushampering  the  development  of  innovation.    Despite  China  implements  tax  system  as  aninstrument to improve SME financing  two kinds of incentives like lowering tax rates and taxrelief  for  instance  including  an  exemption  of  up  to  150  percent  of  R&D  expenditure  fromcorporate income tax and the provision of carrying forward any unused amount to offset taxliabilities up to four years in the future; \\xe2\\x80\\x9chi and newtech firms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d be applied 15 percent tax rateinstead  of  the  normal  rate  of  25  percent.  The  sorts  of  tax  incentives  are  not  enough.  Thedifficulty in raising funds in China still is a serious bottleneck which restricting the  growth ofSMEs. However China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy makers have realized and attempted to address this issue tosupply  adequate  and  special  finance  for  SMEs.  According  to  recent  empirical  studiesshortage of talent is ranked the secondhighest obstacle to innovation of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SME.Most Chinese SMEs are private owned with weak capacities for technology creation. The levelof technological innovation of SMEs in China is still not high. The mode of innovativeness isadoption  or  adaptation  that  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  innovators  are  specialized  in  the  application  of  existing10  Chunlin Zhang World Bank Douglas Zhihua Zeng(2009) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPromoting enterpriseled innovation inChina\\xe2\\x80\\x9d William Peter Mako World Bank Publications P3510\\x0cthese to  enhance technologies in  costreduced  ways theirtechnologies  using  of competitiveness.  The fast  growth of  local market offers a big substantial  space and a  hugedomestic  demand  stimulate  the  development  of  SMEs.  Apparently  laborintensive  andlowtechnology  industries  are  easy  for  new  private  entrepreneurs  to  set  up.  MoreoverInternationalization and FDI lead to the global knowledge diffusion technology spillover fromadvanced foreign companies that provides as an opportunity to Chinese SMEs to catch up withthe worldleading technologies. However those sorts of technologies are not latest upgradetechnologies because some foreign companies fear the loss of intellectual property and futurecompetition from companies that learn the new technologies (Hayter and Han 1998 page 3;Young and Lan 1997). In addition China has already demonstrated some success in buildingup technological infrastructure and supporting institutions in its HighTech Industry Zones. Sofar Chinese SMEs majorly dependent  on a close integration of the clusters of  supply  chainpartners  which  providing  them  to  access  information  knowhow  and  new  technologies  ingeneral  potential  local  or  domestic  links  along  and  between  value  chains.  These  is  limitedformal collaboration across firms (or between firms and other organizations) going on locally.Many  innovative  SMEs  have  extensive  linkages  to  other  organizations  through  industrialcluster  or  Science  Parks  whereas  networks  are  weak  and  fragmented.  R&D  projects  areusually conducted inhouse and seldom collaboration. Even when there is \\xe2\\x80\\x98collaboration\\xe2\\x80\\x99 it istend  to  partially  shortterm  focus  and  opportunistic  behavior  unwillingness  to  take  risk  orfailure.  Therefore  the collaboration with  universities  and  research  institutes  in  China is  stilllower  than  developed  countries.  In  other  words  the  effective  industryuniversityresearchcooperation system is still understructure. The innovation capacity of Chinese SME is weak.Many  SME  owners/managers  lack  of  relevant  skills  and  knowledge  in  making  importantinnovation  reform  decisions  and  their  employees  are  low  quality. Many  firms  simply  don\\xe2\\x80\\x99tknow  how  to  plan  for  and  manage  the  innovation  process.  Insufficient  collaboration  andcommunication  among  small  and medium  enterprises  the  innovation  strategies  are  largelyrelied on their personal ties where contact with external stakeholders for generating ideas fortheir strategic decisions. They rely heavily on their formal and informal socialnetworks to gaininformation and advice from outside. These networks are based on family connections on thebasis that family members could be trusted.The  Finnish  national  innovation  system  pursues  a  constant  strategy  in  R&D/technologicalaccumulation and human resource development. Finnish SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innovative strategies are onthe  basis  of  knowledgebased  creating.  Namely  innovation  strongly  evolves  around  thecreation  of  new  knowledge.  Many  of  them  are  innovation  leaders  with  advanced  technicalknowledge  and  patents  within  a  market  niche.  Networks  between  industry  and  scienceresearch  are  fairly  developed  in  Finland.  Innovation  activities  of  SMEs  is  switching  tocustomer  and  useroriented  networked  and  open  innovation  ecosystems  which  areembedded in a global economy. Nevertheless science and technology researches are carriedout more especially in ICT (information and communication technology) sector that causes the11\\x0cinnovation  capabilities  making  their less diversification of industrial structure. Chinese SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s innovative strategies vary in mediumand  lowtech  or  manufacturingbased  innovation  development.  The  innovation  model  ofChinese SME is defined regard as Chainlinked or Supplyoriented models. Only few of thempossess core technologies due to most of them have limited capabilities to conduct a research.The local innovation system is often structured by integrating the relationships in supply chainstransition  from  production  to innovation  processdependent  on  them.  The  supplerdriven  innovation  from  large  companies  helps  SMEs  onadopting  advanced  equipment  to  achieve  higher  quality  in  proficient  production  processestherefore  enhancing  innovative  capacity.    The  buyerdriven  innovation  is  pulled  by  largecostumers that requiring SMEs to improve their products\\xe2\\x80\\x99 quality and technology standards.These  sorts  of  usersupplier  interactions  within  the  local  cluster  spur  SMEs  to  focus  theirspecialties on R&D and innovation. China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SMEs Innovative activities are yielded by flexibleoperation  and  quick  adaptability  to  market  changes.  They  enable  to  enter  new  marketssegments quickly by offering much flexibility to satisfy the requirements of market competition.However they are facing to inadequate technology innovation infrastructure. Better absorptionof  available worldwide technological resources and foreign knowlow has become the mainstrategy  in  Chinese  SMEs  to  catching  up  with  developed  countries.  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  SMEs  pursuitprofitmaximizing and have little incentives to invest in innovation and technological progress.Their innovation strategy is lack of longrange planning.  Although China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SMEs have morepressure  for  innovation  in  order  to  survive  market  competition.  Strong  competition  andinterfirm rivalry thus serves to accelerate innovation (Porter 1990 and 1998; Grabher 2002).Their natural tendency is to maximize shortterm profit through the expansion of their existingproduction capacity and market share as well by controlling costs. Furthermore Chinese SMEowners/managers  widely  adopt  an  outsidein  approach  in  developing  their  strategies  whichmore  highly  adaptable innovationcommercialization reduce cost and increase the flexibility.to  environmental  changes  such  as  shorten 6. ConclusionsThe innovative small and middlesize enterprises are considered essential for the developmentand  growth  of  nations.  Therefore  facilitating  innovation  in  SMEs  is  central  for  stimulatingeconomics development at the local regional and even national levels (Jone and Tilley 2003).A successful innovation often contents support mechanisms outside the firm able to providespecialized  services  and  information  that  can  be  used  to  overcome  innovation  obstacles.Governments play a fundamental role in determining policies that can affect innovation. Policymakers should place greater emphasis on creating effective fundamental system  support orpolicies to facilitate local  cooperation network  for SMEs and  establish a stable platform forcooperation to achieve mutual learning between SMEs and partners.Obviously different factors impact on strategic innovation decisions and models with regionalcharacters. Innovativeness is not only happened in hightech industries alone but also can be12\\x0cachieved in  traditional  lowtech  sectors.  SMEs  in  China  have more  flexibility  in  operationsmore easily adapt to changing markets and execute attack quickly in face of competitive. Thesuccess factors of Chinese SMEs lies in the ability to access transfer and apply technology.Finnish SMEs has knowledgebased entrepreneurial competitiveness.As we have seen there are many differences in innovation patterns within countryspecific.But  we  can  also  find  common  factors  as  well.  In  summary  effective integration  innovationstrategy and continuous learning are critical to the survival and success of firms operating inchanging and complex  environments.  This article represents an early research stage of  mydissertation.    The  future  research will  be  contacted  by  a  qualitative  investigation  which  toimprove the indicators in practice.Appendix IChina\\xe2\\x80\\x99s research institutes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 R&D expenditure (20002009) RBM billionSourceChina Science and TechnologyStatistic13\\x0chttp//www.sts.org.cn/tjbg/tjgb/document/2009/rdgb2009_3.htmAppendix IIGross domestic expenditure on R&D 19942008As a percentage of GDPSource OECD (2009) Main Science and Technology Indicators 2009/2 December.Appendix IIIFirms with national/international collaboration on innovation 200406As a percentage of innovative firms%National collaboration onlyInternational collaboration6050403020100dnanFilelihCnedewSairtsuAsdnalrehteNcilbupeR hcezCimuge) B40l2002( acirfA htuoSyawroNianotsEkramneDgruobmexuL6002( dnaaeZweN l)70dnalerI)402002( dnalecIimodgnK detinUianhC402002( adanaC)gnirutcafunam)10029991( napaJ705002( aeroK)gnirutcafunam)706002( ailartsuAlyatIinapSlagutroPynamreGSource OECD (2010) Measuring Innovation A New Perspective OECD Paris based on OECDInnovation microdata project.14\\x0cReferencesJoseph Maciariello  (2009)  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarketing and innovation in  the  Drucker Management  System\\xe2\\x80\\x9dJournal of the Academy of Marketing Science Springer Volume 37 Number 1 / P3543Peter F.
