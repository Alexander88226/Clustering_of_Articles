New technologies are being developed and implemented in subSaharan Africa with the potential to change the competitive landscape in the financial sector. FinTech challenges traditional structures and creates efficiency gains by opening up the financial services value chain although it also raises concerns about new vulnerabilities. Today FinTech is emerging as a technological enabler in the region improving financial inclusion and serving as a catalyst for innovation in other sectors such as agriculture and infrastructure.SubSaharan Africa has become the global leader in mobile money transfer services spurring widespread access to financial services. Although subSaharan Africa has lagged behind the rest of the world in access to finance some countries in the region are now global leaders. There is a wide degree of differences across the region with East Africa leading in mobile money adoption and usage. Built on an appropriate pricing strategy to attract customers suitable regulation and a reliable and trustful network Kenya represents today one of the most successful cases regarding the use of mobile money. FinTech may carry significant gains for financial inclusion and deepening by improving the level of efficiency of the financial sector. FinTech provides avenues to extend access to credit as new technologies help overcome information barriers and lower the cost of crossborder transfers. In particular pressures on correspondent banking relationships could be partly remedied by the use of new technologies if the new systems can satisfy requirements to avoid money laundering and the financing of terrorism. Furthermore whereas the current technologies are still facing number of challenges such as vii\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErscalability and high energy consumption future distributed ledger technologies could enhance efficiency security and transparency of payment systems in subSaharan Africa thus lowering trading costs.There is a need to balance the tradeoff between the benefits that FinTech technologies may generate and potential added risks and vulnerabilities. Given the lower levels of financial inclusion bank competition and macrofinancial linkages in subSaharan Africa relative to other regions regulators and central banks could potentially benefit from considering FinTech as a leapfrogging opportunity to foster inclusive economic growth and development. At the same time these new technologies and business models present new risks that would need to be addressed with suitable regulatory frameworks.Policy measures are needed to reap the potential benefits of FinTech while managing associated risks. First policymakers need to fill the large existing infrastructure gap in the region starting with electricity and internet services. Second there is a need to address the perennial race between fastmoving innovation and the slower pace of regulation. Third policymakers should look beyond the potential benefits of FinTech in just the financial sector to consider the possible impact on employment and productivity the digital economy and more broadly the scope for much needed structural transformation.viii\\x0cChAPTEr1introductionInnovation in financial technology often referred to as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinTech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is rapidly transforming the global financial sector. Since 2010 more than US$50\\xc2\\xa0billion has been invested in almost 2500\\xc2\\xa0companies worldwide as FinTech redefines the way in which we store save borrow invest move spend and protect money (Skan Dickerson and Gagliardi 2016). Although there is not yet a consensus the working definition of FinTech adopted by the Financial Stability Board points to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctechnologically enabled financial innovation that could result in new business models applications processes or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Financial Stability Board 2017).Ongoing innovation in business models and processes is building on advances in technology. The technological basis for new FinTech business models and services rests on the development of some major innovations developed in recent decades. These include distributed computing artificial intelligence big data cryptography smart contracts and mobile internet access. Taken together these innovations have enabled the ability to collate and analyze vast amounts of data develop more robust security systems and connect economic agents through multiple types of platforms on a realtime basis.FinTech is challenging traditional structures and is creating efficiency gains by opening up the financial services value chain. Much of the interest in FinTech is related to the way in which innovation in the financial sector can lead to increased access better services and gains in efficiency. Such innovation includes transforming all aspects of delivery of core functions of the financial sector such as settling payments facilitating borrowing and saving risk sharing and allocating capital. Moreover this process could trigger deep changes to the existing market structure and financial market infrastructure for the provision of these services. The current financial infrastructure typically revolves around (1) incumbent banks serving retail commercial and 1\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErwholesale customers; (2) insurance and pension providers; and (3) money foreign exchange and capital markets all of which are underpinned by payment system providers and other financial market providers as well as central banks and regulators. Financial innovation can improve the way the private and public sectors function.FinTech has the potential to strengthen and accelerate important gains in financial development achieved in subSaharan Africa over the past two decades. Financial liberalization reform of monetary policy frameworks and instruments and improvements in the institutional environment contributed to a significant expansion of banking activities and financial products. Some countries achieved decisive progress in financial deepening and now have increased access to international financial markets while others have lagged. The advent of panAfrican banks led to an increased use of payment system tools such as debit and credit cards and there has been robust growth in mobile payments in many countries. Still financial systems in subSaharan Africa face several limitations and financial inclusion remains too narrow limiting the prospect for further gains in sustained growth employment and poverty reduction.While acknowledging the large potential gains from FinTech there are concerns about new vulnerabilities that these technologies and business models may bring. New competitors without previous experience in the industry are providing innovative financial services. For instance blockchainbased technology promises to enhance trust in economic exchanges. Its applications are designed to provide a secure digital infrastructure to verify identity facilitate faster and cheaper crossborder payments and protect property rights.1 However these technologies may be rapidly creating new types of risks that are not well understood or covered by existing regulations.Against this background a careful consideration of the potential of FinTech is needed to boost banking and financial development in subSaharan Africa.2 It is necessary to balance the tradeoff between the potential benefits that FinTech generates and the added vulnerabilities that may be created. However given the low level of financial inclusion and competition in Africa and more limited macrofinancial linkages relative to other world regions regulators and central banks should seriously consider FinTech as an opportunity to fos1Pisa and Juden (2017) discuss in detail the potential role of blockchain technology in addressing development challenges.2In October 2018 the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank Group (2018) launched the Bali FinTech Agenda a set of 12 policy elements aimed at helping member countries harness the benefits and opportunities of rapid advances in financial technology that are transforming the provision of banking services while at the same time managing the inherent risks. The Agenda proposes a framework of highlevel issues that countries should consider in their own domestic policy discussions and aims to guide staff from the two institutions in their own work and dialogue with national authorities.2\\x0c Introductionter economic growth and development. The rest of the paper is organized as follows Chapter 2 discusses the trends and unique characteristics of FinTech in subSaharan Africa. Chapter 3 explains the opportunities and challenges that FinTech creates in subSaharan Africa. Chapter 4 concludes.3\\x0c\\x0cChAPTEr2FinTech in SubSaharan Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x94Where Does the region Stand?Financial intermediation and financial inclusion in subSaharan Africa remain low despite progress in recent years. Helped by reforms the depth and coverage of financial systems in subSaharan Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x94as measured by the standard indicators of financial development such as the ratios of private sector credit to GDP and broad money to GDP\\xe2\\x80\\x94have significantly improved over the period 1995 to 2013 (Kasekende 2010). However on average countries in subSaharan Africa continue to have a shallower financial system than those in other developing regions of the world (Figure\\xc2\\xa01). In terms of financial inclusion only 20\\xc2\\xa0percent of the population has a bank account compared to 92\\xc2\\xa0percent in advanced economies and 38\\xc2\\xa0percent in nonadvanced economies (Table\\xc2\\xa01). Underinvestment poor infrastructure and comparatively low levels of financial literacy have contributed to the region being underbanked.However mobile money has underpinned a radical change in the delivery of financial services in subSaharan Africa. As a result the region has become the global leader in mobile money innovation adoption and usage with close to 40 out of 45 subSaharan African countries actively using this new financial technology (FinTech).1 Within subSaharan Africa East Africa continues to lead in terms of adoption and usage rates. Whereas overall financial depth remains below other regions FinTech is emerging as an engine of growth and technological enabler that fosters financial inclusion and economic development.1Both the Middle East North Africa Afghanistan and Pakistan and Caucasus and Central Asia regions are also reporting progress in the adoption of FinTech.

In addition close to 20\\xc2\\xa0percent of GDP in transactions are occurring through mobile money compared with just 7\\xc2\\xa0percent of GDP in Asia and less than 2\\xc2\\xa0percent of GDP in other regions. Most transactions are used to send and receive domestic remittances. Increasingly transactions are also being used for domestic transfers such as paying utility bills receiving wages and payments for goods and services (Figure\\xc2\\xa03). Mobile money accounts have now overtaken traditional bank accounts in several subSaharan African economies. Based on data for 17 subSaharan African countries for which both mobile money and traditional bank account data is available there were nearly twice as many traditional deposit accounts as mobile money accounts in 2012. By 2015 mobile money accounts surpassed traditional deposit accounts in these 17 economies which include some of the largest in subSaharan Africa such as South Africa Kenya and Tanzania (Figure\\xc2\\xa04). 7\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErFigure 3.

The low number of branches and automatic teller machines (ATMs) in the region and the absence of internet connections makes it difficult to transfer remittances or pay bills. Therefore there is a large unfulfilled demand for payments services and the relatively large penetration of mobile devices in the region provides a technological platform that can be used by mobile money agents.3 In fact there are now more mobile money agents in subSaharan Africa than ATMs or bank accounts.4Within subSaharan Africa East Africa is the clear leader in mobile money adoption and usage. Despite the success of mobile money in subSaharan Africa there is a wide degree of crosscountry difference (see Figure\\xc2\\xa04). East Africa developed an infrastructure that uniquely built upon the latent demand for mobile financial services in subSaharan Africa \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 East African countries favored a telecomled regulatory model. In this framework the telecom provider works with the financial regulator to establish the infrastructure for mobile payments. The telecomled model has proved more successful in attracting users than the bankled model that other subSaharan Africa countries promoted. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 East African countries tended to have a single telecom provider with a large market share which provided an initial critical mass of users needed to push mobile money past the niche level. In Kenya Safaricom has a share of nearly 70\\xc2\\xa0percent of the market; in Tanzania Vodacom has a market share of close to half. Having a large market share allowed most mobile payment users to operate on a single platform without facing compatibility issues though this raises concentration and potential stability concerns. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 East African countries particularly in the East African Community have national identification systems. These systems facilitate faster mobile payment adoption rates and enable more secure transactions.Addressing the region\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infrastructure gap can lead to an even higher usage of mobile payment and other financial services. SubSaharan Africa lags behind the rest of the world not only in terms of access to electricity but also in terms of internet penetration and technological readiness (Table\\xc2\\xa02). For a sample of subSaharan African countries as of 2017 388\\xc2\\xa0million of the continent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 1.25\\xc2\\xa0billion are online with 160\\xc2\\xa0million holding Facebook accounts.

Agents usually earn commissions for performing this service and often provide frontline customer service such as teaching new users how to complete transactions on their phone.4Dupas et al. (2016) show that distance to banks acts as a barrier to access financial services.9\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErTable 2.

Therefore the margin of improvement for the continent is large and the potential impact of new technologies and infrastructure can set the path for much stronger and inclusive financial development in the region. In many instances telecoms benefit from high barriers to entry resulting in highly concentrated segments. Although size matters for some telecoms to manage liquidity and counterparty risk from a policy perspective it is critical to lower costs improve access and facilitate interoperability to foster competition. In this regard the proliferation of taxes on the telecoms sector in recent years\\xe2\\x80\\x94like customs duties on capital equipment and handsets diverse regulatory fees high corporate income tax and valueadded tax rates or telephone call excises\\xe2\\x80\\x94may distort product and output markets impeding efficiency affordability and growth.5FinTech Promotes Financial inclusion beyond the Payments ArenaA wellfunctioning payment system is indispensable to reduce the costs of exchanging goods and services in the economy. However promoting financial inclusion and development implies going beyond payments. There is broad demand in the region for many other financial services that are underdeveloped such as the provision of several types of credit services crossborder payments various forms of investment products and insurance services.FinTech providers are leveraging their experience and large customer base in payments services to provide other financial services.

Indeed more advanced types of FinTech centered on lending rather than payments are growing throughout subSaharan Africa. While microfinance has traditionally led the region as an alternate source of finance in recent years FinTech has facilitated the growth of several types of crowdfunding and peertopeer lending (Figure\\xc2\\xa05).

FinTech is not only helping improve financial inclusion in the region but it also serves as a catalyst for the emergence of innovations in other sectors such as agriculture and infrastructure which promotes economic growth and development. FinTech may also complement other nonfinancial technologies and foster innovation by the government setting the path for the development of a digital economy in the region (see Box\\xc2\\xa03).12\\x0cFinTech in SubSaharan Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x94Where Does the Region Stand?box 1. Why Kenya?MPesa (M for mobile pesa means money in Kiswahili) is a mobile phone\\xe2\\x80\\x93based money transfer system that was launched in 2007 by Safaricom and Vodacom the largest mobile network operators in Kenya and Tanzania who are owned by Vodafone. MPesa was jointly developed by the UK Department for International Development and Vodafone in the early 2000s. The service has been successful as it allows customers to deposit and withdraw money transfer money to other users or pay bills. The service quickly expanded to other countries in subSaharan Africa including Tanzania Lesotho Mozambique and Ghana and also Albania Romania and India. As of end2016 the service had almost 30\\xc2\\xa0million users worldwide of which 20.7\\xc2\\xa0million are in Kenya. Today Kenya is one of the economies with the highest use of mobile money at 53 transactions per adult per year (Figure\\xc2\\xa07). Figure 7.

An appropriate pricing strategy to attract customers and stores in tandem and the deployment of a reliable and trustful network are critical for success.3.  Safaricom had a good working relationship with the Central Bank of Kenya and was given regulatory space to design MPesa in a manner that fit its market; this provided sufficient prudential comfort to the central bank. A recent study by Suri and Jack (2016) underlined the role of MPesa to achieve inclusive growth in Kenya.13\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErbox 1. Why Kenya (continued)Going forward mobile money can accelerate the inclusion of users into the formal financial system by integrating mobile money and other financial services providers.

Digital innovation and Financial Services in SubSaharan AfricaThe words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAfrica\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinnovation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are not often found in the same sentence. But in fact much is happening in Africa. The reach of mobile networks and growth in subscriptions have made mobile technology the goto means by which digital content and services are created and consumed. Several subSaharan African countries have established hubs for tech startups and have generated new employment opportunities. These hubs provide the means for the industry to continue evolving not only in size but in variety of services offered.Innovation in the agricultural sector has huge potential in Africa. Digital financial services increase smallholder farmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to weather and market information and help decision making on when and which crops to plant and where to sell crops. The Tigo Kilimo SMSbased application launched in Tanzania in 2012 provides uptodate weather and agronomic information and the Connected Farmer program in East Africa sends uptodate market prices to farmers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 mobile phones allowing them to select the best markets and times at which to sell and receive digital payments and receipts.In fragile and conflictaffected states financial technology (FinTech) has played an instrumental role. In Sierra Leone the government turned to mobile wallets to help fight the Ebola virus outbreak. The United Nations finds that mobile payments to emergency workers dramatically shortened payment times and minimized fraud during the outbreak. In Liberia mobile payments to health and education workers who work in areas periodically cut off during the rainy season have helped maintain critical social services. FinTech is also increasingly being harnessed to improve tax collection thereby contributing to domestic revenue mobilization a key objective in many African countries.Payments innovation has also benefited the health sector. In Rwanda the government has partnered with a private company (Zipline) to use drones guided by mobile phone\\xe2\\x80\\x93based location services to quickly deliver lifesaving medical products to rural health clinics. Payment by mobile phone facilitates the business model.New technology also has the potential to help address Africa\\xe2\\x80\\x99s infrastructure deficit. MKopa Solar in Kenya (Kopa means borrow in Kiswahili) sells solar home systems on a payment plan with an initial deposit followed by daily payments up to one year. After completing payments customers own the product outright. MKopa aims at solving two problems simultaneously it seeks to accelerate rural electrification a big challenge in sparsely populated African countries and to provide consumer credit to rural households who would have found it difficult to qualify for a loan from a traditional bank.17\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErbox 3. Digital innovation and Financial Services in SubSaharan Africa (continued)Blockchain technologies can potentially be applied to many other environments beyond virtual currencies. Bitland is a new platform in Ghana that seeks to solve the endemic problem of land registration (as much as 90\\xc2\\xa0percent of agricultural land is reportedly undocumented). Bitland creates a record for every piece of land that is stored on a blockchain and thereby renders them less susceptible to forgery or tampering. In principle outofcourt settlements of land disputes should be quicker and easier with the use of blockchain technology.18\\x0cChAPTEr3FinTechled Transformations and implicationsAs the financial technology (FinTech) space is developing innovators are seeking to enhance elements along the financial services value chain well beyond mobile money. Startups established players and central banks are in a process of discovery to design test and redesign new products services and regulation. Underpinning this process is the coalescence of new technologies. The largest impact will occur in the financial sector with important implications for broader growth. This chapter seeks to provide a guide to considering the channels through which the future financial development of FinTech in subSaharan Africa could occur and the policy implications in terms of the tradeoffs FinTech could create.FinTech represents a disruptive competitive force that will have a major role in shaping the structure of the financial industry. FinTech primarily affects market structure by bringing new technologies that (1) reduce the costs of financial services (2) create market access opportunities for new entrants (nonbanks) (3) broaden access to new segments of the market and customers and (4) affect the competitiveness of existing incumbents. These changes may potentially create large efficiency gains in an industry that has not experienced major technological and market structure changes in the last decades.The technological foundations for these new products and services are well developed. The products and services being created in the field of FinTech draw on global technological innovations. Broadly these include the following (see He et al. 2017) \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Mobile access and the internet connect consumers to firms and to each other (persontoperson transactions). \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Big data and artificial intelligence comprise the availability and analysis of databases that have billions of observations of transactions and char19\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGEracteristics which can be used to help design and tailor financial products and services. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Distributed ledger technology (DLT) refers to a type of networking of independent computers to record share and synchronize transactions rather than have a centralized database.1 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Cryptography allows for robust security systems that enable electronic transactions to be carried out safely and is the basis for smart contracts and cryptocurrencies.The application of these new technologies in subSaharan Africa offers transformational potential. Although it is difficult to provide a comprehensive set of changes that could occur these new technologies can help to reduce existing market inefficiencies. Together these technological developments provide avenues to reduce information costs increase transparency as well as enable greater trust and enforcement of contracts (Box\\xc2\\xa04).2 The new technologies will also bring a range of risks that will need to be mitigated.Possible Transformations Financial inclusion and DeepeningFinTech can have a significant impact on financial inclusion and deepening by improving the level of efficiency of the industry. SubSaharan Africa has lower levels of financial inclusion and depth compared to other emerging market and developing economies. This provides space for significant growth opportunities in the sector as there is a large proportion of the population that does not have access to financial services. FinTech offers opportunities to new entrepreneurs and incumbents in the financial sector that can leverage innovative and less costly business models to serve this large uncovered segment of the market. In particular the relatively large penetration of mobile phones (81 mobile phones per 100 inhabitants) gives new entrants a unique opportunity to reach these new customers with mobilebased financial services.Access to credit could also be extended through technologies that overcome information barriers. The cost of credit risk assessment remains high in subSaharan Africa. Challenges for banks stem from unreliable accounting and financial information a lack of credit bureaus and limitations in legal institutions. Small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) cite access to finance as their main challenge which has also gender equality implications 1A distributed ledger is a distributed database where each node has a synchronized copy of the data allowing also for (1) decentralization (control of the database is done by all network participants) (2) reliable trustless environments and (3) cryptographic encryption. See more at Benos Garratt and GurrolaPerez (2017).2See also Figure\\xc2\\xa04 from the He et al. (2017) which provides a mapping of the major technologies and how they impact financial services.20\\x0cFinTechled Transformations and ImplicationsSubSaharan AfricaOther non advanced economiesTable 3.

Big data and machine learning for instance has the potential to reduce the cost of credit risk assessments particularly in countries that do not have an established credit registry. This can be achieved by using a broader range of information such as mobile phone usage data and payments data which is available in higher volume and new statistical tools to process this larger volume of information to better understand and measure the nature of credit risks. Such alternative information for credit risk assessments possibly at a lower cost in subSaharan Africa could attract new entrants into the provision of credit including (nondeposittaking) FinTech firms (peertopeer and other crowdfunding platforms). This will have implications for competition and the use of personal information by thirdparty players and carry legal and regulatory risks.FinTech can change the financial industry in subSaharan Africa by increasing competition and efficiency. Bank competition in Africa is low compared to other regions of the world (Table\\xc2\\xa03 and Figure\\xc2\\xa08). Bazot (2018) and Philippon (2016) argue that the current financial system has historically been inefficient. Moreover banks in subSaharan Africa are typically less efficient than banks in other world regions and therefore financial services are more expensive. This inefficiency is driven in part by higher operational costs (Beck and Cull 2014). Lower competition in these countries may be the result of high entry barriers due to the existence of a negative business climate or the regulatory barriers. New FinTech entrants may face lower entry barriers as they may require a smaller scale of operation to be profitable. Broader financial development in subSaharan Africa could be pushed forward at an accelerated pace. There is a need to develop financial markets in subSaharan Africa beyond retail payments; the banking sector and financial market infrastructure as capital markets insurance companies pension funds and other financial institutions and instruments remain limited. The level of financial literacy remains relatively low in subSaharan Africa. Efforts are underway in the region to use FinTech for users to pay insurance premiums (Lesotho) receive pension payments (Ghana) and purchase government 21\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErFigure 8.

FinTech tools can also help support financial literacy programs (electronic wallet education at the primary school and higher levels).Possible Transformations Crossborder and Domestic PaymentsA potential widespread application of FinTech could be to significantly lower the cost of crossborder transfers. The cost of sending remittances to subSaharan Africa is the highest globally (see Ratha et al. 2018) in part because of the oligopolistic nature of the banking industry in subSaharan Africa low regional and financial integration and the existence of multiple currencies and inefficient payment systems for intraAfrican crossborder payments. FinTech has the potential to reduce transaction costs with positive effects on the volume of remittances and regional integration. DLTs are being considered to facilitate value transfer exchanges between parties without the need for crossborder intermediation. Network technologies could have the potential to bypass the complex web of intermediaries present in these crossborder payments (multiple correspondent banks or infrastructures such as continuous linked settlement [CLS]).34 Intermediaries can also use such technologies.53For instance international payments using cryptocurrencies can be securely received in minutes and can be rapidly settled in the domestic currency. DLT systems such as Ripple can be used to efficiently process foreign payments and can be supported by international banks and payment companies.4CLS is a global clearing and settlement system for crossborder foreign exchange transactions. The system is operated by CLS Bank International which is owned by over 70 global banking and financial institutions.\\xc2\\xa0It enables foreign exchange transactions involving the CLS eligible currencies to be settled through the CLS System on a\\xc2\\xa0paymentversuspayment\\xc2\\xa0basis thus eliminating the settlement risk in these transactions.5For instance CLS has started using a DLT platform.\\xc2\\xa022\\x0cFinTechled Transformations and ImplicationsPressures on correspondent banking relationships could also be partly remedied by new technologies. Crossborder flows including those related to trade and remittances are being challenged in many countries by the loss of correspondent banking relations. The current correspondent banking relations model is also expensive as correspondent banks often need to maintain liquidity (prefunding) at correspondent banks and enter in credit relationships with them (overdrafts). In addition there has been an increase in compliance costs including in relation to sanctions regimes and antimoney laundering and combating the financing of terrorism (AML/CFT). Such a model can also entail long payment chains particularly in the context of nested relationships. These ongoing pressures on correspondent banking relationships have mostly affected transactions denominated in US dollars. In some instances FinTech solutions could offer cost savings and secure solutions (for example certain regulationfocused technologies) that facilitate customer due diligence measures and information sharing for the purpose of correspondent banking relationships. Other emerging FinTech solutions (for example blockchain technology) could provide a more efficient alternative to the traditional correspondent banking model. Provided the new systems can still satisfy the international AML/CFT standards this could be a substantial boost to lowincome countries that receive significant remittances from overseas.DLT could enhance efficiency of certain types of payment systems in subSaharan Africa. With DLT all operations are jointly kept by all members of the network and all processes involving ordering settlement and payments are implemented in real time. Currently in payment systems across subSaharan Africa settlement processes that are not operated in realtime (non\\xe2\\x80\\x93realtime gross settlement systems) may involve several days to be fully executed thus increasing operational costs and creating operational and counterparty risk. DLT could speed up the settlement of transactions with a decentralized and automated settlement process thus reducing backoffice costs. However it should be noted that use of DLT for wholesale payments brings its own specific set of operational risks and some limitation on scalability. Some central banks in subSaharan Africa are actively experimenting with DLTbased payment systems. For example the South African Reserve Bank initiated a proof of concept that simulated a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crealworld\\xe2\\x80\\x9d trial of a DLTbased wholesale payment system using a tokenized South African rand (Box\\xc2\\xa05).Possible Transformations Fiscal and monetary SectorsSome of the innovations in finance could be applied to the fiscal sector to improve the efficiency of the interaction between the state and citizens. A 23\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErlongstanding challenge in many subSaharan African countries is the efficient collection of taxes and delivery of public services and social spending. For example estimates suggest that digitalizing government payments could create value of roughly 1\\xc2\\xa0percent of GDP for most countries (Gupta et al. 2017). If well implemented there are potential gains in tax administration and compliance targeting of social programs and public financial management more broadly using existing data on transactions and combining it with personal information. Public procurement could also benefit from the use of smart contracts that are designed to facilitate verify or enforce contract negotiations or performance. As with existing fiscal operations effective systems would need measures to protect privacy and minimize generating new methods for fraud and evasion. Moreover the use of DLT could offer tools to help promote transparency and reduce corruption.If adopted widely digital currencies could have profound implications for the monetary sector. It has been argued that some digital currencies and other forms of digital money could potentially replace traditional currencies. The economic literature has widely cited the three economic functions of money (1) medium of exchange (2) unit of account and (3) store of value. Digital currencies issued by the private sector differ along many dimensions and at the moment struggle to fully satisfy the functions of money in part because of erratic valuations. In addition they pose considerable risks as potential vehicles for money laundering terrorism financing tax evasion fraud and other financial crimes. Unlike private sector issuance of a digital currency state issuance would satisfy the three functions of money and could further support public policy goals such as financial inclusion security and consumer protection and ensuring a degree of privacy in payments (ManciniGriffoli et al. 2018). Even then there are potential downsides of a digital currency including risks to financial integrity and stability that should be considered as well as concerns from central banks regarding the implications of the broader adoption of digital currencies6 and how this could affect the implementation of monetary policy (Heller 2017a 2017b; Box\\xc2\\xa06).76The Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and the Markets Committee recently completed work on central bank digital currencies analyzing their potential implications for payment systems monetary policy implementation and transmission as well as for the structure and stability of the financial system. The report underlines that wholesale central bank digital currencies combined with the use of DLT may enhance settlement efficiency for transactions involving securities and derivatives but central banks should carefully monitor digital innovations (Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures 2014 2016; Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructures and Markets Committee 2018).7The use of emoney could also affect the production design and distribution of currency which is today a traditional area of responsibility for central banks.24\\x0cFinTechled Transformations and ImplicationsThe need for investing in hard and Soft infrastructureFinTech and associated innovations can have macroeconomic gains for subSaharan African countries and make growth more inclusive. Increased and more efficient financial intermediation can have a positive impact on growth (see the finance and growth literature pioneered by Levine [2005]) especially if access to credit by SMEs increases. In addition in economies dominated by the informal sector new technologies can increase the incentives to formalize (for instance electronic payment of taxes in exchange for being included in a pension system).Investment in hard and soft infrastructure is needed to enable FinTech to develop and serve a rapidly growing digital generation. Hard infrastructure refers to the need for investment in internet connections and energy to enable firms to gain from the technological improvements. Soft infrastructure relates to the need for regulation to support a favorable business environment and investment in skills.Allocating resources to these investments will require policymakers in subSaharan Africa to address several tradeoffs. Estimates for investment in hard infrastructure are already large and pressing whereas rising levels of public indebtedness limits the scope of public financing. Filling the large existing hard infrastructure gap in the region will require considering how to work with the private sector to provide financing or delivery of services for the adequate provision of electricity and internet services.Investment in soft infrastructure needs to address the perennial race between fastmoving innovation and the slower pace of regulation. There is a tradeoff between catalyzing or at least supporting rapid innovation which has large potential gains to the economy and taking the time to identify and manage its associated risks through regulation and supervision to ensure financial stability and integrity (Box\\xc2\\xa07). Given the central importance of financial regulation in supporting the growth of the FinTech sector the following chapter gives deeper consideration to these factors.Soft infrastructure rethinking Financial Sector regulationA variety of FinTech developments especially related to the regulatory and supervisory sector (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegTech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSupTech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d respectively) can potentially strengthen financial stability by increasing diversification and transparency as well as enabling better assessment of risks by all players in the financial sector (Box\\xc2\\xa08).25\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErTable 4.

Propagation to the rest of the financial sector through unforeseen channels.Exacerbation of systemwide macrofinancial risks such as contagion procyclicality or excess volatility which can amplify shocks to the financial system.Source Financial Stability Board (2017).At the same time potential gains from the emergence of FinTech carry risks and introduce new vulnerabilities. Safety and soundness considerations are a concern as the financial sector is prone to crises panics or runs (Table\\xc2\\xa04 and Box\\xc2\\xa09). Market failures such as externalities and asymmetric information exacerbate the effects of these financial shocks which may propagate to the rest of the financial system and the entire economy as well as create perverse feedback loops with the financial system. FinTech can exacerbate some of the wellknown existing vulnerabilities or create new weaknesses that were not previously present in the financial system (see Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 2017). Among the 10 areas of risk identified by the Financial Stability Board 3 are priorities for international collaboration with relevance in subSaharan Africa (1) the need to manage operational risk from thirdparty service providers (2) mitigating cyberrisks and (3) monitoring macrofinancial risks that could emerge as FinTech activities increase.8Some steps are being taken in subSaharan Africa to start addressing these risks. For instance the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) issued information and telecommunications technology risk management guidelines to the banking sector in 2012 followed by a cybersecurity guidance note to the banking sector in 2017. The CBK has subsequently extended the coverage of cybersecurity guidelines to payment service providers through its 2018 draft guidelines. In addition to guidance on cyberrisks issues the CBK has emphasized supervision collaboration with national agencies and information security in its strategy to mitigate cyberrisk. For instance bank supervision includes vulnerability assessments to assess the quality of cyberrisk management onsite examinations of the financial institution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s information and communication technology systems and the incorporation of information technology auditors in onsite inspections (CBK 2017 2018).8FinTech activities may be considered as part of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cshadow banking\\xe2\\x80\\x9d sector that is financial intermediaries that provide services similar to traditional commercial banks but outside banking regulations. As the 2007\\xe2\\x80\\x9308 financial crisis demonstrated the lack of appropriate regulation in the shadow banking sector and their vulnerable business model led to rapid contagion to the rest of the financial system.26\\x0cFinTechled Transformations and ImplicationsThe nature of the tradeoff between safetyefficiency in regulation of FinTech is evolving (see Box\\xc2\\xa09). The efficiencysafety tradeoff is conceptually very similar to comparable tradeoffs that have already been considered by policymakers in the banking industry (Keeley 1990) or the payments industry (Berger Hancock and Marquardt 1996). One of the differences with FinTech is the nascent nature of these technologies which makes it more difficult for regulators and policymakers to determine with reasonable certainty and accuracy the benefits in terms of economic efficiency and the additional vulnerabilities side effects and risks that these technologies can bring to society. Moreover \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinflated expectations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d about FinTech that are part of what has been called the \\xe2\\x80\\x9chype cycle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Gartner 2017) increase the difficulties for regulators to provide a fair assessment of these tradeoffs. Continued research is needed to remain up to date with the potential benefits and costs involved in these technologies.Due to its pioneering efforts in mainstreaming mobile money subSaharan Africa became an early leader in regulatory innovation. SubSaharan African countries with large FinTech operations can use their central bank to license and regulate mobile network operators. For instance in the Kenyan National Payment System Regulations \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmobile payment service providers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are telecommunications service providers licensed under the Kenya Information and Communications Act and authorized by the CBK to offer payment services. The common feature of these regulatory frameworks is that a mobile money network operator maintains liquid assets equal to the amount of money issued electronically. The funds are usually pooled and held by a bank in the name of the mobile network operator. This arrangement ensures a customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s money will be available on demand. Mobile network operators do not typically need to meet minimum capital requirements. Due to the relatively small value of individual transactions mobile network operators can limit money laundering and terrorist financing risks by capping the number of accounts an individual can hold and by limiting the total value of transactions over a given period although additional measures are also needed.The rapid growth and evolution of FinTech created gaps for regulators to address. The rise of FinTech has the potential to create vulnerabilities in the financial system through several channels. First FinTech should increase competition in the financial system which could reduce existing financial institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 solvency by reducing their earnings and promote higher risk taking (Keeley 1990). Second if FinTech firms provide financial services thereby acting de facto as new banks supervisors may decide to set asymmetric regulations on capital or liquidity which could generate incentives for regulatory arbitrage and risk shifting. Third many of these new players may enter in the market with relevant experience from other industries (for example retail or telecoms) but much lower experience and expertise in the 27\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErfinancial industry. This can have negative consequences for the financial system too. All these channels can be an important source of risk such as credit risk operational risk liquidity risk money laundering/financing of terrorism risk and other types of risks.FinTech also raises concerns regarding the emergence of new risks related to money laundering and financing of terrorism. Country authorities typically use licensing/market entry controls and preventive measures\\xe2\\x80\\x94including customer due diligence\\xe2\\x80\\x94transaction monitoring record keeping and obligations to report suspicious transactions to assist in deterring and detecting money laundering and terrorism financing. Recent technologies such as virtual assets and related financial services have the potential to spur financial innovation and present some AML/CFT solutions but they also create new opportunities for criminals and terrorists to launder their proceeds or finance their illicit activities (see the Financial Action Task Force (2015 and 2018). Some innovation may favor anonymity of users and promote a lack of transparency in the financial system. In addition crossborder payments may become faster cheaper and more efficient which can also help promote financial flows between international crime networks. All these factors are a cause of concern regarding money laundering and financing of terrorism cyberrisks and other associated risks.Financial regulation plays a role in the emergence of FinTech. When considering new FinTech entrepreneurs that provide financial intermediation services bank supervisors will need to consider how these new players are going to be placed vis\\xc3\\xa0vis the financial regulatory toolkit. A first consideration that regulators may need to consider is whether FinTech companies should be regulated like traditional banks or whether it would be optimal to set differential regulations based on proportional application of specific requirements for FinTech companies. For example there are several regulations that increase the cost of operation of banks but are intended to control risks and increase the safety and soundness of banks. These include requiring capital and liquidity buffers which would create an opportunity cost for new entrants and impact their profitability. There are several tools that are intended to increase the safety and soundness of the financial system when banks are in a situation of stress such as the use of lender of last resort facilities or the existence of implicit guarantees and deposit insurance schemes. Issues related to the supervision and monitoring of cybersecurity and other related operational risks or AML/CTF issues are especially relevant. Regulators could also facilitate interagency cooperation to clarify the conduct of existing supervision.To understand risk without hindering innovation some jurisdictions are adopting flexible regulatory approaches such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregulatory sandboxes.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d A 28\\x0cFinTechled Transformations and Implicationsregulatory sandbox is a closed testing environment designed for developing regulatory frameworks for emerging business models such as FinTech. Annex\\xc2\\xa02 provides a description of one of the first regulations specifically designed for FinTech providers set in March 2017 by the Ministry of Finance in Mexico and the case of a new regulatory sandbox created in Mauritius in October 2016.29\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErbox 4.

Project Khokha A Distributed Ledger Technology\\xe2\\x80\\x93based Whole Payment SystemsProject Khokha\\xe2\\x80\\x94initiated by the South African Reserve Bank (SARB)\\xe2\\x80\\x94is a proof of concept that simulated a \\xe2\\x80\\x9crealworld\\xe2\\x80\\x9d trial of a distributed ledger technology (DLT)based wholesale payment system using a tokenized South African rand. Project Khokha built on previous global initiatives on DLTbased payments systems such as the Bank of Canada\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Project Jasper and other initiatives in Brazil Europe Japan and Singapore (see Annex\\xc2\\xa01). The SARB (2018) notes that the project provided the opportunity to broaden the DLT skills base in the South African banking industry and laid the foundations for future collaborative work\\xe2\\x80\\x94essential in the blockchain context. The results of Project Khokha show that \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The typical daily volume of the South African payments system could be processed in less than two hours with full confidentiality of transactions and settlement finality. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Transactions were processed within two seconds across a network of geographically distributed nodes with distributed consensus providing the requisite resilience. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 The SARB was able to view the detail of all the transactions to allow for regulatory oversight. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 There are many issues to consider before the decision to take a DLTbased system into production can be made including those related to the practicalities of implementation legal and regulatory factors and the broader economic impact.DLT can also enhance security and transparency in the payment system while lowering trading costs. DLT significantly enhances the traceability and reliability of information stored in the ledger. As blockchains are difficult to hack DLT could be robust against cyberattacks. DLT can also help mobilize a large volume of data and information to better assess credit risk thus contributing to financial stability. Several central banks are analyzing the use of these technologies to replace existing realtime gross settlement systems. In 2016 Payments Canada along with the bank of Canada R3 and commercial banks started an experiment project codenamed Project Jasper to explore a DLTbased wholesale payment system.31\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErbox 6. monetary Policy implementation and mobile moneyThe remarkable penetration of mobile money services in the subSaharan Africa region and the potential of this technology to evolve into a widely used transaction medium is raising concerns about its effects on monetary policy implementation. Several central banks in subSaharan Africa adhere to conventional reserve money programs to target inflation through monetary targets. In these countries targeting reserve money anchors inflation if the growth rates of the money multiplier and the velocity of circulation are constant (or at least predictable).It is not clear yet how mobile money can affect the money multiplier and the velocity of money. In principle any mobile money balances are fully backed by money deposited by the mobile money service provider in a bank so no new money is created. Banks can use these additional funds to increase their lending which does create new money but this is no different from the way in which banks use deposits (Adam and Walker 2015). Mobile money services can also help the unbanked population to have access to other financial services leading to a greater level of financial inclusion with positive effects on the money multiplier.Weil Mbiti and Mwega (2012) assessed the impact of MPesa on the behavior of monetary aggregates in East Africa concluding that the monetary policy implications of mobile money have so far been negligible in Kenya Tanzania and Uganda. Weil Mbiti and Mwega (2012) show that the velocity of MPesa rises over time which indicates that users are more inclined to use the system as a transaction vehicle. Nonetheless Weil Mbiti and Mwega (2012) suggest that developments and innovations in this space could fuel the growth of mobile money such that it reaches levels where it could have implications for monetary policy. This study was extended by Ndirangu and Nyamongo (2015) who concluded that mobile money has not affected the conduct of monetary policy in Kenya as the (fast) pace of financial development in the country has not caused structural shifts in the longterm money demand relation. Also Macha (2013) found an association between the instability of money demand in Tanzania after the introduction of mobile money with implications for the velocity of money. Aron Muellbauer and Sebudde (2015) found only tentative evidence that mobile money in Uganda may exert some downward pressure on inflation.Using a dynamic stochastic general equilibrium model Adam and Walker (2015) analyzed whether mobile money has changed the monetary policy environment for the major economies of East Africa. Although mobile money poses challenges to the conventional money targeting approaches used by several central banks across the region these authors found that the impact of mobile money is likely to be positive and enhance the efficacy of monetary policy implementation. Focusing on the growth of mobile money transactions and balances and its implications for inflation forecasting models in Uganda Aron Muellbauer and Sebudde (2015) found no significant effect.32\\x0cFinTechled Transformations and Implicationsbox 7. emoney Floats and Financial StabilityMobile cellular subscriptions in subSaharan Africa continue to grow faster than any other region in the world. At the start of 2017 there were more than 420\\xc2\\xa0million unique mobile subscribers in subSaharan Africa equivalent to a penetration rate of 43\\xc2\\xa0percent (GSMA Intelligence 2017). The high usage of mobile money and its rapid growth requires an effective oversight framework to safeguard public confidence and financial stability.Five key risks and oversight issues arising from mobile payments have been identified (Khiaonarong 2014). They include the legal regime financial integrity fund safeguarding operational resiliency and risk controls in the payment system. A key element of the oversight framework in mobile money is management of the float that refers to the balance of emoney physical cash or money in a bank account that a mobile agent can immediately access to meet customer demands to purchase or sell electronic money. Management of the float has implications for financial stability. Based on country experiences the key safeguarding measures could include the following1.  Usage restrictions Restricting customer funds for money transfers and prohibiting use for other purposes such as extending credit or covering operating expenses of the nonbank entity. Introducing liquidity requirements for nonbank mobile payment schemes which should include limiting the liquid asset categories to be held that are equivalent to the total value of customer funds collected.2.  Protection requirements Insulating customer funds against the claims of other creditors of the nonbank in the event of its insolvency. Introducing insurance or comparable guarantees of electronic values for nonbank mobile payment schemes. Adopting mechanisms to guarantee traceability of customer funds in the event of mass conversion of electronic values to cash or potential nonbank failure.3.  Float management A segregated trust account held by a third party with a licensed and prudentially regulated bank. Maintaining multiple accounts at different banks to diversify risks. Holding of other forms of safe assets such as government securities.Most financial technology (FinTech) companies use their own balance sheet for the provision of credit or other services implying a relatively minor impact of FinTech on financial contagion through the credit or liquidity channel. However many FinTech companies have begun to rely increasingly on funding from banks or other financial institutions with implications for interconnectedness risks and financial stability.Customer funds held by nonbanks may be at risk if unprotected. Financial authorities should consider adopting fund safeguarding measures. In subSaharan Africa mobile operators cannot reinvest floats; in some other jurisdictions (Hong Kong SAR China) 33\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErbox 7. emoney Floats and Financial Stability (continued)floats are managed by segregation from the storedvalue facilities issuer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own funds. By not allowing further investment of floats regulatory authorities in subSaharan Africa have chosen to endure the safety and integrity of mobile payment systems enhancing financial sector stability.34\\x0cFinTechled Transformations and Implicationsbox 8. regulatory and Supervisory Technologies in SubSaharan AfricaAfrican countries have developed or are exploring solutions in the areas of regulatory technology and supervisory technology.The National Bank of Rwanda uses an electronic data warehouse to automate and streamline the reporting processes for the supervision of more than 600 financial institutions including banks microfinance institutions and savings and credit cooperative organizations. Data can be automatically pulled every 24 hours or even every 15 minutes in the case of mobile money and money transfer operators (Broeders and Prenio 2018 Box\\xc2\\xa01).The Central Bank of Nigeria and the Nigeria InterBank Settlement System are developing a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdata stack\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that would include a data warehouse and dashboards and allow riskbased and timely financial supervision and inform new strategies such as financial inclusion policies and regulatory interventions (di Castri Grasser and Kulenkampff 2018).35\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErBox 9. The SafetyEfficiency FrontierA wellknown tradeoff between safety and efficiency has often been considered for the financial sector. This tradeoff which has been applied to the banking industry (Keeley 1990) or the payments industry (Berger Hancock and Marquardt 1996; Chapman et al. 2015) can be simply illustrated by a safetyefficiency frontier possibilities curve. The safetyefficiency frontier and the set of points inside the frontier summarizes the possible set of market structures that may attain various levels of safety and efficiency levels subject to current regulatory and technological constraints. More specifically along the frontier technical efficiency is achieved because a certain market structure cannot achieve more safety without compromising efficiency and vice versa. Points inside this frontier represent technical inefficiency because there exists an alternative market/technological configuration that could achieve more safety efficiency or both. Points above and to the right of the frontier represent market and technological structures that are unattainable given current constraints. Over time regulatory changes and technological progress create movements of the frontier making some of these points technically feasible.This simple framework can be used to analyze the impact of financial technology (FinTech) in broader terms by considering the social impact of these technological innovations. We would expect that FinTech expands the possibilities frontier in terms of efficiency and safety as FinTech providers expand in the value chain. Recent technologies can increase allocative efficiencies by reducing the cost of providing financial services increasing competition and adding new services. Also these innovative technologies can be useful to better monitor risks reduce operational failures or provide a solution to emerging vulnerabilities such as cyberattacks and antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing. For instance the blockchain technology is essentially a distributed network database that reduces transaction errors increases transparency and accountability and is more flexible than traditional technologies used in clearing payment and settlement systems (see International Finance Corporation 2017).Because FinTech expands the universe of existing opportunities and possibilities in the financial industry the set of alternatives made available by FinTech are greater than before. One of the main challenges for public authorities is to avoid suboptimal market situations that FinTech could create in the economy. For instance in Figure\\xc2\\xa09 we show a market structure in point 1 with a certain balance between safety and efficiency. As technological progress moves the frontier point 2 would be better off in terms of safety and efficiency. Point 2 represents a market allocation that uses stateoftheart FinTech to arrive to a point where the cost of providing financial services is smaller there is more competition and the financial system has a lower level of vulnerabilities. Suboptimal public policies and regulations could move the allocation to suboptimal point 3 which is a situation that improves point 1 in terms of efficiency but not in safety.36\\x0cFinTechled Transformations and ImplicationsBox 9. The SafetyEfficiency Frontier (continued)Figure 9. An EfficiencySafety TradeOffNew allocation improving inefficiency suboptimal in safetyycnecfifEi34Even worse allocation1New firstbest allocation improvingin safety and efficiency2Source Authors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 calculations.SafetyThe entry of nonbanks in the financial services industry provides a good example. There could be \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexcessive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d market entry by nonbanks (for example mobile operators) that significantly increases competition and efficiency in the market but also adds fragility to the financial system. These new players can use their mobile platforms to provide traditional and new bankrelated financial services at a lower cost than traditional brickandmortar providers. However their use of innovative technologies (for example blockchain mobile money platforms crowdfunding) can create new vulnerabilities such as cyberrisks or other operational risks. Also these players may not have adequate regulatory capital levels or have access to central bank lending which makes them potentially more vulnerable to external shocks. For instance in subSaharan Africa some mobile money providers have started to provide financial services beyond payments such as savings accounts and microcredits. These providers may not have access to deposit insurance have limited or no capital and no access to emergency lending by the central bank. During a crisis of confidence in the financial system these operators could be exposed to potential deposit runs or to a shortage of other forms of funding which could lead to failures and contagion to the entire financial system.37\\x0c\\x0cChAPTEr4ConclusionsThere is much uncertainty around the ultimate impact of financial technology (FinTech) and policymakers in subSaharan Africa as in other regions of the world. At times the speed of adoption of technology will even be faster in the region as in the case of the rapid growth of mobile payments. Efficiency considerations include choices regarding competition and coordination (as in the case of whether to push for interoperability) the likely impact on business models and profitability and cost and inclusion issues. They will also have to manage risks to stability and security (including cyberrisk) and to financial integrity and consider the possible impact on monetary policy implementation and transmission as well as financial stability issues. Cybersecurity is of concern as it is an emerging global risk (International Telecommunication Union 2017).Policymakers in subSaharan Africa will need to address several tradeoffs to reap the potential benefits of FinTech. By 2035 more than half of those entering the global labor market will be in subSaharan Africa. Technological innovation and infrastructure development can play key roles in allowing the continent to transform its demographic dividend into jobs growth and rising living standards for all.First policymakers will need to fill the large existing hard infrastructure gap in the region choose the appropriate mix of energy sources to generate electricity and improve the governance of public utilities to ensure an adequate provision of electricity and internet services. However to do so they will need to complement their scarce public resources with domestic and foreign private financing as well as concessional resources. In turn policymakers will need to mitigate the risks associated with investing in infrastructure projects in their countries (Gutman Sy and Chattopadhyay 2015).39\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErEstimates of the infrastructure gap in subSaharan Africa need to be updated. Indeed the oftquoted figure of $93\\xc2\\xa0billion necessary to fill the region\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gap dates to 2009 (Foster and BricenoGarmendia 2010). Even at $93\\xc2\\xa0billion there are limits to the use of public financing to address the infrastructure gap given the level of government indebtedness and low domestic revenue mobilization in the region. Policymakers in the region will need to mobilize the financing needed to invest in electricity generation transmission and distribution as well as in the critical internet infrastructure and the hardware and software systems infrastructure necessary to provide internet services such as fiberoptic links.Second policymakers in the region will also need to address the perennial race between fastmoving innovation and the slow pace of regulation. There is a tradeoff between catalyzing or at least supporting rapid innovation which has large potential gains to the economy and taking the time to identify and manage its associated risks through regulation and supervision to ensure financial stability and integrity. The FinTech sector is evolving rapidly in subSaharan Africa and it is challenging for regulators to identify measure and manage the associated risks. However regulators should be flexible enough not to stifle innovation but at the same time ensure that their objective to maintain macroeconomic and financial stability and financial integrity is not compromised. Since subSaharan Africa is dominated by small value payments proportionality\\xe2\\x80\\x94the balancing of risks and benefits against costs of\\xc2\\xa0regulation\\xc2\\xa0and supervision\\xe2\\x80\\x94is important and regulators can focus on specific challenges such as price and financial stability consumer protection from fraud cyberrisk and on increasing financial literacy. In antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing efforts to ensure appropriate identification are needed. Regulatory sandboxes are used by many countries and could be a useful approach to follow while noting that they must be tailored to different objectives legal structures and levels of financial development.Third policymakers will need to think beyond the potential benefits of FinTech on the financial sector to assess FinTech\\xe2\\x80\\x99s impact on employment and productivity the digital economy and more broadly muchneeded structural transformation of their economies. To reap innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s potential benefits policymakers will need to elaborate policies that can help leverage human capital such as improving financial and digital inclusion and ensuring the adequate provision of financing to new sectors. Policymakers will need to consider the larger picture as FinTech is only a means to the end of sustainable and inclusive growth. For instance appropriate education policies should include financial literacy and skills upgrading if a sustainable digital economy with activities such as ecommerce is to be encouraged. Policymakers will need a forwardlooking approach to identify the type of future jobs that will be needed in a digital economy and provide the relevant skills and education. 40\\x0cConclusionsSimilarly they will need to assess how competition in different sectors will affect the landscape of a future eeconomy (see Tirole 2017). More broadly such policy questions should be in the context of the strategy that countries in subSaharan Africa are elaborating to transform the structure of their economies to benefit from innovation.41\\x0c\\x0cAnnex 1. Project Jasper A Distributed Ledger Technology\\xe2\\x80\\x93based Whole Payment SystemProject Jasper built a proofofconcept system that leveraged a settlement asset issued and controlled by a central bank. The project started by allowing participants to build a settlement capability on a special platform (Ethereum) to demonstrate the ability to exchange a settlement asset between participants. Jasper incorporates a liquiditysaving mechanism that allows participants to coordinate their payments to reduce liquidity needs. Key features of Jasper include the following (see Chapman et al. 2017) \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Value transfer. A financial market infrastructure was made available through a digital representation of currency known as digital depository receipt (DDR) to represent Bank of Canada deposits. DDRs are issued in the system by the Bank of Canada and are backed one for one by cash pledged to the bank by participants. As DDRs are exchanged for central bank money there is no increase in money circulating in the banking system. DDRs are then used by participants in the system to exchange and settle interbank payments. Ultimate settlement finality on the books of the Bank of Canada is achieved after exchanging DDRs with the Bank of Canada for Canadian dollars transferred into their respective settlement accounts. For all intents and purposes these DDRs functioned as cash in the system. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Efficiency. Interbank payments were settled using systems that conduct endofday netting between participants. However as volumes and values increased in these systems central banks became concerned about the risks inherent in netting. Central banks have responded by implementing realtime gross settlement (RTGS) systems where payments are processed individually immediately and with finality throughout the day. Phase 1 of Project Jasper was implemented as a pure RTGS system with every individual payment on the ledger being prefunded by DDRs in the participant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wallet. RTGS systems eliminate settlement risk at 43\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGErthe cost of an increased need for liquidity. To make RTGS systems less liquiditydemanding operators around the world have implemented liquiditysaving mechanisms. The most effective liquiditysaving mechanisms are those that support settlement by periodically matching offsetting payments that have been submitted to a central payments queue and settling only the net obligations. However offsetting algorithms cause delay in settlement which is unacceptable for some types of payment. Phase 2 of Project Jasper explored the possibility of giving banks the choice of entering payments for immediate settlement or into a queue for netting and deferred settlement.44\\x0cAnnex 2. Financial Technology and Legal Frameworks The Cases of mexico and mauritiusA regulatory framework could provide the legal certainty to support the organization operation functioning and authorization of firms offering alternative means of access to finance and investment issuance and management of electronic payment funds and the exchange of virtual assets. Regulating financial technology (FinTech) could seek to (1) encourage the development of products and services that are covering segments of the market not provided by traditional financial institutions; (2) provide prudential rules in risk\\xe2\\x80\\x94including corporate governance accounting and risk management; and (3) prevent money laundering and the financing of terrorism while protecting users of financial technologies. The cases of Mexico and Mauritius can be useful to contrast emerging legal frameworks across countries and regions.The Case of mexicoIn Mexico on March 10 2018 the law regulating FinTech institutions (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinTech Law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) became effective. Key aspects of the law included the following \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Antimoney laundering and counterterrorist financing. The law proposes establishing both client and investor identification standards critical for the integrity and correct functioning of the financial system. To protect investors and clients FinTech companies will not be allowed to make any guaranteed returns on investment or guarantee the result or success of investments. Also the initiative prohibits related persons or those with the power to direct or control a FinTech institution\\xe2\\x80\\x99s management or resolutions from applying for crowdfunding financing as well as those officers partners board directors managers and other individuals imprisoned for over one year for a financial crime.45\\x0cFinTECh in SubSAhArAn AFriCAn CounTriES A G AmE ChAnGEr \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Institutions. FinTech institutions considered under the law include (1) crowdfunding institutions (2) electronic payment institutions and (3) virtual asset management institutions. To provide services in Mexico these FinTech institutions should be legally certified and incorporated as Mexican corporations or limited liability companies. \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Sandboxes. The Mexican law enables innovative companies to operate using technological tools models services or other means through innovative methods or processes. A twoyear temporary authorization will be provided (trial period). \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 FinTech Council. The law also provides for the creation of a FinTech Council which shall act as a means of consultation advice and coordination with the purpose of creating a space for exchanging opinions ideas and knowledge between the public and private sector to learn about the innovations in the field of FinTech and plan their development and regulation.The Case of mauritiusMauritius is using the concept of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cregulatory sandbox\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to spur innovation in the FinTech industry by accommodating the entry of new entrepreneurs. The country has avoided adopting a prescriptive approach to regulation and has instead developed a regulatory framework that facilitates \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctesting grounds\\xe2\\x80\\x9d for new digital business models that are not protected by current regulation. The purpose of the sandbox is to adapt compliance with strict financial regulations to the growth and pace of innovation in a way that does not burden the FinTech sector with rules while also ensuring consumer protection (BBVA Bank 2017). The Mauritius government launched the Regulatory Sandbox License (RSL) on October 20 2016.Although the RSL covers any innovative industry most of the recent RSL successful applicants are in the FinTech industry. For instance SelfKey has obtained an RSL to develop a digital identity wallet service based on BlockChain. Other licenses have been issued to an online crowdfunding platform a medical company producing stem cells and a financial provider of new investment products for the film industry.46\\x0creferencesAdam Christopher S. and Sebastien E.
