The    ndings are discussed inthe context of a large international literature on the e   ects of lending concentration and competitionon    rms    access to    nance. We conclude that the increase in market concentration that is currentlytaking place in Ireland is most likely to lead to more di   cult credit conditions for Small and MediumEnterprises (SMEs).Our research has    ve key    ndings. Firstly concentration of lending to the private sector fell duringthe boom period of 20042008 and rose steadily since the onset of the crisis. This    nding providesevidence of increased market entry and expansion of previously smaller lenders during periods ofprosperity and retrenchment of all but the largest lenders during downturns. Secondly lending toSMEs is signi   cantly more concentrated than lending to the private sector in total. This suggests thatthe lending market for smaller    rms about whom information is less easily attained (   informationallyopaque   ) presents larger barriers to entry which protect incumbent lenders. Thirdly we    nd a degreeof heterogeneity in the concentration of lending to di   erent sectors of economic activity. Fourthlyconcentration of new lending    ows to SMEs in 2010 and 2011 is shown to be signi   cantly higher thanconcentration of the stock of SME credit across all sectors. This suggests that the trajectory is towardseven higher concentration in the market. Finally foreign banks    share of private sector credit stockpeaked just as the crisis began and has been falling since indicating that in times of crisis foreignmarket participants react by more aggressively reducing exposure than domestic banks.There are two competing hypotheses on the likely e   ect of a more concentrated lending marketon access to    nance for    rms. The Market Power Hypothesis (MPH) predicts that the traditionalIndustrial Organization result should hold  a more concentrated market means more market powerfor the largest banks which leads to higher prices tougher conditions and less lending. The InformationHypothesis (IH) however suggests that relationship lending under which investments in informationare required on the part of the lender reverses the direction of the predicted e   ect. Under thishypothesis a more competitive market will lead to less lending as banks will not have the incentiveto make investments in information and their relationships particularly with small borrowers.The paper proceeds as follows Section 2 provides analysis of trends in concentration of the Irishprivate sector and SME lending markets; Section 3 highlights lessons from the literature that canprovide policy conclusions for Ireland; Section 4 concludes.2 Credit Concentration Data and AnalysisWe use the Central Bank of Ireland   s Money and Banking Statistics. These data are available at thelendersectorquarter level with the sectors to which each institution lends mapping into the NACEclassi   cation of sectors of activity. A number of statistics are available at this disaggregation theoutstanding stock of credit to all private sector    rms from 2000 to Q3 2011; the outstanding stockof credit to SMEs from Q4 2010 to Q3 2011; the volume of new lending    ows to SMEs from Q42010 to Q3 2011. Due to the nature of the data available we focus our attention on the Her   ndahlHirschman Index (HHI) of competition which is a measure based solely on the concentration oflending markets. While the literature has found that a more concentrated market need not necessarilybe less competitive the evidence suggests that in Ireland the trend has generally been that as marketsbecome less concentrated they have also been more competitive and vice versa. Goggin et al. (2012)   nd evidence that lenders in the Irish mortgage market have increased standard variable rates asconcentration levels in the market have increased since 2008. We calculate a HHI initially for eachquarter and then for each sectorquarter. These are calculated as the sum of the square of the marketshare of each market participant. A higher share represents a more concentrated or less competitivelending market. We also calculate at the same frequency and disaggregation the share of domesticbanks in total lending.2 2.1 Concentration in private sector lendingFigure 1 plots the HHI for all private sector (non   nancial) lending and for lending to all    core    (nonpropertyrelated non   nancial) sectors. For core sectors the Irish banking system became steadilyless concentrated from the years in which the credit boom began to accelerate (generally consideredto be 200405) up to 2008 witnessed by a noticeable decline in the HHI. From mid2008 howeverthere is a clearly visible turning point in the series with concentration increasing ever since. Thispresents a clear pattern of either increased entry or increased expansion by small market participantsduring a boom period followed by a contraction in competitive forces once economic conditions beganto deteriorate.The minimum value that the HHI reached in 2008 was .15 with the value for Q3 2011 standing at.19. To get a sense for whether or not a HHI of .19 represents a concentrated lending market Table1 reports HHIs calculated in previous studies. McCann et al. (2012)    nd that across 26 Europeancountries between 2000 and 2009 85 per cent of the countryyear observations have a HHI below .2.These numbers and those of Table 1 suggest that concentration in the Irish private sector lendingmarket is heading towards the upper end of international norms for developed countries.Data on lending to Small and Medium Enterprises has been required by the Central Bank ofIreland since 2010. Our prior due to the opaque nature of smaller    rms is that this market shouldbe more concentrated than the private sector credit market. Figure 2 plots the HHI for the stockof private sector and SME credit on identical scales for Q4 2010 to Q3 2011. The    gure shows aclear di   erence with the SME lending market having a HHI ranging between .25 and .27 over thesample period signi   cantly larger than any    gure observed for the whole private sector. Numerousstudies have previously shown that smaller    rms have more di   culty in accessing    nance. The higherconcentration level found in the lending market to smaller    rms is a potential channel through whichthis di   culty may arise.While Figure 2 outlined the di   erence in the HHI of outstanding credit stocks between private sectorand SME lending Figure 3 plots the HHI for new lending    ows to SMEs which gives an indicationof the likely path for concentration in the market. These data are likely to be more volatile thanconcentration measures for credit stocks given the di   culties experienced in the Irish    nancial sectorand the low volume of new lending in a given quarter in 2010111 thus an average of the availabledata is plotted here. The    gure shows that the HHI in new lending is consistently higher than theHHI for outstanding stock. This indicates that the Irish SME lending market is currently becomingmore concentrated.Figures 4 and 5 exploit the sectoral dimension of the lending data. Figure 4 reports the concentration of outstanding credit stock of each sector of economic activity in 2004 and 2008. The pictureshows a heterogeneity in concentration of lending across sectors and a pattern of increasing competition over the credit boom. The only exception to this pattern is the construction sector which had aHHI of .19 in 2004 and .26 in 2008. The general trend presented supports the proposition made earlierin the paper that the period of economic and credit boom in Ireland was associated with an increasein competition in the lending market. Figure 5 presents an average HHI for each sector in 201011comparing the HHI for lending to all    rms on the left with the HHI for lending to SMEs on the right.We observe higher concentration in the lending market for smaller    rms in the majority of sectors. Asmentioned previously this higher concentration may be driven by the opaque nature of smaller    rmswhich increases barriers to new entrants but may also in itself contribute to credit constraints forsmaller    rms.On new lending    ows to SMEs Figure 6 goes beyond the national numbers presented in Figure3 and sheds light on the likely path for concentration of sectoral SME lending markets. With threesectors presenting HHIs above .4 and all sectors reporting a HHI greater than .25 it appears thatthe market for newly issued credit to SMEs in Ireland is an highly concentrated one. The logicalconclusion is that lending will become more concentrated in the short run in the majority of sectors in1Central Bank Money and Banking Statistics show that new lending to SMEs averaged roughly e500m per quarterin 2011.3 the economy with the knockon e   ects for credit conditions and constraints that have been mentionedpreviously.2.2 Bank NationalityAs outlined in the introduction a large literature exists on the role that foreignowned banks can playin decreasing credit constraints for local    rms particularly when high concentration poses the risk ofincreased constraints. The share of lending accounted for by foreign and domestic banks is outlinedin this section. As in the previous section we begin with the longest time series available to usplotting the quarterly share of private sector lending stock accounted for by the domesticallyownedand foreignowned banks. Table 2 reports the banks that are de   ned as domestic or foreign. UlsterBank although present in the Irish market for over a century is considered a foreign bank for thepurposes of this analysis.Figure 7 reports the share of domestic banks in private sector lending with the red line representinglending to core sectors. Consistent with analysis of the HHI a clear pattern emerges whereby duringthe boom period of 2004 to 2008 the market penetration of foreign banks increased signi   cantly.This is consistent with a situation where attractive potential returns in a booming economy attractnew entrants to the lending market. The post2008 crisis has had an identical e   ect on foreign bankpenetration to that on competition in the market with a steady increase in the domestic share oflending from a low of 54 per cent at the end of 2009 to 64 per cent in 2011 Q3. This pattern matchesthe    ndings of Presbitero et al. (2012) who show that more distant banks in Italy are more likely toration credit since the onset of the crisis. As with the    ndings on concentration previously the lessonsof the literature suggest that this trend will likely have a detrimental e   ect on credit conditions in thelocal economy.Figure 8 shows a degree of heterogeneity in foreign bank penetration across sectors of activity. Thedomestic share of lending fell in the majority of sectors between 2004 and 2008 although there arenotable anomalies such as the construction sector where domestic banks    share of lending increasedfrom 59 to 72 per cent over the boom period.Figure 9 shows that in the SME lending market the domestic share in both new lending andthe stock of credit are very similar at 65 and 66 per cent indicating the the outlook is that thedomestic share will remain steady. In the SME market there are sectors such as Transport & StorageConstruction and Business & Administrative Services which are dominated by local banks but in mostsectors where the share lies around 60 per cent indicating that a signi   cant market share will continueto be accounted for by foreign lenders.3 Lessons for Ireland from the literatureFigures for new lending suggest that the likely path for the SME market is towards further concentration from a position where the market is already highly concentrated in international terms. Thetrajectory for foreign bank penetration also appears to be downward. The international academicliterature provides numerous lessons for the likely e   ect of this on access to    nance in the Irish realeconomy.The con   icting predictions of the Market Power Hypothesis (MPH) and Information Hypothesis(IH) have been tested on numerous occasions with a wide range of papers o   ering ambiguous results.The direction of the e   ect can depend on the sample of countries used the additional control variablesincluded and the proxy used for competition in the banking sector.2 Papers that reconcile the twoviews have done so in a number of ways. de Guevara and Maudos (2009) and Patti and Dell   Ariccia2Papers supporting the MPH include Beck et al. (2004) Chong et al. (2011) Agostino and Trivieri (2010)Black and Strahan (2002) Jayaratne and Strahan (1998) and Cetorelli and Strahan (2006). Petersen and Rajan (1995)presented    rst evidence that less competitive banking systems could lead to more access to    nance. Other paperssupporting this hypothesis include Giannetti et al. (2008) and Zarutskie (2006).4 (2004) explain that the relationship has an inverted Ushape i.e. at very high levels of concentrationthe MPH holds but below these levels the IH holds. CarboValverde et al. (2009) explain the ambiguity by relating concentration and competition to measures of market contestability and informationattainment. If a market is concentrated and also is not vigorously contested then the MPH is shownto hold.A separate but related literature on the e   ect of foreign bank penetration on credit conditionsexists. A number of studies generally using data for emerging market countries have found bene   ciale   ects of foreign bank penetration on access to    nance.3 A more recent literature however has foundthat during the crisis period foreign bank penetration may pose additional risks to local    rms in thatthese banks with less information on the local market generally retrench at a faster pace than localbanks.4This literature has a number of implications for the trends presented here for Ireland. The keymessage of de Guevara and Maudos (2009) is that the MPH holds at the highest levels of concentrationbut not at lower levels. As outlined earlier it appears that concentration in Ireland is approachingthe highest range of HHIs seen in Europe in recent decades. The key lesson of CarboValverde et al.(2009) is that concentration will lead to tougher credit conditions where there is not a high degree ofcontestability or investment in information on the part of lenders. Evidence from Goggin et al. (2012)suggests that in the Irish mortgage market increased concentration has not been accompanied byvigorous competitive behaviour since 2008. Furthermore new lending    gures reported by the CentralBank of Ireland have been low in 2010/11 and Lawless and McCann (2011) have shown that creditconditions in Ireland are the most di   cult in the euro area currently. All of these facts suggest that interms of the results of CarboValverde et al. (2009) Ireland appears to be in a position where increasedconcentration is likely to exacerbate as opposed to ease SME credit constraints.Beck et al. (2004) suggest that an e   cient credit registry and foreign bank penetration can mitigatethe e   ects of bank concentration on obstacles to    nance. The fact that a credit register does not exist(although it is planned to begin operating in 2013) combined with a trend towards foreign banks   lending shares falling in Ireland in recent years suggests that these mitigating factors are not likely tobe in place to reverse the predicted e   ects of the MPH in Ireland in the coming years. Similarly whilehigh GDP per capita and good insititutional quality are currently qualities of which Ireland can boastthe likely growth rate in GDP in Ireland given current economic concerns across Europe suggeststhat an increase in economic activity is also unlikely to reverse the MPH e   ect.4 ConclusionThis paper presents descriptive statistics on competition in lending to    rms in the Irish private sectorusing detailed banklevel lending data. The aim of the paper is to present a picture of competition levelsin the market and to draw implications for Irish    rms    credit access. From a policy perspective ourkey    ndings are as follows the lending market for all enterprises has become more concentrated sincethe onset of the 2008 crisis; the lending market for SMEs is signi   cantly more concentrated and thetrend is towards even higher concentration; foreign bank penetration has diminished in Ireland sincethe crisis. Having distilled the lessons from the literature on the likely e   ect of increased concentrationand lower foreign bank penetration in the Irish SME lending market it appears most likely is thatthe predictions of the Market Power Hypothesis will prevail leading to tougher conditions for SMEsseeking to access    nance. Policy measures such as a loan guarantee scheme micro   nance fund andcredit register should help to mitigate these adverse e   ects somewhat but it is clear from the analysispresented here that challenges will remain in the medium term.3Examples include Giannetti and Ongena (forthcoming) George R.G.
