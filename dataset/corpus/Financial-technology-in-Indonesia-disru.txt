Abstract   Financial Technology is a combination of the terms financial services and information  technology.  Broadly  speaking  Financial  Technology  is  defined  as  a company  that  generates  revenue  through  the  provision  of  technologybased financial  services.  Indonesia  as  one  of  the  developing  countries  experienced  an increase  in  economy  in  the  last  two  decades  Indonesia's  financial  industry  has shifted  due  to  the  fast  technology  growth  and  development.  This  pradigm  shift poses  new  challenges  for  regulators  and  market  participants  in  balancing  the potential benefits of innovation with the potential risks. It takes the intervention of regulators  and  business  actors  of  Financial  Technology the development of Financial Technology without attenuating the pace of innovation.  Keywords Financial Technology innovation  1. Introduction to  support  A phenomenon that transforms an existing system and / or market which can offer  practical  value  easy  to  access  comfort  and  cost  effectiveness  is  called Financial  Technology.  Financial  Technology  also  known  as  FinTech  is  a  new sector  in  financial  industry  that  combines  technological  and  finance  functions. Utilization  of  technology  in  the  field  of  finance  to  facilitate  trades  corporate business or interaction and services provided to the retail consumer. Broadly  speaking  Financial  Technology  can  be  defined  as  a  technology application  in  finance.  The  term  Fintech  does  not  refer  to  any  institutional  or financial or payment definitions. However the relationship between finance and      84                                                                    Kannya Purnamahatty Prawirasasra   information technology has been established for a long time and has evolved over three distinct eras. Wilson  (2017)  states  that  Financial  technology  is  a  company  that  primarily uses  technology  to  generate  revenue  through  providing  financial  services  to customers.. Other  sources  explain  that  Financial  Technology  is  a  dynamic  segment  at  the intersection  of  the  financial  services  and  technology  sectors  where  technologyfocused  startups  and  new  market  entrustments  are  being  provided  by  the traditional financial services industry (PWC 2017). Meanwhile  according  to  Bank  Indonesia  (2017)  states  that  the  definition  of Financial  Technology  is  a  phenomenon  of  fusion  between  technology  and financial  features  that  transform  business  models  and  a  weak  barrier  to  entry which as regulated financial institutions. The same thing is also described by Kominfo (2017) that Financial Technology is  a  fusion  phenomenon  that  occurs  between  technology  with  financial  features that change the business model and the weakening of barrier to entry. So  it  can  be  concluded  that  Financial  Technology  is  a  contraction  of  finance and  technology  that  creating  value  by  providing  financial  services  through  the engagement of technology. Indonesia  as  one  of  the  developing  countries  has  huge  potential  in  the development  of  Financial  Technology.  The  growth  of  Financial  Technology  in Indonesia  is  greatly  assisted  by  support  from  banks  and  governments.  For customers  who  are  conventional  Financial  Technology  business  can  be considered the key to bankruptcy. However on the other hand the involvement of Financial Technology is actually able to collaborate well with the bank. This will widen  the  financial  services  network  for  the  Indonesian  population  thus increasing the number of customers and the financial inclusion of Indonesia will grow. Nevertheless to date the carrying capacity of Financial Technology ecosystem in Indonesia is considered inadequate. As the new Financial Technology is known in Indonesia governments and regulators in technology and finance must adapt in terms  of  policy  and  regulatory  adjustments  as  a  form  of  risk  mitigation.  Other challenges  faced  include  the  presence  of  gaps  between  the  desires  of  investors with the characteristics of the Financial Technology itself especially related to the projected gain gained.  2. The Evolution of Financial Technology  Financial Technology 1.0 (18661987) From Analogue to Digital In the late 19th century finance and technology had become the first period  of  financial  globalization  that  lasted  until  the  beginning  of  the  first  World  War (Hong  Kong).  In  this  era  technology  has  an  important  role  in  conveying information  across  borders  including  financial  information  such  as  transactions and  payments  around  the  world.  J.M.Keynes  quoted  via  (HongKong)  describes the relationship between finance and technology as follows    Financial technology in Indonesia disruptive or collaborative?                          85       The inhabitant of London could order by telephone sipping his morning tea in bed the various products  of  the whole earth  in such quality as he might see fit and  reasonably  expect  their  early  delivery  upon  his  doorstep;  he  could  at  the same  moment  and  by  the  same  means  adventure  his  wealth  in  the  natural resources  and  new  enterprises  of  any  quarter  of  the  world  and  share  without exertion or even trouble   . Furthermore technology developed rapidly during World War I especially in the  field  of  Information  Technology  and  Communications.  This  is  evidenced  by the  emergence  of  several  technologybased  companies  such  as  International Business Machine (IBM) in 1967. In  1967  the  community  was  introduced  by  ATM  machines  that  became  a transition  from  analogue  to  a  digital  industry.  Companies  engaged  in  financial industry began to use technology in carrying out its operational activities such as BACS  (Bankers     Automated  Clearing  Services);  US  CHIPS  (Clearing  House Interbank Payments System) SWIFT (Society of Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunications)  as  a  tool  in  the  interconnect  domestic  payments  system across borders. The growing use of technology in operational activities replacing paperbased mechanisms becomes computerized which automatically increases the likelihood of risk occurring both internally and externally.  Financial  Technology  2.0  (19872008)  Development  of  Traditional  Digital Financial Services.   replacing  most        In this era financial institutions maximize the use of IT for internal corporate activities  gradually forms  of  paperbased  mechanisms.  In 1970 technology grew with the emergence of a system that enabled investors to stock electronically. n the 1980s the Bank began to update the software so that the  data  can  be  stored  safely.  In  the  1990s  the  usage  of  nternet  encouraged  the creation of new business models in the Financial Technology sector. As a result emerging  websites  aimed  at  retail  investors  replacing  the  phonedriven  retail stock brokering model. In this era ATM is one of the biggest innovations in the field  of  finance  although  technological  innovations  that  occur  in  the  financial industry sector is still focused on the bank side without considering the customers needs   . This is evident by the use of Core Banking System as one of the systems used by the majority of Banks.        The  presence  of  Internet  in  the  early  1995  shifted  the  Bank  to  innovate  that allows customers to stay in touch virtually. Thus in 2001 at least 8 banks in the US  have  used  ebanking  system  with  an  online  customer  number  of  1  million customers  (Hong  Kong).  So  in  2001  the  company's  spending  on  technology increased  dramatically.  This  is  because  the  Bank  began  to  shift  the  internal process system and interactions with their customers become fully digitalized. Based on this several regulations are required to protect the rights of the bank and the bank's own consumers.  In Hong Kong the Chief Executive of the Hong Kong Monetary Authority ratified the regulation in 1999. However in Indonesia     86                                                                    Kannya Purnamahatty Prawirasasra   Bank  Indonesia  circulates  the  6/18  /  DPNP  Circular  Letter  on  applying  for  risk management to bank service activities via internet (internet banking) by 2014. The  Letter  (Surat  Edaran)  requires  the  Bank  to  apply  risk  management  as  set forth  in  a  written  policy  procedures  and  guidelines  covering  the  active supervision of the Board of Commissioners and the Board of Directors;  Security control; And risk management in particular legal risk and reputation risk.  Financial  Technology  3.0  (2009present)  Democratizing  Digital  Financial Services.  The  Global  Financial  Crisis  that  occurred  in  2008  had  an  impact  on  banking and  financial  sector.  Meanwhile  according  to  (Hong  Kong)  Global  Financial Crisis has had two major impacts in terms of public perception and human capital. First  as  the  origin  of  the  financial  crisis  became  more  widely  understood  the public perception of bank deteriorated. Secondly general developed a distrust of the  traditional  banking  system.  On  the  other  hand  many  financial  professionals either  lost  their  jobs  or  were  now  less  compensated.  And  also  the  newer generations of highly educated financials. In  addition  an  increasing  number  of  regulation  of  incumbent  players  and  the social  and  behavioral  changes  in  the  customers.  Communities  seek  funding alternatives  that  are  more  democratic  and  transparent  and  able  to  provide  more value in every transaction made. In addition the increasing need of consumers to access their financial accounts in managing their investments as well as simplify the  transactions  of  their  phones  has  led  to  the  new  applications  and  also  to  an increase need of security for their online transactions (Bucharest). According  to  (Cui  and  Wu  2016)  changes  in  behavior  from  customers  will encourage  the  development  of  new  products.  Older  customers  tend  to  behave passively  in  decision  making.  However  changing  the  paradigm  of  thinking  will change  the  behavior  of  new  customers  expect  to  receive  solutions  that  can  be adapted  to  their  needs  and  investment  goals  (Nicoletti  2017).  These  changes require the company to turn the business model into customer oriented where the products  and services match the expectations of  the users and if its possible via digitized platform. From  the  external  side  many  Financial  Technology  startups  targeting  the younger  generation  become  the  target  market  who  spend  more  time  using  the internet.  However on the other hand the  younger  generation has only  relatively fewer assets than older customers. The gap is particulary wide with resoect to the oldest generations who tend to have substantial financial wealth and capability. To  be  able  to  answer  the  dilemma  the  company  must  be  able  to  innovate  in various ways to transform their customer relationship and offer new approaches in financial services.  3. Methodology and Data  The methodology used in this study is the literature review. Literature       Financial technology in Indonesia disruptive or collaborative?                          87   review is  a description of a theory findings obtained from  various sources to  be used as a basis / reference in completing a problem.     FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY GLOBAL BENCHMARK GAP       FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY IN INDONESIA    Figure 3.1  Research Framework IMPLICATIONS ACTION PLAN  Policy and Regulation  Based on the above picture the early stages of this research are data collection and previous research on Financial Technology globally covering the history and implications  of  certain  countries.  Furthermore  data  collection  and  analysis  of Financial  Techology  in  Indonesia  including  case  studies  of  opportunities  and challenges faced by Financial Technology in Indonesia. The results of the analysis are  used  in  the  basis  of  suggestions  for  governments  financial  institutions  and OJK as regulators in Indonesia.  4. Financial Technology in Indonesia  According to Hong Kong (2016) the development of Financial Technology in developing countries is supported by several factors that become characteristic of developing countries namely (1) young digitally savvy populations equipped with mobile  devices;  (2)  60%  of  the  world  will  be  located  in  Asia  by  2030;  (3) inefficient  financial  and  capital  markets  creating  opportunitioes  for  informal alternatives;  (4)  shortages  of  physical  banking  infrastructure;  (5)  behavioral  predisposition  on  favor  of  convenience  over tryst;  (6)  untapped  market opportunitoes  (1.2  billion  people  without  bank  accounts);  And  (7)  less  stringent dat aprotection and competition. But  on  the  other  hand  the  potential  opportunities  are  balanced  against  the challenges that will be faced. Investors feel there is large information asymmetries in the market activity Asia Pacific to be specific. In addition the high barrier to entry  for  retail  banking  with  a  regulation  that  is  less  flexible  makes  investors prefer to invest in developed countries. Indonesia  as  one  of  the  developing  countries  with  the  largest  population  has enormous potential in developing the industry of Financial Technology. Financial     88                                                                    Kannya Purnamahatty Prawirasasra   Services  Authority  as  one  of  the  regulator  in  Indonesia  argues  that  Financial Technology  in  Indonesia  has  many  opportunities  due  to  the  existence  of  huge amount  of  financing  gap  imbalance  of  financing  distribution;  The  low  level  of financing  inclusion  the  low  rate  of  velocity  of  money  the  low  level  of  SME export  access;  And  the  increasing  on  the  internet  technology  and  mobile  phone usage in Indonesia. The  value  of  Financial  Technology  transaction  in  Indonesia  is  estimated  to reach  USD  14.5  billion  or  about  0.6%  of  total  global  transactions  estimated  at USD 2.355.9 billion (Kominfo 2016).   Figure 4.1 Financial Technology transaction in Indonesia   Survey  conducted  by  the  Association  of  Internal  Services  Users  Indonesia (APJII)  states  that  of  the  total  population  of  Indonesia  sebanya  88.1  million  are internet  users.  The  majority  of  Internet  users  aged  1825  years.  However  of  all internet users 65% of them are internet users on the island of Java (APJII 2016)   10%18%18%29%25%35  44 tahun25  34 tahun10  24 tahun45  54 tahun> 55 tahunFigure 4.2 Internet user in Indonesia     Financial technology in Indonesia disruptive or collaborative?                          89   With  the  growing  number  of  technologybased  companies  in  Indonesia  an association  of  financial  companies  in  Indonesia  called  Fintech  Association  of Indonesia  (AFI)  was  established  in  2015.  The  Financial  Technology  Indonesia Association is expected to be a forum for Financial Technology and investors To share  knowledge  and  equate  the  vision  of  the  Indonesian  economy.  In  addition AFI  also  serves  as  a  bridge  of  communication  between  Financial  Technology institutions that exist abroad.   180160140120100806040200Q1Q2Q3Q4Figure 4.3 Number of Financial Technology in Indonesia (2016)  The presence of Financial Technology in Indonesia must be addressed properly by  OJK  as  an  institution  that  has  a  function  as  a  regulator  in  Indonesia.  In  this case  the  OJK  needs  to  take  the  right  attitude  to  maintain  a  balance  between  the role  of  formal  and  informal  financial  sector  and  risk  mitigation  through  proper regulation  without  having  to  turn  off  the  rate  of  innovation  in  the  financial services sector.  5. Conclusion  The  development  of  Financial  Technology  in  Indonesia  will  have  a  very positive  impact  on  the  Indonesian  economy  such  as  encouraging  equitable distribution of the welfare of the population; Assisting domestic financing needs; Encourage  the  distribution  of  national  financing;  Improve  national  financial inclusion; And encourage the ability of UMKM which is still considered low. It can not be denied that the rise of Financial Technology in Indonesia will also give  social  impact  such  as  the  change  of  mindset  of  conventional  financial institution. Conventional financial institutions are considered traditional financial institutions that are not flexible and can not meet the needs of its customers. Thus to optimize the role of Financial Technology it is necessary to intervene from  financial  institutions  and  business  players  of  Financial  Technology incorporated  in  the  Association  of  FinTek  Indonesia  to  collaborate  on  the information path by utilizing available data to strengthen the distribution channels      90                                                                    Kannya Purnamahatty Prawirasasra   that have been built up. Second product collaboration that can meet the needs of consumers. It takes a product that is useful for both parties. In addition it is also necessary to intervene from JK as a regulator in Indonesia should be able to  create  regulations  that  can protect  the rights  of  consumers and companies without hampering the pace of innovation. In addition OJK also needs to develop a strategic policy that ensures that risks from Financial Technology in Indonesia  can  be  mitigated  and  provide  fair  and  equitable  protection  for communities.
