The crowdsource panel includesbankers credit union executives industry analysts advisors authors andfintech followers from Asia Africa North America South and CentralAmerica Europe the Middle East and Australia.We used the findings from our panel as the foundation to develop aglobal survey of executives involved in the financial services industry which provided aprioritization of our trends. Our global survey also provided an opportunity to do an endofyearreview of last year   s projections. Finally the survey collected insight into strategic priorities for2018 and the fintech players that the industry believes will have the greatest impact in theupcoming year.By collecting insights from leading influencers ranking the trends using an industry survey andincluding extensive analysis around each trend we have developed the most comprehensiveannual trend report in the banking industry. For the third consecutive year the research analysisand Digital Banking Report entitled 2018 Retail Banking Trends and Predictions aresponsored by Kony Inc.. The report will be available right after Christmas.Top 10 Retail Banking Trends for 2018The ranking of the top 10 trends and predictions was done by providing a list of trends identifiedby our crowdsourced panel and asking banks credit unions and the supplier community globallyto provide their top 3 predictions for 2018. Of the organizations that provided their top 3 trendsthe highest ranking prediction was that the industry was going to remove friction from the customer journey (61%). The next two most mentioned trends were the improved use of data andadvanced analytics and refinements in multichannel delivery (mentioned by 57% and 42%respectively).Interestingly with the exception of one trend (testing and use of blockchain technology) thetrends and order of these trends were the same as last year. Last year   s trend of investment ininnovation did not make the top 10 this year. The importance and underlying components of eachtrend differed in this year   s research compared to the predictions for 2017.The fact that the list of trends identified by the financial services industry has remained relativelyconsistent could be a symptom of a greater problem. The banking industry is moving much tooslow and legacy firms are failing to differentiate themselves. According to Forrester    In a marketwhere onethird of all customers say    all banks are basically the same    it would make sense forexecutives and their teams to obsess over how to differentiate. Unfortunately 2018 will look morelike a digital arms race between warring incumbents than a year in which firms find new ways tospecialize and create value for customers.   Regarding changes in emphasis for this year   s trends removing friction from the customerjourney increased in importance from last year with 61% of organizations placing this trend in thetop three compared to 54% last year. The trend around the use and application of data alsoincreased in importance from last year with 57% of those surveyed placing this in the top 3 for2018 compared to 53% in predictions for 2017. Other notable shifts of importance included agreater belief that open banking APIs would be important less emphasis on regulatory changesand a greater belief that advanced technology would have an impact in 2018.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report Top 10 Strategic Priorities for 2018When we asked financial services organizations worldwide about their top three strategic prioritiesfor 2018 there was a significant change in priorities compared to last year   s research. While theorder of the top three priorities remained the same as last year the priority of reducing operatingcosts dropped from 41% last year to only 32% for 2018. At the same time the priority ofinvestment in innovation dropped from the 4th position to 7th with the number of firmsmentioning innovation falling from 26% to 22%.The biggest jumps in strategic priority in 2018 were seen with the emphasis on automating corebusiness processes (up 13%) and recruiting talent (up 8%). These shifts illustrate the growingimportance of becoming a digital bank and the impact of this transformation on the types ofemployees required to address new challenges. Here is what some of our crowdsource panel had to say about 2018.   2018 will see developments across the banking industry including a more matureapplication of fintech solutions greater use of digital payments the opening up ofbanking thanks to API built architectures the first significant progress withblockchain technology and the harnessing of AI and RPA solutions. These changeswill all occur as global tech giants (including those from China) change the financialservices battleground.       Roberto Ferrari Chief Digital and Innovation Officer at Mediobanca Group   Financial institutions have spent the last few years painting the vision of what it means to be a digital bank. In2018 we   ll see a significant shift from optimization     streamlining and automation     to creating new revenuestreams. This revenue may come from new business models or simply new products and services but it signalsa recognition that simply doing the same things better is no longer enough.       Nicole Sturgill Principal Executive Advisor at CEB now Gartner   Investing in new skill sets will be critical. The digital talent gap is only widening andorganizations that can   t keep pace will be crippled by it. Now more than ever the right talent istruly a competitive advantage.       Danielle Guzman Global Head of Social Media and Distributed Content at Mercer    2018 will see a radical change in how traditional financial institutions approach digitaltransformation.  The Chief Digital Officer concept will be replaced as companies seek to embeddigital transformation     for both customer value proposition and business model transformation    into the roles and expectations for every job in the organization and every initiative undertaken. Digital management much like risk management in recent years will become everyone  s job. This will launch a wave of transformation especially in traditional banking.       Mary Beth Sullivan Managing Partner of Capital Performance Group   2018 will be an amazing year in banking. The debate on cryptocurrencies will rageon with jurisdictions legalizing and defining ICO token issuance and definitionsaround cryptocurrency use. Regulators will increasingly compete for dollars talentand fintech innovation through more open banking and fintech licensing provisionsputting markets like the US further behind the eight ball on basic capabilities likepayments and challenger models. Blockchain POCs will move to implementationneobanks will start to go global and global technology experiences surfacing bankand credit utility will start to emerge that undermine traditional charters.       Brett King CEO and Founder of Moven and author of Bank 4.0Regarding the use of an industry leading group of financial services industry influencers JayPalter Chief Engagement Officer at Jay Palter Social Advisory said   As technological innovation accelerates and financial systems globalize social networks (such asLinkedIn Twitter and Facebook) have emerged as indispensable and efficient tools for followingkey developments and insights from thought leaders. Knowing who you need to follow and payattention to online is more important than ever.   1. Removing Friction from the Customer JourneyWhile the banking industry has talked about    customercentricity    and   improving the customer experience    for decades most organizations havehad difficulty breaking down product silos or leveraging internal data todeliver a contextual digital experience.    Longterm sustainable growth in thebanking industry seems only possible with a radical departure from a salesand productobsessed mindset to one of genuine customer centricity andfurther rationalization of strategies to target the right markets customer segments and solutions   states Deloitte.According to the 85page report Improving the Customer Experience in Banking the objectiveof delivering a positive customer experience has become secondary to other bank prioritiesresulting in a transactional banking relationship for the customer. For financial organizations tochange this dynamic and meet the evolving needs of today   s customers there are five areas thathave emerged as crucial priorities 1.  Move focus of digital engagement from cost reduction to experience enhancement.2.  Leverage advanced analytics machine learning and contextual engagement to provide ahighly personalized experience.3.  Allow the consumer to engage with their bank on the channels they prefer at the times theywant to engage.4.  Transition advisory and sales activities from being reactive to being proactive.5.  Engage endtoend throughout the customer journey from shopping to account opening toonboarding and through relationship expansion.A positive customer experience is channel sensitive with customers placing a higher weight ondigital customer experiences more than physical or call center channels. In fact in a recent J.D.Power survey the largest banking organizations improved in overall customer satisfaction whilemidsize banks declined and regional banks plateaued. This was attributed primarily to improvedmobile and online satisfaction.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends ReportAs the banking industry responds to the    Age of the Individual    big data and advanced analyticswill define the winners from the losers. It is critical for banks and credit unions to deliver on thepersonalization promise to win the battle of having the best customer experience.How customer insight is used can make a big difference to the customer experience     andultimately to the profitability of the organization. The right information analyzed in the right waycan ensure that the financial institution can provide the right offer at the right time     along with aseamless service at a lower cost. And that has to be good for everyone involved.    Financial companies need to introduce experiences that are more like Tinder andInstagram rather than the traditional services they provide today. It   s not just digitalinnovation or transformation where banks can compete for the future it   s alsoabout reinventing dated policies processes and products for new and morediscerning generations of connected consumers. UX design strategies and principlesand humancentered design belongs in the CSuite now more than ever.       Brian Solis Principal Analyst and Futurist at Altimeter Group a Prophet company   Most forwardlooking banks have realized that a purely customeroriented experience will neverenable a really defensible differentiation towards competitors. Huge customerdriven programshave helped provide    errorfree    transactional experiences to their customers but this isn   tenough. Organizations must activate structured topdown initiatives to detail the brand promiseacross every touchpoint and frontline behavior with the final goal to create a deep and durablealignment with the human side of their customers     moving from    customer experience    to    humanexperience   .       Ambrogio Terrizzano European Financial Services Lead at Accenture   We are about to tear down product silos that confuse customers and get focused on beingrelevant convenient and frictionless. Our new gotomarket will be driven by attention andengagement. The winners will be the most efficient at manufacturing and the most effective atengaging. Ecosystems will win beyond single individual providers.       Nigel Walsh Partner at Deloitte UK   Human first The core of banking and insurance is social     not the abundant technology butunderstanding human behavior and decision making will be relevant to differentiate and design asuperior value proposition.       Andreas Staub Managing Partner at Fehr Advice   2018 will bring more capabilities for shifting more control of one   s finances from banksmerchants or processors to the enduser. These highly intuitive trustcreating controls willultimately drive higher spend loyalty and trust with lower misuse.       Jim Van Dyke Founder and CEO of Futurion.Digital   The banks that have done the hard work of changing their internal culture in orderto welcome and foster change and elevate the experience will retain the relationshipwith the consumer and will compete successfully with new entrants whether theyare new challenger banks or the big tech firms (GAFA).       Duena Blomstrom Chief Growth Officer Marketplace at Temenos    The great opportunity of 2018 will be to align crossfunctional teams around an early stageadaptive and collaborative process (using agile and scrum road mapping). To move rapidly from amyopic operational and technology focus to working from the    outsidein    letting targetedcustomer segments/persona needs pain points and lifestyle triggers guide and inform strategyexperience design and personalized content and tailored new products.       Mark Weber CEO of Weber Marketing Group   Mobile will be at the center of the customer experience in 2018. Voice banking will become moreprevalent especially for customers of larger banks while smaller community banks will continueto work to catch up adding more mobile banking options that remove friction and improvefunctionality.       Lori Philo Cook Owner of InnovoMarketing   2018 will be the year of bringing human connection to the forefront of the customer experience.Whether through digital voice or face to face financial services firms will improve on the deliveryof the most fundamental of human needs to connect with customers let them know they havebeen heard acknowledged and understood.       Joe Sullivan CEO of Market Insights Inc.   Mobile banking will continue to accelerate past standard banking in customerpreference as their digital user and customer experiences become more enriched and datainformed. This will include consumertobusiness frictionless digitalbanking consumertoconsumer oneclick payments new cryptocurrencyopportunities passwordfree biometrics locational services and offers andconversational interfaces.       Kirk D. Borne Principal Data Scientist and Executive Advisor at Booz Allen Hamilton   Banks will increase experimentation with chatbots and interactive assistants to find ways tointeract with customers in a more meaningful way and to provide a better customer experience.The focus will shift to evolving these experiences by integrating more sophisticated data to gaininsight using machine learning to understand and predict what a customer may need anddeploying bots that can help their agents do their jobs better.       Tiffani Montez Senior Analyst at Aite Group2. Expanding Use of Data and Advanced AnalyticsOver the past 18 months the Digital Banking Report has seen a growinggap between the organizations that are embracing the power ofcontextual insights and the potential of digital transformation vs. thosethat continue doing things the same way they have in the past. There isno reason to see this gap narrowing in 2018.Bestinclass financial institutions will apply advanced analytics andartificial intelligence to increase automation improve personalizationreduce costs enhance the customer experience and even assist with compliance. The potentialof advanced analytics grows exponentially over time. Each iteration additional data source andperformance measurement results in learning that enhances the accuracy of the predictivemodels. It also allows organizations to refine data sources as opposed to simply adding more andmore data.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report Finally with each iteration predictability goes up while costs can go down improving marketingefficiency. From the customer   s perspective the messaging in more    on target    improving thecustomer experience satisfaction and lifetime value.According to David Gerbino Principal of @dmgconsulting    Financial institutions that effectivelyleverage data and advanced analytics across the enterprise will be in a position to capitalize onnewer technologies such as machine learning and automation. Those firms who fall behind willneed to quickly overcome barriers that are preventing them from enjoying the benefits ofadvanced analytics or they will find themselves too far behind to catch up.      Many banks have built their core operations on fragmented systems aligned toproducts. This has distributed customer data across multiple platforms and banksrecognize that they cannot use AI effectively on data spread across the business. Asa result organizations will develop strategies for building an Enterprise DataArchitecture in 2018 which rationalizes and cleanses their fragmented data stores.       Chris Skinner CEO at The Finanser Ltd.   2018 we will see tech and datadriven leaders being appointed into clevel positions in thefinancial services industry. This will occur because advisory board shareholders and established CEOs recognize that the new era of customercentric digital ecosystems demand leadership witha digital and techdriven mindset.       Dr Robin Kiera Fintech Insurtech Digitalization Speaker and Influencer   Machine Learning applications will continue to mature with each vendor featuring a domainspecific solution. Organizations will work towards fully integrated endtoend data managementplatforms to handle increases in different data streams including Deep Learning applicationstransforming data into actionable insights. AI and Deep Learning applications in voice recognitionand video analytics will also accelerate.       Ronald Van Loon Director at Adversitement   A new generation of AI solutions focused on the effectiveness more than on the efficiency. Toolsable to evolve from the pull conversation to the push sales. The proactive offer of the rightproduct at the right time with the right message as was done physically by the best sales fordecades. Something able to address the body of the customer base and not only the long tail ofthe most rational person.       Matteo Carbone Founder and Director at Connected Insurance Observatory   Virtual replicas will move beyond industrial applications and into financial services in2018. A digital twin will not only propose an action plan for a human to review/do itwill intervene on its own. As cloudbased processing power rises and tools becomemore operative running behavioral digital twin simulations will become moreprevalent.       Mike Quindazzi Managing Director at PwC    In 2018 organizations will embrace more automation and AI to provide a better experience forcustomers across digital channels and to empower employees with the tools and knowledge theyneed to improve their performance.       Jenni Palocsik Director of Solutions Marketing at Verint   AI will become a necessity for financial services to deliver better experiences lower costsreduce risks and increase revenue     providing a competitive edge. Most firms will need toevaluate a buy/partner decision to deploy solutions such as chatbots biometrics fraud and voiceor else fall further behind.       Dennis Gada Regional Head Financial Services at Infosys   Artificial Intelligence (AI) will start to bear fruit supporting more complicated usecases for older adults such as decumulation and financial planning for longevity. Thecombination of advanced analytics Internet of Things (IoT) and big data will allowbanking to be more seamlessly integrated into our daily routine transforming voiceinto the new UI.       Theodora Lau Director of Market Innovation at AARP   Anticipatory UIs will grow as a result of natural language processing and AI prompting a shift incustomer interaction from pull (the customer having to trigger the interaction with the bank) to push (the bank initiating the interaction in a noninvasive way).       Paolo Barbesino SVP and Head of Digital at Unicredit   With many organizations searching for deposits those that do not have a sound datacleansingand enriching process combined with a datadriven acquisition and retention strategy backed bya marketing automation platform will find themselves on the losing end of 2018. Marketing teamsand technology teams will need to be in 100% alignment going into this year.       John Waupsh Chief Innovation Officer at Kasasa   Data will reach a point of critical mass not in terms of volume but in organizationcollation correlation and democratic distribution. This will not just empower realtime or strategic decision making (   if this then that   ) but also determine long termroad maps capacity planning customization of products and services for newacquisition and revenue channels and critically cost management. Data will be theconstant atmosphere in which we work and breath rather than the    lake    or   warehouse    we visit.       Rob Findlay Managing Director at Accenture Interactive and Founder of  Next Money   Many financial institutions will attempt to roll out tools powered by artificial intelligence and manywill fail due to a lack of clean and usable data. Leading institutions will focus on getting their dataorganized accessible and clean building a solid foundation to ultimately win the race toward AI.       Matt West Global Strategic Account Executive at MX   Could data scientists be last year   s hot occupation? Software could reduce the demandintegrating deep learning and code into packages that detect fraud improve targeting etc.Software goes where there   s demand     look for more data science expertise to be deployed assoftware.       Tom Groenfeldt Writer for Forbes   Banks must continue to gain a deep understanding of their customers or they willfall further behind. Transaction analytics and data categorization are the foundationof all datadriven initiatives. If financial institutions cannot categorize their data andidentify the right audience they will find it difficult to move forward in moreadvanced areas such as AI Virtual Assistants and Customer Journey Mapping.       Rob Heiser President and CEO of Segmint3. Improving Multichannel Delivery Banks and credit unions will see less than half their customers face toface in 2018. Instead an increasingly digital customer base will use selfservice touchpoints as a first point of contact only reaching out tocontactcenter agents or branches for the most complex engagements.This movement of transactional interactions to digital channels will meanthat branch and contactcenter interactions are more important than everin building human relationships with customers.Winning financial services organizations will provide all customer contact personnel with thedigital tools required to access answers quicker and will invest higher trained personnel who arebetter equipped to use these tools and present high value responses to inquiries.The traditional definition of convenience in banking has revolved around the proximity of thebranch. With the growth in digital technology and the increased acceptance of online and mobilebanking access to banking products and transactions is no longer tethered to a physical locationresulting in a redefinition of convenience. Today while convenience is still the primary driver ofinitial consideration the importance of branches in that definition has gone down.Novantas found the correlation between    perceived convenience    and    consideration    to be slightlystronger than the correlations between    perceived convenience    and    purchase    with both beingvery strong. The biggest news is that the drivers of    perceived convenience    start with anorganization   s digital capabilities. In fact the importance of branchcentric factors have dropped ineach of the past three years of the study. This is especially true for consumers aged 1854.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report Aligned with the preference to shop digitally there has been a corresponding increase in thepreference to open accounts digitally according to Novantas. Over a third of consumers prefer toopen their account digitally with the number being significantly higher (46%) if the consumershopped using digital channels exclusively. In fact the mobile channel has replaced otherchannels as the centerpiece of the banking relationship.    In 2018 mobile will surpass desktop as the top digital channel for retail bankaccount opening. Consumers will move from just browsing to actually buyingfinancial products from their phones. This move will be supported by superiorsecurity from mobile vastly improved customer interfaces and the convenience ofoffhours access that mobile provides.       Don Bergal CMO at Avoka   Operational processes and technology infrastructure created for branchcentric workflows willbecome the limiting factor for adequately serving digitalfirst customers. Institutions will be forcedto migrate from digitizing selfservice to providing exceptional service digitally.       Wade Arnold Advisor at BillGo   Advertisers will realize that context does count. While they   ve appreciated the precision targetingof social platforms there will be a growing appreciation in 2018 that the trustworthiness of thecontent on each platform has a big impact on their brand message.       Jennifer Grazel Global Director Vertical Marketing for LinkedIn   One of the biggest trends is clicks to bricks. We are working with many of our clients to connectthe online digital experience to the traditional branch experience with the use of tablet friendlyopen branch workflow experience for loans and deposits.       Kyle Kehoe President Action Division of CRIF Lending Solutions   The emergence of Gen Z (born 1996 and after) will underscore the urgency for small and midsized institutions to accelerate their digital evolution; both in terms of customer experience andworkplace culture. As this constantlyconnected generational cohort enters adulthood their digitalpreferences (e.g. mobileonly immediacy personalization security) and pragmatic independentpersonalities will challenge financial service managers and marketers alike.       Jim Perry Consultant and Strategist for Market Insights    2018 will see banks getting much more serious about digitizing their current analogprocesses with a particular focus on their commercial customers and on mobile.Loan processing account opening service subscriptions problem resolution andonetomany payments are all examples of current processes that are ripe to bereimagined in order to gain speed efficiency and scale.       Chris Nichols Chief Strategy Officer at CenterState Bank   Especially for emerging markets around the world there will be increased importance of themobile channel and increasingly the growth of smartphones changing access to banking (andfinancial services in general). The use of new ways to interact with customers and increasinglythe use of chatbots will be a key trend.       John Owens Senior Advisor for Digital Financial Advisory Services    Financial institutions will pull back from dramatic changes and take a more practical approach tothe industry   s challenges such as service delivery and channel utilization. With 2018 being theyear of small business banking there will be increased investment in technology (or partneringwith fintech firms) to simplify business loan processes using branch staffs for selling theseservices.       David Kerstein Founder of Peak Performance Group4. Embracing PSD2 and Open API BankingWhile APIs are not new to banking and are nothing more than a structurefor how software applications should interact they provide the gateway forinnovative contextual solutions that would be difficult to offer without OpenBanking. As outlined by the World Retail Banking Report 2017 published byCapgemini in conjunction with  Efma there are three types of APIs1.  Private APIs These are APIs that are used within the traditionalbanking organization reducing friction and enhancing operational efficiency. A vast majority(88%) of banks viewed private APIs as essential in 2015.2.  Partner APIs These are usually between a bank and specific thirdparty partners enablingthe expansion of product lines channels etc.3.  Open APIs In this scenario business data is made available to third parties that many nothave a formal relationship with the bank. Because of the structure of open APIs manybanks have a greater concern around security.Most banks ease into the use of APIs moving from private to partner and sometimes to openAPIs. It is believed that over time APIs will evolve to the more extensive options in response tothe consumer desire for greater digital solutions not currently provided by legacy organizations.This will also occur as both fintechs and traditional banking organizations understand that theyneed each others strengths. This collaboration will enable both banking organizations and fintechfirms to offer more to customers than previously possible.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report Deloitte believes there are four distinct strategic options for banks and credit unions in the future.In two scenarios an institution remains in control of the customer/member relationship. In theother two products and distribution become unbundled.Incumbent as a fullservice providerIncumbent as a utilityIncumbent as a supplierIncumbent as an interfaceIt must be mentioned that the options are not mutually exclusive. Organizations may want to playin multiple quadrants. For instance they may want to be a supplier of services as well offeringproducts in a thirdparty interface. Perhaps the greatest risk of open banking is that it will allow consumers and merchants toexecute direct transactions without going through banks making it more difficult for banks to havea full view of the customer transactions and maintain customer relationships. It is hoped that theopen banking concept can avoid this demise as traditional banks and fintech firms work togetherto build the customer   s trust and offer products and services that will improve a consumer   slifestyle.The foundation of these partnerships will be the data that can be collected and cultivated for thebenefit of the customer the bank and the fintech firms. If applied diligently the improvement incustomer experience could be the differentiator that retains the overall banking (and nonbanking)relationship.   As PSDII enters in force at the beginning of the year some truths will be revealedabout the effects of such imprecise regulation about the misplaced expectations ofsome startups and about the real open banking strategy of the European banks.Over the year I expect the bumps in the road to open banking to get smoother as new players learn to work together and deliver banking services in new ways. Therest of the world will be watching and learning from this.       Andra Sonea Solutions Architect at Anthemis Group   The era of Open Banking is upon us. Banks have moved beyond exploration with Fintechcompanies and moved towards established partnerships. This evolution will continue in 2018 asconsumers move closer to having the power to completely customize their banking relationship.       Matt Wilcox  SVP Marketing Strategy and Innovation at  Fiserv   We   ll reach peak API excitement but despite the investment there won   t be many successstories from banks opening their APIs just yet as they realize its not a case of    build it and theywill come!   .       James Haycock  Managing Director at  Adaptive Lab   The rise of open banking will force banks to decide whether they want to be the interface (incontrol of the relationship) or the pipe (providing third party ecosystems) with digitally savvyproduct and systems. Big internet players will test the water and offer unbundled financialservices to support their core business (eg payment services lending).       Paolo Barbesino SVP and Head of Digital at Unicredit   I believe 2018 will be a year of demistifying open banking driven by API whenmany institutions will start seeing it as a new channel of customer acquisition andengagement rather than a threat that will diminish their business.       Sonia Wedrychowicz Head of Technology Consumer Banking Group at DBS BankGet the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report   I   m looking forward to U.S. specific    lessons learned    from the PSD2 enforcement in the UK. Asusual we will bastardize the guidelines to fit our unique needs. But open banking is comingwhether we like it or not.       Sam Maule Managing Director North America at 11FS   2018 will be the point of no return due to PSD2. This will place banks and fintech services intoequal positions thus taking user experience design to the forefront as the main edge ofcompetition.       Alex Kreger CEO of UX Design Agency   European MiFID2 and PSD2 will realize internationally the need and opportunities of digitalwealth management accelerating all B2B and B2C wealthtech trends.       Paolo Sironi Director at IBM Watson Financial Services   As the fintech ecosystem gets more complex and end users look for more selfservice tools the    platformification    of digital banking will be a trend that will bringconsumer business and employee under one single solution to save money and lower the maintenance/complexity of managing disparate systems.       Tom Shen CEO of Malauzai Software   We   ll reach peak API excitement but despite the investment there won   t be many successstories from banks opening their APIs just yet as they realize its not a case of    build it and theywill come!   .       James Haycock Managing Director at Adaptive Lab   Open Banking will be a massive game changer. The best hope is that banks become the nextfinancial platform     finance 2.0     offering consumers more choice and competition. Worst casescenario is that the big tech giants (Google Facebook Apple Amazon etc.) will leverage theirdata and open platform to dominate the market.       Liz Lumley Global Fintech Commentator and Adisor to Financial Services Industry   Open banking is the dawn of the next wave of banking like we haven   t known before. Newentrants will be able to access interesting new sources of data and make payments andold incumbents will be pushed to embrace the next wave of digital     with the result beingintelligent digital services either as an end to end experience or as part of adistributed ecosystem. This is the year that David and Goliath will win but which one wins mostis going to be the most interesting thing to see. Its way too close to call.       David Brear CEO and Founder of 11FS   PSD2 and open banking represents a huge opportunity for change and innovation in the comingyear. Benefits will come to organizations with a PSD2ready API and regulatory permissions toopen a marketplace which collects and connects other financial services providers all within thebanking app.       Anne Boden CEO of Starling Bank   The frontlines in the battle for the new customer will shift in 2018. Tomorrow   sconversational commerce AI and big data will transform the Facebooks AmazonsGoogles and Apples of the world into the key gateways for new customers. Theonly way to compete will be through real customer insights from personas/journeysand integration requiring API ready infrastructure.       Craig McLaughlin President of Extractable   The availability of APIs is a game changer for the industry as FIs gain the ability to decouplefrom inflexible vendor development processes and take more control over customer experience.       Alpine Jennings Director Deposits at State Farm Bank5. Building Fintech Partnerships In the past many traditional banking organizations looked at fintech startups as more of a nuisance than a threat. Today many are viewing thesenontraditional providers as a threat as well as either a partner or potentialacquisition.In its latest Global Fintech Report PwC found that 88% of legacy banking organizations fearlosing revenue to financial technology companies in areas such as payments money transfersand personal loans. The amount of business at risk has grown to an estimated 24% of revenues.In related DeNovo   s research from PwC it was found that 30% of consumers plan to increasetheir usage of nontraditional financial services providers with only 39% planning to continueusing solely traditional service organizations. This is an additional wakeup call to legacyorganizations to determine how they will retain the key components of an existing bankingrelationship.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report In response to this threat 82% of traditional financial organizations stated a plan to increasecollaboration with fintech companies in the next three to five years. Similarly almost 50% offinancial services firms are planning to acquire fintech startups over the same period.Fintech startups realize that it takes more than a great solution to attract a scalable customerbase. To reach beyond early adopters and the techsavvy takes massive amounts of capital forpromotion and product support. Partnering with an established banking organization who willsupport the expansion of users among their client base seems like a logical means to an end.Alternatively legacy banking organizations struggle to keep up with consumer expectations. Sizeorganizational structure (silos) and even traditional leadership styles hamper the ability to deliverthe new digital solutions consumers receive from other industries. Partnering with a fintechstartup alleviates some of these issues allowing the established organization an opportunity tokeep pace with marketplace demands.Fintech collaboration is not about grabbing for the    next shiny object        it   s about intuitive productdesign ease of use and 24/7 accessibility.   Vendors that create marketplaces to aggregate/integrate enterprise banking appsand tools for banks and credit unions     will gain traction in 2018. FIs will moreeasily integrate and deploy bestofbreed solutions reduce their reliance on a singlelarge core provider differentiate their offering by offering a wider range of choices totheir customers and find effective and efficient approaches to core transformation.       Ron Shevlin Director of Research at Cornerstone Advisors Inc.Read More Banking Options Narrow Partner or Acquire Fintech Firms   Banks will put pressure on core providers to become more open and accommodating resultingin the core   s increasing appetite to acquire fintech digital banking and data companies. Thecores will begin proving they can support the changing needs of the banking industry.       Bryan Clagett CMO at Geezeo   Collaboration between fintech startups and financial services organizations will heat up furtherfueled by regulatory changes such as PSD2 and by industry groups like TruSight.  Thechallenges of fintech firms    scaling up and the FIs    innovation are addressed by partnerships. Regulatory changes should also aide in making collaborations easier.       Alex Jimenez VP and Senior Strategist at Zions Bancorporation   Banks will be more open to the idea of partnering with fintech firms incumbent vendors andeven competitors and they   ll actually begin to enter into partnerships. Like any new skillpartnering will take practice but those financial institutions that do it well will have a significantadvantage over the competition both traditional and new.       Dan Latimore SVP of Banking at Celent    In 2018 we will see more financial institutions working together on innovationprojects. They are finally warming up to the idea that they don   t have to inventeverything in house and that the network effect can be very valuable for certainefforts as we saw with Zelle in 2017. Professionally managed consortia will allowmore institutions to make up lost ground on the innovation leaders.       JP Nicols Managing Director at Fintech Forge   More core providers will begin to embrace the API like FIS has done with Code Connect. Thiswill create healthy tension that exist between data aggregators digital banking providers andnimble startups who all want a financial institution   s business. The net result will be cheaper andfaster collaboration between a financial institution and their chosen technology partners.       Keith Armstrong CoFounder of Abe AI   The banking industry will follow the path of the computing industry whereby the most successfulplayers morphed from a build model to a buy model. The most successful banks and creditunions will learn to better position and build their brands and enable a new era of banking byharnessing unlimited innovation from fintech providers.       Don MacDonald CMO at MX   Fintech startups merging with more successful fintech players or hoping to bebought by incumbents will be one of the biggest trends in 2018. AI and machinelearning will play an increasingly key role for the startups as well as for theincumbents differentiating winners from losers in an increasingly competitiveenvironment.       Spiros Margaris Founder of Margaris Advisory   After years of aggressive costcutting due to the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis banks willlook to partner with bank technology and fintech providers that provide solutions that can directlyimpact revenue. Digital lending and account origination will be the early areas of focus.       David Gerbino Principal of @dmgconsulting   More banks will see fintech startups as an    enabler    rather than a    disruptor    and there will bemore collaborative initiatives between banks and startups. More banks will focus on digitaltransformation as a key strategic agenda rather than focusing on digital innovation in a limitedemerging technology area.       Makato Shibata Head of Global Innovation at Bank of TokyoMitsubishi UFJ   Big retail players will realize they don   t have the technology or the reach to capture datapreviously only available through financial institutions or third parties and will collaborate morewith startups. It will be the year of Fintech for people.       Matteo Rizzi CoFounder of FinTechStage Limited   The innovation function grows up and moves from the Lab to the Factory. Bank IT teams will meld with business and deliver new solutions by using ideation design development andbusiness modeling into a complete ability to deliver customer ready solutions. This is the end ofinnovation islands and will be the only way to deliver true financial services innovation.       Dion Lisle VP Head of Fintech at CapGemini   While there has been a perceived slow down in venture capital fintech investmentstartup activity corporate partnership investment and experimentation with smallertechnology players will not slow down in 2018. Many banks will need sherpas andinterpreters to bring these activities inside the bank to change the culture fromwithin.       Bradley Leimer Managing Director and Head of Fintech Strategy at Explorer Advisory andCapital   2018 will be a year of stretching limits for fintech partnerships.Banks want bigger impact fromfintech technologies and bigger/faster results and they will invest heavily in technologies andtools that can create a humanlike experience across all channels. This may also be the year theregtech space finally gets the attention it deserves.       Devie Mohan CoFounder and CEO of Burnmark   2018 will see deep integration of AI/ML into fintech and financial processes. Fintech as anindustry will mature significantly making 2018 the year when fintech will leave puberty behind.       Alex Nechoroskovas Founder of Fintech Summary6. Expansion of Digital PaymentsDespite increased adoption of digital payments cash remains a primary formof payment for many especially for lowvalue transactions and by certaindemographic groups. Attributes of cash contributing to continued use includespeed universal acceptance anonymity lack of fees etc. Some emergingmarkets also still lack a modern payments infrastructure while certaincultures don   t have trust in the banking system. In other words the reportsof the death of cash are still exaggerated.While epayments are expected to grow at a CAGR of 17.6% from 2015     2019 the yearlygrowth rate is expected to decrease as more transactions move to mobile payments (mpayments). Mobile payments are expected to have a CAGR of 21.8% from 2015     2019 helpedby an increased proliferation of mobile devices. As with many of the payment trends the impactof China on growth numbers is significant.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report The integration of customer analytics improved fraud management dynamic wallet solutions andother valueadded services will have a positive impact on both the consumer and the merchant. Itis expected that ongoing improvement in biometrics and secure payments will become mandatoryin the future while integration realtime financial management solutions will becomecommonplace.Finally as fintech firms continue to bypass traditional value chain components traditional financialservices organizations will need to determine if they should partner with buy or ignore these newcompetitors. Given that most of the fintech activity in the payments space has targeted the mostlucrative components of the payment value chain significant decisions are necessary. There is no clear path to success in the new payments ecosystem with many variablesopportunities and challenges still in an embryonic state. It does seem to be clear that success willrequire collaboration between players and markets. Especially as new technologies and newstructures of solutions emerge in connection with open banking APIs AI and big dataorganizations will need to determine their best role in the new ecosystem.In the end the consumer and commercial marketplace will determine the winners but there aretremendous opportunities for firms that embrace collaboration of insight and solutions to developan improved valueadded proposition that can address the need for speed insight and security.   With the fastpaced development of applications technology and recent upgradesto Apply Pay we can expect mobile payments to continue to grow at a rapid pace.With the surge of Cyber Security data breaches on the rise it will be essential thatthese mobile payment applications and systems be put through vigorous securitytests performed by thirdparty auditors.       Michael Fisher Fulltime Analyst at TechCPU   Adoption of alternative payment technologies will expand exponentially as consumers ditch cashfor the convenience and security of emerging payment methods including contactless paymentsdigital wallets and biometric verification.       Todd Linden CEO of Paysafe Group   With most larger U.S. banks utilizing the Zelle platform we will start to see a tremendousacceleration to digital payments especially P2P. The benefit of having a common set of railsacross the majority of the largest banks in the U.S. allowing seamless payments to the majorityof U.S. banking clients cannot be overemphasized. Watch out cash!       James Anthos SVP and Director of Strategic Planning at BB&T   PayPal and Venmo will see major competition with the continued roll out of Zelle and the moveto (near) realtime payments transfer. All solutions will likely continue to grow but it will beinteresting to see if Zelle is able to penetrate into known Venmo demographics.       Chris Fleischer Director at Fiserv   2018 will see the consumer adoption of P2P payments accelerate to the point that this way ofpayment becomes a serious alternative to existing payment methods such as cash and cards.       Ron van Wezel Senior Analyst at Aite Group   2018 will see the first deployments of realtime retail payments platformspowered exclusively by mobile phone access. Driven by financial inclusion thesesuperscalable and ultra lowcost platforms will connect mobile wallets toinstitutional payers and merchants as well as traditional bank accounts. Theseplatforms will also enable easy access to payments for the new applications of thefuture such as the solar battery leasing companies transport companies and others.       Konstantin Peric Deputy Director of Financial Services at Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation7. Navigating Compliance and Regulatory ChangesSimilar to what we saw in 2017 most banks and credit unions worldwideare continuing to do business under a cloud of regulatory uncertainty that isexpected to a challenge for the foreseeable future. Even though lawmakersand regulators aren   t expected to make many definitive changes mostfinancial institutions continue to do their best to meet risk and complianceparameters and supervisory expectations.Since most institutions realize that they don   t have the ability to wait to see how things willeventually end up many banking organizations are making progress trying to keep in alignmentwith what is anticipated from a risk and business perspective. As one banker stated this pastyear we are in a position to    beg for forgiveness    rather than    asking for permission.   According to Deloitte    Banking organizations need to keep moving forward as planned withdeliberate linkage between regulatory strategy; business strategy; and building infrastructure forgovernance regulatory reporting and risk management that scales and is flexible.The good newsis that many of the changes banking organizations are currently implementing make good sensefrom a business perspective   not just a regulatory perspective   and are worth doing no matterhow the future unfolds.   Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report   Regulatory and consumer attitudes to data protection controls and data sharingare undergoing important changes in many markets around the world and especiallyin Europe (e.g. PSD2 and GDPR). Managing customer consent for data usage anddata sharing is rapidly becoming a critical skill for banks. While regulatorycompliance matters forwardlooking banks will be thinking beyond compliance andseeking to turn customer consent into a valuable asset..       Zilvinas Bareisis Senior Analyst at Celent   The complexities and nuances of data management privacy and security will come to a head forfinancial institutions and fintech. Both will need to assure data platforms are designed around theprinciples of transparency and trust as governments role in oversight continues to evolve.       Bryan Clagett CMO of Geezeo   The most exciting activities in banking are happening in Asian markets where commerce andfinancial services are blending within new everyday customer experiences and where governmentregulatory activities are encouraging and directly involved in innovation. The policies of the U.S. and Western Europe need to more rapidly evolve or else the banking and technology centers ofinnovation will continue to shift eastward.       Bradley Leimer Managing Director and Head of Fintech Strategy at Explorer Advisory andCapital   I worry about FIs response to regulators    review of sales practices in the wake of Wells Fargo.Especially at a time when alternative service providers are expanding. Banks can illafford anoverreaction here.      Alpine Jennings Director Deposits at State Farm Bank8. Exploring Advanced TechnologiesAt a time when most organizations are still playing catchup a new waveof digital technology has the potential to change the way organizationsdeliver banking services even further. These new technologies includeartificial intelligence (AI) the internet of things (IoT) blockchain openbanking platforms with application program interfaces (APIs) and roboticprocess automation (RPA).With the potential to increase efficiency decrease costs and enhance the customer experiencethese digitalenabled technologies will result in disruption of the way people do their banking andpotentially what organizations deliver these services. We are already seeing organizations testingmany of these digital technologies hoping to win the battle to become the    bank of the future.   As quickly as past technologies have become the norm a new wave of emerging technologieswill combine digital technologies and the power of data to set new standards. According to PwCthese    essential eight    technologies includeThe Internet of Things (IoT)Artificial Intelligence (AI)Robotics3D PrintingAugmented RealityVirtual RealityDronesBlockchainObviously the prioritization and investment in each of these technologies will vary based on theindustry business model and strategic goals of each organization. For instance while themarketplace as a whole does not foresee investing much in blockchain technology the financialservices industry ranks this as a high priority. That said investment in emerging technologies as a percentage of overall technology investmenthas not increased since 2007 (across industries). In fact the share of the overall technologybudget that is allocated to emerging technology is only 17.8% according to the PwC research.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends ReportEspecially for the financial services industry it is imperative to think beyond individual emergingtechnologies. With the advent of open banking APIs as a way to bring external technologies andinnovations directly to banking customers and the emergence of nontraditional bankingecosystems that may include nonbanking services combinations of technologies will become thenorm.For instance the use of customer data insights and advanced analytics may be combined withIoT technologies to allow payments directly from smart home devices. Likewise the the expandeduse of conversational AI and VR devices may come together providing methods of banking interactions only imagined in scifi movies.Being a leader in emerging technology is no longer a luxury only for the big players. It isimportant for all financial organizations to make emerging technology a    core competency    withengagement throughout the organization (not just the very top). In addition the focus of everyimplementation much be both internal and external human experiences as opposed to revenueprofit and cost savings.   Artificial Intelligence is an    event horizon    for financial services. You just cannotspeculate on what is beyond the introduction of true AI in the financial sector. Why?Because the customers will have robots too. How exactly will the bank   s robot goabout selling a pension to my robot? My robot couldn   t care less about the free penthe nice advertisement on television or the reassuring mahogany in the advisor   soffice.       David Birch Director of Innovation at Consult Hyperion   The most exciting of technology trend as it enables unprecedented speed of innovation andrequires a severe cultural change is the DevOps evolution of many banks. This may be thesingle most important change to banking in the next few years.      Duena Blomstrom Chief Growth Officer Marketplace at Temenos   In 2018 chatbots will become mainstream and grow out of the bankowned channels (e.g.bank   s website internet banking mobile banking) and into the conversational platforms customersuse most often. These platforms include messaging apps (e.g. Facebook Messenger LINE etc)and personal intelligent assistants (e.g. Google Assistant Amazon Alexa etc.).       Danny Tang Channel Transformation Leader Global Banking at IBM   I see 2018 as a year of wide application of AIdriven solutions that will be mostlyvoicedriven fast development of biometric authentication with special focus onfacial recognition and voice as well as a boom of commercial applications ofblockchain especially in SME and trade finance areas.       Sonia Wedrychowicz Head of Technology Consumer Banking Group at DBS Bank   Virtual (VR) augmented (AR) and mixed reality (MR) will enable a 4th wave of computing powervia a spatial computing revolution that integrates disruptive technologies such as sensors BigData the cloud AI and wearables. Together with other innovation accelerators     AI robotics BigData and wearables     AR/VR/MR will drive efficiencies transform established sectors andcreate new business opportunities.       Dennis Gada Regional Head Financial Services at Infosys9. Competing with New Challengers Modestsized fintech firms and large tech giants continue to make retailbanking inroads worldwide providing services that leverage the best indigital technology to deliver a customer experience that removescumbersome steps from both routine and more involved bankingengagements. Relative financial newcomers like AliPay (China) WeChat(China) Rakuten (Japan) Atom (UK) Monzo (UK) Starling (UK) N26(Germany) and Revolut (UK) have joined household names like PayPalAmazon and Google to disrupt the banking ecosystem leveraging modern infrastructures andinnovative cultures.According to Bain    Many of the tech giants possess the ingredients of success digital prowesslarge customer bases organizations well versed in improving the customer experience andample leeway to extend their corporate brands into banking.    More concerning may be that someof these firms are generating a level of trust previously reserved only for traditional banks andcredit unions. As a result an increasing percentage of consumers are willing to use financialproducts offered from these nontraditional firms     especially where the experience is superior tothat offered by legacy organizations.It is expected that demand for products and services from fintech firms and large tech companieswill only increase as more consumers become familiar with new digital offerings. This isespecially true for younger consumers who have grown up with digital devices. More and morepeople will get annoyed when they   re forced by bank policies and processes to use nondigitalchannels for everyday banking business states the Bain research. This includes rudimentarytransactions as well as being able to open new accounts or apply for loans.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends Report The best way to prepare for the inevitable increase in competition that the continued expansion ofbanking services offered by Amazon Google PayPal Facebook and an increasing number ofstartup banks will bring is to be proactive in the development of personalized digital solutions.This will most likely involve new partnerships inside and outside of traditional bankingorganizations and a redefinition of what a banking ecosystem includes.In other words if banks don   t reorient their approach and radically accelerate their rate ofprogress loyalty will suffer and they will watch technology firms poach more business.Meanwhile their economics will erode as too many routine transactions continue to flow throughexpensive branch and callcenter networks.There is a great advantage in the customer and member insights that traditional financialinstitutions possess. The key is to apply these insights in ways that directly and positively impactthe digital experience similar to how large tech firms currently improve shopping social searchand payments.   The most significant change in the financial services industry next year will be theentry of 4th gen competitors. Not banks not fintech firms and not tech giants butleftfield players challenging banking indirectly with their own virtual currencyecosystems. Expect plays from the likes of Lego Starbucks Disney McDonalds CocaCola Shell & Budweiser.       Chris Gledhill CEO and CoFounder of Secco    In 2018 we will see one of the tech platform players (Amazon Alibaba Tencent Baidu GoogleMicrosoft Facebook etc ) make a move in Fintech that will make all existing FinTech startupinnovations look futile.       Peter Vander Auwera Founder Petervan Productions   In 2018 open banking will move forward significantly in some markets. At the same time firmssuch as Alipay will expand internationally with both Alipay and Amazon pushing their paymentsolutions and getting into lending and other services.       Alain Enault General Manager and Program Director at Efma   Ecommerce and payments giants from China (Tencent Alibaba) will make significant inroads inthe U.S. market raising the stakes for Amazon and WalMart and just about everybody in thepayments space. Consumers will benefit from new digitalenabled experiences simplifiedpayment options and heightened competition.       Steven Ramirez President of Beyond the Arc   2018 will see a US fintech get a full bank charter. Whether it   s with the OCC fintechcharter or SoFi is succesful in getting an industrial bank charter it will happen oneway or another. .       Bryan Yurcan Senior Writer at The American Banker    Insurance will stay on top of fintech trends in 2018 as the industry faces a challenge togenerate and collect more data on customers. We will see more incumbants developingecosystems of tech/startups/partnerships around them to build the next insurance generation andbetter compete with new players (GAFABATX).

Testing Blockchain TechnologiesSatoshi Nakamoto the unknown person or persons who designed thecryptocurrency went on to say    digital signatures provide part of thesolution but the main benefits are lost if a trusted third party is stillrequired to prevent doublespending    in the original whitepaper.In the proposed solution the    network timestamps transactions by hashingthem into an ongoing chain of hashbased proofofwork forming a recordthat cannot be changed.    He further described the concept of miners where    a majority of CPUpower    would generate the longest chain and outpace attackers or malicious intent.Today blockchain is no longer just about bitcoin or the broader category of cryptocurrency; it   s anexploded view of the underlying technology. It   s unique and differentiated in that it   s an immutableledger with a single version of the truth of the transaction.And unlike other immutable datastores it is also a shared or distributed ledger across a peertopeer private or public network. It leverages a consensus mechanism to create permanent recordsof transactions through a distributed and decentralized network removing the need for a centralauthority.Ultimately it intends to create a trustless exchange of goods services and/or real assets in amore trustworthy way. And with a potentially much lower cost of transaction.Get the 2018 Retail Banking Trends ReportWhy should we all care? While financial services is the sector most likely to be disruptedblockchain technology is poised to improve customer experience streamline product featuresand enable our global economic system to reshape market structures that will impact us fromWall Street to Main Street.Financial services marketers retail bankers product managers and customer service executiveswill all be impacted by the progress of blockchain technology. One of the first overarching impactscould be in the development of a system of universal identity verification that will impacteverything from new account opening to cybersecurity. Leaders must be prudent and act now in evaluating blockchain as the types of deploymentsevolve while regulators need to reevaluate policies and processes given the enhancedtransparency the technology promises.Read More What is Blockchain    And Why Should I Care?   It has long been anticipated that blockchain will eventually transform the way wetransact     largely by automating processing and reducing costs.  2018 will be theyear banks get real traction with their blockchain initiatives and when we see banksimplement solutions that address areas like KYC loan fulfillment and crossborderpayments.       Nick Bilodeau Head of Insurance in Canada for American Express   2018 is when banks start to realize the value of crypto currencies and start offering mainstreamwallet services for normal people to store their crypto currencies. The current offerings (likecoinbase) have so much friction  that this market is ripe for taking for banks.       Deva Annamalai Director Innovation and Client Engagement for Fiserv   Blockchain will definitely see the light in banking in the field of Supply Chain Finance savingtedious paper work reducing settlement times risks fraud and costs and increasingtransparency.       Maria Jose Jorda Garcia Chief Innovation Officer at BBVA Microfinance Foundation   The hype around block chain and specifically bitcoin has risen to fever pitch. The trend nextyear will be to consolidate interest in blockchain as a technology having the capacity todisintermediate many financial services companies altogether.       Don Peppers Futurist and Founder of CXSpeakers   Blockchain technology will start to be used more extensively in the financialservices industry in 2018. Permissioned distributed ledgers will be used for thesharing of contracts documents data and the processing of certain payments. Thenthe technology will fade into the background just another piece of the IT machineryfor many companies.       Penny Crosman Editor at Large for American Banker   2018 will be the advent of the Hashgraph (blockchain competitor) opening disconcerting cases ofdecentralized use of applications such as micropayments distributed capital markets livecollaboration applications distributed MMOs auctions and more.       Jean Baptiste LeFevre Intrapreneur for BNP ParibasSome Closing Thoughts from Our Panel   The monetization of underused resources that started with Uber and Airbnb will become mainstream in financial services. Thanks to secure decentralized systems untapped sources ofindividual capital can be invested and lent in new ways. The larger trend behind that is theemerging tokenization of the economy.       Sebastien Meunier Senior manager at Chappus Holder & Co.   The great advancements we saw in finance digitalization and fintech creation will strongly impactfinancial inclusion in 2018 helping democratizing finance for the 2 billion adults missing in thegame. It is time for a new digitized banking ecosystem to reach more people allowing for morebusiness creation and economy improvement.       Maria Jose Jorda Garcia Chief Innovation Officer at BBVA Microfinance Foundation   Diversity and inclusion will become a primary topic in board room discussions and strategicplans. Seats at the boardroom table will be a new metric that matters.  And yes the 2017 climateimpacted this dynamic.       Lisa Kuhn Phillips VP at Allied Payments Network   2018 should be a year of very visible divergence where the most techsavvy companies willaccelerate their investments in innovation and new strategies while those slower to adapt will justtry to automate their processes.       Huy Nguyen Trieu CEO of The Disruptive Group   2018 will be known as the year of action. There   s been a lot of conversations meetings demosplans etc but there is an urgency now to get projects planned and funded to create newcustomized engagement models and variety of products/services from which to choose formore personalized client experience.       April Rudin Founder and CEO at The Rudin Group   There is an ever growing talent gap that is keeping banks and credit unions frommaximizing their digital growth potential.
