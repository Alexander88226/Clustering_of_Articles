decades we have experienced the entrance of Internet social media and mobile devices that have changed the way we interact with people and things. This revolution has taken longer to penetrate however after the global Financial Crisis of 2008 that deeply affected the banking sector forcing financial Authorities to impose high restrictions for bank lending this revolution has involved many areas of business with particular focus on financial services and payments.  The unavailability of bank financing pushed individuals and SMEs to find alternative solutions to finance and in this context Fintech industry developed.   Fintech is a term coming from the contraction of two words \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTechnology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and refers to all companies that apply technological innovations to financial services sectors. This industry is fragmented into many sectors offering products and services to a broad range of customers and in the case of financial services Alternative Finance is the Fintech area that is bringing the most important innovations in terms of finance by using online marketplaces that work by matching the demand of borrowers with the offers of investors and lenders. Alternative Finance  is  characterized  by  many  subsectors  Crowdfunding  Online  Invoice  Trading Merchant  finance  Payments  and  Trade  Finance  which  differ  on  their  business  models  but mutually  shares  some  features  such  as  the  fact  of  being  totally  webbased  and  nonbank players. Basically they offer products and services as banks but leverage customer experience. Indeed with the advent of Digital Revolution customers have changed their minds so that their new expectations rely on joining digital experiences in almost everything they do and while banks are still retarded Fintech companies are able to offer customers what they want.   Today the market is characterized by the presence of more than 1250 nonbank players across the world and the expansion of Alternative Finance has moved also towards emerging countries.  According  to  that  the  situation  for  retail  banking  is  not  so  wealthy.  Banks  are  facing  the competition of new challengers and have to choose how to deal with it whether to fight or collaborate with them.   In next chapters we will go deeply with the analysis of Alternative Finance focusing on how such phenomenon is revolutionizing the banking sector. In particular the first chapter will give an overview of the economic and financial environment where SMEs and banks have to survive. The second chapter will focus on having a more understanding about Fintech industry and factors that make Fintech a revolution.  \\t \\xc2\\xa09\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cFollowing chapter will focus on the analysis of Alternative Finance in terms of market shares and understanding of its main subsectors. To better understand how they work chapter four will provide a description per each business model of Alternative Finance and an additional case study.  Among the different business models characterizing Alternative Finance particular attention will be given to PeertoPeer lending and Invoice Trading which represent the main sources of alternative finance for SMEs and for these will be provided specific show cases.  For  what  it  concerns  the  PeertoPeer  lending  option  I  experienced  a  real  online  loan application on the web site of an Italian leading platform and I also interviewed one of the key staff of the same platform to gather more information about the operating process.  For what it concerns the Invoice trading instead I interviewed the key staff of another Italian startup that recently entered the market and got some information about their business. Chapter  five  will  give  an  overview  of  the  state  of  art  of  the  regulatory  framework  both European and percountry to understand how regulation is approaching the phenomenon of Alternative Finance and what are the main differences across countries. The end chapter will finally provide a SWOT Analysis of Fintech and Alternative Finance industries and the analysis of potential banking solutions to approach them. \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0 10\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cChapter  I  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  OVERVIEW  OF  THE  ECONOMIC  AND  FINANCIAL ENVIRONMENT AFTER THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL CRISIS The economic and financial environment where we live is characterized by on one side the presence of large and small businesses driving the economy of each country but that cannot find financing and on the other side the presence of banking industry that is now in troubles suffering from the advent of digitalization and technological changes.  This chapter provides an overview of the economic and financial environment in the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008. I.1|Overview on Small and medium enterprises  Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) represent the major drivers of the economic activity and employment  in  most  developing  economies  as  well  as  a  way  to  improve  innovation  and technology.  A report of the World Economic Forum1 shows that the amount of micro small and medium enterprises in emerging markets varies between 365 and 445 million out of which 25 million to 30 million are formal SMEs and 55 million to 70 million are formal microenterprises. In developed markets it is possible to estimate approximately 100 million formal SMEs. I.2|Overview on the banking industry Generally when we talk about banking we think about international institutions that operate across  the  world  offering  services  that  range  from  checking  account  lending  financing payments  processing  and  wealth  management.  When  we  talk  about  banks  we  think  about complex products like derivatives CDOs CDS and the presence of a large physical branch network.  Besides  family  and  friends  bank  financing  has  always  been  the  most  important  source  of external  finance  for  individuals  and  businesses.  Normally  large  companies  with  profitable investments  and  collaterals  have  easier  access  to  bank  financing  while  small  and  medium enterprises (SMEs) often do not because they are always considered highrisk firms. This is because  as  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWorld  Economic  Forum\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  highlights  in  its  report  finances  of  SMEs  are characterized  by  high  complexity  and  low  scale  which  lead  banks  to  limit  their  lending services.  Generally SMEs have to deal with many issues such as securing loanterm funding handling \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa01 WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM (October 2015) The Future of FinTech   A Paradigm Shift in Small Business Finance available online at http//www3.weforum.org .  \\t \\xc2\\xa011\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0clate payments managing working capital and taking care of collections and; because of that they  need  money  but  specific  challenges  limit  traditional  bank  lending  to  SMEs.  Reasons behind this are related to the fact that SMEs usually lack internal skills and resources to manage finance and to conduct systematic fundraising.  Literature highlights two main problems. The first is characterized by information asymmetry as a result of a lack of supporting a solid financial information infrastructure. Often SMEs do not produce audited financial statements that yield credible financial information for a bank to assess  the  financial  situation.  Furthermore  for  smaller  enterprises  the  line  of  separation between the finances of the owner and those of the business is usually indistinct. A second challenge can be considered the principal/agent problem particularly acute in the case of SMEs. Once financing is received the entrepreneur may use funds in ways different than those for which it was intended. In other words the high intrinsic risk of the entrepreneur may exceed the risk appetite of the banks which consequently reject the financing requests. I.3|The negative effects of the Global Financial Crisis on lending activity In the aftermath of the Global Financial Crisis of 2008 the above situation exacerbated. The Great Recession had severe effects. Fist governments dropped their interest rates to nearly 0%. Second banks reduced credit concession and cut back significantly on the risk they were willing to take with loans due to a strengthening in bank regulation imposed by Basel III which aims at avoid further collapses (more details on Basel III are provided in Appendix A). Third a worsening of credit ratings for businesses.  This context just made it even more difficult than typical for small and medium size businesses getting capital. \\t \\xc2\\xa012\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cFigure  1  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  Credit  restriction  between  2008  and  2014  and  analysis  of  qualitative  index  on European credit restriction  Average quarterly Credit restriction 15%  (*) 1 significant loosening; +1 significant restriction  Source \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Ronchi S. (June 16 2014) Supply Chain Finance Nuove opportunit\\xc3\\xa0 di collaborazione nella filiera According to the World Economic Forum in the United States SMEs loans as a percentage of all bank business loans fell from 35% to 24% while in Europe the borrowing costs for SMEs increased  by  150%.  A  proportion  of  45%  to  55%  of  worldwide  SMEs  do  not  have  a  loan overdraft but would need one while 21% to 24% have a loan but suffers significantly financial contractions.  The above situation is similar for Italy. An article2 by \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIl Sole 24 Ore\\xe2\\x80\\x9d states that in 2009 the number of SMEs that obtained financing from banks moved from 642% to 29% and 238% in 2013. In addiction the situation is worsened by the interest rates charged by banks higher than those  paid  by  larger  enterprises.  Furthermore  between  2008  and  2013  banks  and  other financial  institutions  started  to  select  customers  basing  on  severe  creditworthiness  criteria limiting the access to credit for those SMEs that did not satisfy certain requirements. \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa02\\t \\xc2\\xa0Bartoloni M.

Today it is possible to state that the old banking is broken and that a new world is coming. The reasons why this is happening rely on a series of factors that do not fit well with the era of digitalization and technology revolution based on an easier and faster way to approach every market. The above factors do not prepare banks to survive the revolution that is coming out since they relate to a number of weaknesses of financial institutions such as 1. \\xc2\\xa0 Business models outdated banks rely on systems that are not tech and are not in the Internet space;  2. \\xc2\\xa0 Fraudulent behaviours surveys show that twenty of the world\'s biggest banks have paid more than $200bn in fines for misdeeds ranging from manipulation of currency and interest rate markets and compensating customers who were wrongly sold mortgages in the US or insurance products in Britain; 3. \\xc2\\xa0 No  money  for  shareholders  any  more  while  in  the  past  the  banks  gave  money  to  their shareholders from 7 to 5% today they do not. They try to cut costs however they are still inefficient; 4. \\xc2\\xa0 Absence of innovations the level of innovation coming from the banking sector is paralysed. From mid 1960 when they developed the Automated Teller Machine (ATM) that represented a big surprise for those years the last worthy innovation is represented by the Online banking in 1990; 5. \\xc2\\xa0 Lost of customer trust since the Financial Crisis the level of customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s trust within the banking sector has severely decreased and banks find difficult to reclaim clients who left and retain the ones who remained.

At the same time customers changed their minds and the way to approach products and services becoming more digitalized and enlarging their expectations.  In this situation Fintech companies are emerging and driving a big revolution becoming one of the most powerful tools supporting the growth of businesses and bringing the innovation across all industries.  The current chapter gives a 360degree view on Fintech industry by providing an explanation of drivers value propositions market segmentation and outlooks.  II.1|What is Fintech? The term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinTech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d refers to a dynamic ecosystem whose name derives from a contraction of two  words  Finance  and  Technology  and  defines  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccompanies  that  provide  or  facilitate financial services by using technology3\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  A report4 by KPMG and H2 Ventures defines Fintech companies as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthose companies using technology to the best advantage and driving disruption within the financial services industry. These  companies  have  a  commitment  to  excellence  superior  customer  experience  and  a demonstrated ability to do one thing in a market better than everyone else\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  The financial services sector had always been characterized by the use of technology however with the last innovations this sector witnessed the creation of new and fast growing alternative finance markets that see the use of internet and technological devices for doing business giving space to a proper \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDigital Revolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Basically Fintech has affected most segments of the whole global market with particular focus on Financial Services the epicentre of Fintech disruption (see Figure 3). Fintech companies aim at reach efficient and effective financial solutions at a lower scale by disintermediating  the  role  of  incumbents  such  as  banks  and  servicing  customers  directly through the use of online and mobile channels that are reshaping the way customers access financial products and services by providing solutions that can better address customer needs \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa03\\t \\xc2\\xa0WORLD ECONOMIC FORUM (October 2015) The Future of FinTech   A Paradigm Shift in Small Business Finance available online at http//www3.weforum.org .\\t \\xc2\\xa04\\t \\xc2\\xa0KPMG  H2 Ventures (2015) Fintech 100 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Lending global Fintech innovators Report 2015 available online at http//fintechinnovators.com/uploads/H2FintechInnovators2015.pdf \\t \\xc2\\xa016\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cby offering enhanced accessibility convenience and tailored products.  Figure 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Fintech disruption in Financial sector  Source \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Pwc Global Fintech Report March 2016  II.2|Drivers of Fintech Disruption Fintech revolution depends on many factors. First technological advances that provide new advanced solutions and capabilities that influence consumer behaviour and expectations as well as driving a change within the industry. The penetration of smartphones and internet has been revolutionising the virtual connectivity allowing individuals and businesses\\xe2\\x80\\xa8to connect and doing things in ways previously unknown. Second the Global Financial Crisis that leaded the  public  opinion  to  lose  faith  in  traditional  financial  institutions.  This  has  created  an environment whereby the consumer is open to adopting new business models and products from new  providers  meanwhile  the  crisis  has  leaded  traditional  financial  institutions  to  fail investments in technology and innovation. Third the set of regulatory restrictions imposed on banking sector has been contributing to the worsening of the sector by increasing operating costs of compliance and reducing R&D budgeting.  As a result banks lost competitiveness and have to assist to the entrance onto the markets of nonbanking players which are able to offer alternative financial products and services that can substitute the ones provided by banks and can fill the financing gap widen in the postcrisis environment for startups and SMEs.  These new players are focused on the digital distribution of data through a globalized network that use software and servers.  \\xe2\\x80\\xa8\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa017\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cFigure 4  Drivers of change FINTECH3.Regulatory changes1.Digitalinnovation2.The Global Financial Crisis\\t  II.3| What is Fintech Revolution? When we talk about Fintech Revolution we refer to the great number of success factors that characterize  companies  which  operate  within  such  industry  and  that  outline  the  borders between traditional banking and the new challengers. If on one side there is the banking industry with numerous gaps that lead the consumer to look for other financial providers on the other side there are nonbank players that offer consumers products and services that are similar to those provided by banks but in a different way that exerts a great influence over customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decisions about their financial services providers.  The value proposition of Fintech is based on the following key factors 1. \\xc2\\xa0 Good customer experience with the advent of Internet and mobile devices customers has become \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdigital friendly\\xe2\\x80\\x9d so that they enlarged their expectations on products and services delivery totally based on technology and digital improvements. Fintech offer customers the experience to get what they are looking for in a few minutes wherever they are and in an easy way.  2. \\xc2\\xa0 Faster service Fintech offers products and services in less than a half of the time took by banks; 3. \\xc2\\xa0 Simplification  of  products  processes  and  communication  Fintech  firms  offer simplified  products  than  banks  reduce  the  complexity  behind  banking  industry including  less  bureaucracy  issues  and  allow  consumers  to  have  a  direct  customer \\t \\xc2\\xa018\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cservice with immediate effect; 4. \\xc2\\xa0 Specialization and Personalization Fintech companies limit their offerings on a few core products to a targeted customer audience; 5. \\xc2\\xa0 IT infrastructure Fintech totally operate online by using advanced IT infrastructures including marketplaces that connects one arm of the market (for instance borrowers) with the other arm of the market (for instance Investors); 6. \\xc2\\xa0 Low costs Fintech companies do not have physical infrastructures and consequently no  employees  and  no  taxes.  This  severely  reduces  operating  costs  and  allows  new challengers to invest in high level of innovation. II.4|Segmentation of Fintech market Fintech ecosystem involves many areas of business. A report by McKinsey Panorama5 proposes a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCustomerProduct\\xe2\\x80\\x9d segmentation of this sector.  As the figure shows the targets of customers range from \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRetail\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCommercial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d such as small and mediumsize businesses to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLarge Corporations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that include public and nonbanking institutions.  Products  whereas  range  from  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRevenue  share\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cLending  and  Financing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  to  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSales  and Trading\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The highest concentration of capital invested is in \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPayments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (retail payments) which represent the most important segment characterising Fintech space together with the use of innovative data.  The advent of Internet and mobile technology has significantly changed the way to pay with the  surge  of  new  technologydriven  payment  processes  new  digital  applications  that  make payments easier alternative processing networks and the increased use of electronic devices to transfer money among accounts.  Another  very  important  segment  of  Fintech  landscape  involves  the  use  of  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig  Data  and Advances analytics\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that permit to gather a large flow of information to predict \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnext best actions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Building a comprehensive data ecosystem means to access customer data and have a 360  degree  view  on  customer  activities  and  behaviour.  This  allows  firms  to  leverage  this information to drive decisions across a broad range of actions from customer acquisition to understanding credit scoring. A  high  concentration  of  Fintech  activity  is  also  in  Lending  segment  characterized  by  the emergence of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOnline Platforms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that allow individuals and businesses to lend and borrow \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa05\\t \\xc2\\xa0 McKinsey  &  Company  Cutting  Through  the  FinTech  Noise  Markers  of  Success  Imperatives  For  Banks available  online  at  http//www.mckinsey.com/industries/financialservices/ourinsights/cuttingthroughthenoisearoundfinancialtechnology December 2015 \\t \\xc2\\xa019\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cmoney  among  each  other.  Fintech  innovation  also  manifests  itself  in  the  development  of alternative credit models use of nontraditional data sources and powerful data analytics to price risks and lower operating costs than traditional bank financing.  A  report  by  Accenture6  defines  platforms  in  this  way  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cA  digital  platform  brings  together process people technology and information into a value network that provides consumers and businesses access to an extensive selection of products and services within and across multiple markets.  By  enabling  multiple  parties  to  engage  in  networked  commerce  digital  platforms create a multiplier effect quickly increasing demand\\xe2\\x80\\xa8for products and services and generating additional value for various users along with the platform\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owner\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Online platforms are a key point in Fintech sector because they serve to bring products and services together into a richer and a personalised customer experience. They build connections across the value chain among consumers suppliers retailers and the different players operating within the market.

Among the large product offerings from now on we will focus on \\xe2\\x80\\x9clending and financing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d target which includes the Financial Services sector. A common way to address the disruption of Fintech in the Financial Services sector is known as Alternative Finance that embraces different areas of finance subject to Fintech Revolution. This chapter will give a global view on the evolutionary steps and the market composition across major countries of the Alternative Finance. III.1| Defining Alternative Finance Alternative  Finance  can  be  considered  an  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cumbrella  term\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  covering  a  different  range  of financial solutions. It does not exist a proper definition for Alternative Finance when we talk about it we just refer to a constantly evolving and rapidly expanding sector composed by different segments of business.  In order to have a clear vision at a very basic level it may be possible to define Alternative Finance as all \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabout the provision of finance to individual borrowers and SMEs funded by means other than the banking sector8\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. However Alternative Finance involves high levels of technology so it may be possible to change the former definition with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cabout providing a technologybased solution to financing businesses and consumers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In short it is a sector that offers finance in a more technological way by disintermediating the traditional role of incumbents.   III.2| Forms of Alternative Finance Solutions Today there are over a dozen different forms in which Alternative Finance can be divided up into and these may vary depending on the size and target of the market.  The most important and commonly used can be summarized as follow \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Crowdfunding; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Online Invoice financing; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Merchant Finance; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Payments; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Supply Chain Finance; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Trade Finance. \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa08 www.glifinance.com \\t \\xc2\\xa022\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cEach above subsector contains multiple business models that will be deeply analysed in the next chapter.  Despite many differences all of such forms of financing share the following characteristics  1. \\xc2\\xa0 They are \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdigital businesses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d operating through online platforms; 2. \\xc2\\xa0 They provide financial services but they are not banks;  3. \\xc2\\xa0 They  leverage  the  scale  of  online  platforms  to  secure  numerous  lenders  and investors.  Right  at  the  top  the  most  relevant  models  are  Crowdfunding  which  includes  Equity Crowdfunding  and  PeertoPeer  Lending  and  Invoice  Financing.  These  represent  the  most viable and effective source of fund rising for startups and SMEs across the world. According to the World Economic Forum turning to these solutions can have positive effects on  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  balance  sheet  situation.  Indeed  many  issues  faced  by  entrepreneurs  would  be overcome with more availability of cash working capital improvements and more stable and secure funding all easily available from Alternative Finance platforms.

Facilitating the allocation of capital is an old concept as capitalism and getting money from  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrowd\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (basic  concept  of  Crowdfunding)  is  traced  back  to  18th  century.  Indeed school of thoughts attribute the creation of Crowdfunding to Jonathan Swift an Irish writer who inspired the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIrish Loan Fund\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to fight the poverty of that time; others attribute the merit of creation to the fundraising campaign that Joseph Pulitzer launched through the newspaper \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe World\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to fund 150000 dollars for a pedestal for the Statue of Liberty.  The history of Alternative Finance can be summarized in four main periods 1. \\xc2\\xa0 1990s \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2000s Internet enables the first online Crowdfunding campaigns With the advent of Internet people started to exchange contents via email instant messages and fan pages. In this way they contributed to create communities which aim to share common interests and work together for common purposes. In this atmosphere a British rock group \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarillion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the first to use the power of the crowd as a source of finance. In 1997 they ask fans to fund 60000 dollars for US tours and subsequent albums directly on their website.   2. \\xc2\\xa0 2000  2005 The era of Microlending and P2P This period witnessed the emergence of sites like Kiva based on online microlending which enabled individuals to support projects and ideas by lending small amount of money.  The real innovation came with the arrival of platforms like Zopa and Prosper which provide lending between individuals (peer to peer).  3. \\xc2\\xa0 2005  2014 The Excitement Phase The two biggest drivers of growth of Alternative Finance market were probably the advent of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWeb 2.0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and the Financial Crisis of 2008. The former got people used to the idea of being part of online communities whose aim is to share common interests and pursuing mutual goals. In this period platforms like Indiegogo and Kickstarter came to light becoming popular all around the world. The latter leaded SMEs finding new sources of financing and investors new asset classes.   4. \\xc2\\xa0 Today The Execution Phase Today  the  Alternative  Finance  industry  is  mature  and  starts  to  enter  the  mainstream.  The number of platforms operating within this sector has been constantly increasing all over the world. \\t \\xc2\\xa024\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cIII.4|A global overview of the Alternative Finance market With  the  entrance  of  Fintech  into  the  mainstream  Alternative  Finance  is  growing  so  fast alongside the three primary markets such as Continental Europe US and AsiaPacific Region. III.4.1|Worldwide Crowdfunding Market According to Massolution at the end of December 2014 Crowdfunding platforms operating worldwide  has  reached  an  amount  of  1250  of  which  600  in  Europe  and  375  in  the  North America recording an increase of almost 167% of the total volume moving from $61 billion by 2013 to $162 billion dollars by 2014.

Outside the US China and the UK are the most compelling markets for marketplace lending while Australia is still a nascent market showing good promises given its shared characteristics with the UK (see Figure 9). Furthermore the global marketplace lending is estimated to reach $290 billion by 2020 (see Figure 10).

Morgan Stanley Report points out that US Unsecured Consumer is the main target for PeertoPeer platforms which issue loans to refinance existing debts. Unsecured Consumer Lending  is dominated by early entrants such as Lending Club and Prosper that are respectively the first and the second consumer online lending platforms taking 60% and 20% share in loan issuance in 2014. For what it concerns SME lending market it is more fragmented than the consumer unsecured segment however platforms like On Deck and Kabbage dominate the small business market. Estimates show that SME marketplace lenders represented $4.6 billion in 2014 issuance (2.1% of the total market).  Furthermore issuance is expected to expand at a 47% CAGR through 2020 primarily through the creation of new credit rather than taking share from incumbents. In 2020 an annual SME loan volume of $47 billion (account foe 16% of total US SME issuance) is forecasted \\xe2\\x80\\x93 see Figure 12. Beyond consumer and business lending sectors US marketplace lenders have started to enter the  student  loan  mortgage  and  auto  loan  markets.  To  date  only  student  loan  has  seen \\t \\xc2\\xa027\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0csignificant traction issuing over $3 billion through the leading platforms such as SoFi and CommonBond.  The  increase  in  the  application  of  student  loans  is  particularly  due  to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMillennials\\xe2\\x80\\x9d people between 1834 years old which are becoming a larger portion of the consumer loan market as they look for credit to finance major purchases or refinance their student debt. According to that they can be considered as the prime targets for P2P lending as they value the convenience of transacting online and are less loyal to banks than other part of the population. \\t \\xc2\\xa0Figure 11 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 US marketplace lending by addressable markets  \\t \\xc2\\xa0Source \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Morgan Stanley Report   \\t \\xc2\\xa028\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cFigure 12 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Penetration of SME marketplace lending   Source \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Morgan Stanley Report  III.4.4| Size and growth of Alternative Finance market in Europe Between  2012  and  2014  European  online  Alternative  Finance  market  is  composed  by 255 platforms displaced among 27 countries.

By looking at the market composition of 2014 there has been a remarkable increase of 68% in the  number  of  active  platforms  that  contributed  to  an  increase  of  85%  in  the  total  funding volume that reached \\xe2\\x82\\xac56.7 million. The Italian landscape is characterized by the presence of all traditional models of crowdfunding such Donation Reward Equity and Loan and so called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHybrid platforms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that mix the features  of  two  models  for  instance  Reward  and  Donation  creating  a  single  model (Reward+Donation) that is able to respond to more specific customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 requests thus enlarging the customer satisfaction. Among 69 active platforms that operate on the Italian market 45% are Rewardbased 17% operate through donations 19% are Equitybased and only a small percentage of 4% operate as Lending platforms such as Smartika Prestiamoci Borsa del Credito.it and Mutui Online which serve the consumer and business segments.  For what it concerns the subsector of Online Invoice Trading WorkInvoice is the leading platform while Instapartners is now emerging. Finally Payment sector is dominated by Satispay. \\t \\xc2\\xa0Figure 15  The composition of Italian Alternative Finance Market 3%12%17%4%19%45%DonationRewardEquityLendingDonation+RewardOther\\t \\xc2\\xa0Hybrid\\t \\xc2\\xa0models Source \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Universit\\xc3\\xa0 Cattolica del Sacro Cuore Il Crowdfunding in Italia Report 2015   \\t \\xc2\\xa033\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cAs shown in Figure 15 there is an evident disparity among models. With respect to the US and the  UK  markets  the  Italian  market  is  dominated  by  Rewardbased  crowdfunding  which demonstrates a higher propensity for social and innovative campaigns. Furthermore in 2015 the percentage of equitybased platforms increased due to the change in the regulation (better explained in the next chapters) that requires the registration of Italian equity platforms within the CONSOB book; while the percentage of PeertoPeer marketplace lending is very low. The small incidence of PeertoPeer lending is primarily due to the difficult application of loanbased model within the Italian ecosystem characterised by banking restrictions and the absence of a proper regulation for PeertoPeer marketplace lending.  Geographically most platforms operate in the North of Italy with a strong concentration in the city of Milano which hosts 16 platforms. A  large  majority  (74%)  of  platforms  serve  the  domestic  market  mainly  addressing  private individuals and associations while small businesses are reached at 67%.

Data  points  out  that  nearly  twothirds  of  customers  across  the  globe  are  using  products  or services  from  challenger  firms  and  that  the  percentage  of  penetrated  market  is  very  high especially in emerging markets such as Latin America Asia Pacific and Middle East & Africa.

Millennials are then followed by those aged 35 to 44 and those aged 18 to 24.

In particular a specific show case will be attached to the description of every model to compare the theoretical view with a more practical explanation. For some business models I interviewed some key staff that gave me some relevant information about the marketplace lender they work for. IV.1| Crowdfunding IV.1.1| What is Crowdfunding Crowdfunding can be defined as a way in which people organizations and businesses (from early to mature stage) can raise money to finance or refinance their activities through the use of online portals known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplatforms\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. This process results into a new form of financing that can substitute the traditional funding system offered by banks. Figure 18 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Traditional Funding vs Crowdfunding  The process of Crowdfunding is fast and easy and involves three main participants  \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 The project owner which is an individual or a business;  \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 The funders a pool of individuals that act as donors investors or lenders depending on the type of crowdfunding business model; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 The online platform which acts as intermediary. \\t \\xc2\\xa038\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cCrowdfunding combines the emotional engagement and dedication of entrepreneurship with the social and financial returns of investments ultimately aligning the investor and the investee in the early stage of business growth.  IV.1.2|Different models of Crowdfunding Crowdfunding industry includes different business models available to businesses individual consumers nonprofit organizations and charitable causes. Each model includes different forms of contribution and expected returns that include money as equity debt exchange/reward or simply donation depending on the intrinsic motivation that leads funders and fundraisers to turn to these models. From the point of view of funders the reasons why they may decide to turn to Crowdfunding can be classified in three macrocategories and depend on the nature of the expected return which can be \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Social motivation the return is intangible. The funders are motivated by the nature of the project and the potential to contribute to its realisation making a positive effect with their money; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Material  motivation  the  return  consists  of  a  product  or  service  as  a  reward  for  the investment; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Financial motivation the fundraisers are motivated by the prospect of getting monetary and financial returns with less concern for supporting social causes or local businesses.  Nowadays there exist more than ten different types of Crowdfunding models operating in the market however the most recognized by literature are described in Table 1. \\t \\xc2\\xa0Table 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The principal business models of Crowdfunding \\t \\xc2\\xa0Form of contribution Form of return Motivation of funder Donation Intangible Social Reward Crowdfunding Donation/Prepurchase Equity Crowdfunding Investment Lending Crowdfunding Loan \\t \\xc2\\xa0Nonfinancial rewards and intangible benefits Return on investment in time if the business goes well Repayment of the loan with interest 39\\t \\xc2\\xa0Social and material Financial Financial Model Donation Crowdfunding \\x0cIV.1.2.1| Donation \\xe2\\x80\\x93based Crowdfunding The donationbased form is used by individuals or charitable organisations to collect money from a group of people in forms of donations whit the aim to support charitable projects in exchange for symbolic rewards like invitations for special events or public recognitions.  Donation based Crowdfunding does not pay financial returns but the intrinsic motivation of donors to turn to this type of Crowdfunding model is linked to the opportunity to join customer experience.  IV.1.2.2|Reward based Crowdfunding The use of rewardbased model increased significantly in recent years. This business model has become  the  most  popular  form  of  Crowdfunding  in  the  support  of  creative  social  and entrepreneurial projects. The model allows people to contribute to projects in exchange of nonfinancial returns. An important benefit to the entrepreneur is that the rewards cost relatively little to deliver but hold significant value to the backers in terms of experience or recognitionrelated rewards such as getting the first product of an innovative production campaign.  In the last case the model is similar to a presale agreement whereby the entrepreneur is able to test the market and get feedbacks about product awareness and the potential of a such product to penetrate a certain market.   The first two models of Crowdfunding have been included within the analysis for completeness however they will be left out as they are considered less relevant from the moment that they do not impact financial service sector.  IV.1.2.3|Equitybased Crowdfunding The  Equitybased  Crowdfunding  (or  investmentbased  crowdfunding)  is  generally  used  by earlystage firms and connects companies and investors that want to contribute to fund small businesses or startups. Within this form of Crowdfunding investors invest directly or indirectly into new or established businesses by buying shares of equity issued by the companies thus becoming shareholders of those companies. The financial returns can be generated by share or by \\xe2\\x80\\x9crevenue sharing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which consists of getting part of revenues deriving from the economic activity of the company funded. This  model  includes  a  subsector  relies  on  real  estate  Equitybased  crowdfunding  (Real Estate) which can be defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca direct investment into a property by individuals usually \\t \\xc2\\xa040\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cthrough the sale of a registered security in a special purpose vehicle (SPV)12\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Individual and businesses that raise capital through equity crowdfunding valued the speed at which they could get money;  IV.1.2.4|Loanbased Crowdfunding  (i) \\xc2\\xa0 Definition  Lending  activity  is  referred  to  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeertoPeer  lending\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (P2P)  or  marketplace  lending  and represents  the  most  innovative  form  of  alternative  finance  for  small  and  mediumsize businesses. It can be described as the practice of bringing together individuals and institutional investors that have money to lend in the hope of financial returns with people and businesses that  seek  to  obtain  funds  without  going  through  traditional  intermediaries  such  as  banks venture  capital  and  business  angels  but  simply  using  online  platforms  in  the  form  of  loan agreements. (ii) \\xc2\\xa0PeertoPeer lending models The reasoning behind P2P loans varies depending on the different segments that characterise this form of financing. In particular P2P can be broken down into 1. \\xc2\\xa0 Peertopeer Consumer lending (P2C) whereby individual borrowers acquire mostly unsecured personal loans from a number of other individual lenders within an online marketplace. Credit card debt consolidation medical expenses weddings and home repair are some of the most common reasons associated with this type of P2P loans requested. This type of loan is one of the fastest growing segments and makes up the majority of P2P loans due in part to the fact that they are generally smaller sized loans have a relatively high number of borrowers with good credit scores and the time in which an individual can complete an online application and obtain a loan is very low; 2. \\xc2\\xa0 Peertopeer Business lending (P2B) whereby SMEs raise capital directly from a pool of lenders both institutional and individual bypassing prolonged and uncertain bank lending processes; Other forms also include \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa012\\t \\xc2\\xa0Zhang B.

(iii) \\xc2\\xa0Marketplace lending As reported by Foundation Capital in one of its paper14 a more appropriate name to describe PeertoPeer  lending  is  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarketplace  lending\\xe2\\x80\\xa6which  is  fundamentally  about  creating platforms to connect borrowers with lenders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d with technology making it possible for \\xe2\\x80\\x9c...third part(ies) to match idle supply and demand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  However it is difficult to attribute a proper definition to marketplace lending. Many papers consider this term as a synonym of PeertoPeer lending while others believe it is a misnomer given the fact that with the development of industry a significant portion of funding also comes from financial institutions and institutional investors which cannot be considered as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The online marketplace can be considered as the virtual place where who wants to borrow money is put in a direct contact with who wants to lend money through an online platform. In this way borrowers get access to appropriately priced products while investors are getting higher yields and more investment choices.  IV.2| How do Crowdfunding platforms work? Before going into deep with the analysis of specific show cases it is important to understand how Crowdfunding platforms work.  Despite the presence of a great diversification due to the entrance of many online platforms onto the market the application process is basically standard and it could be described as follow.  (i) \\xc2\\xa0 The borrowing process From the borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side the request for financing starts with an online application. In order \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa013\\t \\xc2\\xa0Zhang B. Baeck P. Ziegler T. Bone J. Garvey K. (February 2016) Pushing Boundaries The 2015 UK alternative Finance Industry Report available online at http//www.nesta.org.uk/sites/default/files/pushing_boundaries_0.pdf . 14\\t \\xc2\\xa0Foundation Capital Whitepaper A Trillion Dollar Market By the People For the People How Marketplace Lending Will Remake Banking As We Know It available online at https//foundationcapital.com/assets/whitepapers/TDMFinTech_whitepaper.pdf . \\t \\xc2\\xa042\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cto guarantee the whole security against the risk of missing payments of the borrower each applicant is required to send a list of documents that will be analysed by a team of specialists with the aim to check the financial and credit profile of each individual who asks for getting funds so that it will be possible for the platform to identify and select the most creditworthy borrowers. To do so the team carefully checks the identity of the applicant the reason why he/she is asking for money and checks other specific information that will never be publicly available to investors for privacy reasons. Once the platform has verified the reliability of the applicant each borrower is assigned a credit score based on the quality of financial data analysed. In this way the platform is able to match the borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s demand with the offers updated on the marketplace to create a tailored loan proposal.  Once the match has been done each applicant will receive a confirmation email with the loan proposal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s details. In case of acceptance the borrower will receive the funds on his/her account and will be committed to repay the loan increased by the interest rates within a monthly basis. In case of rejection instead the applicant could reapply.  (ii) \\xc2\\xa0The analysis of credit history Generally the most important factor to be considered within a lending transaction is the analysis of past credit history which allows the platform to understand the debt position of a potential borrower. In traditional bank financing the decision about credit concession is primarily based on the evaluation of the overall creditworthiness of the borrower. For this scope banks look at the expected  future  cash  flows  of  a  firm  as  a  primary  source  of  debt  capacity.  Crowdfunding platforms whereas make this analysis more accurate by gathering borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s information from different sources of data and advanced analytics. In order to fix this concept and better understand how the process of credit scoring works for Crowdfunding platforms I interviewed a Digital Sales Manager and financial analyst of one of the most important Italian operating leading platform. The key points that came to light concern the  principal  factors  characterising  credit  scoring  models  which  determine  the  success  of financing requests. Normally the specificity of factors varies depending on the type of business that asks for funds whether it is a limited liability company or a corporation a company with a simplification in accounting or ordinary accounting etc. However among these factors there are three categories that the financial analyst I talked to has defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe three pillars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d meaning that if a company asking for money positively satisfies them it will obtain a loan proposal by the platform.  \\t \\xc2\\xa043\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cThe above factors are the following \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Quantitative elements such as   \\xc2\\xa0 Percentage revenue increase;  \\xc2\\xa0 Financial ratios such as as current ratio (current assets over current liabilities) debt to equity ratio gross profit percentage (gross profit over gross sales) ROA (net income over total assets) and ROE (net income over net worth);  \\xc2\\xa0 Free Cash Flows. \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Trend elements such as  \\xc2\\xa0 Rating score given by public credit rating agencies;  \\xc2\\xa0 The presence of potential detrimental. \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Qualitative elements such as  \\xc2\\xa0 Web scoring;  \\xc2\\xa0 Purpose of financing request;  \\xc2\\xa0 Business activity;  \\xc2\\xa0 Past credit history.  (iii) \\xc2\\xa0 How does the credit score process work? In  order  to  check  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe  three  pillars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  each  platform  operates  a  due  diligence  process  that consists  in  checking  all  information  available  about  a  private  individual  or  a  business  to determine whether to accept him/her at the borrowing process. As previously highlighted in point  (i)  part  of  the  necessary  information  is  given  directly  by  the  applicant  during  the application phase however most of the information is obtained through the consultation of national Credit Rating Agencies that give more financial details and define the merit of credit of the applicant. On the basis of their evaluation the Credit Rating Agencies assign a credit score depending on the level of risk associated with each applicant.  The next table shows the credit scores and the associated meanings which are fundamental for the team of analysts of the platforms to decide whether to accept or not the application of a  potential borrower and in case of acceptance determine a tailored loan proposal. In fact the interest rate on the loan is determined on the basis of the risk the higher is the risk the higher will be the interest to pay monthly for the borrower. \\t \\xc2\\xa044\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cTable 2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Credit rating system  Source \\xe2\\x80\\x93 http//www.modefinance.com/it/ratingagency   \\t \\xc2\\xa045\\t \\xc2\\xa0 \\x0c(iv) \\xc2\\xa0The lending process From the point of view of an investor the process of lending starts by opening an account and give a few personal information and more specific details about the amount of money to lend the desired interest rate and the duration of the investment. Basically each investor participates by placing a bid on a loan request which corresponds to the amount of money the investor is willing to lend. For this purpose each platform allows investor to decide whether to set the investment automatically \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAutomatic way\\xe2\\x80\\x9d through the algorithms of the platform or using the so called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHandpicking business way\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that permits the lender to set his/her own criteria of lending by him(her)self. In particular this form allows investor to decide the businesses to which he/she is willing to lend money choosing among those that satisfy specific requirements such as risk bands the region in which the borrower operates the sector of the business the reason for the loan company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financials etc.; and have an independent assessment of the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial position. In order to minimize the credit risk a single offer is split into multiple chunks that will finance microloans to different borrowers. For instance an investment of \\xe2\\x82\\xac5000 may be split into 100 different requests of \\xe2\\x82\\xac50 each. In this case the risk associated with a single borrower is spread among multiple investors and a potential loss may result in a small share of the total investment. According  to  the  information  given  by  the  investor  the  platform  matches  the  investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s proposal with the loan demands which are close to it. Once the match is done the borrower has the right to choose whether to accept the financing and in case of acceptance he/she will receive the funds. The lender will then receive his/her capital plus the relative interests in monthly instalments.  Finally the repayment can be recycled into new loans or withdrawn by the lenders. In case of recycling the new loan will be at the latest interest rate provided by the marketplace which means that the loan book rates will evolve overtime.           \\t \\xc2\\xa046\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cFigure 19 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The steps of the lending process   Source  http//www.lend2fund.com/howitworks.html (v) \\xc2\\xa0How capitals move between parties Within the entire process the money borrowed and lent by the parties is held by the platform on their behalf within a segregated bank account known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPayment account\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which can be freely opened by the platform in a Correspondent Bank or simply be the parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 bank account.  The account is not part of the platform\\xe2\\x80\\x99s assets which means that it would not be available to creditors in case of insolvency of the intermediary.  In case of missed payments most platforms will appoint debt collection agencies to pursue the payments due unless or until a default of the borrower would occur. Furthermore to mitigate \\t \\xc2\\xa047\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cthe credit risk many platforms provide a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cContingency Fund\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is used to repay capital losses to lenders in the event of borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s default. This fund is built up by charges on the borrowers which normally pay a small percentage fee together with the monthly instalments.  Legally the fund is owned by trustees or separated companies. (vi) \\xc2\\xa0How much does it costs? The total cost of borrowing money is determined by two factors the interests paid to investors and the fees paid to the platform. The interest rate is typically set by the platform and it is based on the risk associated with the amount of the loan and the length of the repayment term the higher is the length term the higher will be the risk. This leads to higher interest rates to pay and consequently higher yields for the investors. During the lending process each loan grade is assigned an annual percentage rate (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cAPR\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) that refers to the cost of borrowing money on a yearly basis. An APR allows the borrower to quickly compare different loans and includes the interest rate as well as fees necessary to finance the loan.  Normally fees are charged on the total loan amount lent and are around 1% per annum across the whole market. Commission or selling fees are charged on either the amount left outstanding on  the  loan  or  on  the  original  investment  amount.  Depending  on  the  type  of  platform performance fees can be charged on lenders\\xe2\\x80\\x99 profits.   IV. 3|Risks of Crowdfunding Although Crowdfunding market is much bigger and characterized by big players there are a whole range of risks to face. This paragraph will provide the description of the major risks associated with PeertoPeer lending and Equity Crowdfunding solutions. For what it concerns the loanbased option the main risks are on lender\\xe2\\x80\\x99s side and they can be described as follow \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Credit risk the biggest difference between putting money into a bank and turning to this alternative finance solution is that the risk of borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s default shifts from the bank to the lender which may have a capital loss; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Platform insolvency  it may happen that online platform blows up due to undisclosed losses  lack  of  controls  or  failure  of  its  role  of  intermediary  between  lenders  and borrowers; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Interest rate risk in the event of an increase in the interest rates some longer term loans might become unattractive and this would cause a lack of liquidity due to the fact \\t \\xc2\\xa048\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cthat many investors may decide to move to back to conventional deposits.  However  there  is  no  doubt  that  Equity  Crowdfunding  is  riskier  than  the  lending  solution especially when it involves unquoted companies. The main risks associated with this kind of model is related to \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Decision making through platforms investors have access to investments easily and it may happen that unwary investors make inappropriate investment decisions because they underestimated the risks and make insensible valuations.  IV.4| Show Case Borsa del Credito.it In order to understand in practical way what does it mean applying for financing and how a lending process works I have experienced the loan application of an Italian family business to the leading PeertoBusiness platform \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorsa del Credito.it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. IV.4.1| What is Borsa del Credito.it? \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Company Information Borsa del Credito.it is a 2013 Italian Fintech startup company that operates as leading company in SMEs financing.  \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Governance  information  the  company  is  run  by  a  Corporate  Group  whose  holding company is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBusiness Innovation Lab Srl\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which owns 100% of two other companies  (i) \\xc2\\xa0 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMo.Net  Spa\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  a  Payment  Institution  which  is  authorized  under  the  Italian  law  to handle money transfer between parties and; (ii) \\xc2\\xa0\\xe2\\x80\\x9cCrenway Srl\\xe2\\x80\\x9d a credit broker that lends its activities by making use of the web portal BorsadelCredito.it.  Crenway  puts  in  relation  banks  and  other  authorized  financial intermediaries  with  potential  customers  to  encourage  the  conclusion  of  credit transactions in any form. However it cannot perform on behalf of banks and other banking institutions loan agreements or other forms of financial products but it simply manages the delivery of nontransferable checks fully completed by bank partners or clients. Crenway is totally independent from the concession of credit and because of that it may be that potential borrowers cannot obtain funding from banks despite the presence of a credit broker.  \\t \\xc2\\xa049\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0c Source  https//www.borsadelcredito.it   \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Statistics to date the company has lent more than \\xe2\\x82\\xac 1 billion to more than 10000 Italian SMEs. \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 General information the platform requires lenders to be at least 18 years old own a proper bank account and live in a European country.

The financing need of the company is to get \\xe2\\x82\\xac200000 to be reimbursed in 60 months (the maximum term provided by the platform). The application process took 10 minutes and the steps we were asked to follow are reported below. 1. \\xc2\\xa0 Step No.0 SIGNUP In order to guarantee the highest level of security we had to create a proper account and a nickname. The nickname represents the identity of the potential borrower and it is the only \\t \\xc2\\xa051\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cinformation investors know about him/her together with more information about the business and  the  sector  whereby  the  company  operates.  Any  type  of  sensitive  information  is  make publicly available to investors (and vice versa). Once  the  signup  phase  is  done  the  platform  assigned  the  potential  borrower  a  personal consultant  that  was  available  to  help  the  client  in  making  the  application  or  getting  some information.  2. \\xc2\\xa0 Step No.1 INSERT PERSONAL DATA The  owner  of  the  company  was  required  to  insert  her  generalities  and  attach  her  identity document and fiscal code. She was also asked to confirm whether she is a Political Exposed Person (PEP) under the AntiMoney Laundering law. \\t \\xc2\\xa0Furthermore she needed to insert the same information for the other members that represent the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBeneficial Owners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the company and in our case they were two. In Step No.1 the platform run some Anti Money Laundering tests to ensure that the money of the company is not coming from illegal actions. The potential borrower had to insert the origin of capital and how many times she was intended to ask for financing to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorsa del Credito.it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t \\xc2\\xa052\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cduring the current year. Finally under the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cForeign Account Tax Compliance Act\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (FATCA15) she had to declare that the company is not fiscally resident in the US so that there is no risk of tax evasion.  Once the potential borrower has fulfilled all these sections Step No.1 is completed and it is possible to move to Step No.2 which is focused on the financing request.  \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Step No.2 INSERT DETAILS ABOUT THE FINANCING REQUEST The step No.2 is about giving more details about the financing request. In particular we had to insert the reason why the potential borrower needed the money (investing repay a precedent loan obtain more liquidity etc.) and based on the scope declared give a brief explanation. In our case we asked the money to acquire a PPE valued at \\xe2\\x82\\xac250000. \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa015 FATCA is a United States legislation that primarily aims to prevent tax evasion by US taxpayers by using nonUS financial institutions and offshore investment instruments.   \\t \\xc2\\xa053\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0c\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Step No.3 DOCUMENT ATTACHING \\t \\xc2\\xa0The owner of the company was asked to attach the last financial statements of the company to let the team of specialists of the platform check the financial sustainability of the company and assign a rating score according to the level of risk associated with.

Business sold on credit remains as outstanding receivables on the balance sheet of a company. For  many  years  businesses  used  to  sell  their  receivables  to  third  parties  called  factor  to improve their cash position. This transaction is known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfactoring\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and requires the factor to purchase the receivables of a company at a discounted price against immediate cash payment. However the traditional factoring does not seem to be the best solution for helping SMEs as it typically takes long term and complex contracts involving fixed volumes and consequently low flexibility. A valid alternative to traditional factoring is represented by online invoice trading which is a new form of Alternative Finance that allows small businesses to monetize online outstanding receivables  by  using  an  online  platform.  In  this  case  businesses  sell  unpaid  invoices  or receivables  (individually  or  in  a  bundle)  at  a  discount  to  a  pool  of  individual  or institutional investors in order to receive liquidity immediately rather than waiting for the natural expiration of the invoices.   IV.5.2| Benefits of Invoice Trading The  most  important  benefit  associated  with  Invoice  financing  is  about  the  problem  of  late customer payments that cause financial distress and liquidity gaps. By using this system small and mediumsize businesses are able to overcome this critical issue and avoid situation of working capital shortages without the need of asking for money to banks. Further benefits consist of \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 More flexibility it is possible to sell even one invoice; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Cost advantage the parties agreed on the price to pay to each other; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 No collateral requirements; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Speed the seller gets liquidity in a few days; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Better working capital situation. \\t \\xc2\\xa057\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cIV.5.3|Show Case WORKINVOICE.it Workinvoice.it is the first Italian invoicetrading platform16 providing an alternative pool of liquidity to Italian SMEs.

Basically the process of selling unpaid invoices or receivables is based on six main steps 1. \\xc2\\xa0 The  seller  fixes  the  minimum  amount  of  money  he/she  is  willing  to  accept  as  final payment and the amount he/she would prefer to receive (called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuy Now\\xe2\\x80\\x9d); 2. \\xc2\\xa0 The buyers compete in an auction and the highest amount proposed for the balance will win the auction. In case there is a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuy Now\\xe2\\x80\\x9d offer this will win; 3. \\xc2\\xa0 The seller receives a 90% down payment on the total price of the invoice; 4. \\xc2\\xa0 At the due date the principal debtor is committed to repay the invoice to the buyer that won the auction and bought the invoice17; 5. \\xc2\\xa0 If the payment due is done and the buyer has received the money he pays the last 10% of  the  invoice  minus  the  amount  of  money  that  the  parties  agreed  to  represent  the remuneration of the investor.

(i) \\xc2\\xa0 How does it work? Differently  from  other  companies  like  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWorkInvoice\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  whose  operating  model  relies  on  an auction system Instapartners works through a process of securitization.  Instead of uploading the outstanding invoices/receivable into the platform and lets the auction start  the  process  implemented  by  this  startup  company  is  based  on  the  purchase  of  the outstanding financial products from a selected seller and sell them to a Special Purpose Vehicle (SPV) that will securitize and transform them into debt obligations that will be then sold onto the market. In this way the risk relapses 95% on the SPV and 5% on the startup company to prevent the risk of fraud.  (ii) \\xc2\\xa0What are the main differences between Instapartners and a traditional bank? Basically there are a few differences. From a financial perspective Instapartners manages the same products a traditional bank offers and in the same way. However the main difference relies on the way how the process of advance invoices and receivables is done.  First of all the process implemented by Instapartners is more competitive in terms of costs primarily due to the fact of being totally webbased. Furthermore it may happen that banks take advantage of their local monopoly power to improve the costs of their services in those regions affected by the presence of single branches.  Second like any other Fintech company it offers a customer experience that banks are unable to offer because of their lack in technology improvements that make the process easier and faster. Third there is no credit limit. This allows companies that need liquidity to sell a single invoice making the whole process more flexible. From a legal perspective whereas Instapartners is authorised under Article 106 of the new Italian  register  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTesto  Unico  Bancario\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and  subject  to  a  prudential  supervisory  regime equivalent to that of banks meaning that Instapartners is a bank and not a marketplace.     \\t \\xc2\\xa060\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0c(iii) \\xc2\\xa0Who can apply?

IV.6.2|How does supply chain finance work? The process of SCF is composed by different steps which vary depending on the subject that firstly turns to a SCF platform whether it is the buyer or the seller. According to this it is possible to identify two different solutions \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Account Receivable Financing; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Supply Chain Financing/Dynamic Discounting. The first solution is generally used by sellers that directly turn to a webbased platform to sell their invoices for early payment well before the actual due date and in most cases without any involvement from or disclosure to their customers. This is the case of Invoice Trading solutions like WorkInvoice platform.  The second whereas is used by buyers that invite their suppliers to obtain earlypayment terms. This is the case of platforms like PrimeRevenue. As an invited supplier he/she can view all approved invoices from his/her customer and select the invoices he/she wants to sell and get paid immediately by one of more than 50 funders on a multibank platform model. A  multibank  financing  model  is  independent  from  any  bank  relationship  meaning  that  the platform act independently from banks allowing clients to grow their financing programs by adding new funding partners like banks and nonbank funders or even have the opportunity to fund their program by themselves.  (i) \\xc2\\xa0 Understanding the operating process for SCF/Dynamic Discounting Basically  the  process  which  involves  the  buyer  within  the  selling  of  invoices  is  described below 1. \\xc2\\xa0 The supplier sends their invoices to the buyer using the current policy and methodology; 2. \\xc2\\xa0 The buyer approves the invoices from the supplier and uploads the approved invoice data (its payables as well as any applicable payment offsets such as credit/debit memos) onto the Supply Chain finance platform; 3. \\xc2\\xa0 The platform offers early payments at discount to the supplier; 4. \\xc2\\xa0 At this point in time the supplier has two options \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Choose the Normal process of Supply Chain Finance which consists of waiting until the original maturity date to obtain the funds directly on his/her bank account (see Figure A); \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Choose the Dynamic Discounting Process which consists of selling or \\xe2\\x80\\x98trading\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\t \\xc2\\xa063\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0chis/her receivables to a funder19 through the platform in return for advance payment (see Figure B); 5. \\xc2\\xa0 If traded before maturity 100 percent of the invoice (minus a small financing fee or discount) is transferred electronically to the supplier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bank account. In most cases the supplier is paid on the next business day. Since funds from the financial institution are advanced based on the buyer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s promise to pay at the original maturity date financing rates are based only on the buyer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s risk not the supplier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. 6. \\xc2\\xa0 At maturity the buyer pays the full invoice amount to the supplier or respective funder.  IV.6.2.1|Supply Chain Finance Vs Dynamic Discounting Process Dynamic discounting is a solution that gives buyers more flexibility to choose how and when to pay their suppliers in exchange for a lower price or discount for the goods and services purchased.  This  process  enables  both  parties  buyers  and  suppliers  to  initiate  earlypay discounts on an invoicebyinvoice basis by let them select trough a webbase platform which invoice should be subject to early payment. Basically  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdynamic\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  component  of  discounting  process  refers  to  the  option  to  provide discounts based on the dates when suppliers will receive payments. In most cases the earlier the payment is made the greater the discount. The main difference between the normal SCF process and the dynamic discounting process is based on funding. In SCF the buyer uses thirdparty funders to finance early payment terms. In dynamic whereas the buyer finances his/her suppliers with early payment terms.  \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa019 Funders have always been institutional investors however working capital finance has been emerging as a playing field also for nontraditional funders.

This is the case of technology giants such as Amazon eBay Alibaba Google etc. that are redefining customer experience and increasing the playground for financial services. Some of them in fact are enlarging their service offering by providing working capital lines and loans becoming an alternative way to traditional financial institutions.   IV.7.1|Different providers how they work? This sector is characterised by the presence of multiple providers. The World Economic Forum analysed six among the most important players onto this market.  1) \\xc2\\xa0 Amazon Lending It was founded in 2012 with the aim to extend credit to small businesses that sell their products on Amazon\\xe2\\x80\\x99s platform. Initially the company limited its service to US and Japanese sellers but it is now expanding the lending program to sellers in other seven countries such as Canada France Germany India UK and China. The process of lending implemented by Amazon Lending is not as the typical as Crowdfunding platforms. The difference lays on the fact that while platforms like \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorsa del Credito.it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFunding Circle\\xe2\\x80\\x9d lend money to businesses that ask for it Amazon Lending directly offers money to businesses that sell their products on the platform. Basically it works by using a huge database and the power of big data to access all information a bank would never have about a customer such as  the frequency at which merchants run out of stock; the selling performances; the inventory cycles; the growth rate; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 shipping time; and on the basis of this information they search for potential borrowers. If a seller accumulates a certain number of data points the company will invite him/her to apply for a loan which can be useful to purchase inventory and increase the sales on Amazon.com.  Amazon offers threetosix month loans for an amount ranging from $1000 to $600000 and charges an interest rates ranging up to 13%.  \\t \\xc2\\xa066\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0c2) \\xc2\\xa0 PayPal Working Capital PayPal  is  a  leading  global  company  operating  in  Payment sector that offers to individuals and businesses who have an email addresses the possibility to send and receive money payments online. It operates an open secure and technology agnostic payment platform used by businesses to make their online payment transactions more secure. PayPal has recently entered the lending sector with \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPayPal Working Capital\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which gives businesses that process payment through PayPal the capital they need. Lender  determines  the  eligibility  of  borrower  on  the  basis  of  his/her  PayPal  sales  history without affecting personal credit score.  To be eligible to apply for a loan businesses must respect the following requirements \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Have a PayPal Business or Premier account for 3 months or more; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Process at least $20000 in PayPal sales annually;  \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Pay off any existing PayPal Working Capital loan.  (i) \\xc2\\xa0 How the process works? Basically  PayPal  Working  Capital  offers  fixed  amount  loans  with  a  single  fixed  fee  no periodic interest charged and any other fee.  The process of getting a loan is easy and involves the following main steps 1. \\xc2\\xa0 Select the loan amount which varies based on borrower PayPal sales history; \\xe2\\x80\\xa8 2. \\xc2\\xa0 Choose the percentage of future PayPal daily sales to go toward repayment of the loan amount and the loan fee;\\xe2\\x80\\xa8 3. \\xc2\\xa0 If approved get the loan amount deposited to PayPal account within minutes to use for the business; 4. \\xc2\\xa0 Start making repayments as a percentage of daily sales. \\xe2\\x80\\xa8  (ii) \\xc2\\xa0Repayment procedure During  the  application  phase  the  borrower  is  required  to  select  the  repayment  percentage which is the portion of his/her future daily sales that will go towards repaying the loan balance.  Basically the loan is repaid automatically as the borrower makes sales through PayPal \\xe2\\x80\\x93 until your loan amount and fixed fee are paid in full. Daily repayments are taken on the prior day sales and on days with no sales the borrower pays nothing that day subject to the minimum payment requirements. The minimum amount required to be paid is at least 10% of the total \\t \\xc2\\xa067\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cloan amount (loan + the fixed fee) every 90 days for the first 540 days of the loan.  Here\\xe2\\x80\\x99s an example  If you borrow $10000 ($9000 loan + $1000 fixed fee) you are required to pay $1000 every 90 days thereafter for the first 18 months of the loan.   3) \\xc2\\xa0 Alipay Financial Alipay  Financial  is  an  online  microcredit  company  launched  by  the  Chinese  ecommerce platform Alibaba in 2010. The company offers loans from its own cash to small businesses clients allowing individuals and businesses to execute online payments in a secure manner. With a registered user base of approximately 43.5 million as of June 2007 Alipay is an accepted online payment method for many online retail websites and service providers in China.  Based on its huge customer based it has developed a complete online wallet which offers many services associated with payments.  Alipay  has  partnered  with  some  leading  Chinese  banks  including  Bank  of  China  China Construction Bank Agricultural Bank of China and the Industrial and Commercial Bank of China.  4) \\xc2\\xa0 Rakuten The Japanese platform Rakuten is another online platform that moved into the lending space. In 2013 it started to offer \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRakuten Super Business Loans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to its merchants. In contrast to Amazon Lending businesses are not subject to a preselection but are invited by the platform itself to submit loan applications. The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRakuten Super Business Loans\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are intended to provide financial support mainly for business expansion and flexible working capital finance. Loans range from 1 million to 10 million Yen. 5) \\xc2\\xa0 Square Capital  Square Capital was founded in May 2014 by Square a provider of credit card processing and payment solutions and it offers cash advances to small businesses.  Square Capital has already advanced $225 million in business financing to more than 20000 businesses over the past year. In April 2015 it advanced nearly $25 million in capital at the time a runrate of $300 million to $400 million in business lending per year.     \\t \\xc2\\xa068\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0c6) \\xc2\\xa0 iZettle The last entrant in the field of payment processor lending is the Sweden platform iZettle. The company announced its small business loan program \\xe2\\x80\\x9ciZettle Advance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in August 2015. The model works slightly differently to the ones offered by its competitors. Repayments are not charged as a fixed interest rate but rather as a flat fee.  Repayment is conducted in daily instalments proportionally to card sales. Borrowers are able to borrow up to two times their monthly sales.  IV.7.2|Benefits and risks of Merchant and Payment financing The most significant benefit of merchant and payment finance is represented by the fact that collection and payment processes are facilitated. This is particularly due the visibility that the above platforms have on a substantial portion of a merchant\\xe2\\x80\\x99s daily transactions. In effect they  get  realtime  information  about  performances  cash  flows  and  other  sensible  data  of merchant companies selling their products on the platform. In this way the process of select reliable borrowers is easier and faster with respect to traditional systems of financing. From merchants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 perspective the process is more convenient as payment systems are already integrated.  Furthermore  a  contractual  relationship  is  in  place  so  that  the  extension  of  credit  can  be completed in a speedy and efficient manner.   The World Economic Forum highlights the risks associated with this sector as the following \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 The market for online merchant platforms and payment processors is significantly more concentrated  among  few  large  players.  This  could  potentially  limit  healthy competition; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 As this form of lending is part of a business relationship it is less transparent from the outside and harder to regulate;\\xe2\\x80\\xa8 \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 On a micro level the lack of experience of such players\\xe2\\x80\\xa8in the lending business has been a source of concern. Extrapolating from internal seller data may not be enough to properly assess credit risk over time especially from a macro perspective. For instance as Amazon or Rakuten are not set up as banks those players have less access to  the  banking  network  and  are  excluded  from  access  to  credit  bureaus  in  some countries; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Shareholders  may  question  the  mandate  of  an  ecommerce  platform  or  payment processor to move into the lending space. \\t \\xc2\\xa0 \\t \\xc2\\xa069\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cChapter V THE STATE OF ART OF THE REGULATORY FRAMEWORK ON ALTERNATIVE FINANCE Previous  chapters  show  the  evolution  of  alternative  finance  models  and  in  particular  the development of specific forms such as Crowdfunding. This has become more popular over the last years being a disruptive and revolutionary option for many people and businesses.  The rapid worldwide growth of Crowdfunding has made the legislation unable to be quick in catching it up leading each jurisdiction to build its own regulatory framework and consequently creating a nonhomogeneous landscape for potential investors and borrowers.  While rewardbased Crowdfunding received little attention from regulators since it is a form of presale  that  enjoys  the  traditional  consumer  protection  investment  and  lendingbased Crowdfunding have been receiving more attention from the moment that the former relies on the emission of shares which often falls under the local national authority\\xe2\\x80\\x99s jurisdiction and; the latter competes in a certain sense with banks that are regulated. Despite the interest of regulators on both forms of Crowdfunding the current regulation is focussing on regulating equitybased Crowdfunding because it presents the biggest risks for fraud and failure compared to loanbased Crowdfunding. This section will focus on analysing how current regulation addresses Crowdfunding and the main participants and how the state of art of the Regulatory Framework differs between Europe and US. V.1| The state of art of European regulatory framework on Crowdfunding The current European legal framework is characterised by a number of directives that apply to investmentbased  Crowdfunding  and  all  the  participants  involved  within  the  transactions. Among the directives issued by the European Commission it is possible to identify the most relevant within the financial sector \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Directive  2004/39/EC  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMarket  in  Financial  Instrument  Directive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  known  as MiFID  which  aims  to  make  it  easier  for  investors  to  buy  financial  instruments  or investment services in Europe. MiFID can face different interpretations as to whether Crowdfunding platforms performs a regulated activity or not. \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Directive 2003/71/EC as amended by Directive 2010/73/EC \\xe2\\x80\\x9cProspectus Directive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which regulates how companies raise funds; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Directive  2005/60/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAntiMoney  Laundering Directive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (AML) on the prevention of the use of the financial system for the purpose of money laundering and terrorist financing; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Directive  2007/64/EC  of  the  European  Parliament  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPayment  Services  Directive\\xe2\\x80\\x9d \\t \\xc2\\xa070\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0c(PSD) on payment services within the internal market; V. 2|Market in Financial Instruments Directive (MiFID) V.2.1| Authorisation under MiFID  In order to operate Investmentbased Crowdfunding platforms have to be generally authorised under MiFID which imposes duties about their capacity of Crowdfunding platforms of acting as investment intermediaries. In order to be within the scope of MiFID platforms need to carry on an investment service or an activity in relation to financial instruments provided by MiFID.  In particular the current Directive applies to the list of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinancial instruments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d set out at Section C of Annex 1 of the same Directive which refers to \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctransferable securities20\\xe2\\x80\\x9d such as shares and bonds or units of collective investment undertakings (for more details see Appendix B for Section C of MIFID). Platforms that are carrying out MiFID services and/or activities need to be authorised as an investment firm a credit institution or a tied agent and comply with the minimum Capital Requirements Directive which imposes initial capital requirements to protect investors from the risk of insolvency and ensure operational continuity. The levels of capital requirements vary according to the type of service and activity provided by the platforms. The activity most likely to  be  carried  out  by  Crowdfunding  platforms  is  the  reception  and  transmission  of  orders between parties.  The benefit of being under this regulation is that a platform is allowed to carry on a service or an  activity  for  which  it  is  authorised  across  the  European  Union  (and  so  getting  a  MiFID Passport) without the need of additional authorisations.  In  addiction  platforms  that  operate  under  MiFID  are  automatically  subject  to  Antimoney laundering and terrorist financing rules under the AntiMoney Laundering Directive. V.2.2|The current interpretation of MiFID to Investmentbased platforms However there are some divergences about how Member States approach the application of MiFID. Some Member States consider that Crowdfunding platforms must be authorised under bespoke  regimes.  This  because  it  is  common  though  that  Crowdfunding  platforms  do  not provide \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvestment services and activities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in relation to transferable securities or other financial instruments as defined in Section A of Annex 1 (for instance \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnonreadily realisable \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa020 MiFID defines \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTransferble securities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as classes of securities which are negotiable on the capital market with the exception of instruments of payment\'   \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa071\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0csecurities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d). According to that they would fall under the regulation of a domestic bespoke regime developed by each Member State since they are not in the scope of MiFID.  Table 6 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 MIFID authorisation Authorisation under MiFID Crowdfunding platforms provide investment services (as listed in Annex 1 Section A of MiFID)  in  relation  to  investment  listed  in  Annex  1  Section  C  of  the  same  Directive  in particular  transferable  securities  (shares  and  bonds)  or  units  of  collective  investment undertakings. Domestic bespoke regime under MiFID Article 3 exemption21 Authorised platforms can carry on crowdfundingrelated services and activities at national level  also  in  relation  to  MiFID  financial  instruments.  However  these  platforms  are  not allowed to passport their activities across the European Union unless they seek a full MiFID authorisation  (in  such  a  case  they  would  not  be  authorised  under  the  national  bespoke regime). Authorisation for services and activities not included in MiFID financial instruments When platforms do not provide services in relation to transferable securities or other MiFID financial instruments they need not be authorised under the Directive. Authorisation outside MiFID Framework Other  Member  States  have  developed  their  domestic  bespoke  regime  outside  the  MiFID framework  because  they  consider  that  investors  may  have  access  to  MiFID  financial instruments through platforms which are not in the scope of MiFID because such platforms do not carry out any MiFID service or activity.

According to MiFID II which it is expected to apply in 2018 and it will amend the present Directive Crowdfunding platforms would constitute a new regulated trading venue known as Organized Trading Facility (OTF) which will fall under the MiFID II regulation. V.3|The Prospectus Directive (2003/71/EC as amended) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe  prospectus  Directive  (PD)  requires  publication  of  a  prospectus  before  the  offer  of securities to the public or the admission to trading of such securities on a regulated market unless certain exclusions or exemptions apply22\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The Prospectus Directive only applies to securities offered to transferable securities as defined in MiFID therefore the obligation to publish a prospectus could apply to securities offering through Crowdfunding platforms. However the current Directive becomes applicable only in the following cases \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 PD only applies to MiFID financial instruments; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 PD only applies to securities included in an offer with a total annual consideration of \\xe2\\x82\\xac5 million. With regard to securities offered to the public or admitted to trading for amounts lower than \\xe2\\x82\\xac5 million issuers that are willing to offer securities through Crowdfunding platforms  may  not  need  to  produce  such  prospectus  (depending  on  Member  State\\xe2\\x80\\x99s threshold); \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Offers that are addressed only to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cqualified investors\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are exempt from the obligation to publish a prospectus; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Offers that are addressed to fewer than 150 natural or legal persons per Member State (other than qualified investors) are exempt from the PD. Nonetheless  once  an  exemption  is  found  issuers  must  also  comply  with  the  requirements provided by Member States securities laws. V.4| Regulating lendingbased Crowdfunding For what it concerns lendingbased Crowdfunding national regulatory regime is applied. The authorisation  requirements  are  different  by  Member  State  and  they  range  from  specific  to Crowdfunding to general authorisations and registrations similar to those used at national level to operate as financial intermediaries. Depending on the type of authorisation crowdlending as  a  regulated  activity  under  a  bespoke  regime  is  subject  to  additional  rules  on  capital \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa022  European  Securities  and  Market  Authority  ESMA/2014/1378  Opinion      Investmentbased  Crowdfunding available  at  https//www.esma.europa.eu/sites/default/files/library/2015/11/20141378_opinion_on_investmentbased_crowdfunding.pdf 18 December 2014 \\t \\xc2\\xa073\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0crequirements professional qualification and conduct. All Member States with bespoke regimes either in place or underway with one exception impose or plan to apply capital requirements. Some bespoke regimes also require platforms to have arrangements in place to ensure that loans continue to be administered if a platform goes out of business and impose on platforms the organisational duty to draft publish online and enforce policies and procedures in order to ensure business continuity. The standards of professional qualification and conduct rules vary by Member States.  V.5| Crowdfunding Framework in EU Member States Despite a relevant number of directives issued by the European Commission there is still a lack of a legal harmonisation among European countries which have provided their own regulation on Crowdfunding. To date requirements differ by Member State that treat the Crowdfunding activity like a general trade or like a more specific activity V.5.1| Crowdfunding Regulation in the UK The United Kingdom is currently the most developed market for PeertoPeer lending with a proper trade association \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeertopeer Finance Association\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (P2PFA) that represents 90% of the entire UK market. In the UK Crowdfunding is regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) where it involves activities that fall within the scope of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFinancial Services and Markets Act 2000\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (FSMA).  Over  the  last  years  Crowdfunding  has  been  a  key  focus  of  the  FCA  and  the Government  aiming  at  promoting  Crowdfunding  as  an  alternative  finance  method  for individuals and businesses. According to this Crowdfunding is regulated by the FCA \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif it involves a person carrying on a regulated  activity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  or  if  it  involves  the  communication  of  a  financial  promotion  for  the purpose of Section 21 of FSMA.  (i) \\xc2\\xa0 Investmentbase Crowdfunding In order to conduct a regulated activity platforms operating this business model are required to be authorised by the FCA unless an exemption is available.  To ensure a more sustainable regime and limit potential risks for investors in 2014 the FCA issued a Policy Statement \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPS 14/04 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 The FCA\\xe2\\x80\\x99 regulatory approach to crowdfunding over the Internet and the promotion of nonreadily realisable securities by other media\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whose aim was to restrict the type of investors to whom platforms can offer promotions for unlisted equity or debt securities called \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnonreadily realisable securities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Under the Financial Promotion Regime firms promoting these types of products via Equity \\t \\xc2\\xa074\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cCrowdfunding platforms must promote these investments only to investors that understand the inherent risks or have the capacity to bear any losses such as \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Professional clients; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 retail clients who confirm that in relation to the investment promoted they will receive regulated investment advice or investment management services from an authorised person; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 retail clients who are venture capital contracts or corporate finance contracts; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 retail clients who are certified or selfcertified as sophisticated investors; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 retail clients who are certified as high net worth investors; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 restricted investors who certify that they will not invest more than 10% of their net investible financial assets in unlisted equity and debt securities23. In the case that no advice has been provided to investors platforms have to ensure the investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s understanding of the risks involved. In particular platforms must run \\xe2\\x80\\x9cappropriateness tests\\xe2\\x80\\x9d where investors must certify that they understand the risks related to the investments.  (ii) \\xc2\\xa0Lendingbased Crowdfunding Before 2014 the regulation of platforms offering debt securities such as bonds or debentures was closer to the regulation of platforms that offer equities. Platforms offering nonsecurities based lending were not treated as carrying on a regulated activity so that the lendingbased model developed quickly as an alternative to bank loans.  However from 1 April 2014 the Financial Conduct Authority assumed the responsibility of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOffice for Fair Trading\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (OFT) to regulate the consumer credit market including loanbased Crowdfunding platforms. In order to regulate P2P lending the FCA applied a new regulated activity of \\xe2\\x80\\x9coperating an electronic system in relation to lending\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Chapter 6B art. 36H of FSMA) which establishes that  P2P  platforms  are  carrying  out  a  regulated  activity  if  they  are  facilitating  lending  and borrowing between individuals and businesses under an article 36H agreement. Under this rule firms  (previously  regulated  by  the  Office  for  Fair  Trading)  operating  an  electronic  system become subject to regulation by the FCA under an interim permission regime.  The new regulated activity only applies to loans where24 Financial \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa023 4.7 http//www.fca.org.uk/static/documents/policystatements/ps1404.pdfMarch 2014 24 Chapter 6B art. 36H(6) of Financial Services Markets Act 2000. paragraph Authority Conduct 14/04 PS available online at \\t \\xc2\\xa075\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0c\\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 The lender is an individual or relevant person; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 The borrower is an individual or relevant person and o \\xc2\\xa0 The lender provides the borrower with credit less than or equal \\xc2\\xa325000 or; o \\xc2\\xa0 The agreement is not entered into by the borrower wholly or predominantly for the purposes of a business (\\xe2\\x80\\xa6). Under this regime platforms with interim permissions had a time window (between August and October 2015) during which they were required to apply for full FCA authorisation or lose their authorised status; by contrast new firms entering the market after April 2014 must first register and obtain the full authorisation from the FCA before operating into the P2P market. Under the Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 (FSMA) in order to conduct a regulated activity platforms are required to be authorised by the FCA unless an exemption is available. Platforms performing loanbased Crowdfunding are subject to the following main tenets of the P2P Regime \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Publication of historic performance loan data; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Capital adequacy requirement which is currently \\xc2\\xa320000 but it will be increased to \\xc2\\xa350000 or a percentage of the volume of loaned funds by 1 April 2017; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Client money segregation platforms holding client money must be authorised to hold client money as set out in CASS; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Clear fair and not misleading communications with lenders firms must ensure that investors have enough information to take informed investment decisions; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Resolution plans for investor protection in the event of platform\\xe2\\x80\\x99s failure. The UK regulation limits the amount a fundseeker can raised to \\xe2\\x82\\xac5 million in a 12month period. V.5.2|Crowdfunding Regulation in France The French Regulatory Framework for Crowdfunding is characterized by the adoption of a new set of rules the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOrdinance on Crowdfunding activities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d detailed in specific provisions by the Decree no. 20141053 in 2014. This new regulation amended the General Markets Authority Regulations of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAutorit\\xc3\\xa9 des March\\xc3\\xa9s Financiers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (AFM) that corresponds to the French Financial Market Authority. The new regulation allows online platforms to rise up to \\xe2\\x82\\xac1 million in financing for businesses via loans or issuance of securities.

Under  this  new  regulation  all  offering  profit  loans  subordinated  loans  and  comparable investments are considered \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvestment products\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. However in order to boost these products and  encourage  investors  German  legislator  introduced  the  socalled  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCrowdfunding Exception\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that excludes Crowdfunding from most regulatory requirements especially the one related to the publication of a prospectus. However this exception is only applicable if the following conditions are satisfied \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Retail investors o \\xc2\\xa0 If the investor has freely available assets of at least \\xe2\\x82\\xac100000 they are allowed to invest up to \\xe2\\x82\\xac10000; o \\xc2\\xa0 If  the  investor  has  not  freely  available  assets  of  at  least  \\xe2\\x82\\xac100000  twice  the investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s monthly income but in any case no more than \\xe2\\x82\\xac10000; o \\xc2\\xa0 If the investor does not provide any income/assets statement \\xe2\\x82\\xac1000; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Professional  investors  and  Corporations  are  subject  to  investment  limit  exemption which means that there are no limits for this type of investors; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 The amount per project shall not exceed \\xe2\\x82\\xac25 million; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Platforms need a license under the German Trade Commerce and Industry Regulation \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0Act and under the German Banking Act or the German Securities Trading Act; In the previous versions of the regulation investors were asked to manually sign and send via mail to the crowdfunding platform the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvestment Information Sheet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. With the  entrance  into  force  of  the  new  regulation  this  process  can  be  carried out  electronically  and  consequently  make  investing  easier  and  smoother  for  all investors; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 An important change of regulation is related to the possibility to advertise crowdfunding \\t \\xc2\\xa078\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0ccampaigns to media focusing on economic topics that originally was prohibited. The approved  law  removes  this  obstacle  and  allows  for  advertising  also  through  other channels  such  as  social  media  provided  that  the  communication  includes  adequate warnings about the risks associated with the investment. V.5.4|Crowdfunding Regulation in the Netherlands In the Netherlands Crowdfunding has become a serious and recognized alternative for bank financing  so  that  the  Netherlands  Authority  for  the  Financial  Markets  (AFM)  published guidelines on the regulatory implications of Crowdfunding. The current Regulatory Framework falls under the scope of the Dutch Financial Supervision Act that regulates Crowdfunding and all parties involved within the process. Depending on the type of business model whether lending or equity license obligations will apply. According to the Dutch Regulation platforms can be qualified as intermediaries credit issuers or investment firms and they need to get licensed to operate or alternatively an exemption for it. On April 1 2016 the Regulation for equity and loanbased Crowdfunding has been amended to provide the following rules \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Maximum  amount  to  invest  in  equitybased  model  put  at  \\xe2\\x82\\xac  40.000  per  investor  per platform; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Maximum amount to invest in lendingbased model put at \\xe2\\x82\\xac 80.000 per investor per platform; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Maximum amount to invest per project put at \\xe2\\x82\\xac 5.000; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Platforms need to conduct an investor test to ensure the investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knowledge about investing and the risks associated with investing in startups prior to the investment; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Platforms must send an email to the investor within 1 working day after the initial investment. This email must contain information about the associated risk of the project and give the investor the possibility to change their minds about the investment; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 From the moment that a loan becomes negotiable the platform will be considered to provide investment services if it acts as a broker and consequently it will need a license to act as an investment firm and will become subject to MiFID. \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0 79\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cIV.5.5| Crowdfunding Regulation in Italy Italy has been the first European country to have a specific regulation for Crowdfunding. However the Regulation only focused on Equity Crowdfunding while for Lending model there is not a specific Regulation.  (i) \\xc2\\xa0 Investmentbased Crowdfunding In  2013  the  Italian  Financial  Supervisory  Authority  known  as  CONSOB  published  a Regulation for Equity Crowdfunding introduced by the Italian Government to facilitate the financing of small and mediumsize businesses and startups. Through the Law Decree 179/2012 as converted into Law 221/2012 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe Growth Decree 2.0\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and subsequent updates the Government introduced the concept of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinnovative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d startups. Within the articles 2532 the Growth Decree 2.0 defined and regulated the innovative startups and introduced \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Articles 50quinquies \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGestione dei portali per la raccolta di capitale per le startup innovative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 100ter \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOfferte attraverso portali per la raccolta di capitali\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  of the Legislative Decree No. 58/1998 known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTesto Unico Finanziario\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whose discipline has been implemented by the CONSOB on 14 July 2013 and then amended in 2016. Since its entering into force the main obstacle of this regulation was represented by the fact that the scope of its activity was too narrow since it focused only to a particular type of startups and to equity financial instruments. Because of that the regulation has been recently amended with the introduction of a new Law Decree No. 24/2015 known as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvestment Compact\\xe2\\x80\\x9d converted into Law on March 2015. This new Law enlarged the scope of activity of the previous Regulation by adding to innovative startups the category of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinnovative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d SMEs. According to the new Italian Regulation in fact also  venture  capital  companies  and  undertakings  for  collective  investment  which  invest  in innovative startups or innovative SMEs are allowed to raise capital online through Equity Crowdfunding. In the overall design of the legislator the Equity Crowdfunding is seen as a tool to foster the development of startups and SMEs through rules and funding arrangements that are able to exploit the potential of Internet.  \\t \\xc2\\xa080\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0c(ii) \\xc2\\xa0The \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegolamento sulla raccolta di capitali di rischio tramite portali online\\xe2\\x80\\x9d The  current  Regulation  for  Equity  Crowdfunding  has  been  implemented  by  the  CONSOB through  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegolamento  sulla  raccolta  di  capitali  di  rischio  tramite  portali  online\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  that represents the reference text for the discipline of Crowdfunding in Italy. This Regulation sets rules on the Platforms on the offers and obligations of communications to the Italian Authority. The Regulation provided by CONSOB requires that the management of a platform can be  conducted  only  by  investment  companies  and  investment  banks  which  are automatically  enrolled  in  a  special  section  of  the  register  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegistro  dei  gestori\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  or; companies that have the authorisation of CONSOB to provide the investment services and must  be  registered  in  the  ordinary  section  of  the  same  register  if  they  meet  certain requirements. The  register  contains  a  series  of  information  (i.e.  registration  number  registered  office administrative  headquarters  the  Internet  address  and  web  link  etc.)  about  all  investment companies  and  banks  that  provide  investment  services  which  must  communicate  to  the CONSOB before starting to operate their activity of management of a portal. Article 13 of the Regulation establishes the duties of platforms which must \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 work with diligence fairness and transparency avoiding that any conflicts of interest that may rise can adversely affect the interests of the investors and issuers; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 make available to investors all correct clear and non misleading information about the offer  in  order  to  enable  them  to  reasonably  and  fully  understand  the  nature  of  the investment the type of financial offer and the risks attached as well as take conscious investment decisions; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 ensure that investors which are not professional investors can bear the risks attached to the financial investment; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 ensure investors that all information on the portal\\xe2\\x80\\x99s web site are updated and accessible for a 12month period; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 ensure  that  investors  have  the  capacity  and  the  experience  necessary  to  understand essential features and risks attached to the investment and in case it deems that the financial instrument is not appropriate for the client it warns him. Under the Italian law and regulation an offer can be successfully completed only if at least  5%  of  the  offered  share  capital  is  paid  by  professional  investors  by  banking foundations or startups incubators. \\t \\xc2\\xa081\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cItalian Regulation relies on the action of professional investors to protect the nonprofessional investors from the possible risks. This means that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCrowdfunding in Italy most likely acts as a substitute for early seed venture capitalists25\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The Italian Regulation limits the amount raised to \\xe2\\x82\\xac5 million in a 12month period.  (iii) \\xc2\\xa0Lendingbased Crowdfunding Even though the Italian Regulation does not provide a specific Regulation for lendingbased Crowdfunding the existing platforms operating in Italy are subject to the authorization of the Bank of Italy. The article 106 of the Italian Consolidated Law on Banking know as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTesto Unico  Bancario\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  regulates  the  financial  intermediaries  who  are  subject  to  a  prudential supervisory regime equivalent to that of banks. In particular the current article regulates the funding activity and aims at achieving financial stability stating that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cL\'esercizio  nei  confronti  del  pubblico  dell\'attivit\\xc3\\xa0  di  concessione  di finanziamenti  sotto  qualsiasi  forma  \\xc3\\xa8  riservato  agli  intermediari  finanziari autorizzati iscritti in un apposito albo tenuto dalla Banca d\'Italia\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. According  to  that  platforms  that  operate  Loan  Crowdfunding  have  to  work  as  financial institution of payments such as financial intermediaries authorised by the Bank of Italy.

The same system is not working however outside of the European Union and especially from continent to continent. To date Alternative Finance is still largely a national phenomenon with crossborder activity still very limited. The principal reason of such limitation is the introduction of bespoke regimes by  Member  States  which  are  tailoring  Crowdfunding  Regulation  to  the  needs  and characteristics  of  their  own  domestic  markets.  In  particular  the  divergences  in  the harmonization of crossborder activity partly derive from the lack of a common definition of what types of services constitute "Crowdfunding" and from the different thoughts about the subjection of platforms to MiFID.  According to this it is possible to identify the main obstacles to crossborders as follow26 \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Large variety of national legislations; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Discretion of Member States in transposing European Directives as in the case of MiFID; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Adoption of different regulatory solutions that hamper the creation of a future harmonization. V.8| Building a Capital Markets Union A possible action against the limitation of crossborder activities is the attempt to establish a Capital Market Union. For this purpose the European Commission has realised a Green Paper \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBuilding a Capital Markets Union\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that aims at enhancing the flows of capital from investors to European investment projects by providing more efficiency in market infrastructure and intermediaries and improving allocation of risk and capital across the European Union as well as making Europe more resilient to future shocks.

This regulation which will become effective on May 2016 implements the requirements of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cJumpstart Our Business Startups Act\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (JOBS Act) and allows companies to offer and sell securities through Crowdfunding. The final rules provide requirements that  \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Allow individuals to invest in securitiesbased Crowdfunding transactions based on \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0certain thresholds; limit the amount of money that an issuer can raise using the Crowdfunding exemption; impose issuers (companies) to disclose certain information about their business and securities offering; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 create a regulatory framework for intermediaries such as broker and dealers; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0introduce a new term for intermediaries such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfunding portal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d better known as Crowdfunding platforms; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 create a regulatory structure for regulate the role of intermediaries either as brokerdealer as funding portals. The JOBS Act substantially changed a number of laws and regulations including provisions that allow small businesses to offer portion of equity to private citizens through the use of online platforms in order to encourage the funding of SMEs. The Title III of the JOBS Act which can be cited as the \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x98Capital Raising Online While Deterring  Fraud  and  Unethical  NonDisclosure  Act  of  2012\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x99  or  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x98\\xe2\\x80\\x98CROWDFUND Act\\xe2\\x80\\x99\\xe2\\x80\\x9d amends the Section 4 of the US Securities Act of 1933.  The principal amendments on the Securities Act of 1933 can be summarised as follow 1. \\xc2\\xa0 Crowdfunding Exemption Section 4(a)(6) of Title III provides an exemption from the registration requirements of Section 5 for certain Crowdfunding transactions. The Section 4(a)(6) limits the amount that a company can raise through Crowdfunding.  Under the final rules \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 An  issuer  is  permitted  to  raise  a  maximum  aggregate  amount  of  $1  million through crowdfunding offerings in a 12month period; \\xe2\\x80\\xa8 \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Individual investors over the course of a 12month period are permitted to invest \\t \\xc2\\xa089\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cin the aggregate across all crowdfunding offerings up to \\xe2\\x80\\xa8 o \\xc2\\xa0 If either their annual income or net worth is less than $100000 then the greater of  $2000 or 5 percent of the lesser of their annual income or net worth; o \\xc2\\xa0 If both their annual income and net worth are equal to or more than $100000 then 10 percent of the lesser of their annual income or net worth; and \\xe2\\x80\\xa8 \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 During the 12month period the aggregate amount of securities sold to an investor through all crowdfunding offerings may not exceed $100000. \\xe2\\x80\\xa8 However  there  are  certain  companies  that  are  not  eligible  to  use  the  Regulation Crowdfunding exemption. Ineligible companies include   \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 nonU.S. companies; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 companies that already are Exchange Act reporting companies;  companies that are disqualified under Regulation Crowdfunding\\xe2\\x80\\x99s disqualification rules;  companies that have failed to comply with the annual reporting requirements under Regulation Crowdfunding during the two years immediately preceding the filing of the offering statement and;  companies that have no specific business plan or have indicated their business plan is to engage in a merger or acquisition with an unidentified company or companies;  \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa02. \\xc2\\xa0Requirements  with  respect  to  certain  small  transactions  In  order  to  guarantee  the investor protection point C of Section 4(a)(6) of Title III requires that offering transactions take place through an intermediary either as broker or a funding portal. In this context section 4A provides a series of requirements regarding solicitation limitations disclosure obligations and other requirements and prohibitions for intermediaries and issuers involved within  the  transaction.  The  key  factor  for  investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99  protection  is  that  Crowdfunding transactions must take place through intermediaries that are registered with the Securities and Exchange Commission.  The same section requires them to disclose certain information to investors and potential investors such as disclosures related to the risks associated with the investments and other educational materials and to take other actions and measures to reduce the risk of fraud. Furthermore  intermediaries  must  communicate  certain  information  to  the  Commission \\t \\xc2\\xa090\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cwithin the terms provided. Issuers have to file certain information with the Commission and disclose it to investors and intermediaries; 3. \\xc2\\xa0Disqualification  Provisions  the  Commission  established  disqualification  provisions under which an issuer would not be able to avail itself of the exemption for crowdfunding if the issuer or other parties including intermediary were subject to a disqualifying event; 4. \\xc2\\xa0 Limited exemptions for funding portals Section 3 (h) of Title III separately requires the Commission  to  adopt  rules  to  exempt  either  conditionally  or  unconditionally  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfunding portals\\xe2\\x80\\x9d from having to register as a brokerdealer under the Exchange Act Section 15(a)(1).

This chapter will provide the analysis of strengths weaknesses opportunities and threats of Fintech industry with particular focus on Alternative Finance sector. In order to formulate the conclusion of the present study next pages will analyse how banks may decide to approach these phenomena. Is it better to compete or collaborate? In this last chapter we will try to answer this question by evaluating what are the main advantages of staying in. VI.1| SWOT Analysis  The analysis of different operating business models allows to gather many information about value  propositions  and  competitive  advantage  that  characterize  and  distinguish  Alternative Financial solutions with respect of traditional ones. However we also got aware about the risks associated with these models. In  order  to  recap  all  of  the  main  positive  and  negative  features  and  outline  potential opportunities  and  threats  next  paragraph  will  propose  a  SWOT  Analysis  that  mixes  the common characteristics of Fintech and Alternative Finance since they are strictly connected. VI.1.1|Strengths of Alternative Finance 1) \\xc2\\xa0 Absence of legacy operating costs one of the most important advantages of Fintech companies relies on the cost advantage. Companies operating Alternative Finance do not face operating costs typically linked to banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 extensive branch networks and IT systems. This requires banks to sustain a huge amount of costs that could be saved as the figure above demonstrates;          \\t \\xc2\\xa092\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cFigure 22  The cost advantage of Fintech marketplace lenders  Source \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Lending Club website  2) \\xc2\\xa0 Regulatory advantage in the aftermath of Financial Crisis banking Regulation has become more stringent forcing banks to respect certain capital requirements to improve the  ability  of  financial  institutions  to  absorb  shocks  and  avoid  further  collapses  all resulting  in  lower  efficiency  and  lack  of  possible  innovation.  Fintech  companies instead  are  subject  to  a  light  Regulation  with  no  capital  requirements  and  in  some cases platforms operating certain type of Alternative Finance solution will join some exemptions; 3) \\xc2\\xa0 Higher flexibility while banks do not have too much flexibility in terms of opening time Fintech companies make financial transactions and customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s finances available 24x7 from any place; 4) \\xc2\\xa0 Speed Fintech companies provide more speed in terms of time to process the loan application which approximately takes 12 days against approximately 3 months took by banks. The process includes the process of investigation of the potential borrower the loan listing into the marketplace and the lending process (see figure 23). This represents \\t \\xc2\\xa093\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0ca big advantage especially for situations where businesses need liquidity; Figure 23 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 P2P loan or Bank loan?  Source \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Funding Circle website  5) \\xc2\\xa0 Technological advantage Fintech companies are totally digital and totally based on technology innovations; 6) \\xc2\\xa0 No collateral requirements Alternative Finance solutions do not require collaterals. Indeed marketplace lenders offer unsecured lending favouring small businesses which very  often  have  stable  cash  flows  but  no  tangible  collaterals  that  banks  could  lend against; 7) \\xc2\\xa0 More  efficiency  Fintech  companies  do  use  any  paperwork  letting  customers  stay home and access financial services directly onto the web. This results in no bureaucracy issues and more efficiency; 8) \\xc2\\xa0 Customer experience differently from banks Fintech is able to offer customers the experience to reach what they need with a few \\xe2\\x80\\x9cclicks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d whenever and wherever they want.  VI.1.2|Weaknesses of Alternative Finance 1) \\xc2\\xa0 Low customer base An element that can negative affects the development of nonbanks players\\xe2\\x80\\x99 activity is the lack of existing customers faced by Fintech companies which may find difficult to acquire them costeffectively in most cases; 2) \\xc2\\xa0 Lack of reputation From the moment that Fintech is a new phenomenon that is still growing nonbank players can suffer from a lack of reputation due to the low level of awareness among the public; 3) \\xc2\\xa0 Information Asymmetry a big weakness of the market is represented by imperfect \\t \\xc2\\xa094\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cinformation affecting SMEs and online platforms which results in a market failure. Many SMEs only approach the largest banks when seeking finance. Although a large number of these applications are rejected (rejection rate 50%) part of these are viable and are rejected simply because they do not meet the risk profiles of the largest banks. However there are often challenger banks (smaller institutions) and Alternative Finance providers with different business models that may be willing  to  lend  to  these  SMEs  but  in  many  cases  challenger  banks  and  other providers  of  finance  are  unable  to  offer  finance  as  they  are  not  aware  of  the existence of such SMEs and the SMEs are not aware of the existence of these alternative sources of finance.   VI.1.3| Opportunities of Alternative Finance 1) \\xc2\\xa0 Leverage existing infrastructures Fintech companies may take advantage from the possibility to join \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccoopetition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and find ways to engage with the existing ecosystem of banks (a specific paragraph to argue about this topic will be proposed next); 2) \\xc2\\xa0 Innovation in the use of big data and credit scoring models big data and advanced analytics offer potentials to predict customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnext best actions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d understand customer needs and deliver financial services in a new way. Credit underwriting in banks often operates with a case law mindset and relies heavily on precedent. In a world where more than 90% of data has been created in the last two years FinTech data experiments hold promise  for  new  products  and  services  as  well  as  evaluates  in  a  more  accurate  the creditworthiness of borrowers. Marketplace lenders use heavily datadriven and semiautomated risk assessment methods which banks may not have. Foundation Capital defined  the  access  to  new  data  as  a  possibility  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cto  outFICO  FICO.  The  best  loan marketplaces  have  developed  their  own  data  sources  and  algorithms  to  evaluate potential borrowers. New insights can be gleaned from data sources that incumbents have not even begun to consider\\xe2\\x80\\xa6\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 28. Retail banks do not have access to these data but as Foundation Capital pointed out \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthey  lack  the  analytics  and  organizational  focus  to  lead  or  even  keep  up  with  this growing field. New marketplaces on the other hand recognize that integrating new \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa028\\t \\xc2\\xa0Foundation Capital Whitepaper A Trillion Dollar Market By the People For the People How Marketplace Lending Will Remake Banking As We Know It available online at https//foundationcapital.com/assets/whitepapers/TDMFinTech_whitepaper.pdf. \\t \\xc2\\xa095\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0csources of data is their competitive advantage.

The loans in question failed to conform to the investor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s express instructions as to a noncredit and nonpricing element;  3) \\xc2\\xa0 Operator insolvency a real concern lies in a platform blow up due to undisclosed losses poor cost control and/or failure to keep originating lenders and borrowers. \\t \\xc2\\xa0 \\t \\xc2\\xa0         \\t \\xc2\\xa0 96\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cFigure 24  SWOT analysis  \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0Strengths Speed; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Absence of legacy operating costs; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Regulatory advantage; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Higher flexibility; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Technological advantage; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 No collateral requirement; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 More efficiency; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Customer experience Weaknesses \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Lower Customer base; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Lack of reputation; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2Information asymmetry Opportunities Threats \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Leverage existing infrastructures; Innovation in the use of big data \\xe2\\x80\\xa2and credit scoring models; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Customer referral; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Government support \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s default; \\xe2\\x80\\xa2\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Operator insolvency Frauds;  \\t \\xc2\\xa0VI. 2|An opportunity or a threat for banks How banks respond to Alternative Finance? Financial  institutions  have  multiple  approaches  to  respond  to  the  potential  disruption  of Alternative Finance. While  some  years  ago  the  great  attitude  of  banks  was  to  avoid  the  rise  of  such  a  new phenomenon today things have changed let a new trend emerging. In  particular  there  are  more  strategies  that  banks  are  taking  into  account  for  remaining competitive into the new space of financial services and they are analysed as follow  1) \\xc2\\xa0 Competing  Depending on its strategic goals a bank may decide to develop its own Alternative Finance platform thus becoming a direct competitor of existing marketplace lenders. In this way a small business owner that does not meet the bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit and/or profitability criteria and consequently sees his/her loan application rejected can obtain the funds as well. \\t \\xc2\\xa097\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cIn  particular  with  hybrid  lending  strategies  the  bank  can  guarantee  part  of  the  loan  on  its balance sheet based on its risk appetite while listing the rest on its online lending platform where investors lend the money off balance sheet at a slightly higher interest rate.  However deciding to approach the competing solution may have some difficulties such as the risk for bank to cannibalise its own products and higher costs of implementation.  2) \\xc2\\xa0 Collaborating The collaborative solution provides the banks to act as investors by purchasing loans from Alternative Finance players. In this case banks make contractual arrangements with online platforms to buy their loans and diversify their investments into segments that are not normally subject to traditional lending.  Examples  of  existing  partnerships  between  marketplace  lenders  and  financial  institutions include  The British Business Bank (a development bank wholly owned by the UK Government) has provided RateSetter with an investment and for each loan that qualifies under agreed criteria the Bank will be one of the investors for this loan.  They agreed to create a strategic alliance under which Union Bank purchases personal loans through Lending Club platform. The two companies work together to create new credit products to be made available to both companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 customer base.  This strategic relationship brings together Lending Club\\xe2\\x80\\x99s low operating cost and Union Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strong balance sheet and large customer base. Both companies focus on responsible lending and customer service which helps unlock lower rates and superior service to both companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 customers.  From Lending Club\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective this strategic alliance is the way to leverage Union Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s strengths consisting of high reputation for transparency high 98\\t \\xc2\\xa0  \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cquality products and customer service. From Union Bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s perspective instead this is the chance to invest in high quality assets and new products. While the core business of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorsadelCredito.it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is just the P2P lending for amounts that they do not lend (given their role of intermediary) or higher than those imposed by the Bank of Italy there are support from the partner banks in this case Deutsche Bank that provides such payments. The platform  limits  itself  to  make  a  first  investigation  on potential borrowers then it passes the practice in the bank that eventually meets the customer to provide the funding.   3) \\xc2\\xa0 Partnering Create a partnership is an attractive opportunity for many institutional investors and works in two ways that involve partnership programs with the local Government and other governmental institutions or creating partnership agreements between a bank and a platform. The  first  partnership  requires  financial  institutions  to  refer  customers  who  do  not  meet traditional lending criteria to marketplace lenders. In this way customers can apply for loans on a cobranded website. This mutually beneficial arrangement enables platforms to access more borrowers while banks can leverage the platform\\xe2\\x80\\x99s technology to screen their current customers for consumer loan refinancing. The UK is the country whereby the above partnering solution  is  the  most  developed  also  thanks  to  the  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  action  of  establishing  the mandatory \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferral Scheme for high street banks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is being implemented under the Small Business Enterprise and Employment Act.  This program obliges the most higher street banks to refer on any small and mediumsize business whose loan application has been rejected the option to turn down for credit alternative finance platforms.   The  second  way  of  partnering  requires  financial  institutions  to  institute  a  process  in  which borrowers fulfil a loan application on a lending platform infrastructure and receive a loan from the financial institutions. To  date  a  range  of  banks  from  small  to  large  national  and  international  institutions  are partnering  with  many  existing  marketplace  lenders  to  help  make  smaller  loans  and  take \\t \\xc2\\xa099\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cadvantage  of  low  cost  structures.  Others  instead  partnering  with  the  aim  to  join  products development. Examples  of  existing  partnerships  between  marketplace  lenders  and  financial  institutions include  \\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0 \\xc2\\xa0Funding Circle is supported by the British Business Bank29. The British Business Bank and its subsidiaries do not offer bank accounts take deposits or provide regulated banking services but provides its financial support to smaller businesses through its delivery partner. Any decisions to provide finance to smaller businesses are made by Funding Circle not by the British Business Bank.

Mark Pitkin President & CEO of BancAlliance member Sugar  River  Bank  commented  "By  partnering  with Lending Club through BancAlliance our bank can offer access to a responsible product to our customers while at the same time acquiring assets with which we are very familiar  and  that  offer  higher  returns  than  many alternatives.  As  a  former  regulator  I  also  appreciate having  access  to  the  legal  regulatory  compliance  and credit  experts  at  BancAlliance  that  helped  us  vet  the Lending Club program30." According to the program the banks are committed to buy a certain amount of loans from Lending Club which will check  borrowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  ability  to  repay.  The  borrowers  come either from the bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own customers who the bank send to a Lending Club website or come directly to Lending Club. Now instead of analysing the loans on their own the banks rely on Lending Club\\xe2\\x80\\x99s software which uses a datadriven process to evaluate a borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to repay. This  helps  small  banks  extend  credit  to  borrowers  with lower credit scores than they previously served and build a pool of those loans. The effort is aimed at helping small banks overcome the cost  of  underwriting  a  large  pool  of  loans  while  also meeting regulatory requirements. \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa030 The Wall Street Journal www.wsj.com \\t \\xc2\\xa0101\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cJP Morgan Chase turned to On Deck platform to provide loans to SMEs.

To  date  the  number  of  financial  institutions  that  have  taken  this  strong  reorganisational decision is still very limited because this operation requires banks to invest much money into \\t \\xc2\\xa0102\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0ctechnological processes. The example of a successful transformation is the follow   After seven years of work BBVA has finally transformed itself and achieved the state of art of platform including all products and services and employees that are now working digitally.  This results into an increase in the number of transactions processed daily (from 90 million in 2006 to 250 million in 2013).  \\xc2\\xa0 6) \\xc2\\xa0 Incubating Other strategies follow the principle of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cif you can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t beat them join them\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Many banks are not launching incubators or accelerators such as spaces where startups can grow and collaborate with third parties to gain better insight into their technologies.  Examples include Barclays Tech Accelerator and Intesa SanPaolo Startup initiative.  7) \\xc2\\xa0 Investing A number of financial institutions are establishing venture funds to actively invest in startups.  One  of  the  most  recent  case  includes  UniCredit  one  of  the  leading  European  commercial banks and Anthemis Group the leading financial services technology venture and advisory firm which have announced a new joint investment venture UniCreditevo.  \\t \\xc2\\xa0103\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0c \\xc2\\xa0is  a  dedicated initiative  focused \\xe2\\x80\\x9cUniCredit  evo\\xe2\\x80\\x9d exclusively on identifying and investing in bestinclass financial technology startups.  With an initial capital commitment of \\xe2\\x82\\xac200 million from UniCredit  the  initiative  targets  mid  stage  startups  and followon  investments  in  more  mature  and  established FinTech businesses as well as early stage digitally native financial  services  startups  working  on  more  pioneering solutions. The aim of the investment is to help UniCredit accelerate the digitalization of its banking Group. Through investment  partnership  UniCredit  and Anthemis  will  cover  the  entire  lifecycle  of  emerging FinTech companies with a primary focus on Europe and North  America.  The  initiative  will  span  across  the  early startup  ideas  phase  to  maturity  and  apply  to  different fields of retail banking and consumer finance; investment and  corporate  banking;  wealth  and  asset  management; capital markets and trading; payments and financial data; technology and infrastructure. the *Source Unicredit Website  The COO and Deputy General Manager of UniCredit Paolo Fiorentino noted "Thanks to this partnership we are ramping up our digital transformation building a new business model to maximize the combined strengths of traditional market players and newcomers. As a bank we have the resources financial expertise and large customer base that can complement startup innovation. This will in turn boost our digitalization enabling us to better adapt to the everevolving needs of our customers. Today Anthemis becomes a key partner on this journey. By leveraging  their  wide  expertise  Anthemis  will  help  us  identify  top  class  players  and opportunities that will drive innovation and ultimately help us to better serve our customers."     \\t \\xc2\\xa0104\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cCONCLUSIONS  The aim of this thesis is to understand how the evolution of disrupting Alternative Finance is reshaping the sector of financial services and what are the major impacts on incumbents. For decades major banks have faced minor disruptions from the invention of the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAutomated Teller Machine\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (ATM) to the arrival of new technologies. The difference is that while those innovations  came  from  within  the  large  banks  and  most  were  driven  internally  by  banks themselves the current revolution is more profound.  Today banks live in a global economic and financial context characterised by a more strictly Regulation and the aftereffects of the Financial Crisis that leaded banks to reduce their lending activities principal cause of financial troubles of SMEs. In this situation individuals and business consumers have begun to approach financial products and services in a different way by embracing new challenger platforms to get financing and satisfy their financial needs. Customer needs are changed ad aim at a direct access to their capitals  everywhere  and  at  any  moment  overthrowing  physical  distances  and bureaucracy issues. Customer expectations rely on a fast and painless digital banking experience and expects incumbents to offer something similar. Most banks instead are not prepared to meet these expectations from the moment that they are still strictly linked to the traditional concept of banking characterised by the presence of a huge amount of branches inflexible opening times and paper documents. These factors together with a stringent regulatory framework which continues to pile pressure on to ensure that banks  develop  sufficient  protection  to  prevent  further  financial  collapses  and;  poor  data management systems; hamper financial institutions to quickly respond to consumer needs. All of this results in an increase of costs of infrastructures loss of efficiency and lack of the opportunities for banks to invest in technology and customer experience. On the contrary Fintech challengers (and in particular Alternative Finance solutions) provide everything  banks  are  not  able  to  offer  becoming  more  agile  in  efficiently  responding  to customer expectations. Indeed they have built a business based on a total digitalisation that allows  nonbank  players  to  dismiss  the  physical  presence  of  infrastructures  and  paper documentation  and;  the  possibility  for  customers  to  access  their  capitals  and  financial transactions  24x7  wherever  they  are  in  a  context  whereby  payment  system  has  lost  its physicality.  Furthermore  Fintech  companies  rely  on  technological  advanced  datadriven approach  that  permits  to  gather  a  significant  amount  of  personal  data  such  as  level  of education current and previous jobs living situations hobbies and interests (etc.) different from those accessed by banks to better assess worthiness of clients. \\t \\xc2\\xa0105\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cTo date there almost 2000 online platforms operating alternative banking solutions. The total amount of investments in Fintech is nearly $23 billion and it is growing fast across the years as well as the level of awareness associated with the Fintech companies. This is the time where financial institutions have to choose how to approach this phenomenon whether to compete or collaborate. If at the time where disrupting evolution was in its infancy banks tended to move toward the competition approach facing the risk to cannibalise their own products;  now  that  the  industry  is  maturing  and  becoming  mainstream  the  attitude  of incumbents is changing too.   From this study it emerges that the number of large financial institutions that are approaching alternative finance solutions in a collaborative way is increasing and a significant number of integrating  and  strategic  partnerships  between  incumbents  and  challengers  have  been developed resulting in a wintowin situation. Banks figured out the importance of being technological advanced and got aware that Fintech players are not their direct substitutes but can be their partners to enhance and accelerate the level of digitalization of banking sector.  Partnering means leverage each other strengths to create the best possible ecosystem where banks get the opportunity to fill their gaps and reduce the risk of being marginalized within the sector. Being proactive would allow banks to improve technical innovations get the speed of responding to customer needs expand credit lower operating expenses and finally increase the level of creativity so that they would become able to offer customers the experience they are looking for. These online processes reduce the loanclose cycle while improving  accountability  transparency  and  efficiency.  Furthermore  providing  better customer experiences will also increase revenue and harden loyalty among the customer base. At  the  same  time  developing  integrating  partnerships  would  give  Fintech  companies  the opportunity to get the features they need. In particular what alternative finance solutions need is capitals (since Regulation forbids the possibility to lend own money) more liquidity operating license and a good reputation to reach a broad range of customers.  Based on the above evidences questions about the future of banks and financial services are coming to light.  To date it is difficult to state for sure what will be next because the phenomena of Fintech and Alternative Finance are still more recent and many countries are starting to experiencing them now. However the results of the present study give an important contribution to fix what are \\t \\xc2\\xa0106\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cthe future actions that should be taken to ensure the success of a new market that involves a collaboration between both the sector of financial services and digitalized players. From Fintech perspective the analysis of the whole Regulation currently in force highlighted some weaknesses of the system based on a nonhomogeneous Regulatory Framework among European countries most of which use their local legislation to regulate the development of the different forms of Alternative Finance. Furthermore in other countries like Italy the study shows that there is still a poor regulatory structure for what it concerns certain type of financing solutions. All of this results in a lack of efficiency and opportunities to join from international capital flows and cross border activities that we have seen to be very limited.  Another  relevant  obstacle  that  emerged  from  this  study  is  the  level  of  awareness  among customers about the existence of Alternative Finance players. Although statistics show a big increase in the level of global investments there are still potential customers (investors and borrowers) that are not aware about the potential of Fintech companies. By the contrary there are even challenger banks that do not know about individuals and SMEs in troubles.  In  order  to  solve  these  serious  gaps  initiatives  from  local  Governments  and  International Authorities are needed to sustain the development and success of such these new phenomena. In particular for what it concerns the nonhomogeneous Regulatory Framework the effort of the European Commission to build a Capital Markets Union can be considered only a primary step that will surely bring some economic and financial opportunities.  For  what  about  increasing  the  level  of  awareness  among  customers  whereas  a  further institutional way to sustain growth and success of Alternative Finance models may rely on the effort of Governments to invests into promoting campaigns and the implementation of some programs  as  in  the  case  of  the  UK  that  implemented  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cReferral  Scheme  for  high  street banks\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  From  banks  perspective  the  primary  actions  to  take  rely  on  innovation.  Those  banking institutions that wish to survive in the future will have to launch innovation campaigns and digitalization programs through which it will be possible to reach the new customer targeting.     \\t \\xc2\\xa0107\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cAppendix A  The impact of Basel III the principal innovations introduced by the regulatory framework Basel III is a global comprehensive set of reform measures developed by the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision to strengthen the regulation supervision and risk management of the banking sector.  The global Financial Crisis revealed several deficiencies in the financial regulation so that it became necessary to develop a new regulatory framework to compensate those lacks. Basel III is intended to strengthen global bank capital requirements built on the three pillars of Basel II and liquidity rules with the goal of promoting a more resilient banking sector. The objective of the reforms is to improve the banking sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to absorb shocks arising from financial and economic stress whatever the source thus reducing the risk of spill over from the financial sector to the real economy31.  The most important innovations introduced by Basel III refer to \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Increase the quality of Minimum Common Equity Capital the crisis demonstrated that credit losses and writedowns come out of retained earnings which is part of banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 tangible  common  equity  base.  Furthermore  it  revealed  the  inconsistency  in  the definition of capital\\xe2\\x80\\x99s quality across jurisdictions and the lack of disclosure that would have  enabled  the  market  to  fully  assess  and  compare  the  quality  of  capital  among institutions.  In  this  context  Basel  III  increased  the  minimum  Common  Equity requirement from 2% to 4.5% reached in 2015; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Add a Capital Conservation Buffer starting from January 2016 banks are required to hold an initial Capital Conservation Buffer of 0.625% that will reach a definitive 2.5% value (after the application of deductions) in 2019. This capital serves to ensure that banks maintain a buffer of capital that can be used to absorb losses and resist during periods  of  financial  and  economic  stress.  In  this  way  the  total  Common  Equity requirements reaches 7% at the end; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Add an extensive countercyclical buffer a countercyclical buffer within a range of 0% \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2.5% of Common Equity or other fully loss absorbing capital will be implemented when  authorities  judge  credit  growth  is  resulting  in  an  unacceptable  build  up  of systematic risk; \\xc2\\xa7\\xef\\x82\\xa7 \\xc2\\xa0 Increase of Tier 1 Capital Tier 1 capital is the base capital which includes common \\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\t \\xc2\\xa031\\t \\xc2\\xa0Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (December 2010 rev June 2011)  A global regulatory framework for more resilient banks and banking systems available online at https//www.bis.org/publ/bcbs189.pdf.  \\t \\xc2\\xa0108\\t \\xc2\\xa0\\x0cequity and other qualifying financial instruments based on stricter criteria.
