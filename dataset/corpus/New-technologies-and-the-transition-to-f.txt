A transition to the formal economy is a condition to realize decent work for all. Given the magnitude and decent work deficits associated  with the informal economy there is an urgency to tackle informality with an integrated approach which can bring more robust results. New  technologies  are  continuously transforming the  world  of  work.  Technology is transforming not only the way we work but also how we work and even why we work  for workers  and  economic  units.  The  role  of  new  technologies  and  its  relationship  with informality  has  been  addressed  from  different  perspectives.  For  policy  makers  it is important to know how new technologies are affecting the public sector in particular policy making. This paper focusses on how technologies can enhance the impact of institutional public policies addressing informality. Today an increasing number of governments are promoting the application of new technologies to simplify and facilitate the transition from the informal to the formal  economy. These    eformality policies    as  in some  cases are related to e government initiatives. This paper analyses some emerging public policies or publicsector practices and tools where technologies have already been implemented directly or indirectly for the  transition to formality. This raises the questions if these policy innovations will transform the way formalization policies will be implemented in the future. Finally the paper aims to serve as a basis for further discussions for policy makers around  the  world  who  are  searching  for  innovative  policy  solutions  for  facilitating  the transition to the formal economy and other actors who are concerned with this topic.

Introduction New  technologies  are  one  of  the  most  forceful  drivers  of  the  future  of  work. Technology is transforming not only the way people work (how) but also the very nature of work (what) and even its purpose (why). Technology comes in waves. In recent decades the world has witnessed the appearance and  evolution  of  computers  then  the  revolution  of  information  and  communications technologies  (ICTs)  then  mobile  and  smart  phones  and  then  the  surge  of  automation technologies.  There  are  of  course  differences  and  especially  lags  in  the  way  different countries or regions incorporate these innovations. The literature points out that these technological developments as any  technological international discussion on technology and work has centred on the risk of losing jobs or on the future of labour relations. More recently there has been some discussion on the potential change in history have tremendous effects on the labour markets.1 And much of the  recent of technology to support growth employment creation and labour market policies.2 The relationship between new technologies and informality has been addressed from different perspectives. Some studies focus on the appearance of new forms of informality     in particular nonstandard forms of work (ILO 2016a). Others focus on the process and difficulties of the informal sector units to incorporate new technologies in their business  or activities (Chen 2016). Some others analyse the effect of technologies on productivity and on informality (Barrantes C  ceres et al 2012; Galli 2017). And others see the definitions of formal or informal as becoming increasingly indistinguishable (Smith 2012).3 Technology  is  likely  to  have  both  positive  and  negative  effects  on  informality. Productivity and economic structure influence the income distribution and labour outcomes including informality. Technology can increase informality via the probable increase in the productivity  gaps  among  economic  units  especially  when  access  to  technologies  is  not equal or via the spreading of new forms of work especially those where informality  is higher. But the question is can it also reduce informality? In this paper we focus on how technologies can enhance the impact of institutional public policies addressing informality.4 Today an increasing number of governments  are promoting the application of new technologies to facilitate the transition from the  informal to the formal economy. We call these policies eformality policies as in some cases they are related to egovernment initiatives.5 In order to extract some crosscutting policy lessons we analyse some emerging public policies   or   publicsector  practices  or   tools   where   technologies   have   already  been  1 Hart K. 2000.

The future of informal economies    in Thesigers. 20 December 2012. http//thesigers.com/analysis/2012/12/20/thefutureofinformaleconomies.html 4 We leave aside the discussion on new technologies and other labour market policies such as active labour market policies for example that could also have a link with the transition to formality. 5  Note that a previous study uses the concept of    einformality   .

EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 1                                        implemented directly or indirectly for the transition to formality. We then ask if these policy innovations will transform the way formalization policies will be implemented in the future. The experiences we selected are based on a nonexhaustive web search trying to show the spread of these experiences around the world     especially in middle or lower income countries     and the diverse approaches taken. The paper aims at serving as a basis for further discussions for policy makers around the world who are searching for innovative policy solutions for facilitating the transition  to the formal economy and other actors who are concerned about this topic.   2 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247                          2. Policy approaches for the transition to formality After  almost  five  decades  of  focusing  on  informality  its  concepts  magnitude  and characteristics the related international discussion is currently turning its attention to the transition to the formal economy. An important threshold in this discussion has been the Transition from the Informal to the Formal Economy Recommendation 2015 (No. 204) adopted by the tripartite constituents at the International Labour Conference in 2015. The Recommendation indicates the threefold objectives of the transition to the  formal economy which are to (a) (b) facilitate the transition of workers and economic units from the informal to  the formal  economy  while  respecting  workers     fundamental  rights  and  ensuring opportunities for income security livelihoods and entrepreneurship; promote the creation preservation and sustainability of enterprises and  decent jobs in the formal economy and the coherence of macroeconomic employment social protection and other social policies; (c) prevent the informalization of formal economy jobs. Recommendation 204 states that the effective way to achieve these objectives is through applying the integrated approach that covers an array of policy areas including strategies for  inclusive  growth  formal  job  creation  social  protection  regulatory  frameworks enterprises development compliance and enforcement and so on. 2.1 Policy pathways to formality In the last decades the International Labour Organization (ILO) has seen an increasing number of countries implementing deliberate policies for the transition to formality  around the  world.  These  policies  together  with  economic  growth  and  structural  transformation processes have contributed to a reduction in informality in some regions or countries.6 In practice the experience shows that countries have explored different pathways  to formality  mainly  related  to  the  increase  in  economic  capacity  (productivity);7  the improvement of norms or regulations; the design and implementation of incentives; and the improvement of enforcement systems and measures (figure 1).  6  For  more  details  on  this  experiences  see  for  example  the  ILO.  2014a.  FORLAC  notes  on Formalization in Latin America a region with several documented experiences of formalization. See also Berg (2010) Bertranou et al. (2014) and Chacaltana (2016) for detailed country cases analyses of Brazil Argentina and Peru respectively. 7 Note that the link between productivity and informality can be both ways. See for example Kanbur (2017).  EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 3                  Figure 1. Main strategies used for the transition to formality                                            Source Authors. Productivity Countries have operated at three main economic levels the macroeconomic the meso economic and the microeconomic. First  at  the  macroeconomic  level  reductions  in  informality  have  occurred  during periods  of  high  growth  and  in  the  presence  of  an  enabling  environment  for  sustainable enterprises to create formal jobs. Second  productivity has  also  been  stimulated in  specific  sectors  at  what  could  be described as the    meso economic    level. Interventions are needed here even in a context of strong economic growth. The resulting formalization of employment and economic units will depend on the labour intensity in the sectors that drive it on the existence of productive chains that activate the labour demand or public policies for developing certain sectors  or regions. Third action has been taken at the microeconomic level by strengthening technology human capital or ways of production organization tackling outofdate technology     above all  in  smaller  businesses       and  addressing  the  issue of  training  deficits  in  workers     and employers    organizations. Regulations There  are  initiatives  in  various  complementary  fields.  The  first  aim  is  to  improve quantity quality and access to information and the knowledge of rights and obligations of employers workers and the general public. Sometimes economic units are not fully  aware of what it means to have a formal business or formal workers the benefits of being formal or the registration procedures for that.  4 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247              A second area is the adaptation or simplification of regulations or procedures.  There are various initiatives of this kind often combined with other tools     sometimes  incentives and support programmes and sometimes sanctions. Simplifications generally concern tax declaration labour procedures affiliation and contribution to social security registration of enterprises or unification of procedures. Procedures are often optional and for a specific segment such as small and micro enterprises therefore not applicable generally. A third complementary approach identified in this area is dialogue negotiation and consultation  processes  to  promote  improvements  in  the  design  and  compliance  with standards and regulations to ensure that they provide adequate and effective protection to all. The use of social dialogue in all its forms is key for changes in standards and regulations to be legitimate and sustainable. Incentives They vary in type. Some  are  associated with taxation mainly for small and micro economic units and sometimes including ownaccount workers. Some countries     such  as Argentina  Brazil  and  Uruguay       have  linked  their  tax  incentives  to  social  security contributions integrating various payments in a single tax. Some unconventional mechanisms have been used for these cases such as collective insurance  schemes  in  Argentina  and  Costa  Rica  or  subsidized  programmes  in  order  to increase social protection coverage. The use of unconventional affiliation methods is more common in groups that are hard to reach although more evidence is needed to assess the scale of its final impact on formalization levels. In many cases this is due to the fact that the experiences are very recent. The  challenge  as  ever  is  that  growing  affiliation  should  be  accompanied  by improvements in the services such as health services pensions or both. The health benefits may be visible in the short term but pensions are a longterm benefit. This does not only involve access but quality and coverage as informal workers and business owners are not in the system and clear and visible incentives must be provided for them to move into formality. Measures  to  encourage  formalization  by assigning benefits  to  specific  groups  must consider the timeframe and the process for gradual transition to the general system and the scope of regulation. Discrimination in the law against one group of citizens and weakening labour relations by reducing standards should always be avoided. The appropriate timeframe for becoming formalized should ensure that improving working conditions is the natural result and the main objective of formalization. These systems  should not be seen primarily as  vehicles for raising revenues but as mechanisms for the inclusion or incorporation into transition to formality of a broad  sector of workers and economic units that carry out their economic activities in the informal     and even the subsistence     economy. In some cases access to public services can be an incentive for example introducing targets for public procurement through Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) or allocating public space for informal workers and economic units to operate. Enforcement Finally  various  governments  have  taken  action  to  increase  the  State   s  capacity  to deliver services to all the population or to ensure that standards are met. In some cases this requires improving the information about the population   s duties and rights  strengthening the structures qualities transparency and accountability of the responsible institutions  or applying sanctions or promoting agreements and alliances between workers and employers.  EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 5                     In other cases governments have strengthened their inspection capacity by  increasing the number of inspectors or modernizing/adopting new technologies and databases for better supervision  and  monitoring.  And  in  further  cases  governments  have  adopted  specific inspection procedures to facilitate the transition to formality. These approaches have been used for the formalization of employment and  economic units with more or less emphasis on specific dimensions depending on regional or country context. Experience also shows that formalization policies require multiple interventions and policy coordination and an integrated approach in order to facilitate the transition to the formal  economy.  The  transition  also  requires  innovative  solutions  as  informality  is  not homogenous and not all informal workers or economic units are in that situation for the same reason.  For  example  for  groups  that  are  hard  to reach       such  as  own  account workers domestic workers or contributing family workers     some unconventional approaches  have been used either to increase their registration or to extend social protection to them. 2.2 Egovernment applied to formalization policies Eformality With the advent of new technologies many countries around the world have embarked on  egovernment  processes.  Although  there  is  some  discussion  on  the  definition  egovernment is usually defined as the use of ICTs to improve the activities of publicsector organizations. Through advanced technological tools    Egovernment  aims  at  improving  the  relationship  between  people  and  their  government     making public services delivery more effective accessible and responsive to people   s needs... increasing participation in decision making and making public institutions more transparent and accountable.   8 The United Nations Department of Economic and Social Affaire (UNDESA) monitors progress in egovernment through periodical surveys and constructing an index to  measure the effectiveness of egovernment in Member States.9 Its egovernment development index (EGDI)  comprises  three  subindices  each  of  which  assesses  key  dimensions  of  egovernment      Status of the development of telecommunication infrastructure (Telecommunication infrastructure index).      Scope and quality of online services (Online service index). Inherent human capital (Human capital index).     According to UNDESA egovernment has grown rapidly around the world over the past 15 years. It argues that the EGDI values have improved for many countries (29 countries  8 United  Nations  Department  of  Economic  and  Social  Affairs  (UNDESA).  2016.  E Government Survey 2016 EGovernment in support of sustainable development (New York). 9 A discussion on measuring digital government can be found in Ubaldi B; Lafortune G.

The Internet mobile phones and other innovative devices to share information and to deliver public services have spread widely in recent years. Figure 2. World.  Evolution of egovernment indices.  Source * UNDESA 2016. Note The components of the human capital index were updated in 2014. See EGovernment Survey 2016 table A.2 for further details. Also note that this assessment rates egovernment performance of countries relative to one another as opposed to being an absolute measurement. More studies and information would be required to assess if this progress promoted more inclusion in all dimensions of society. For the labour market a key indicator to measure exclusion is the proportion of workers in informal employment. Figure 3 shows the simple correlation between egovernment indices and informality rates around 2016 which can be affected by many other variables.  10 UNDESA defines    veryhigh    where egovernment development index values are in the range  of 0.75 to 1.0. 11  The index has improved significantly especially among developed countries (see figure A.1. in Annex).

Note Developed countries are considered as highincome countries as defined by the World Bank ($12236 or more; 34 countries) and emerging and developing countries as middleincome and lowincome countries ($12235 or less; 77 countries). Egovernment indices are from the year 2016 and informality rates are from year 2016 or the latest year available. We  observe  as  expected  a  negative  correlation  between  informality  rates  and  the egovernment development index scores as well as all its subindex scores. In other words countries  with  high  egovernment  indices show lower  informality  rates. The  average  egovernment development index score in 2016 for countries with low informality rates  is more than double that of countries with high informality rates.12 These differences increased in absolute terms during the period 20032016 and countries with high informality still have very low egovernment capacities (figure A.2 in Annex). In all cases we observe some variation in this relation but it is particularly high in the online service index. The online service index scores of countries with a more than 80 per cent informality rate varies widely from the score value 0.1 to 0.8. Since  both  informality  rates  and  the  egovernment  index  scores  are  influenced  by countries    level of development or income we perform crosssection ordinary least squares (OLS) regressions of informality rates on egovernment indices     not to identify  causality but to verify if these simple correlations still hold after controlling for per capita GDP (table A.1 in Annex).      12 In the calculation countries with high formality include countries with formality rate above 66 per cent (38 countries) and countries with low formality include those with formality rate below 33  per cent (47 countries) (see figure A.3 in Annex).  8 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247      The results confirm significant negative correlations in all cases except in the online service index.  One  possible  policy  implication  is  that  some  countries  may  not  be  using all their already acquired online service potential or capacity with a specific target on labour market issues or on informality. This means that much can be improved in this area in  many countries. Eformality is an item in that agenda.  EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 9                  3. Emerging experiences in the application of new technologies for the transition to formality New technologies not only can affect the way economic units and workers interact  in the labour market but they can also drastically transform how public policies work. This is the main purpose of egovernment initiatives for example. In the case of the transition to formality technologies are not only changing the way these types of policies work but they can even affect the very definition of    formality        often described as    registration        of economic units or workers or even transactions. The registration  act  for  any  of  the  dimensions  of  formality  changes  drastically  in complexity  and  time  required  depending  on  whether  it  is  done  manually  personally  or electronically virtually or in general with any of the new technologies including algorithms big data or artificial intelligence. Technologies can also affect any of the policy pathways to formality that countries are implementing through the following channels increase productivity for those who have access;          help in improving regulations as they disseminate information or simplify legal procedures;      help in designing and administering incentives in any of the tax social security  or labour  dimensions  that  increase  considerably  the  capacity  of  enforcement  and oversight. Policy emphasis will vary from case to case and from one region to another. Sometimes it focuses on the formalization of economic units; in others it focuses on the formalization of employment. In some cases it combines both dimensions. In others it focuses on the registration of transactions as a means to formality of economic units and employment. In  this  paper  we  review  some  innovative  experiences       mainly  in  developing  and emerging countries     that show that these governments are embarking on this new trend although there is still much to be done. We focus mainly on experiences related to public policy based on a review of secondary sources mainly in English and Spanish. We first explore  experiences  related  to  the  formalization  of  economics  units  and  then  describe experiences in the formalization of employment. 3.1 Formalization of economic units Formalization  of  economic  units  deals  with  economic  capacity  but  also  with registration procedures taxes and so on which are usually set up by governments. In many cases different institutions establish different sets of requirements and in most cases  they do not coordinate. The application of technology provides solutions that can reduce the costs of registration     often with the case of a virtual onestop shop     simplify timeconsuming procedures and increase compliance with tax obligations. More importantly it bridges the gap of different institutions in coordination for translating formalization of economic units into formalization of employment     for instance registration of workers and making social security contributions.  EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 11               3.1.1 Electronic registration or payment mechanisms for enterprises Since transaction costs were considered as a barrier for formalization of economic units (De Soto et al. 1986) onestop shops offer a solution as they simplify procedures.  Many countries  had  tried  to  implement  this  type  of  initiative.  Unfortunately  there  can  be complications  as  public  institutions  need  to  coordinate  and  align  their  systems  and procedures especially if they have to operate in a single physical location with one interface. New  technologies  have  allowed  the  appearance  of  electronic  registration tools including these onestop shops. The objectives of onestop shops are to reduce the time and cost  for  business  registration  as  well  as  to  improve  access  for  smaller  economic  units operating at a distance from the registrar   s offices (in some countries entrepreneurs must still travel to the capital city to register a business). Onestop shops generally include services such as registration procedures in local governments or sectorial government bodies. There is a trend towards virtual onestop shops. According to the World Bank13 in 2016 eightytwo economies offered electronic registration services for businesses but while this was possible in more than 80 per cent of highincome countries it was only about 13 per cent in lowincome ones. The report also mentions interesting cases in Canada Cyprus Ecuador New Zealand and the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia. In some cases all the countries do is make registration records electronic. In others this tool has eliminated some requirements for example the notarizing documents. In the Republic of Korea entrepreneurs can register their businesses online at a Staterun website14 as long as they attach the necessary documents such as the registration form and the  lease agreement.  The  mobile  application  is  also  available  to  check  the  current  status  of  the registration process which usually takes up to three days. In 2017 the Government of Colombia created the Ventanilla   nica Empresarial (VUE) a onestop shop mechanism that includes a web platform that is expected to  progressively incorporate all procedures related to the entrepreneurial activity. In time this web platform will be mandatory for opening and closing businesses and for information flows on the firm   s activities.15 The evidence on the use of onestop shops on formalization is scarce. However  some studies have shown that onestop shops indeed facilitate the registration of new firms  but not necessarily the formalization of their workers (Deelen 2015). More evidence on the use of virtual onestop shops is therefore needed. Sometimes but not always these developments are accompanied by  complementary tools such as  portals to register and pay taxes and portals to register and pay the social contributions.  The  quality  and  simplicity  of  portals  for  taxes  and  social  contributions however are very important. In  Estonia  the  eBusiness  register  is  an  advanced  and  secure  tool  that  allows entrepreneurs to register new businesses online in just minutes without having to go to a notary or  some other  official. From 2011 most companies have been  established over the  13 www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/startingabusiness/goodpractices  Using 14 www.hometax.go.kr 15  Decreto 1875  2017. Interestingly the Decree 639 of 2017 exempts a small business owned by young persons from the payment of the commercial licence (matr  cula mercantil) and its  renovation for the first year.  12 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247               Internet using the eBusiness register and this process has come down from five days to  18 minutes. The eResidency programme also allows nonEstonian citizens to access the eBusiness register and use the digital solutions when establishing a company in Estonia. The online register  makes  the  process  of  registering a  company  and  submitting documents such as annual reports easy and efficient for users no matter where they are.16 For taxation collection Estonia developed the eTax which is the electronic tax filing system set up by the Estonian Tax and Customs Board. Each year around 95 per cent of all tax declarations in Estonia are filed electronically. Using a secure ID a taxpayer logs  onto the  system  reviews  their  data  in  prefilled  forms  makes  any  necessary  changes  and approves the declaration form. The process typically takes three to five minutes. Even one click tax returns have been possible since 2015     the data that is already in the system is displayed for the user along with the calculated result then all the users have to do is click on the confirmation button. All this can take less than a minute. An enterprise can also make their declarations for income tax social tax unemployment insurance and contributions  to the mandatory pension fund.17 3.1.2 Registration of financial transactions payments and bills Operators in the informal economy tend to use cash partially because of their difficulty to have access to formal financial services or in attempt to avoid paying taxes. For  this reason an important emphasis of some governments is to register transactions under the idea  that  digitizing  financial  services  and/or  procedures  could  generate  incentives  and possibilities for the formalization of economic units and its workers.18 Tracking transactions can be considered an important tool for the transition to the formal economy as they increase transparency and accountability in the transactions dimension. The advent of mobile technology along with increasing smartphone penetration has generated  and  facilitated  new  possibilities  for  facilitating  electronic  transactions  and creating an ecosystem to initiate financial inclusion. Some  countries  explicitly  incentivize  the  transition  to  a  cashless  economy  or disincentive for the use of trackless cash. For example they incentivize the use of electronic money via the use of credit or debit cards or other solutions.19 The idea is not only to track transactions. Some argue that this could change the payment habits to be more secure  and efficient generate a financial track record which may facilitate access to finance and create opportunities for startups in the electronic payment area as there is a number of  noncash payment options in the market. Table 1 shows some examples. In the Republic of Korea since 1999 the Government gives an incentive     a tax deduction in income tax     if people reach a certain amount in credit card  transactions.  In  Vietnam  the  recently  approved     no  cash  policy     includes    the  16         https//eestonia.com/solutions/businessandfinance/ebusinessregister 17        https//eestonia.com/solutions/businessandfinance/etax 18  Ketterer  J.A.  2017.

And in Estonia a stateissued digital ID and a mobile app facilitate the use  of secure electronic transactions. Thailand launched mobile payment services with low fee as a  part  of  national  epayment  initiatives.  In  addition  the  real  estate  sector  in  Italy provides reimbursement and other advantages only when payment is made electronically.20 Table 1. Country experiences in incentives for electronic transactions Case Incentives for the use of credit card in the Republic of Korea21 No cash policy in Viet Nam Description Results As credit cards allow the disclosure of the transaction history to a third party the system enhances transparency in all commercial transactions. It also helps to reduce the tax burden on salary income earners. Expected results. The Plan expects that by 2020 cash transactions would total less than 10 per cent of total transactions; all sellers and distributors would accept cards. It also expects that many businesses specializing in online payments such as MoMo mobile payment eMonkey Payoo VTC Pay or BankPlus would be increasingly accessible to many. The Credit Card Income deduction scheme began in 1999. Taxpayers can receive a deduction on their yearend tax settlement of up to 3 million KRW (some 2800 US$) depending on the amount spent in credit cards purchases. If the aggregate personal expenditure billed within Korea of a taxpayer or his/her dependents exceed 25 per cent of his/her gross income 15 per cent of eligible amount is deducted from income tax. The deduction limit is the lesser amount between the 20 per cent of gross wage and  salary income and KRW 3 million.22 The purpose of the policy23 is to reduce the number of cashbased deals saving cost and time and improve overall electronic payment methods (increasing transparency and improving documentation) and control tax evasion. This includes      Point of sale systems and automatic teller machines would be established and use of multipurpose magnetic cards would be encouraged. Fees on cash payments could be increased while those on electronic payment for credit organizations and commercial banks could be reduced.      20 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 2017.

This experience increased rapidly in digital payment wallets enabling people to continue transaction. Many fintech (financial technology) companies set out to take on the wider foreign exchange market narrative. With significantly smaller overheads bulk handling and intelligent transferring fintech companies can offer realtime rates and negligible transaction surcharges. This is part of the Digital Agenda 2020 for Estonia.24 Every Estonian irrespective of location has a stateissued digital identity. Banks encourage customers to use their eID for secure transactions and internet banking services. One ebanking solution called    Pocopay app   25 allows customers to open and use a bank account from their mobile phone and to request and make payment in a cashless way. Results Fintech companies can be a solution to the world   s unbanked problem. Technology developed to enable currency exchange can now be used to help the billions of people excluded from traditional banking institutions. Today over 99 per cent of all banking transactions in the country are carried out online. Thailand launched a new interbank mobile payment system in January 2017 allowing money transfers that are cheaper and easier than those offered by conventional bank. It is one of the government   s national epayment initiatives.27 Customers will be limited to one PromptPay account for each national ID number or mobile phone number. It aims at nudging people into the formal economy by bringing more of the country   s financial transactions into the formal economy. Alternatively  some  countries  impose  penalties  to  discourage  cash  transactions.  In Greece  instead  of  an  incentive  taxpayers  incur  a  penalty  if  they  do  not  make  enough electronic payments. As of January 2017 if they do not spend a certain percentage of their annual income through electronic payments they will have a penalty of 22 per cent imposed on the missing difference between the minimum required payment and the actual  payment. For a taxable income up to 10000 euros (   ) at least 10 per cent of their income must be spent via electronic payments. For a taxable income between    10001 and     30000 and above       30000  the  minimum  percentage  increases  to  15  per  cent  and  20  per  cent respectively.  Also  tax  allowances  and  tax  deductions  are  available  only  for  electronic payments. On the other hand the cap for cash transactions fell from     1500 in 2016 to     500 in 2017. Any purchase of goods or services should be paid electronically now if it accounts for more than     500.28  24 www.mkm.ee/sites/default/files/digital_agenda_2020_estonia_engf.pdf 25 https//pocopay.com/en/ 26 Ono Y.

These laws  are  expected  to  increase  tax  revenue  and  fiscal  transparency  while  reducing underdeclared or undeclared activities. On the other hand another approach is to increase the registration of cash transactions. Many  countries  are  already  using  electronic  instead  of  paper  receipts30  to  track  cash transactions.  Some  countries  provide  incentives  for  using  ebills  while  others  sought  to establish a mandatory electronic invoice (table 2). Table 2. Country experiences in registering cash transactions Case Cash receipt income deduction scheme in the Republic of Korea31 Description Results When a cash receipt is issued the purchase information is sent directly to the National Tax Service. The system helps to enhance transparency in all commercial transactions with the objective to achieve high levels of equity within the context of taxation. It is implemented from 2005 allowing all residents of Korea to get tax credit for purchases paid in cash as long as they are registered to National Tax Service (NTS) Cash Receipt System. People can either present a membership card (Tax Save Card) or their cell phone number at the time of purchase to issue cash receipt. Taxpayers can receive a deduction on their yearend tax settlement of up to 3 million KRW depending on the amount spent in cash purchases. The deduction works out to 30 per cent of the total cash you've spent that exceeds 25 per cent of the yearly income you have reported. The total of the cash purchases can be those made by the taxpayer and/or the taxpayer's dependent(s). As of 2008 the cash receipt system applies to all cash purchases without any minimum amount (initially it applied to cash purchases of 5000 KRW or above).  29 Krogerus M.

For businesses this tool will enable them to pursue the new Accounting Act that account based documents can also be digital. 31  www.korea4expats.com/articlecashreceipttaxcreditcardregistration.html  16 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247        Case Antitax evasion programme in S  o Paulo Brazil     Nota Fiscal Paulista (NFP) Description Results The programme created monetary rewards for consumers to ensure that firms report final sales transactions      It provides tax rebates and monthly lottery prizes for consumers who ask for receipts and      It establishes a direct communication channel between the tax authority and consumers through an online account system where consumers can verify receipts reported by establishments and can act as whistleblowers by filing complaints. Along the supply chain the tax credit and debit system of the VAT generates thirdparty reporting in transactions across firms. At the final consumer stage however these selfenforcing incentives break down since consumers typically derive no direct monetary benefit from asking for receipts. The NFP policy introduced incentives similar to the VAT for final sales it aims to affect both the likelihood that a transaction is reported at all and the accuracy of reporting since rewards to consumers are an increasing function of the value of receipts. According to Naritomi (2016)      The programme increased revenue reported in retail sectors by at least 22 per cent over four years.      The estimated effect is stronger for sectors with a high volume of transactions consistent with shifts in detection probability due to whistleblower threats.      The enforcement effect triggered by  consumers blowing the whistle firms report 14 per cent more receipts and 6 per cent more revenue after receiving their first complaint.      Consumer   s condition of their participation on past lottery wins. Even small prizes generate a significant and steady increase in the number of receipts that consumers request and in the number of different businesses in which they ask for receipts. Online cash register in Hungary32 Cash register connected to a fiscal control unit in Sweden In 2014 Hungary introduced an online cash register. It records the data in a Fiscal Control Unit embedded in the machine at the point of sales and then transmit the data to the tax authority in high frequency using mobile phone network operators. Mobile phone network operators have benefits as they are identifiable and reliable. Small businesses receive subsidies for up to five changes of cash machines. The tax authority has mobile inspection devices which enable them to analyse and verify whether shops register their transactions correctly. Cash registers must be connected to a fiscal control unit which must be certified by the Swedish tax authority. Many specific information including total sales amount VAT amount and a unique control code is recorded in the fiscal control unit. Only tax authority can access the information. Sweden targeted all sectors that are selling goods or services as they have higher cash transactions. In the first year of introduction (2014) VAT revenue increased by 15 per cent in the sectors concerned. There was also an increase in the number of employees registered for tax. When it was first introduced the reported revenue increased by 5 per cent. They estimate that the reform has brought the increased tax revenue of at least 3 billion SEK. Statistics from the Swedish Tax Agency show that the reported VAT output rose by 7 per cent in the restaurant sector and 11 per cent in the hairdressing industry in 2010.33  32 Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD). 2017.

This technically precludes companies from not declaring or underdeclaring their revenues thus reducing the resources for paying undeclared work. Employers have been incentivised to introduce the    black box    by granting them social security breaks from the salaries of their declared employees. In  the  Republic  of  Korea  the  income  tax  deduction  scheme  also  applies  for  cash transactions35 as long as it is recorded in the national tax service cash receipt system. In S  o Paulo Brazil the local government provides incentives either with tax deductions or lottery based rewards to consumers to report final sales. A recent study finds that the  enforcement effect triggered by consumers blowing the whistle was both significant and also  beneficial to firms firms report 14 per cent more receipts and also six per cent more revenue after receiving their first complaint.36 On the other hand in Hungary and Belgium an online cash register is adopted which automatically sends the data to tax authority and the social security authorities. Sweden also has similar system that it is mandatory to use the cash register which is connected to a fiscal control unit. And the fiscal control unit must be certified by the Swedish tax authority. In Ghana the draft legislation to make it obligatory for certain categories of taxpayers to use a fiscal electronic device is being discussed. The device will allow transactions to be transmitted  to  the  tax  authority  in  real  time.  It  is  expected  to  increase  the  revenue mobilisation by 20 per cent and bring some informal sector entities into the tax regime.  34 European Platform Undeclared  Work  Report  from the  two  meetings  of the  Working Group  on 11 May 2017 and on 29 September 2017 Working Group on Success Stories to the European Platform Undeclared Work.2017. ec.europa.eu/social/BlobServlet?docId=18479&langId=en 35 More recently the government gives higher benefit to cash or debit card usage (30 per cent) than credit card usage (15 per cent) as excessive credit card usage can increase the debt of households and can create burden to SMEs due to transaction costs. 36 Naritomi J. 2016.    Consumers as tax auditors    London Schools of Economics.  18 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247             3.1.3 Increasing SME productivity and formality at the same time     the case of Tabletas Concanaco in Mexico37 Most  of  the  academic  and  political  discussion  accepts  that  technology  increases productivity in certain circumstances. There is ongoing discussion whether through  that channel informality is indeed reduced. There are cases in which productivity and informality are targeted at the same time. In Mexico commerce and services are the main economic activities and employ the largest share of workers. SMEs represent 98 per cent of the total number of enterprises in these sectors. The problem is that of these SMEs almost 83 per cent are informal and 6 out of 10 employees  are  informal.  Only  33  per  cent  of  the  SMEs  use  ICTs  and  there  is  low standardization in services and low performance in the supply chains. The Tabletas Concanaco project in Mexico The National Committee of Productivity created an alliance between the tax authority (SAT) the  national institute for entrepreneurship (INADEM) and Concanaco the Confederation of Chambers of Commerce Services and Tourism. This alliance  generated the project  Tabletas Concanaco (Concanaco Tablets)  to increase the productivity of the SMEs in these sectors by including them in the formal economy and modernizing them with the inclusion of ICTs in their businesses. How  does  it  work?  A  tableta  Concanaco  is  a  tablet  that  includes  a  technological  solution  specifically designed for SMEs. It offers a year of free Internet connection helps the recording and provision of sales reports enables electronic sales and electronic billing and includes a sales point terminal with a slot for credit and debit cards. How much does it cost? The total price of the tablet plus the services is some $5600 Mexican pesos (equivalent of around US$ 350). The programme is subsidised by Concanaco with 360 pesos and by INADEM by 4640 pesos. Therefore the final price to the SME is around 800 pesos (less than US$ 50). The Sales Point Terminal (TPV) does not generate monthly fees nor  billing minimums and has a bank commission of 2.86 per cent  plus  VAT.  The  tablet  is  equipped  with  Android  OS  as well as with an Intel processor and a oneyear warranty. The project also provides coaching in the operation of the TPV. For this an agreement was signed with CONALEP (National College of Professional Technical Education) so that the students would be in charge of training and in compensation a grant was awarded to them for this service. The inclusion of information technologies in an SME is vital in today   s globalized world not only to increase sales  but  also  to  increase  productivity  and  competitiveness.  This  is  expected  to  lead  to  a  better  and  more competitive economic environment for firms and therefore to formality.38 The tablet facilitates labour formalization by helping the SMEs register their employees. The project successfully reached  15086 beneficiaries of a special tax regime for SMEs (R  gimen  de Incorporaci  n Fiscal) which is Mexico   s main formalization public programme. Some 2000 young people  were also included. The project has verified that 89 per cent of the beneficiaries made tax declarations. The project involved the participation of 147 chambers of commerce and it is estimated that 25646 workers benefited from it. Some 45.5 per cent of the total beneficiaries were male and 54.5 per cent were female. Most of them were between the ages of 18 and 45 and 44 per cent had upper high school education.  37 The  authors  thank Mr  Octavio  Garc  a  Confederation of  Chambers  of  Commerce  Services  and Tourism of Mexico (CONCANACO SERVYTUR). 38 This link between technology and increased sales is not necessarily direct however as other aspects of business organization and functioning are also needed. Some private solutions are being developed for  that  like  the  example  of  TiendaTek  (TechCorner  store)  that  developed  app  that  helps  with inventories cash flow etc. for small business in Colombia www.tiendatekweb.com  EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 19             3.2 Formalization of employment Formalization  of  employment  has  been  approached  most  of  the  times  through incentives (for example combining access to social protection with tax deductions) or by enforcement measures. New technologies are being already used in these areas. 3.2.1 Electronic registration of workers The inspection system and the capacity of the labour authority can also be  improved with the use of better databases.  Table 3 shows some country examples. In the case of Brazil in 2007 the government launched the project    eSocial    in order to unify the sending of employer and employee data and it is part of the Federal Government initiative  called  SPED  (Public  System  for  Digital  Bookkeeping).  eSocial  replaces  the separate  reporting  to  the  social  security  institution  the  internal  revenue  service  and  the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Therefore it involves the participation of agencies such as the Caixa Econ  mica (Federal Bank) (responsible for the Fundo de Garantia do Tempo e Servi  o (severance indemnity fund)) the National Institute of Social Security (INSS) the Ministry of Planning Ministry of Labour and Employment and the Internal Revenue Service of Brazil (RFB). Table 3. Electronic registration of workers Case Description Results eSocial in Brazil   eSocial is the Brazilian government   s project to unify the sending of employer and employee data. This unified system will replace the need to send separate reporting to social security institution the internal revenue service and the Ministry of Labour and Employment. Until recently the use of the eSocial portal was optional while mostly used by domestic employers. From July 2018 eSocial will apply to all companies including small businesses.  Electronic employment registration in Estonia The Estonian Tax and Customs Board launched the electronic register in July 2014 to enable employers to easily register all employees with the Board prior to an employee starting work. The electronic solution eliminates the need for inperson visits to a service bureau for registration. Registration can now occur in a variety of ways 1) Web registration through the eTax Board/e Customs websites by entering data manually or uploading a file; 2) Registration via a machinetomachine (M2M) interface using XRoad technology the standard for integrating public registers and information systems in Estonia and 3) Mobile registration via a phone call or SMS message. Besides employers no longer need to submit employment information to the Estonian Health Insurance Fund or the Estonian Unemployment Insurance Fund as that information is made available and easily accessible from the national register. As of November 2014 approximately 70000 companies registering nearly 600000 employees are using the national employment register. Due to increased visibility by the Board into disbursements and tax declarations labour tax collections are estimated to increase to    5.1 million within the first four months of the register being live (July to November 2014). Additionally more than 9000 first time workers have now been registered after the employment register was launched.39  39 Estonian Tax and Customs Board Improving employment verification and increasing tax collections. https//www.cgi.ee/sites/default/files/files_ee/casestudies/cgicasestudyestoniaemployment registerpdf.pdf  20 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247           Case Electronic Payroll in Peru Description Results In 2006 the Peruvian government implemented the Electronic Payroll (EP). Before payroll information had to be sent physically to the Labour Ministry. With the EP this information can be sent virtually and to the tax authority. The legal mechanism was an interinstitutional agreement between the Labour Ministry and the National Superintendency of Customs and Tax Administration (Superintendencia Nacional de Administraci  n Tributaria) (SUNAT).40 The Ministry regulates what information is included in the Payroll but SUNAT can make amendments and also sets the conditions in which the information is delivered. A study (Diaz 2014)41 finds that the EP has allowed the Labour  Ministry to reach a larger number of firms thus strengthening the inspection system. It also finds that employment registered at the payroll     the most formal     has grown fastest than total occupation in particular since 2006. In 2008 there were 2.17 million workers registered in the EP. That number increased to 2.73 million in 2011 and 3.13 million in 2013. eSocial  reduces  bureaucracy  and  increases  corporate  responsibility  in  providing information and that this makes labour regulation both clearer and more individualized. The unified system will also help various institutions find irregularities or inconsistencies  such as missed deadlines and under or no declaration. It started in 2007 with just the tax system. Companies were required to provide in a digital and unified form accounting and tax information that had previously been  recorded in separate programmes books and forms. Later it was broadened to include information on social security and registration of workers including employee health workplace safety and workplace accident data. In practice users input their employment information  including incomes  and  activities  and  then  transmit  them  electronically  to  the  government.  The integration  of  companies     computer  systems  with  the  eSocial  national  system  enables automated  communication  with  employers;  with  standardization  and  integration  for registering individuals and legal entities under the participating agencies. Until recently eSocial was optional and it was used mostly by domestic employers. As of  July  2018  eSocial  will  increasingly  apply  to  all companies.  The  latest  timeline  with mandatory dates for using the system was published in the Official Diary on 2  September 2016  through  Resolution  no.  5/2016.  In  practice  eSocial  does  not  place  additional obligations on companies. It only changes the way information is delivered. The single  file with standardized data and updated records facilitates monitoring and accelerates clearance processes in certain procedures. In Estonia the Taxation Act of 2014 created a national registry of employees and their employment information     the electronic register     to enable employers to easily register all employees with the Board before an employee starts work. In Peru the government (Labour Ministry) requires private business to report  payroll information  including  for  each  worker  details  on  pay  sex  occupation  and  so  on. Traditionally this procedure was done manually. Of course as this is the only procedure to register workers those business and those workers reported to the Labour Ministry are  the most  formal  of all. These payrolls form  the  basis  for  calculating  the index  of registered employment and the work of the labour inspection system. In 2006 the government created the  Electronic  Payroll  an  electronic  solution  to  replace  the  manual  reporting  of  private business payrolls. The objective was to seek more efficiency regarding the information  on  40 SUNAT is the tax authority in Peru. 41 Diaz J.J. 2014.    Formalizaci  n empresarial y laboral    in Infante R.; Chacaltana J. (ed.) Hacia un desarrollo inclusivo en Per   CEPAL and ILO. (Santiago) pp.173260.  EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 21                                 workers registered.42 Through a specific agreement signed between the Labour Ministry and the tax authority (SUNAT) three major changes were introduced      The payroll information has to be sent virtually not physically.      As they are virtual the information can be sent monthly instead of annually.      The information would be sent not only to the Labour Ministry but also to the  tax authority  together  with  information  of  the  firm  usually  required  by  the  tax authority (sales profits etc). The electronic payroll has two components      TRegistro  (   I  register  you   )  is  the  registration  of  the  labour  information  of employers workers retired workers service locators young people in training and third parties involved.      The Monthly Payroll (PLAME) is mandatory and includes information on income compensation for those people registered in the TRegistro including  thirdparty providers  of  services  information  on  days  worked  hours  worked  and tax deductions. This tool eliminates the transaction costs in the previous procedure that included payroll books  and it  also eliminates  storage  costs  and reduces  the risk of  losing documents.  In addition workers can more easily prove their labour relation. All employers hiring at  least one worker are obliged to report their electronic payroll. Failure to do so on time represents a fault for each worker involved in the payroll. The same applies if the information is not correct. According to a recent study (Diaz 2014) the use of the Electronic Payroll (EP) has allowed the Labour Ministry to reach more businesses than before. In the old system some 26000 firms would report payrolls every year to the Labour Ministry. After the EP was introduced that number increased to more than 200000 which was the number of firms traditionally reporting to the tax authority. The study also shows that after the introduction of the EP registered  employment increased the records indicate that registered employment in firms of five or more workers increased from 930000 in 2002 to 1.1 million in 2005 and 2.4 million in 2011 (figure 4).  42 Law No. 27711 (29 May 2002).  22 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247              Figure 4.

In  Hungary  under  the  Simplified  Employment  Act  (2010/LXXV)  a  simplified employment model lowered administrative procedures for both employee and employer. The employment status has to be stated in a mutually agreed simplified work contract which can be  declared  either by a Short Message  Service (SMS)  or electronically via the socalled    client  gate     system.  It  covers  two  categories  of  simplified  employment  (a)  seasonal agricultural work which includes seasonal tourism services and (b) other casual/temporary work including domestic work. For domestic work the employer pays a flat rate daily  tax regardless of hours worked and actual wage paid. By entering codes into a text message or into  the  Internetbased  client  gate  system  all  obligations  can  be  fulfilled  at  once      notification reporting and payment (ILO 2016b). 3.2.2 Upgrading labour inspection According to a recent ILO study (ILO 2017) although the use of new technologies in labour inspection raises many new challenges such as the security and confidentiality of data the sometimes high cost of innovations the risk of work overload etc. it also  offers many benefits to both inspection bodies and final users (employers and workers) as it creates more  transparency  a  closer  link  among  users  better  monitoring  and  followup  of inspections systematic statistics and more agility in the work of the inspectors.43 For formalization purposes Argentina has the    Digital inspector    scheme and in 2003 adopted a strategy for reducing labour informality and established an array of programmes norms and initiatives for this purpose. This strategy     some analysts call it an    integrated strategy     as  it  includes  multiple  interventions  and  coordination  among  them       led  to  a reduction in nonregistered employment from 50 per cent to 34 per cent between 2003 and 2014. One of the main programmes in this strategy is the National Plan for the Regularization of Labour (PNRT).  43 ILO. 2017. Utilizaci  n de tecnolog  as de la informaci  n y de la comunicaci  n en las inspecciones del trabajo. Una visi  n comparada en torno a pa  ses seleccionados. Oficina de la OIT para el Cono Sur de Am  rica Latina (Informes T  cnicos OIT Cono Sur N  2).  EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 23              In  the  context  of  that  programme  in  2011  the  tool     Digital  Registered  Work     or    Digital inspector    improved the process of detection and sanctions for firms that do not comply with labour legislation. The programme used to manage physical information in its inspections verifying the firms supporting information and then would go to the Labour Ministry to verify that all workers were declared in the SIPA database (Sistema  Integrado Provisional  Argentino)  administered  by  the  Federal  Administration  of  Public  Revenues (Administraci  n Federal de Ingresos P  blicos) (AFIP). The innovation is that through an agreement between AFIP and the Ministry of Labour Employment  and  Social  Security  in  2006  a  database  was  created  called  Simplificaci  n Registral (or Mi Simplificaci  n) which is managed by AFIP where the employer is obliged to  register  all  workers.  For  these  workers  the  employer  pays  and  determines the contributions to AFIP and that information is registered in the SIPA (also handled by AFIP). The digital inspector system managed to put online both databases (updated daily) so  that the  Labour  Ministry  could  verify  in  real  time  the  registry  status  of  workers  and  the corresponding contributions. In  sum  the  idea  was  to  link  the  labour  inspection  to  the  Simplificaci  n  Registral registry so that inspectors could consult this platform online during their field visits. Labour inspectors are provided with Netbooks with a wireless Internet connection so that they can consult  in  real  time  those  databases  of  National  Social  Security  Administration (Administraci  n Nacional de la Seguridad Social) (ANSES) and AFIP to verify if all workers in the inspected firm are registered at the time of inspection. An application (interface) was generated for that tablet (Digital Inspector) so that the inspector can enter the identification number of the worker and verify if they are registered and if their contributions have been paid. With this innovation according to the Labour Ministry the inspection procedure was reduced from 40 days to just one.44 If the inspector detects an infraction they immediately sanction the firm for not registering the workers and if there are outstanding contributions they alert AFIP and estimate both the debt and fines. The PNRT does not inspect other labour conditions (for example collective agreements) as this is a task for the provinces. However it does explicitly have competence in detecting child labour. Sri Lanka has the    Labour Inspection System Application (LISA)        an application on a tablet to support labour inspection helping to monitor cases and ensuring compliance with labour laws.45 Inspectors can take pictures using their tablets when they observe a  problem at  the  workplace  and  upload  them  directly  on  LISA.  Using  LISA  they  can  also  write inspection reports on the site. In the past inspectors had to carry more than 10 different forms with a bulky record book which costs them much more time and energy. LISA has also simplified the work at the Complaint and Legal Department. Grievances submitted  by  workers  or  employers  are  now  put  into  LISA  online  database  and the information is sent to labour officers online. It has made the procedure much faster than before  when  officers  had  to  transfer  all  the  information  from  record  books  to  another notebook. LISA has also made monitoring the followup actions easier. By typing the name of the worker or the employer into the LISA system a person can see all the details  about their complaints court records and any action taken by labour officers. The United Arab Emirates uses technologies for labour inspection. The Ministry of Labour has developed a comprehensive enterprises    and workers    database which includes almost all enterprises and all workers in the private sector. The database is updated regularly  44 ILO. 2014b. FORLAC Note on Inspection in Argentina. 45 http//www.ilo.org/asia/mediacentre/articles/WCMS_353256/langen/index.htm  24 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247                through  information  gathered  by  inspectors  and  information  received  directly  from businesses. All labour inspectors have access to computers the Internet and this database. As of 2010 the inspection activities were half computerized but some parts of the  system such as municipalities have advanced and fully computerized systems. For example in the Municipality of Abu Dhabi the inspectors use portable data applicators so all inspection activities both office and field are fully computerized.46 The United Arab Emirates established a fully computerized hotline service to receive the complaints and enquiries of national and migrant workers in 13 languages including Arabic. An SMS is sent to the workers concerned to confirm the receipt of the  complaints. In addition a fully computerized comprehensive system for reporting occupation  injuries has also been developed. Occupational diseases and workrelated injuries are often greatly underreported. The system can improve investigation of occupational accidents. 3.2.3 Increased compliance culture through information technologies In 2011 the U.S. Department of Labor (DOL) created a free mobile app for employees to independently capture and track the hours they work and determine the wages they are owed. The new tool called    DOL     Timesheet    was developed by the DOL Wage and  Hour Division (WHD) as part of its ongoing efforts to    achieve compliance with labour standards to protect and enhance the welfare of the Nation   s workforce   .47 Traditionally workers would manually record and track the hours worked in order  to reconcile work hours with pay leave overtime etc. With the app this process is now digital. The app allows the worker to set up a separate timesheet for each employer input their hourly wage and then use the app like a stopwatch to record their time by pressing  buttons marked    Start Work       Start Break       Stop Break    and    Stop Work   . The app allows for manual entry if this functionality is not used in real time. It also allows the employee to categorize or add comments to describe the break in further detail. It automatically computes any hours above the regular 40 per week as overtime hours. The workers are able to obtain weekly and monthly summaries of the hours worked and  the corresponding wages and can also email the summaries to themselves or if necessary  to an attorney. Thanks to its accurate and detailed records of working hours it can be used to challenge an employer   s records in case of disagreement. The app also includes links to information on  the  DOL   s  website  describing  for  example  federal  minimum  wage  and  overtime requirements and a    Contact Us    tab which makes a phone call email or appointment with the DOL just a touch away.48  46 Data is provided by the government in the framework of the assessment. 47 Zins (2011) and Davidson P. (2014). 48 The U.S. Department of Labor has also launched an application in 2012 called Eat. Shop. Sleep. app  that  consumers  can  find  out  about  worker  safety  and  wage  violation  records  of  a particular business. The app helps consumers to make the social decisions by rewarding businesses that treat workers  fairly.  It  may  give  higher  incentives  to  companies  to  increase  compliance.  See https//blog.dol.gov/2012/03/09/dolchallengeleadstoconsumerprotectionapp.   In   addition  the U.S. Department of Labor developed new business tool Comply chain to improve labour compliance in global supply chain. Their  website and  free  mobile application address the issues of child and forced labour in global supply chain and contain best practices guidance to help companies  develop social compliance system. See www.dol.gov/ilab/complychain/.  EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 25                   Several other countries are also using electronic tools for compensation  calculations. In  Uruguay  the  Labour  Ministry  has  developed  a  tool  that  allows  the  calculation  of compensation in case of dismissal for people working at least 48 hours a week. Some companies in the Republic of Korea are also using hightech methods to measure the working hours by tracking their GPS WiFi connection or staff cards that they need to place on a card reader to get in and out of the companies. On  the  other  hand  some  countries  adopted  a  system  or  law  to  promote  electronic payments to workers. Deduction or delays in payments are hard to track when workers are paid in cash. Electronic payment to workers have its advantages as it can help ensure that the minimum wage is respected and inspect labour abuses. In Egypt the Ministry of Finance introduced prepaid payroll card to expand the use of electronic payments and increase payment transparency. The payroll cards can be issued to anyone including the underbanked who do not have access to bank accounts. Between 2010 and 2013 more than 1.5 million cards have been issued. It is significant figure considering that  Egypt  is  a  highly  cashbased  society  and  only  about  9  million  people  hold  a  bank account.49 The United Arab Emirates also introduced prepaid payroll card with similar purposes. Other countries made it mandatory to pay workers electronically for certain industries. In Austria payments for wages for work in the construction sector must not be paid or accepted in cash as long as employees have a bank account or legitimate claim for one. The Thai government released a Ministerial order requiring the seafood and fishing industries to  pay their workers electronically on a bank account in 2017 to ensure transparency and  fairness to  workers.50 Impact  studies  show  positive  effects  on  financial  inclusion  efficiency  and transparency.51 3.2.4 Facilitating social protection and formality Technologies are contributing to expanding social protection by simplifying payment of social security contribution and developing innovative tools and these changes can  help reaching out to marginalized groups as well. Some  countries are  working on electronic  payment  of  social  security contributions which can benefit both provider and beneficiaries of social protection. In Colombia there is a tool called Planilla Integrada de Liquidaci  n de Aportes (PILA). This is an electronic solution that allows any worker to make their social security contributions (health retirement fund  professional  risks)  and  parafiscal  contributions  (Cajas  de  Compensaci  n  Familiar (CCF) Servicio Nacional de Aprendizaje (SENA) and Instituto Colombiano de  Bienestar Familiar (ICBF)) through a system of electronic transfers.  49 Hossam  M.

Thus  PILA  improves  efficiency  reduces transaction costs and time and allows the contributors to know exactly their situation in each subsystem  or  regime.  The  Health  and  Social  Protection  Ministry  has  put  in  place  some orientation operators to guide the user in the system. There are two ways to make payments      Electronic payroll the operator has a website to make payments in this case a bank accounts is needed.      Assisted payroll The operator provides guidance and even coaching in order to make the contributions. This modality is only for firms with below 30 workers  or for    own account    workers that do not have access to Internet. Once the payment is made the system provides a certificate. In Colombia all  persons with an income equal to or above the minimum wage are obliged to join the social  security system  including  own  account  workers.  This  also  includes  households  hiring  domestic workers and even social organizations such as the system of community mothers  (madres comunitarias). Furthermore some countries have developed innovative tools to enable  costeffective social protection programmes. For example in Viet Nam a multifunction smartcard holds a variety of information about its owner in lieu of the social protection notebook. The card can contain biometric information for identity authentication the participant   s  contribution history  information  on  health  insurance  and  health  records  user  identity  for  banking services money for payment etc. Another example is the use of biometrics and smartphones for inperson authentication and verification. A builtin fingerprint scanner can capture and store a digital image of the fingerprints of the user. The Asian Development Bank (ADB) is currently considering the possibilities of expanding support for these interventions.53 Technologies help  expanding  social  protection  to  hardtoreach  groups.  In  2014  in Uruguay the Social Security Institution (Banco de Previsi  n Social (BPS)) launched a free mobile  app  for  employers  to  ease  the  registration  and  compliance  concerning  domestic workers BPS Trabajo Dom  stico [domestic work]. Besides recent years have seen an active dissemination campaign providing advice and information to both workers and households. The mobile app developed by the BPS allows employers  of domestic  workers to do the following online      Consult on billing due dates last payment.      Register and deregister workers.      Modify information on workers (wage personal data).      Pay the corresponding bill for the pension system. In Ghana the National Health Insurance Authority (NHIA) and the ILO are  working on digitalization of the health insurance renewal process. Traditionally the renewal had  to be done in person at a District Office which is timeconsuming for everybody involved. With digitalization it can be done remotely using digital devices such as mobile phones.  It  52 The existence of the PILA does not  modify responsibilities and obligations of the  actors of the social protection system in respect of the payment. The tool only intends to unify all the subsystems in a single payment to facilitate payment from the payer   s side. 53 Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017.

EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 27                                    may attract more people including those in the informal sector to renew their memberships. As of January 2018 the project was at the final stage before the launch.54 Besides  Ghana  has  a  voluntary  pension  contribution  through  mobile  money  for informal  workers.  As  of January  2017  the  National  Pensions  Regulatory  Authority  had granted approval to 78 companies to operate as pension fund managers. Pension products have been developed mainly for workers in the formal sector in an economy that is largely informal. It is estimated that about 70 per cent of Ghana   s workforce is informal and  does not have access to any pension scheme. As a result the People   s Pension Trust has partnered with Vodafone and Dusk Capital to develop a mobileenabled pension product for informal workers. This innovative pension product allows workers in the informal sector to make voluntary pension contributions through Vodafone Cash.55 Kenya too has a mobile payment services called MPESA which allows the self employed to make their voluntary contribution to the National Health Insurance Fund  and the National Social Security Fund.56 After hardtoreach groups have been included in the social security system facilitating the payment of their contributions is equally important to ensure the sustainability of the benefits especially as these groups often find it hard to access formal financial services.  In 2011 Uganda   s National Social Security Fund introduced a SMS platform to allow members to access services on their mobile phones thus reducing time and cost to travel to the offices. Members  can  now  send  an  SMS  to  the  Fund  and  query  their  balance  via  their  mobile phones.  Today  over  270000  registered  members  use  the  platform  which  has  led  to  a reduction  of  30  per  cent  in  the  number  of  walkin  customers  in  20132014  (ILO forthcoming).  54 Impact insurance.

Conclusions New technologies are continuously transforming the world of work. Most of the recent discussion has focused on how currently new technologies     characterized by an impressive speed  of  change       are  affecting  the  behaviour  of  labour  market  actors  workers  and employers and the consequences in terms of volume of employment its composition wages and working conditions. Less attention has been paid however to how new technologies are affecting the public sector in particular policymaking. And yet many governments are gradually adapting  to new technologies. In this paper we have been exploring what some countries are  already doing in relation to the use of new technologies in the labour market     particularly in policies oriented to facilitate the transition to formality of economic units and employment. We have found that there is indeed an emerging trend towards the use of technologies for the transition to formality of employment and economic units via an increasing  number of innovative informationintensive and connectivitybased tools or approaches that we call eformality policies which contrast sharply with the traditional manual physical  presence or timeconsuming practices. Of course these developments are sometimes concentrated on specific policy areas or instruments but the diversity and innovative nature of the experiences show a promising avenue for further study and research. And while evidence shows that business  registration procedures  are  usually  separated  from  employment  formalization  due  to  among  other things the absence of coordination between different institutions new technologies based on information and intelligence could also help bridge this gap and link enterprises  and employment formalization. Indeed these practices facilitate interministerial coordination through  making  it  easy  to  share  information  and  actions  among  tax  social  security  and employment institutions. However even at this early stage in the evolution of this new generation of formality related  policies several issues  arise  for further  discussion.  Although for  example  these esolutions are not always directly or explicitly linked to the transition to formality they bring more transparency information and new approaches that can be considered steps  in this  gradual  transition.  But  do  these  policy  goals  necessarily  imply  or  translate  into  full formalization? More evidence is needed as impact studies are significantly scarce. The transition to formality would be incomplete if economic units are registered but their productivity and working conditions remain the same or if workers are registered  in the social security systems and those systems provide poor quality services. In other words although in itself important registration of economic units and employment is only one part of the story of formalization. The story needs to be completed with the most important part which is the objective of full and productive employment and decent work for all. Many remaining questions and challenges  will probably lead the discussions in the future. On the one hand will these policies be able to deal with the fact that a large proportion of  the  population  in  the  world  still  does  not  have  access  to  new  technologies?  In  some countries the discussion about digital citizenship for example     oriented to grant  citizens minimum access     may gradually move to the centre of the inclusion agenda in the near future. Also if information systematic or even algorithmsbased policies will be at hand  for any  government  or  authority  what  would  be  the  limit  in  their  use  especially  if  this information is private or personal? In time and using new technologies governments will be able to identify individuals in any information system as consumers workers or  economic  EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247 29      units.  This  capacity  should  be  used  not  only  for  registration  but  for  labour  and  social inclusion purposes and social dialogue among social partners in the labour market could play a key role for assuring this. Finally technology is evolving so rapidly that new solutions or alternatives are  being developed currently with a new wave based on automation advanced robotics big data artificial  intelligence  blockchain  technology  etc.  And  there  are  actually  some  tasks  of governments that are being automatized in some countries for example the automatic issue of fines for speeding.  Does this mean that a further stage in policy would adapt formality related policies to automatic solutions?  30 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247                References Asian Development Bank (ADB). 2017.

Note 1 The egovernment indices number of wage and salaried workers and total employment GDP per capita is from the year 2016 and the informality rates are from 2016 or the latest year available (See ILO. 2018 Appendix A.2 for further details). The egovernment development index (EGDI) is a weighted average of normalized scores on three dimensions. Online service index (OSI) Telecommunication infrastructure index (TII) and Human capital index (HCI). The TII is an arithmetic average composite  of five indicators estimated internet users per 100 inhabitants number of main fixed telephone lines per 100 inhabitants number of mobile subscribers  per 100 inhabitants number  of wireless broadband subscription  per 100 inhabitants and number of  fixed broadband subscription per 100 inhabitants.  The HCI  consists  of  four components including  adult  literacy  rate the combined primary secondary and tertiary gross enrolment ratio expected years of schooling and average years of schooling. The OSI was constructed by researchers who assessed each country   s national website in the native language including eservices portal as well as the websites of the related ministries of labour social services etc. The researchers also conducted Survey.

Note 2 Our regression model is         =        0 +        1        +        2                 (                                        )+         where dependent variable (y) is informality rate x is the value of the egovernment index and    is an error term.57 The table shows six regression results. For Model 1     5 each model includes a different egovernment index as an independent variable of interest while controlling for (log transformed) GDP per capita. Model 1 examines the impact of EGDI. Model 2 examines its three subindices simultaneously while Model 3 Model 4 and Model 5 examine each of them separately. Model 6 examines the impact of EGDI while controlling (log transformed) GDP per capital  the proportion of employees among total employment and the interaction term.                                                            57 The interpretation would be as the following If an index score increase by 0.01 the informality rate would change by   _1 percentage points. Note that both y and x are ranged between 0 and 1.     36 EMPLOYMENT Working Paper No. 247       Figure A.2 Evolution of egovernment   Sources *Egovernment indices UNDESA 2016. **Informality rates ILO 2018.
