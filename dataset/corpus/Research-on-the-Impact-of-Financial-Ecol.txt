Nowadays SMEs have become an indispensable part of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy and they are the largest and most innovative organization group in China. Small and mediumsized enterprises not only promote the steady development of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy but also provide more than 50% of the tax revenue for China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic income and create more than 60% of the GDP; At the same time it has made tremendous contributions to improving people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s livelihood relieving employment pressure and promoting technological innovation. According to statistics small and mediumsized enterprises accounts for 99% of the total enterprises in China providing more than 80% of urban employment jobs in China and completing more than 70% of patent inventions. However as China is still in the transitional stage of economic development and its financial environment is still not perfect which has led to the stagnation of SMEs in financing difficulties. In addition with the impact of the international financial crisis the international and domestic financial markets and their financial environment are in an unstable state which has greatly affected the development of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SMEs and made it more difficult to attract financing. This paper will take the financing difficulties of SMEs as the starting point. By combining the theory and case analysis this paper analyzes and studies the meaning of the internal meaning behind the financial environment data and analyzes the influence of the financial environment on SMEs  from  five  aspects.  Finally  based  on  the  results  of theory  and  case  analysis this  paper  proposes  to improve  the  financial  ecological  environment  to  accelerate  the  improvement  of  laws  and  regulations  on financial support for SMEs in the financial environment thereby promoting the healthy development of financial markets. In the end the optimization of financial ecology will alleviate the big problem of financing difficulties faced by SMEs.

INTRODUCTION As the main body in the market SMEs play a central role  in  promoting  the  development  of  the  national economy and promoting the harmonious development of  society.  Since  the  fifteenth  conference  due  to  the rapid growth of SMEs the Chinese Communist Party has paid more attention to the development of small and mediumsized enterprises. As the backbone of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic  development  (Turkson  et  al.  2015)  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 development status is related to the future direction of national economic development and the changes in the internal structure of the current national economy. in some  obstacles However  in  recent  years  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  SMEs  have generally  encountered their development  Since  China  implemented  reform  and opening up and actively implemented its own foreign policy the golden development stage of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small  \\xc2\\xa9 Foundation Environmental Protection & ResearchFEPR   and  mediumsized  enterprises  has  passed.  Due  to changes  in  the  external  environment  the  competitive advantages  of  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  small  and  mediumsized enterprises have gradually disappeared such as China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s manufacturing  enterprises.  With  the  development  of technology  and  the  changing  market  demand  of consumers some manufacturing industries are facing a market  with  poor  demand  and  are  in  a  state  of powerlessness.  The  cruelest  argument  is  that  most manufacturing industries may have to close down and withdraw in the next 35 years. Paulo and Paulo (2015) stated  due  to  the  disappearance  of  many  small  and mediumsized enterprises\\xe2\\x80\\x99 competitive advantages and poor  management  the  financing  difficulties  of  SMEs have become a \\xe2\\x80\\x9ctough problem\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Under the impact of the financing difficulties of SMEs have new features on the one hand with the improvement of the overall material life of the financial  crisis international the Received 9 May 2017 / Accepted 21 Jan 2018 \\x0c  Gao  society which has led to an increase in the production costs  of  enterprises  and  the  overcapacity  of  some industries  SMEs  need  to  maintain  their  normal operations  and  the  demand  for  liquidity  by  financial companies  has  become  more  urgent.  On  the  other hand  under  the  constraints  of  credit  scale  especially under  the  rigid  agreement  of  continuously  increasing the deposit reserve ratio banks are more cautious about the  financing  needs  of  SMEs.  To  solve  the  longstanding problem of financing difficulties for SMEs on the  one  hand  it  depends  on  the  improvement  of  the external environment in which SMEs survive such as the reform of the financial system; on the other hand it depends on the efforts of SMEs themselves. in the  economic In  addition  since  2005  financial  environmental issues  have  been  one  of  the  hot  issues  discussed  by experts field.  From  a  macro perspective  a  good  financial  ecological  environment plays a decisive role in the good operation of the market the  optimization  of  the  economic  structure  the liquidity  of  funds  and  the  strengthening  of  security. Therefore  under  the  current  economic  conditions  in China  Supriti  and  Damodar  (2013)  said  that  it  is inseparable to solve the problem of financing difficulties for SMEs and the state of the external environment in which  enterprises  are located.  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  current economic  structure  is  coexisting  in  many  forms. However  from  the  perspective  of  overall  economic development  the  financial  ecological  environment  is not perfect such as the irrational allocation of financial resources  the  lack  of  innovation  capacity  of  financial institutions  the  imperfection  of  financial  supervision systems  and  systems.  These  are  the  reasons  for  the asymmetry  of  economic  structure  and financial structure  and  the  difference  in  credit  supply  and demand  structure.  At  the  same  time  this  has  greatly increased  the  extent  of  its  financing  difficulties  (Li 2011). In summary the impact of the existing defects of the financial ecological environment and the imbalance of the  financial  ecological  structure  on  SMEs.  We  must combine the theory of financial ecological environment and SME financing related with the current financing situation  of  SMEs  and  propose  ways  to  solve  this problem. THE STATUS QUO OF AND PROBLEMS IN SME FINANCING The Status Quo of SME Financing Under the current economic situation in China the potential functions of SME development are constantly  1634  the  road being  stimulated.  However to  SME development  is  not  smooth.  China  is  in  the  stage  of transition  from  the  planned  economy  to  the  market economy. Most SMEs still have many traditional colors. Therefore Chinese SMEs will generally face difficulties in  financing  during  the  development  process.  The specific analysis is as follows Single financing approach Since  the  reform  and  opening  up  although  the development of SMEs has become more diversified the financing methods of SMEs are still relatively simple and their financing methods are still based on financial institutions. Small and mediumsized enterprises are still in the early stage of growth and all business activities are still in the exploration period which is extremely uncertain so  it  is  difficult  to  obtain  assistance  from  relevant financial  institutions.  Not  only  that  because  we implement  a  socialist  market  economy  the  scope  of government intervention is broader and has a profound impact  (Luo et al. 2011). Therefore the existing legal system of issuing bonds in China has adverse effects on its financing and the imperfection of the development of the capital market makes it difficult to obtain funds through other means. The Cost is high Since  the  implementation  of  the  reform  of  the commercial bank market interest rate system in China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reform and opening up the loan review work has been improved  to  a  certain  extent.  At  the  same  time however the loan review fee has been increased which has  greatly  increased  the  loan  cost  and  increased  the financing cost coupled with other financing costs. This has greatly increased the overall financing costs of SMEs and brought certain financing pressures. The operating environment is poor with obvious differentiation Small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  have  weak foundations  small  scale  of  production  relatively backward technology unstable work performance large employee  mobility  weak  antirisk  ability  difficult management  in  later  loans  and  relatively  low  credit. This has caused financial institutions such as banks to be  reluctant  to  lend  to  small  and  mediumsized enterprises. At the same time sometimes countylevel governments  and  SMEs  will  choose  to  sacrifice  the interests of banks for their own benefit which makes them subject to enormous risk pressures making banks more cautious in handling SME loans. Moreover there  Ekoloji 28(107) 16331640 (2019) \\x0cResearch on the Impact of Financial Ecological Environment on SME Financing     is  still  an  imbalance  in  the  development  of  small  and mediumsized  enterprises  in  China  and  highquality small and mediumsized enterprises have become active targets  for  loans  from  various  financial  institutions. Companies that are not very good will be left out of the cold  because  of  the  dangers  of  bankruptcy  (Li  et  al. 2005). Analysis of Financing for SMEs Through the analysis of the abovementioned status quo  it  can  be  seen  that  the  current  situation  of  SME financing the continued development of SMEs and it is imperative to analyze the causes of the problems. The specific reasons are as follows in  China  has  seriously  hindered The credit evaluation system and the credit guarantee system are not perfect At  present  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  credit  evaluation  mechanism and supervision mechanism are not perfect and there is no national uniformity. And China has not yet clarified the  issue  of  guarantee  funds  and  a  unified  guarantee system has not been formed. SMEs started late and have a weak foundation. When faced with these problems in front of China they have greatly restricted the support of  relevant  financial loans. Therefore there are countless examples of SMEs being unable to implement guarantees and being denied loans. institutions  for  SME in The financial system and the bank management system are inconsistent with the development needs of SMEs Lin  and  Zhi  (2013)  proposed  that  small  and mediumsized  enterprises  are  currently large numbers in China and are widely distributed. However due to the limited credit capacity of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s small and mediumsized  financial  institutions  and  the  relatively dense distribution of small and mediumsized financial institutions  with  strong  capabilities  they  cannot  meet the needs of most SME financing. In addition the bank sometimes  cannot  understand  the  actual  operation  of the  lending  company  resulting  in  a  mismatch  in information.  Therefore  banks  usually  adopt  a  simple guarantee method ignoring the future development of SMEs  which  further increases  the  difficulty  of financing for SMEs. Laws and regulations supporting the development of SMEs are not sound enough Small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  are  in  an environment of imperfect financial markets. In the face of  market  imperfections  government  agencies  must intervene on behalf of the government. Although China has  promulgated  many  laws  and  regulations  to  adjust  Ekoloji 28(107) 16331640 (2019)  the  status  quo  of  macro  finance  such  as  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCompany Law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSecurities  Law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  etc.  but  there  is  still  no provision for a unified guarantee evaluation system. Or even  if  laws  and  regulations  have  been  promulgated there are problems such as poor implementation which seriously hinders the development of SMEs (Liu 2011). The enterprise\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own management system is not sound enough SMEs are in the primary stage of development and the overall level of productivity is still weak. The level of technological development is obviously weaker than that  of  listed  companies.  The  financial  data  is  less transparent and more prone to distortion. These factors are  all  manifestations  of  weak  management  concepts and business concepts. In addition SMEs tend to pay more attention to their own interests and ignore other development lower  credit consequences  which  makes  it  more  difficult  to  use capital and financing (Guo 2014). resulting factors in THE IMPACT OF FINANCIAL ECOLOGICAL ENVIRONMENT ON SME FINANCING The  financial  ecological  environment  has  been receiving  much  attention  from  researchers  since  its introduction.  This  complex  system  is  like  the  natural environment and its components are full of diversified elements.  According  to  the  analysis  of  Li  Yang  et  al. There  are  five  major  components  that  determine  the quality  of  the  financial  ecology  including  economic foundation  financial legal environment integrity culture and the independence of the financial sector. Moreover it is not difficult to find that  a  highquality  financial  ecological  environment plays  a  significant  role  in  improving  the  financing  of SMEs. The specific analysis is as follows industry  development level The Impact of Economic Base on SME Financing The economic foundation is the cornerstone of the development of all things in society. It mainly includes economic  development industrial  structure economic  activity  and  infrastructure  construction. These are all necessary conditions for the development of other elements. A good social and financial ecological environment can enhance economic activity which is conducive to creating a relatively healthy social market economy  so  that it  can  alleviate  the  financing difficulties of SMEs with the selfregulating power of the market economy. On the contrary a relatively poor financial ecological environment which will easily lead to  market  out  of  control  so  that  the  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intervention  in  market  activities  occurs  then  other related  factors  will  lose  their  meaning.  In  addition  a  1635 \\x0c  Gao  good financial environment can attract more investors make more external capital inflows and improve their economic  competitiveness.  This  not  only  drives  the development  of  listed  companies  but  also  benefits SMEs. The Impact of Financial Development on the Financing of SMEs When evaluating the state of financial development we  tend  to  consider  financial  industry  contributions financial intermediation and financial markets. A good financial environment will certainly have a prosperous financial  market  which  provides  a  more  diversified financing  channel  for  SMEs.  Moreover  when  the financial market is relatively perfect the role of bonds and  equity  financing  will  be  brought  into  play  and SMEs will develop rapidly. The Impact of Legal Environment on SME Financing The  law  is  a  way  to  maintain  the  order  of  the financial  ecological  environment  and  it  has  a  direct influence on the financial ecological environment. For the  financing  behavior  of  small  and  mediumsized enterprises all SMEs want to minimize their own costs free and  expenses  and  achieve their  optimal configuration.  In  a  region  with  a  sound legal environment  when  financial  institutions  and  SMEs cooperate the law can serve as the most powerful basis for safeguarding the interests of both parties. Therefore this can greatly reduce the cost of cooperation between the two parties accelerate the overall progress of SMEs in  financing  promote  the  virtuous  circle  of  financial ecological environment and resolve the financing risks of SMEs. The Impact of Government Actions on SME Financing The  operation  of  the  market  cannot  be  separated from government intervention. Judging from the role of SME financing the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interference in the economy will help improve the financing environment for SMEs alleviate the problems of poor regulation of the  market  economy  and  low  level  of  social  security. However  excessive  government intervention  will interfere  with  the  good  operation  of  the  market economy resulting in poor market regulation causing unnecessary troubles for SME financing activities and curbing  the  financing  efficiency  of  enterprises  (Xue 2011).  1636  The Impact of Credit Environment on SME Financing Credit  is  the  cornerstone  of  the  establishment  of cooperative relations between financial institutions and SMEs.  It  mainly  includes  four  aspects  social  security level  education  development  resident  education investment  and  social  integrity.  These  factors  can improve the credit rating of SMEs reduce the various costs  incurred  in  the  financing  process  of  SMEs  and improve  the  ability  of  SMEs  to  obtain  funds.  When financial  institutions  consider  whether  to  handle  loan business  for  a  certain  small  and  mediumsized enterprise  they  will  pay  more  attention  to  these  four aspects especially commercial banks (Xu 2007). In  summary  these  five  major  elements  that constitute  the  financial  ecological  environment  are crucial  to  solving  the  financing  problems  of  SMEs.  A highquality  financial  ecological  environment  can  not only attract more funds to flow into it but also reduce the  cost  of  financing  for  SMEs  increase  financial instruments  that  match  their  financing  needs  and promote  the  continuous  optimization  of  financial institutions. This will provide a richer financing path for their financing. TAKING THE STUDY OF CHINA\\xe2\\x80\\x99S FINANCIAL DEVELOPMENT AS A CASE As  a  province  with  good  financial  development prospects Jiangsu Province has a certain proportion of the  total  number  of  SMEs  in  China.  However  the problem  of  financing  difficulties  for  SMEs  has restricted  the  development  of  enterprises  and  the regional  financing  difference  in  Jiangsu  Province  is more obvious. Below we analyze the impact of financial development  in  Jiangsu  Province  on  the  financing  of SMEs in various regions. Data Source The  data  in  this  paper  mainly  comes  from  the National Database of the National Bureau of Statistics of  the  People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Republic  of  China  and  the  China Statistical  Yearbook  20102015.  This  paper  uses  Excel for data statistics and plots and tables. Financial Development in Jiangsu Province Since  the  reform  and  opening  up  along  with  the rapid development of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy financial assets and economic development have been in an increasing trend which has caused China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial ratio to rise substantially. However China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial development is uneven across regions.  Ekoloji 28(107) 16331640 (2019) \\x0c    Table 1.

By  calculating  the  financial  related  ratio  of  Jiangsu Province  from  2010  to  2015  we  can  understand  the financial  development  of  various  regions  in  Jiangsu Province as shown in Table 1.  (1) From the table it can  be seen that the overall average value of Zhejiang Province during 20101015 is increasing year by year. That is to say during the sixyear  period  the  regions  are  generally  in  a  state  of financial  deepening  and  the  overall  differences  are constantly shrinking. This phenomenon may be due to the  local  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  intervention  in  the  rational allocation of resources which makes the market allocate more space for financial resources. (2) Comparing the financial ratios of the regions it can  be  easily  found  that  the  financialrelated  ratio  of Hangzhou for 6 years is far higher than the overall level. This  shows  that  in  the  competition  of  all  financial resources Hangzhou has more financial resources than other  regions  making  it  possible  to  turn  to  the competition  for  market  financial  resources  and  the allocation  of  financial  resources  is  no  longer  solely dependent on stateowned financial institutions. Analysis of Financing Situation of Small and Mediumsized Enterprises in Various Regions of Jiangsu Most  of  Chinese  SMEs  have  relatively  simple is  no financing  methods  and  Jiangsu  Province  Ekoloji 28(107) 16331640 (2019)  in  Jiangsu  Province exception.  Therefore  it  is  necessary  to  analyze  the distribution of SME loan balances. According to Loan Balance  in  Jiangsu  Province  in  20102015  the  overall loan balance of Jiangsu Province in 20102015 is on the rise  indicating  that  the  phenomenon  of  loans  from SMEs to  relevant  financial institutions has been on the rise for nearly six years. The main  reason  may  be  due  to  the  better  financial development environment in Jiangsu Province which enables  the  rational  allocation  of  resources  and  the increase in loan business. According to the statistics of relevant  websites  in  20102015  the  best  deposit  and loan  resources  of  Jiangsu  financial  institutions  are  in Hangzhou which is closely related to the development of  financial  markets  in  various  regions  we  analyzed above. It  is  not  difficult  to  think  that  where  the  financial market is more optimized the financing threshold for SMEs can be reduced a large amount of foreign capital is  poured  in  and  SMEs  are  in  an  open  fair  and  just financing environment. On the contrary the financial market that is not perfect is the proportion of medium and  longterm  loans  of  related  units  is  low  and  the financing of small and mediumsized enterprises is less. Jinhua is taken as an example for analysis. It can be seen from Table 2 that Jinhua deposit and loan institutions are relatively unbalanced in 20102015. The medium and longterm loans are relatively small and the average of medium  and  longterm loans only accounts  for  about  20%.  The  average  medium  and  1637 \\x0c  Gao  Table 3. The Added Value of Jinhua Financial Industry and its Share of GDP in 20102015 Value added of the financial industry (100 million yuan) Proportion of the financial industry in GDP (%)  2010 2011 2012 2013 2014 2015  GDP (100 million yuan) 2110.04 2458.07 2710.77 2958.78 3206.64 3578.89 longterm loans of the unit is only about 10% while the medium  and  longterm  loans  of  small  and  mediumsized enterprises are often loans such as fixed assets. For the  relevant  financial  institutions  in  the  case  of relatively  weak financial  market  development considering  that  the  size  of  small  and  mediumsized enterprises is too small credit is generally not high and loans have certain risks. Faced with the mortgage of real estate they often reluctantly lend or fear. They will raise the the opportunities for SME loans. However from a vertical perspective Jinhua Deposits and Loans Since 2010 unit shortterm loans have shown a gradual upward trend and the increase rate is far higher than the medium and longterm financial development of Jinhua has been significantly improved and  the  opportunities  for  SME  loans  have  increased significantly. loans.  This  shows threshold financing reduce that and the for It can be seen from Table 3 From 2010 to 2015 the financial  added  value  of  Jinhua  City  has  increased  by more  than  10  billion  yuan  and  the  proportion  of financial industry in GDP has increased from 8.3% to 9.3%. This shows that the financial sector is constantly the  continuous expanding  which  will  promote improvement  of economic structure and continuously  drive  the  development  of  the  financial market. the Based on the analysis from the comparative analysis of  the  financial  development  situation  of  Jiangsu Province  and  the  financing  situation  of  SMEs  it  is concluded  that  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  financial  development  has  a great impact on the financing of SMEs. SUGGESGTIONS TO IMPROVE THE STATUS QUO OF SME FINANCING Through  the  above  summary  of  the  financing problems  of  existing  SMEs  in  China  we  will  make recommendations on the issues from the perspective of the five components of the financial ecoenvironment.

The establishment  of  a  sound  legal  system  requires  the establishment  of  a legal  system  with  practical application  value  and  the  independence  of  work  in addition to the actual situation of the region. It is also necessary  to  improve  the  regulatory  regulations  and systems  improve  the  means  of  supervision  reduce administrative into  a regulatory mechanism based on legal supervision and severely  crack  down  on  illegal  financial  activities. Relevant personnel who violate the law and maliciously for  criminal evade  debts shall  be responsibility  according strengthen cooperation  between  other  departments  and  the financial sector. interference  and  transform investigated to law  and Reduce Excessive Government Intervention and Maintain Market Independence Government  intervention  is  a  direct  means  to correct  market  adjustment  errors.  The  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability  to  improve  financial  market  management  and service enhancement can effectively improve the level of  financial  ecological  environment.  However  in  the face of the current situation of financing difficulties for SMEs this kind of intervention needs to be transformed into  public  service  management  and  change  the intervention method as follows First  resource  allocation  is  rationalized.  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial  ecological  environment  is  in  an  unbalanced regional  development.  The  government  needs  to balance fairness and efficiency increase the promotion of  policy  adjustments  to  underdeveloped  regions  and its  development promote capabilities.  Second strengthen the  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  behavioral  restraint mechanism  and  establish  a  testing  system  which  will help  strengthen  the  supervision  of  the  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s administration  and  try  to  reduce  the  development  of financial  markets  by  administrative  means  during  the normal operation of the market.

In  the  face  of  this problem  we  need  to  start  from  the  following  three aspects is for  SMEs First  of  all  in  China  one  of  the  problems  of financing  difficulties information asymmetry. Banks and other institutions are often afraid to lend to relevant enterprises in the face of such status quo.  However  with  the  development  of  technology the Internet has become a daily tool for communication. Therefore in the face of this problem we should rely more on the power of the network. When enterprises want  to  finance  enterprises  and  individuals  can  send their  credit  records  and  financial  transaction  activities accurately  and  timely  to  relevant  financial  institutions through the joint credit information network platform.
