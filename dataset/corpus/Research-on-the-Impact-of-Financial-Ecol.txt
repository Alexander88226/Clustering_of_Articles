economy undergone qualitative change mode change previous one solely rely state own collective dominate mediumsized private nowadays become indispensable part china economy large innovative organization group china mediumsized promote steady china economy also tax revenue china income create gdp time tremendous contribution improve people livelihood relieve employment pressure promote technological accord statistic mediumsized account total china urban employment job china complete patent invention however china still transitional stage environment still perfect lead stagnation difficulty addition impact international crisis international domestic environment unstable state greatly affected china difficult attract paper take difficulty start point combine theory case analysis paper analyzes meaning internal meaning behind environment analyzes influence environment five aspect finally base result theory case analysis paper proposes improve ecological environment accelerate improvement law regulation support environment thereby promote healthy end optimization ecology alleviate big problem difficulty face keywords ecology gao impact ecological environment ekoloji introduction main body play central role promote national economy promote harmonious society since fifteenth conference due rapid chinese communist party paid attention mediumsized backbone china turkson status related future direction national change internal structure current national economy obstacle however recent year china generally encounter since china implement reform opening actively implement foreign golden stage china foundation environmental protection researchfepr mediumsized pass due change external environment competitive advantage china mediumsized gradually disappear china manufacturing change demand consumer manufacturing face poor demand state powerlessness cruelest argument manufacturing may close withdraw next year paulo paulo state due disappearance many mediumsized competitive advantage poor difficulty become tough problem impact difficulty feature one hand improvement overall material life crisis international receive may accepted jan gao society lead increase production cost overcapacity maintain normal operation demand liquidity become urgent hand constraint scale especially rigid agreement continuously increase deposit reserve ratio cautious solve long stand problem difficulty one hand depends improvement external environment survive reform system hand depends effort addition since environmental issue one hot issue discuss expert field macro perspective good ecological environment play decisive role good operation optimization structure liquidity strengthen security therefore current condition china supriti damodar say inseparable solve problem difficulty state external environment locate china current structure coexist many form however perspective overall ecological environment perfect irrational allocation resource lack capacity imperfection supervision system system reason asymmetry structure structure difference supply demand structure time greatly increase extent difficulty summary impact exist defect ecological environment imbalance ecological structure must combine theory ecological environment related current situation propose way solve problem status quo problem status quo current situation china potential function constantly road stimulate however smooth china stage transition plan economy economy still many traditional color therefore chinese generally face difficulty specific analysis follow single approach since reform opening although become diversified method still relatively simple method still base mediumsized still early stage activity still exploration period extremely uncertain difficult obtain assistance relevant implement socialist economy scope government intervention broader profound impact luo therefore exist legal system issue bond china adverse effect imperfection difficult obtain mean cost since implementation reform commercial interest rate system china reform opening review work improve certain extent time however review fee increase greatly increase cost increase cost couple cost greatly increase overall cost brought certain pressure operating environment poor obvious differentiation mediumsized weak foundation scale production relatively backward unstable work performance large employee mobility weak antirisk ability difficult later relatively low cause reluctant lend mediumsized time sometimes countylevel government choose sacrifice interest benefit subject enormous pressure cautious handle moreover ekoloji impact ecological environment still imbalance mediumsized china highquality mediumsized become active target various good left cold danger bankruptcy analysis analysis abovementioned status quo see current situation continued imperative analyze cause problem specific reason follow china seriously hinder evaluation system guarantee system perfect present china evaluation mechanism supervision mechanism perfect national uniformity china yet clarify issue guarantee unified guarantee system form start late weak foundation face problem front china greatly restrict support relevant therefore countless example unable implement guarantee deny system system inconsistent lin zhi propose mediumsized currently large number china widely distribute however due limited capacity china mediumsized relatively dense distribution mediumsized strong capability meet addition sometimes understand actual operation result mismatch therefore usually adopt simple guarantee method ignore future increase difficulty law regulation support sound enough mediumsized environment imperfect face imperfection government agency must intervene behalf government although china promulgate many law regulation adjust ekoloji status quo macro law security law etc still provision unified guarantee evaluation system even law regulation promulgate problem poor implementation seriously hinders liu system sound enough primary stage overall level productivity still weak level technological obviously weaker list less transparent prone distortion factor manifestation weak concept concept addition tend pay attention interest ignore low consequence difficult guo result factor impact ecological environment ecological environment receive much attention researcher since introduction complex system like natural environment component full diversified element accord analysis yang five major component determine quality ecology include foundation legal environment integrity culture independence moreover difficult find highquality ecological environment play significant role improve specific analysis follow level impact base foundation cornerstone thing society mainly include industrial structure activity infrastructure construction necessary condition element good social ecological environment enhance activity conducive create relatively healthy social economy alleviate difficulty selfregulating power economy contrary relatively poor ecological environment easily lead control government intervention activity occurs related factor lose meaning addition gao good environment attract investor external inflow improve competitiveness drive list also benefit impact evaluate state tend consider contribution intermediation good environment certainly prosperous diversified channel moreover relatively perfect role bond equity brought play develop rapidly impact legal environment law way maintain order ecological environment direct influence ecological environment behavior mediumsized want minimize cost free expense achieve optimal configuration region sound legal environment cooperate law serve powerful basis safeguard interest party therefore greatly reduce cost cooperation two party accelerate overall progress promote virtuous circle ecological environment resolve impact government action operation separate government intervention judging role government interference economy help improve environment alleviate problem poor regulation economy low level social security however excessive government intervention interfere good operation economy result poor regulation cause unnecessary trouble activity curb efficiency xue impact environment cornerstone establishment cooperative relation mainly include four aspect social security level education resident education social integrity factor improve rating reduce various cost incur improve ability obtain consider whether handle certain mediumsized pay attention four aspect especially commercial summary five major element constitute ecological environment crucial solve problem highquality ecological environment attract flow also reduce cost increase instrument match promote continuous optimization richer path take china case province good prospect jiangsu province certain proportion total number china however problem difficulty restrict regional difference jiangsu province obvious analyze impact jiangsu province various region source paper mainly come national database

comparative analysis situation jiangsu province situation conclude china great impact suggesgtions improve status quo summary problem exist china recommendation issue perspective five component ecoenvironment detail follow constantly improve legal system interenterprise exchange require open transparent implementation legal system also integrity practicality law ensure efficiency law enforcement establishment sound legal system require establishment legal system practical application value independence work addition actual situation region also necessary improve regulatory regulation system improve mean supervision reduce administrative regulatory mechanism base legal supervision severely crack illegal activity relevant personnel violate law maliciously criminal evade debt shall responsibility accord strengthen cooperation department interference transform investigate law reduce excessive government intervention maintain independence government intervention direct mean correct adjustment error government ability improve enhancement effectively improve level ecological environment however face current situation difficulty kind intervention transform public change intervention method follow first resource allocation rationalize china ecological environment unbalanced regional government balance fairness efficiency increase promotion adjustment underdeveloped region promote capability second strengthen government behavioral restraint mechanism establish test system help strengthen supervision government administration try reduce administrative mean normal operation ekoloji impact ecological environment accelerate construction system china increasingly close trade issue become another major obstacle face problem start follow three aspect first china one problem difficulty asymmetry often afraid lend relevant face status quo however internet become daily tool communication therefore face problem rely power network want individual send record transaction activity accurately timely relevant joint network platform greatly reduce cost party reduce difficulty secondly support establishment improvement various type guarantee insurance diversify promote healthy various type finally cultivation trustworthy entity severely punish fraudulently obtain maliciously evade debt maintain good external environment law fraudulent act optimize structure enhance steady economy china initial stage still unstable foundation still develop steadily face situation imperative optimize structure stabilize specific practice follow first region broaden bond enable obtain channel addition accelerate construction money enable increase trading tool money secondly encourages jointstock commercial security insurance start diversified promote competitiveness improve efficiency promote activeness thereby lower threshold activity reduce cost finally rapid science large amount world become spiritual pillar change optimize industrial structure become inevitable path science drive productivity drive product value drive industrialization achieve steady steady cooperate factor maintain virtuous circle good situation find
