Taking this as its starting point it presents the technological trends and principal regulatory initiatives in    uencing the development of payment services.For businesses endtoend automation of the     nancial supply chain clear exception processing rules and the enrichment and semantic clarity of     nancial messages all provide tangible bene    ts. Digitisation enables small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) to streamline their business processes and connect to the enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems of large corporate partners. For consumers 24/7 instant payments o    er the perspective of a cashless existence since both individuals and micro enterprises will be able to pay by credit transfer with ease. Th  e retail trade will evolve to a simpler checkout process where the purchase and payment phases will not be separated. Digitisation needs to be employed in Hungary in the     ght to reduce cash payments and enhance     nancial inclusion. To achieve this it is essential for consumers to perceive the practical advantages of cashless payment compared to cash and to be able to manage their personal     nances more easily.Rapid changes demand continuous learning on the part of consumers and micro enterprises to raise the level of their     nancial literacy.Th  is study seeks to answer the question of how Hungary can transform from a follower to a trendsetter in payment services and thence a winner in the process of     nancial digitisation. Extensive collaboration among payment service providers and cooperation across economic sectors together with consistent and coordinated application of payment schemes and standards may lay the basis for superior services.JEL code O33Keywords digitisation payment services PSD2     nancial literacy AYMENT SERVICES AND DIGITISATION731 THE CONCEPT AND CURRENT STATE OF DIGITISATIONDigitisation in its initial sense means the recording and storage of data text and analogue sound and video recordings in digital form. By this de    nition digitisation is contemporaneous with digital data storage. In  the  meantime  a  fresh  de    nition  of  digitisation  has  emerged  signifying  a changing lifestyle     as well as economic and administrative activities     due to the general spread and use of interconnected mobile digital devices. Digitisation leads to a rollback in paperbased administration the removal of spatial and temporal limits automation and the acceleration of communication and business transactions. People communicate remotely not only with other people but also with machines and can receive increasingly     exible and more personalised services.Digitisation transforms payment services and payment     ows not only because it opens up more and more opportunities for payment service providers to o    er their services in new ways but also because our entire environment and way of life is transformed as a consequence. New devices and interactions trigger the creation of new payment solutions.Technological progress is the cause and starting point for the digital transformation  with  the  impetus  for  the  transformation  determined  by  the  following factors1 a)  customer expectations devices capability and a    ordability of services; b) the  innovative  capacity  of  payment  service  providers  strength  of  market competition and su     cient e    ective demand that ensures a return; andc)  the quality of the regulatory environment (including multilateral agreements and standards) as well as the infrastructure. Th  e principal new technological trends which we foresee in the ensuing decades and which are relevant in the context of payment services are outlined below.1.1 Mobile devices and broadband network connectionsTh  e runaway market success of smartphones with mobile internet capability is attributable  to  their  a    ordable  price  highspeed  broadband  connections  and touchscreen simplicity. A pocket computer telephone music player camera and microphone all contained in a single device is an attractive prospect. Th  e utility of such devices is further enhanced by the open nature of manufacturers    application programming interfaces (APIs) within operating systems enabling any de1  Santamar  a J. (2018) Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep and ePayments? 74ISTV  N PR  GAYveloper to distribute their applications through online stores with a global reach (Google Play Apple App Store). Th  e case of UBER is a good example of the use of APIs by developers. Th  e mobile taxi ordering application was created with comparatively modest core development; nevertheless the product itself is astonishingly rich in functions since external geolocation (providing the location of devices and vehicles) maps navigation noti    cation and payment services accessed via APIs have been smoothly integrated into its development. Th  e environment that favours UBER also laid the foundations for the birth of the FinTech phenomenon. 1.2 Touchscreen technology card emulation biometrics augmented realityTh  ese technologies permit customers (and in the case of electronic signatures the service provider as well) to be unequivocally authenticated and to place orders in a quick convenient and secure manner. Th  e mobile wallet may take the place of traditional payment cards and even the physical wallet. Wearable devices and biometrics meanwhile enable identi    cation and authentication of orders even in situations where other devices are not available. Augmented reality o    ers the physical  experience  of  purchasing  without  the  consumer  needing  to  rise  from their armchair.1.3 Blockchain technologyBlockchain technology arranges transactions in blocks authenticates these blocks links the blocks into block chains and ensures publication of records and their preservation in a replicated shared ledger which allows easily manageable databases and transaction systems to be created replacing costly and complex infrastructure and intermediaries. Cryptocurrencies have demonstrated the suitability of the technology  within  their  own  sphere  of  application.  Traditional  payment  service providers have nothing to do with cryptocurrencies since cryptocurrencies     like electronic versions of the cowry shells of old     can be transferred directly between owners. Blockchain technology has nevertheless aroused the interest of     nancial service providers since it may prove suitable for partially or wholly replacing interbank infrastructures. To put it another way simple schemes may take the place of infrastructures that can currently be operated only at signi    cant cost. In the case of cryptocurrencies the authenticity of records is veri    ed not by an entity (operator) but by speci    ed participants in the network and once they validate a transaction it becomes common knowledge and cannot be altered. Th  e bitcoin scheme has no speci    ed owner or administrator. Other blockchain applications may demand the designation of a scheme owner enjoying general public con    dence. AYMENT SERVICES AND DIGITISATION75Intensive e    orts are already under way with a view to successfully applying this revolutionary technology beyond cryptocurrencies although many remain sceptical regarding the scalability of transaction records based on blockchains.1.4 Artifi cial intelligenceArti    cial intelligence particularly using quantum computers that overcome the physical limitations of today   s computers promises to replace telephone customer services with messaging robots (chatbots) and even talking computers.2 Th  e machines behind the chatbots familiar today exchange brief messages in the same way two human beings    chat    with each other.1.5 Th  e Internet of Th  ings data mining and data analysis (Big Data)Th  e Internet of Th  ings (IoT) comprises a network of webconnected sensors of which there may be several in a household or shop that help to respond     exibly to our needs even generating automated transactions. Th  e application of sensors in  machinetomachine  (M2M)  communication  will  signi    cantly  increase  the number of transactions and thus payments providing valuable data to payment service providers about the consumption habits of their customers. Data mining and data analysis help banks better understand the needs of their customers to enable them to present     exible timely and tailormade o    ers.2 THE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION OF PAYMENT SERVICES SO FAR FROM A HISTORICAL PERSPECTIVEProvision of     nancial services entails the administration of     nancial contracts including the management and processing of data. As accounting factories banks and     nancial service providers in general pioneered the practical application of computer technology so that as early as the 1960s and 1970s the     nancial services sector had already begun to employ computer technology at the operational level. Companies with large geographically extensive networks were initially able to improve the e     ciency of their operations and cash management by centralising their treasury operations. Beginning from the 1970s enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems started to evolve.2  From 2016 Bank of America introduced     and has since been continuously developing     its    Erica    digital telephone customer service or chatbot and customers are already able to chat with    Erica    on their mobiles. Parallel with this the bank downsized its human resourceintensive call centre.  76ISTV  N PR  GAYTh  e computerisation of payroll accounting had farreaching consequences enabling  the  disbursement  of  salaries  and  wages  through  personal  checking  accounts or giro accounts. Th  is change relieved employers of the costly administrative burden of cash payments. Retail banking until then typically con    ned to the functions of a savings bank (issuing passbooks and savings certi    cates) and granting simple loans became a more complex business. Computer technology helped streamline public utility fee collection enabling fees to be debited directly to employees    checking or giro accounts. Automatic teller machines (ATMs) were designed to allow wage earners quicker and simpler access to their money. Th  is invention necessitated the issuing of magnetic stripe cards to provide access to cash in the form of an ATM card which could also be used as a cheque guarantee card facilitating identi    cation of the holder when paying by cheque. Th  e development of the payment function of bank cards began with charge cards for business entertainment and travel expenses and the clearing and settlement mechanisms  that  were  developed  for  this  purpose  were  then  adopted  for  consumer credit and debit cards. By the 1980s and 1990s cash withdrawal cards and cheque guarantee cards had evolved into debit cards tied to payment accounts thereby also gaining a payment function. Th  e acceptance of payment cards     following the era of voice authorisation paperbased blacklists and card imprinters used to     ll out purchase receipts     then shift ed to electronic POS terminals. From the 1990s payment accounts could be accessed via the internet initially by means of messages composed sent and received by client programs and later via direct internet banking access and smart (chip) cards which started to supersede magnetic stripe cards.As payment cards have become smart the authorisation of transactions between any two points on the planet takes place within seconds. Smart chips provide strong protection against fraud while NFC wireless technology and mobile wallet applications enable contactless use of cards as well as the emulation of payment cards on telephones or portable devices such as bracelets or smart watches.Payment service infrastructures and communications have accelerated as realtime transactionbytransaction processing gradually supersedes previous batch data processing.Somewhat delayed and spiced with some distinctive local     avour this schematically outlined evolution has taken place     and is continuing to take place     in Hungary. In this country wage payments in cash persisted right up until the     rst half of the 1990s. A standardised interbank clearing and settlement infrastructure has been in place here only since the mid1990s. Hungary   s backwardness in the area of payment services has not been entirely eliminated to this day. Our indicators with respect to both payment account ownership and the use of internet  AYMENT SERVICES AND DIGITISATION77banking are for the time being more modest than the average among EU member states (although no worse than justi    ed by our general level of development). Th  e tectonic transformations of recent decades were favourable for payment service providers in a number of respects. Consumer banking supplies stable funding for banks and information on consumers        nancial behaviour the latter providing a basis for credit scoring and the anticipation of payment di     culties. Th  e handling of payments and the management of payment accounts have become signi    cant and stable sources of revenue for payment service providers.3 PRINCIPAL REGULATORY INITIATIVESINFLUENCING THE FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OF PAYMENT SERVICES3.1 Th  e second Payment Services Directive (PSD2)Directive 2007/64/EC on payment services (PSD1) targeted integration in the     eld of payment services in Europe. Th  e second Directive (EU) 2015/2366 (PSD2) besides further strengthening consumer protection rules and expanding the range of transactions falling within its scope tightens regulations on the authentication of customers and payment orders within the context of digitisation. Under the main regulation authentication must be based on at least two of the following three elements      knowledge (something only the user of the service knows);      possession (something only the user possesses); and      inherence (something that is a personal or biological characteristic of the user). Full application of the regulation would present a sti     challenge to service providers as stringent security requirements may con    ict with the desire not to inconvenience customers. Th  e Regulatory Technical Standards (RTS) created under the mandate of the directive determine in detail the exemptions from the main regulation. Th  e directive     also taking into account the emergence of the FinTech business     obliges accountservicing payment service providers to provide access to the payment accounts they service for the followinga) issuers of payment instruments (transaction authorisation without blocking);b) payment initiation service providers (payment order inputs);c) account information service providers (account and payment data). 78ISTV  N PR  GAYBesides  payment  institutions  holding  a  special  licence  and  specialising  in  this area under the directive the latter two roles may be     lled by accountservicing payment service providers. Detailed rules for access to payment accounts by payment initiation and account information service providers are likewise contained in the abovementioned RTS.Th  e RTS for strong customer authentication and common and secure open standards of communication will be applicable aft er an 18month preparatory period from September 2019.3.2 Th  e strategy for development of fi nancial literacyIn December 2017 the Hungarian government adopted its comprehensive sevenyear national strategy for improving the     nancial literacy of consumers. Th  e strategy establishes a common framework for running the     nancial literacy projects of various public sector stakeholders such as the National Bank of Hungary (MNB) Ministry for National Economy (NGM) State Audit O     ce (  SZ) and Ministry of Human Capacities (Emmi) while maintaining their integrity. Th  e approach enables the national project to identify areas which     in the absence of a comprehensive strategy     previously constituted blind spots and to divert funds and capacities to     lling these gaps in knowledge. Th  e  development  of  consumers     capacity  for  selfprotection  complements  consumer  protection  e    orts  since  material  prosperity  in  large  part  depends  on whether consumers make wellfounded or unrealistic     nancial decisions appropriate to their life situation. Th  e strategy places great emphasis on education within the school system but adults the elderly and disadvantaged also each receive special attention. Th  e acquisition of digital skills pro    ciency in digital     nancial services and understanding of the risks in cyberspace are all important considerations in the implementation of the strategy.Th  e strategy covers a wider scope than its title suggests and is in reality four strategies in one extending beyond the promotion of     nancial literacy to embracea) a plan for the further development of (prior)     nancial advisory services since it is prudent before undertaking a longterm     nancial obligation to take advantage of independent     nancial advice;b) the     ght against cash (including for example the NGM   s POS terminal installation programme); andc) a project to promote     nancial inclusion of groups of the population who at present primarily or exclusively use cash enabling them to take advantage of     nancial services. AYMENT SERVICES AND DIGITISATION79Th  ese projects complement each other since better     nancial capability facilitates     nancial  inclusion  while  the  availability  and  familiarity  of  payment  services promotes  the  reduced  use  of  cash.  In  developing  countries  the  key  focus  is  on     nancial inclusion or the     ght against cash with the promotion of     nancial literacy complementing the core programme. In Hungary in keeping with the practice in developed countries the focus is on the improvement of     nancial literacy.News reports suggest that the action plan of the strategy is due to land on the government   s desk in March 2018.3.3 Th  e introduction of instant paymentsTh  e  instant  payments  service  for  domestic  forint  payments  is  an  initiative  of the MNB (the central bank) and is being implemented under its direction. Th  e planned launch date of the service is 1 July 2019. Instant payment means much more than merely accelerated transaction execution or availability beyond bank opening hours. On the one hand execution will be very rapid and     nal with the bene    ciary receiving the money within a few seconds. On the other hand auxiliary services (e.g. payment requests proxy account identi    ers) will ease payment initiation. Instant interbank settlement allows for this channel to be used not only for transfers of small amounts but also for relatively larger transfers. In Hungary for example it will actually be obligatory to execute nonbatched transfer orders under HUF 10 million in value through this scheme.Th  e bene    ciary of an instant transfer will not need to make a note of the IBAN number of their account as they may link their own telephone number or email address to the account so that money may be remitted to the payment account based on proxies (telephone number email address) usually found on any business card as proxy account identifi ers. Th  e payer need not even take the trouble to     ll in the amount or accompanying information since the bene    ciary may make these data available in a message or in optically readable form.  Th  ese changes may render physical wallets redundant as payments may be made by credit transfer from a mobile wallet to another person or contractor (even to a repairman or street vendor) while payment may also be initiated through a POS terminal. While the starting point is payment between individuals eventually the solution would become applicable in any domestic forint payment situation.Th  e service may create a new digital ecosystem. Th  e more convenient simple and rapid the solutions that are developed and tailored to consumer habits the greater the degree to which instant payment may promote the diminishing use of cash.More and more banks in Hungary are making the instant payment service available in euros as well. 80ISTV  N PR  GAY4 THE FINTECH PHENOMENONDigitisation has reduced the physical and     nancial limits of market entry while at the same time increasing the expectations of consumers. Th  e viability of new business models the facilitation of online and mobile access to     nancial services and the availability of venture capital     nancing have all awakened the entrepreneurial spirit in the     eld of     nancial services. FinTech has also contributed to the creation of new business models for example crowdfunding. In the area of payment services virtual currencies change hands during the payment process without the need for a system of     nancial intermediaries. An example of digitisation of the traditional payment business model is provided by the TransferWise international money transfer service. Based on the convenient but comparatively costly method of sending money via cash transfer TransferWise has essentially adopted the internal settlement operating model of money transfer service providers but employs electronic payment instead of cash payments thus enabling a potentially signi    cant price advantage. Th  e majority of FinTech ventures operating in the area of payment services are concerned with access to payment accounts or services facilitating card payment. Few FinTech companies can expect rapid success in enticing customers away from traditional payment service providers since developing the full range of services of such providers or acquiring a new customer base is a slow and costly process; for this reason they choose instead to specialise thereby gaining themselves the opportunity to cherrypick the activities they favour the most. For their part traditional payment service providers are not letting the appearance of FinTech enterprises go by without a response on the one hand experimenting with innovative developments of their own and on the other hand acquiring promising FinTech ventures or supporting their growth as investors or partners. FinTech incubators meanwhile enable traditional service providers to identify marketable innovations at the initial phase.Th  e FinTech revolution has raised the level of customer expectations with consumers expecting payment service providers to o    er them the experience familiar from online stores. For independent FinTech enterprises payment services represent a regulated area as the PSD2 enters into e    ect. Th  e introduction of instant payments opens up widereaching market opportunities for domestic FinTech ventures. AYMENT SERVICES AND DIGITISATION815 THREE CONDITIONS FOR THE SUCCESS OF DIGITISATIONWe  expect  digitisation  to  enhance  reliability  security  and  accessibility  of  services. Th  e primary goal therefore is to maintain the uninterrupted provision of services. Furthermore it is important for digital solutions to satisfy the real needs of customers and for payment services to genuinely enhance the prosperity of citizens and help businesses strengthen their competitiveness. Finally via targeted public policy measures and selfregulation a healthy regulatory and market environment must be created in order to allow for bestofclass services to emerge amid strong market competition.5.1 Confi dence security uninterrupted serviceDigitisation is boosting the number of connections between digital devices and the customer interfaces of payment service providers by orders of magnitude. Th  e emergence of thirdparty payment service providers adds further to the complexity  of  these  connections.  Th  e  elimination  of  paperbased  solutions  combined with conspicuous growth in turnover and the mass of data being managed make expectations  with  respect  to  the  uninterrupted  secure  execution  of  electronic payments a fundamental requirement alongside full enforcement of data protection criteria. Th  e loss of public con    dence in digital payment solutions would arrest or even reverse the further digitisation of payment services. Every stakeholder has tasks in the interests of maintaining security. It is highly recommended that payment service providers study and incorporate into their own practice3 the guidelines on the security of internet payments of the European Banking Authority as well as the recommendations of the European Central Bank relating to mobile payments and access to payment accounts.Cybersecurity is also served by application of the MNB   s recommendation 7/2017 (VII. 5) on the defence of IT systems as well as by ful    lment of the requirements prescribed for service providers operating critical elements of the infrastructure.5.2 Recognition of customer expectationsTh  is chapter constitutes only a list of examples containing observations in the specialist reference sources rather than the results of any systematic survey. KOV  CS L.     D  VID S. (2016) Fraud Risk in Electronic Payment Transactions. Journal of 3 Money Laundering Control Vol. 19 No. 2 2016 pp. 148   157 82ISTV  N PR  GAY5.2.1 ConsumersTh  e main impetus behind digitisation is to satisfy heightened consumer expectations. Consumers demand a fundamentally secure rapid convenient and transparently priced service. Simplicity in the execution of transactions is an essential expectation. In unexpected situations consumers want assistance and intelligible rapid answers. To ensure transparency of their personal     nances consumers expect intelligible detailed followup information on their account balance and transactions. Th  ey also want to be able to search their account history quickly and for a longer period into the past. Besides a summary of transactions by legal title they also want to be able to look up individual entries in detail. Full transparency of payments cannot be attained without structured meaningful transaction information. If contained within the transaction information the account history can preserve in electronic form copies of merchant invoices related to transactions and other documents such as warranties technical speci    cations instruction manuals or contact details of vendors or service providers.Consumers who are happy to have their payment cards virtualised to their mobiles will be at least as happy to have their customer loyalty cards and accounts virtualised.5.2.2 RetailersRetail sales cover a broad spectrum from hypermarkets through online stores to small shops but retail service microenterprises also belong in this category. Th  ese businesses expect customer payments to be e    ected quickly that payment is preferably irrevocable and that the value of the purchase is credited to their payment account as soon as possible. Th  e retailer is also not indi    erent to the existence and rate of merchant fees the cost of the infrastructure for accepting means of payment and the burden of its operation. Retailers and particularly online stores have an interest in easing checkout and eliminating the hassle of payment authorisation. A conspicuous payment phase o    ers consumers an opportunity for deliberation making them more liable to abandon their purchase than those who have consented to the debiting of their account in advance.5.2.3 Public utility service providersPublic utilities expect due bills to be paid according to a regular schedule with the lowest possible transaction costs. Indication of late payment by the consumer in advance (particularly if default interest is charged) is more favourable than an aborted  AYMENT SERVICES AND DIGITISATION83payment transaction. For public utility service providers invoice matching is of overriding  importance  and  consequently  they  generally  insist  on  initiating  the payment process themselves and that they receive payment data as a supplement to each money transfer in the original form suitable for automated matching.5.2.4 BusinessesBusinesses  want  to  connect  electronic  banking  services  directly  to  their  ERP and other systems but favour standard solutions over bankspeci    c connections. Th  ey want open standardised APIs to be o    ered. As participants in the     nancial supply chain (on the documentation and payment side of the physical supply chain) they want to enjoy the bene    ts of endtoend automation of payment initiation and subsequent transaction noti    cation in close coordination with the management of their other     nancial documents such as invoices. By conducting matching in close to real time they aim to maintain uptodate records promoting both an enhanced standard of service for their customers and better     nancial management. Besides  instant  matching  businesses  expect  streamlined  exception  processing (such  as  returns  recalls  refunds  etc.)  in  a  predictable  preferably  automated fashion. Resources and time devoted to business administration can best be redeployed to the company   s regular and marketing activities. Small and mediumsized enterprises greatly bene    t if ERP suppliers incorporate functions that enable automatic processing of payments into their basic products.5.2. 5 Payment service providers off ering account information servicesPayment service providers that o    er account information services (which may also  be  accountservicing  payment  service  providers)  can  also  be  regarded  as customers in the sense that it is in their interests to have access to the broadest possible  range  of  key  information  through  open  API  connections  with  banks since the quality of consolidated information depends on the quantity and quality of raw data. Th  ese service providers are essentially able to operate in symbiosis with accountservicing banks. It is important for them to be able to connect with accountservicing payment service providers under uniform conditions avoiding the necessity of involving specialised API intermediaries.5.3 Regulatory and market environmentIt is the task of players on the competitive market to develop e     cient payment services able to respond to the expectations of customers. Th  e dynamics and quality of services o    ered on the market are determined not only by e    ective demand  84ISTV  N PR  GAYand the system of     nancial intermediaries but also by other structural conditions elements of which include a solid legal background;     exible     nancial infrastructures; wellfunctioning extensive communication infrastructure; quality of     nancial standards; and quality     and practical enforcement     of bilateral and multilateral agreements between payment service providers regarding the execution of payment transactions.Among numerous positive developments it can be mentioned that     legislators have adopted the PSD2 directive fully and by deadline;     implementation of the instant payment service is proceeding according to the plans of the National Bank of Hungary;     a  strategy  for  the  promotion  of      nancial  literacy  has  been  adopted implementation  of  which  will  contribute  to  breaking  down  barriers  to  the growth of cashless payment services and reducing cash in circulation; and     international card companies are bringing numerous cuttingedge solutions to Hungary.Not every piece of the big jigsaw puzzle is in place either on the international level or in Hungary. Although it is di     cult to draw up an exhaustive list of the missing pieces several factors can be identi    ed by taking into account international blueprints namely     Th  e  Single  Euro  Payments  Area  (SEPA)  project  standardising  payment instruments  and  schemes  regulating  customertocustomer  payment procedures. Some noneurozone EEA countries have adjusted their domestic payment schemes to the SEPA benchmark.     Participation  in  international      nancial  standardisation  helping  to  avoid derogations in the subsequent application of standards.     Domestic standardisation activity complementing international standardisation and facilitating implementation of international standards.     Establishment  of  practical  cooperation  spanning  sectors  expedient  for  the automation of the     nancial supply chain. 6 CONCLUSIONDigitisation provides an excellent opportunity to upgrade payment services to a higher level. Th  e wave of digitisation carries with it the potential to reduce the use of cash make cashless payments ubiquitous promote     nancial inclusion make personal     nancial management as well as corporate cash management more convenient and transparent and ease the administrative burden on enterprises. AYMENT SERVICES AND DIGITISATION85Cashless payments are generally executed in a chain of     nancial messages oft en through a series of intermediary payment service providers and infrastructures. For this reason deepening of cooperation within the     nancial sector as well as between the     nancial and other branches of the economy carries special signi    cance from issues of security to open access and from the meticulous de    nition of business and operational rules to the semantic enrichment of payment messages.
