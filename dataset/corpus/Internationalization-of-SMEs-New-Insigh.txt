INTRODUCTION  As globalization spans all areas of life not surprisingly internationalization of companies is seen as a strategic  imperative  by  scholars  and  practitioners  alike.  Consequently  there  is  an  abundance  of research  studies  and  practitioner  reports  and  textbooks  that  center  on  internationalization  motives market entry strategies efficient organization of foreign partners joint ventures and subsidiaries.  However  research  on  the  internationalization  of  SMEs  is  still  relatively  underrepresented  in  the literature (e.g. Coviello & McAuley 1999; Lu & Beamish 2001; Wright Westhead & Ucbasaran 2007). More than a decade ago the review paper    SME internationalization research past present and future    (Ruzzier  et  al.  2006)  was  published  in  the  Journal  of  Small  Business  and  Enterprise  Development. According  to  Google  Scholar  it  has  since  then  been  cited  more  than  800  times.  While  research  on international  entrepreneurship  which  is  at  the  core  of  the  Ruzzier  et  al.  review  as  well  as  related research  on  born  globals  (Knight  &  Cavusgil  2004;  Cavusgil  &  Knight  2015)  and  international  new ventures (e.g. Zander McDougallCovin & Rose 2015) has intensified over the last decades there are still many issues that are yet to be addressed. The gap becomes even more obvious with respect to teaching  in  the  field  of  International  Management  (IM)  and  international  business  (IB).  Almost  any textbook in the field is predominantly focusing on large MNCs whether from developed or emerging economies  (e.g.  Cavusgil  Knight  &  Riesenberger  2017;  Peng  &  Meyer  2016;  Phatak  Bhagat  & Kashlak 2009). Yet although large corporations and global brands such as HSBC Lenovo McDonalds Siemens or Toyota are known to all students the majority of graduates will work in SMEs that show different approaches regarding their internationalization strategies and processes than what they have been taught at business schools.  What could be the reasons for this neglect despite an apparently intensified interest? From a research perspective a lack of easily accessible secondary data compared to big publicly listed corporations may be one important reason. Moreover using case studies from huge international enterprises that are well known in research studies and particularly for teaching purposes has important advantages. First researchers  lecturers  and  students  can  draw  from  many  sources  and  easily  access  data  and information. Secondly    recipients    such as readers or learners are often familiar with global brands and can  better  comprehend  complex  circumstances  of  the  cases  that  in  one  refers  to  SMEs  that  are regionally  well  known  yet  not  on  an  international  level  even  if  they  are  global  players  within  their industries. A final reason is that international studies conducted by leading strategy consultants based upon their industry and countryspanning expertise are targeting big multinational enterprises too in order to gain reputation and to acquire new clients as these are able to settle their high price tags. Hence  SMEs  seem  to  be  largely  neglected  research  and  consulting  subjects  with  regard  to internationalization especially as they pursue different aims strategies and organizational forms (e.g. Hollenstein 2005).   Not only in SouthTyrol but also in neighboring regions or big European economies such as Germany or Italy SMEs are the 'backbone' of the economy. With regard to internationalization activities of SMEs one has to distinguish between micro businesses (especially local handicraft enterprises) which are at most doing business in areas close to the respective borders and do not pursue clear growth strategies and enterprises in which internationalization and its management is at the center of their firm strategy.  These enterprises range from hightech startups which are to a certain extent prototypes of born globals (Cannone & Ughetto 2014) over component suppliers to SMEs with distinct growth strategies in different business sectors.    The  latter  SMEs  are  confronted  with  challenges  and  problems  such  as  formulating  effective internationalization  strategies  reaching  far  beyond  just  copying  successful  competitors.  Even  more challenges are associated with efficient implementation of such strategies for instance the need for initiate  and  orchestrate  change  management  processes  in  the  headquarters.  Additionally  operative efficiency (organization management processes auditing manufacturing logistics and HRM) which is frequently the source for competitive advantages of SMEs is at risk as structures and processes have  to  be  adapted  to  international  requirements.  Many  of  these  aspects  are  not  at  all  or  insufficiently researched or the scientific insights their reliability and usability are not known.  \\t6\\tISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS Against this background we started a research initiative at the Free University of Bolzano leading to an internally  seedfunded  research  project  called     Management  of  Internationalization  of  small  and medium sized enterprises (SMEs)  Blind spot of research despite major relevance for the economy!    (MISME)  which  has  been  started  in  January  2017  and  will  last  until  December  2019.  It  addresses research questions ranging from motives of SMEs to internationalize formulation and implementation of internationalization strategies to marketing challenges such as the need to customize products and services  to  different  local  markets  human  resource  management  related  questions  as  for  instance international talent management cultural distance and training needs as well as to issues of financing international activities.  Partly  initiated  and  funded  by  the  MISME  project  we  successfully  submitted  a  proposal  for  a Professional  Development  Workshop  to  the  International  Management  Division  of  the  Academy  of Management which we conducted at the 77th Annual Meeting of the AOM in Atlanta GA. in August 2017. Building on this PDW we decided to organize the first conference on    Internationalization of SMEs     New Insights and Future Research Opportunities    at the Free University of Bozen   Bolzano in May 2018 which  aimed  at  discussing  fresh  ideas  and  innovative  research  initiatives  in  the  field  of  the internationalization of SMEs in a more workshoplike format.  We invited international scholars interested in this field including senior PhDs and PostDocs to submit and present their early stage research on the internationalization of SMEs at this interactive conference. We  were  particularly  interested  in  empirical  and  conceptual  papers  that  advance  already  existing knowledge from diverse disciplines affecting SMEs and their attitudes towards internationalization. And the  unexpectedly  high  number  of  interesting  studies  from  authors  originating  from  many  different countries  demonstrated  that  our  idea  to  offer  a  developmental  format  that  allows  for  constructive feedback and discussions among the participants has been highly appreciated.  The interactive conference was opened by JeanFranc  ois Hennart who gave an inspiring keynote speech on  SMEs  and  International  Business  Theory  which  was  further  commented  and  supplemented  by Timothy Devinney.   Hennart started with what he calls the universal belief that selling abroad is always slower more difficult and more costly than domestic expansion which is even more relevant for SMEs. The message of his keynote speech was    selling abroad even for SMEs does not have to be difficult risky costly and  slow     as  it  fundamentally  depends  on  the  firm   s  business  model.  Some  business  models  make selling abroad cheap easy and quick. In the course of his presentation he challenged and questioned basic assumptions of the Uppsala model as well as the mainstream born global literature. Referring to his  2014  article in Entrepreneurship  Theory  and  Practice  he  showed  that  product  customer  and  delivery  system characteristics  of  the  business  model  are  essential  to  predict  the  speed  and  scope  of internationalization (Hennart 2014). According to him it is worthwhile to use classifications of export barriers  (Leonidou  2004)  for  analyzing  internationalization  patterns  of  SMEs.  Finally  he  outlined  a current research project that simultaneously tests the explanatory power of traditional (internet high tech founder experience) and firm business model antecedents (uniqueness transportation costs etc.). As an important implication of future research he concluded that one should look beyond the product at the business model and ask the question    What are the most important measurable characteristics of a fast internationalization business model?    Further research fields he perceives as promising are internationalization of family firms and MicroMNEs.    Thirteen presentations in the areas of Human Resources Strategy Entrepreneurship and Finance as well as Industry 4.0 and Digitalization were held during the conference. The submitted projects varied in their methodology and stage of development. We believe that all authors benefitted from the lively discussions after the presentations and will be able to develop the papers further. We were honored to be  able  to  present  a  European  Journal  of  International  Management  best  paper  award  which  was awarded to a paper authored by Maria Cristina Sestu Antonio Majocchi and Alfredo D   Angelo and titled internationalists  a  theory  of  born  globals     published    The  accidental  \\t7\\tISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS    Entry  mode  strategies  are  SMEs  any  different?   .  The  paper  captured  the  very  central  point  of  the conference Internationalization strategies of SMEs may be very different of those of large enterprises.   The  conference  proceedings  at  hand  include  the  extended  abstracts  of  the  papers  presented  at  the interactive conference if the authors did not signal that they want to abstain from being included for different reasons. Further information on the projects as well as the references cited in the abstracts can be obtained by contacting the authors of the papers.   We surely enjoyed hosting the international conference at our university and hope to see many of the authors at the 2nd interactive conference on Internationalization of SMEs at the Free University of BozenBolzano in the spring of 2019.

Considering that young firms typically suffer  from  scarce  resources  little  experience  and  small  error  margins  (Bruneel  et  al.  2010)  the performance implications of their crossborder expansion have attracted special research attention (for a recent metaanalysis see Schwens et al. forthcoming). However opposing theoretical arguments indicate that the literature is far from being conclusive. While some studies argue that internationalization enables young firms to benefit from additional revenue sources (McDougall & Oviatt 1996) realize economies of scale (Khavul et al. 2010) and explore learning opportunities in foreign markets (Zahra et al. 2000) other studies  emphasizes the  uncertainties  and  additional  resource  requirements  associated  with internationalization  (e.g.  Sapienza  et  al.  2006).  Opposing  arguments  are  also  reflected  in  inconclusive empirical findings reporting positive (e.g. Bloodgood et al. 1996) negative (Zhou & Wu 2014) and nonsignificant effects (McDougall & Oviatt 1996) for the internationalizationperformance link among young firms. In an effort to help overcome the ambiguity in extant research studies have begun to examine the boundary conditions of the internationalizationperformance association in IE notably pointing to the critical role of knowledgebased resources inside the firm (e.g. Schwens et al. forthcoming; Bloodgood et al. 1996). However our understanding is incomplete in terms of at least two important aspects. First while firminternal knowledge is in large part bound to a firm   s employees it remains unclear how different types of knowledge       typically  associated  with  different  types  of  employees       are influential  for  the internationalizationperformance relationship in young firms. Second although knowledge based resources are  likely  to  be  valuable  they  also  represent  a  cost  to  the  firm.  However  existing  studies  focus  on  the absolute rather than the excess level of knowledgebased resources. Consequently we do not know if young internationalizing firms should ensure the availability of certain types of knowledge within the firm by holding costly human resource (HR) slack     i.e. employ    more workers than needed to attend to routine operations    (Lecuona  &  Reitzig  2014  p.  955).    Our  study  examines  the  moderating  influence  of  HR  slack  on  the relationship between internationalization and performance among young firms. Specifically we argue that the magnitude to which internationalization leads to improved performance depends on the associated types of knowledge inherent in different types of HR slack. Consistent with Lecuona & Reitzig (2014) we draw on the  knowledgebased  view  (KBV;  Grant  1996)  and  distinguish  among  (1)  tacit  and  specific  (2)  tacit  and general and (3) codified HR slack. Thus the knowledge associated with different types of excess workers can be (a) tacit or codified (Polanyi 1966) and (b) specific or general (Helfat 1994). While tasks performed by managers typically require knowledge that is difficult to transfer and bound to a specific work context skilled blue collars mainly contribute knowledge that is difficult to codify but can be used in diverse settings.  In  comparison  the  tasks  of  unskilled  blue  collars  require  primarily  knowledge  that  is  easy  to  codify regardless of its specificity (Lecuona & Reitzig 2014). While we assume that tacit and specific HR slack improves the benefits and reduces the costs of a young firm   s internationalization resulting in improved performance we expect tacit and general HR slack as well as codified HR slack to have the opposite effect. We  offer  two  contributions  to  extant  research.  First  we  contribute  to  the  IE  literature  by  theoretically establishing  and  empirically  validating  how  different  forms  of  HR  slack  moderate  the  impact  of internationalization on performance in young firms. As workers hold knowledge we expand previous studies (e.g. Schwens et al. forthcoming) by offering a more detailed perspective on the relevance of knowledgebased resources for the internationalizationperformance link in IE. Second our study is the first to examine HR slack in the unique context of young internationalizing firms. Consequently we contribute to the literature on HR slack (e.g. Mishina et al. 2004) by tailoring our arguments to the specific characteristics of young internationalizing firms.    12\\t\\tISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS Methodology  To test our hypotheses we draw on a sample of young manufacturing firms from France Italy and Spain derived  from  the  EUEFIGE/BruegelUniCredit  dataset  (Altomonte  &  Aquilante  2012).  With  firm performance being the dependent variable we choose a hierarchical linear regression model including interaction terms to validate our theoretical predictions. Consistent with prior studies we use return on assets (ROA) as a measure of firm profitability to operationalize firm performance and percentage of foreign sales to total sales to measure the degree of internationalization. To operationalize the different types of HR slack we divide the number of relevant employees (i.e. managers skilled blue collars or unskilled blue collars) by total sales and subtract the mean ratio of firms operating in the same industry and country (Lecuona & Reitzig 2014; Mishina et al. 2004). To address potential concerns regarding endogeneity we test our model using lagged performance.    Results  We find a positive moderating influence of tacit and specific HR slack (in support of H1) and a negative moderating influence  of  codified  HR  slack  (in  support  of  H3)  on  the  relationship  between internationalization  and  performance.  However  we  do  not  find  support  for  a  negative  moderating influence of tacit and general HR slack (H2). Implications By integrating the notion of HR slack into the IE domain we emphasize the role of excess human resources as a critical source of knowledge which may affect the implementation of young firms    international strategies. Thus our research promotes further considerations concerning the fit between strategic choice and knowledgebased resources in young internationalizing firms. Furthermore our findings are of significance for practitioners as they show that young internationalizing firms     typically challenged by scarce resources     may benefit from specific types of HR slack and suffer from others.

Since the GDP and employment of most economies rely heavily on these forms  of  businesses  the  relevance  of  the  topic  appears  obvious.  As  important  are  the  specific challenges that these companies face Given size and revenues these differ significantly from those of large corporations when it comes to resources and managerial skills (Clifford Jr. 1973). At the same time small and medium enterprises are facing competition from international players while their own potential to act in an increasingly global economy is depending on a large number of factors (Martineau and Pastoriza 2016). Their ability to gain access to scarce resources as their funding and networks usually are not as extensive as those of multinational corporations is limited and they are threatened by  outspending  strategies  of  larger  competitors.  The  increasingly  important  market  of  human resources  the  acquisition  of  highly  qualified  personal  such  as  engineers  or  computer  scientists strongly contributes to the strategic position of an organization. Possessing such rare knowledgeable talents allows companies to gain a competitive edge in their business environments and staying viable (Grant  1996)  (Song  Almeida  and  Wu  2003)  (Crook  et  al.  2011).  Drawing  upon  (Kuivalainen  et  al. 2013) we expect this to be even more important in situations in which SMEs intend to internationalize. When  taking  a  closer  look  several  drawbacks  of  small  and  medium  enterprises  concerning  their position in the competitive market for human resources become obvious. Being the employer of choice for  high  potential  employees  with  relevant  knowledge  e.g.  for  internationalization  projects  poses  a challenge  to  SMEs  which  they  are  aware  of  (Festing  Sch  fer  and  Scullion  2013).  We  divide  these challenges  into  a  perceptional  a  compensational  and  a  perspective  dimension  Generating  brand awareness and entering the evoked set of relevant candidates by building a positive employer brand (Ambler/Barrow  1996)  poses  the  first  barrier  to  SMEs     successful  acquisition  of  high  potentials (Oikarinen and Saraniemi 2016). This problem becomes more relevant when SMEs engage in a country or  worldwide  search  for  personal  with  an  expertise  not  directly  related  to its  field  e.g. internationalization strategy or experts coming from and equipped with knowledge of a foreign target market.  The compensational dimension addresses the abovementioned challenge of being outspent (or being perceived as such) by large corporations able to offer higher fixed salaries. Even in the case that SMEs  match  the  competitive  fixed  salary  other  compensational  components  may  pose  a  secondary barrier to a successful hire. Due to financial organizational and managerial aspects small and medium enterprises  usually  cannot  offer  as  diverse  incentive  systems  large  arrays  of  work  life  balance measurements or professional development programs compared to MNEs. At the same time the career perspectives  in  small  and  medium  enterprises  may  not  be  perceived  by  potential  candidates  as attractive in comparison to those offered by large corporate groups (Marlo 2000). As these drawbacks are  imminent  in  the  nature  of  most  SMEs  they  need  to  establish  alternative  ways  optimizing  the acquisition of strategic human resources and compensate for the abovementioned limitations. We argue that the implementation of candidate experience management (CMX) may pose as a possible solution attenuating  the  perceptional  as  well  as  the  compensational  dimension.  The  concept  of  candidate experience  management  is  closely  related  to  the  concept  of  customer  experience  management  as described  by  (Pine  II  and  Gilmore  1999).  In  practice  it  is  understood  as  an  integrative  perspective including several stages of the application process Starting with candidate awareness and attrition providing information to potential candidates the implementation of the application process itself the selection  of  final  candidates  as  well  as  the  onboarding  process  and  the  impact  of  the  process  on employee retention. CMX covers all relevant candidate touchpoints and thereby is more extensive than the integrated applicant reaction model presented by (Chapman and Webster 2006). In this way CMX resorts to the customer journey concept and adapts it to a candidate application process. This helps to reframe the perception of the hiring process and leads to a candidatecentric approach intended to create a positive experience from the first point of contact via the application and beyond the onboarding process (Verhoeven 2016). While the applicant reactions to different stages of a recruiting process have been of long interest in research (McCarthy et al. 2016) an integrative perspective has received little attention  in  international  scholarly  journals  so  far.  While  the  few  articles  stress  the  importance  of  14\\t\\tISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS candidate experience (e.g. Barbedette 2005 or Carpenter 2013) the steady interest of practitioners demonstrates the concepts relevance in the working world. A google trend analysis allows for a first insight into the relevance of the construct. The increasing digitalization of human resource management and  recruiting  processes  adds  to  this  development  and  opens  new  possibilities  as  it  does  not  only support the CMX but helps to present one   s company as progressive (Brahmana and Brahmana 2013) (Lam  and  Hawkes  2017).  To  our  knowledge  no  investigation  into  the  role  of  candidate  experience management  or  related  constructs  as  sources  of  competitive  advantages  for  small  and  medium enterprises have so far been made. Therefore our research project focuses on the question of    How does  candidate  experience  management  add  to  the  internationalization  of  SMEs?     We  conduct interviews with SME managers to better understand how and why the companies implement different CXM measures. By implementing a qualitative data analysis approach we intend to gain deeper insights into how SMEs strengthen their competitive position in the HR market. We also address their experience in implementing CXM to fill positions relevant to successfully internationalize their businesses     either specialists for internationalization or key actors in the process.  At this stage of the study we are focusing on SMEs in all different stages of internationalization processes. In a second step we plan to develop a survey based on the first study to assess the extent to which different measures affect their ability to acquire and retain high potential personal in the context of internationalization. We are considering to administer this questionnaire not only in Germany but also in the US as well as in South Korea.  The first three interviews with representatives from one company already revealed that small and medium enterprises are beginning to optimize their recruiting processes by adapting them to the applicants    preferences as they clearly identify this as a competitive advantage over their larger competitors.  Our research addresses a relevant gap between research and business reality. We investigate the impact of an  integrated  candidatecentered  application  process  and  its  relevance  for  small  and  medium enterprises with an intention to internationalize their business. We thereby advance our knowledge of SMEs internationalization strategies as well as assisting business in developing useful strategies in the struggle for rare talents.

Nevertheless there is evidence from the practice implying that careers of men and women show different patterns. Moreover it seems that careers of individuals in different national contexts are influenced by distinct (cultural and institutional)  factors.  The  Kaleidoscope  Career  Model  (Mainiero  &  Sullivan  2005)  proposes  that individual  career  patterns  change  over  time  as  individuals  based  on  their  current  lifestage  place varying focus on authenticity balance and challenge.  These  focuses  may  be  further  influenced  by  institutional  factors  as  well  as  gender.  The  study  of international careers within a multinational context usually refers to two distinct but related themes namely international career developments of employees and selfinitiated international careers. While the early literature on international careers focused on the benefits organizations and individuals can draw from successful expatriate missions recent studies concentrated on examining how people adapt to today   s fastchanging and increasingly globalized environment when building their careers (Tams & Arthur  2007;  Suutari  &  Brewster  2000).  Even  though  the  classical  expatriate  assignment  is  still  a common  practice  in  international  businesses  the  increase  in  mobility  and  the  emergence  of boundaryless  individual  driven  careers  prompt  more  and  more  people  to  embark  on  selfinitiated international careers. Hence they expatriate themselves voluntarily to other countries (Carr Inkson & Thorn 2005). Such moves can have various motives such as gaining international experiences seeking personal development or striving for economic or political improvement.  The phenomena of international careers and the global flow of talent     stimulated by both expatriate assignments and selfinitiated international moves     cause various challenges for internationally acting organizations  as  they  have  to  cope  with  more  competition  for  highly  qualified  individuals  worldwide (Tarique & Schuler 2010). Generally firms seek to attract retain and develop these young and talented workers through talent management practices (Iles Preece & Chuai 2010). Yet with an accelerating globalization international talent becomes increasingly valuable while at the same time there is an acute talent shortage on labor markets in both developed and emerging economies (Scullion & Collings 2011).  Consequently  the  development  and  adoption  of  strategic  GTM  practices  become  of  crucial importance for organizations (Tarique & Schuler 2010). In response to calls for research by various scholars (e.g. B  hmer & Schinnenburg 2016; Sullivan & Baruch 2009; Suutari Tornikoski & M  kel   2012; Tams & Arthur 2007) we adopted a crosscultural approach and examine how successful careers of international knowledge workers in three countries namely India Italy and Germany develop over time. We intend to find out if there are culture based differences in their career patterns. In addition we investigate the influence of gender on career paths in and between the country samples.   Considering the key features and advantages of a qualitative research approach (e.g. Bryman 2016; Denscombe 2010) an inductive qualitative research design was selected. Curriculum vitae (CV) analysis was chosen as the primary method for data collection as it is regarded as an adequate instrument to examine  career  trajectories  and  mobility  as  well  as  the  impact  of  such  mobility  on  people   s  career progress (Bawazeer & Gunter 2016). For the analysis of the qualitative data we decided to use the content analysis approach (Mayring 2014). Our final research sample consisted of 74 male and female professionals originating from three diverse cultural contexts namely India Germany and Italy.  Our study contributes to the literature on international careers as it lacks in empirical examination of international careers of knowledge workers especially culture comparisons are rare. We extend the literature  comparing  career  patterns  of  international  knowledge  workers  in  three  different  cultural contexts. Within the career literature only few studies have used CV analysis as primary data collection method.  Therefore  the  present  study  also  contributes  to  the  existing  empirical  research  on  career patterns from a methodological perspective. Our findings reveal significant differences in the career paths  of  male  and  female  international  knowledge  workers  in  distinct  institutional  environments especially regarding the two dimensions of mobility and career patterns. Hence international talent seems to develop differently in distinct cultural contexts. The vast variety of influencing factors affecting  16\\t\\tISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS people   s career decisions may also have a significant impact on organizations employing international knowledge workers and the way in which they manage their workforce (B  hmer & Schinnenburg 2010).  Internationally acting SMEs must be aware of this complexity of contextual impact factors and should adopt a contextspecific approach. They need to align their HRM practices with the many identities and goals to which their employees aspire (Shen et al. 2015). In line with B  hmer and Schinnenburg (2016) we encourage SMEs to implement efficient and tailormade GTM measures that aim to successfully attract  retain  and  develop  talent  to  secure  survival  in  today   s  increasingly  global  dynamic  and competitive world.

Understanding  what  influences  leadership  behaviors  and  global leadership  success  is  an  important  topic  for  SMEs  in  their  internationalization  process  as internationalization  involves  working  with  individuals  in  different  countries  with  different  cultural backgrounds.  Certainly the leader   s individual motivation plays a great role (Bartubo 2005) but also various intelligences have been shown to influence leadership effectiveness (Rockstuhl et al. 2011).  Contemporary  theories  on  intelligence  such  as  Gardner   s  (1993)  and  Sternberg   s  (1999)  theories  of multiple intelligences propose that intelligence is not a single general (cognitive) ability such as IQ but a  collection  of  various  types  of  intelligences.  In  the  context  of  leadership  Alon  and  Higgins  (2005) suggest  that  in  addition  to  general  intelligence  emotional  intelligence  and  cultural  intelligence  are important  factors  influencing  global  leadership  success.  Even  though  the  importance  of  multiple intelligences  has  been  discussed  in  the  literature  studies  examining  international  workgroups  has largely focused on cultural intelligence and demonstrated a positive effect on leadership effectiveness (Groves & Feyerherm 2011; Offermann & Phan 2002) as well as the task performance (Ang et al. 2007). Emotional intelligence on the other hand has so far mainly been examined in a domestic setting. For example  Kerr  et  al.  (2006)  show  that  emotional  intelligence  is  positively  related  to  leadership effectiveness  whereas  Wong  and  Law  (2002)  demonstrate  a  positive  relation  between  a  leader   s emotional  intelligence  and  follower  satisfaction.  When  it  comes  to  general  intelligence  previous research has shown that IQ positively influences leadership effectiveness both in a domestic as well as a crossborder setting (Rockstuhl et al. 2011).  As Alon and Higgins (2005) suggest our study examines general  intelligence  emotional  intelligence  as  well  as  a  leader   s  motivation  as  antecedents  of leadership  behaviors  within  multicultural  work  teams.  We  further  examine  the  mediating  effect  of leadership behaviors on global leadership success. Along the lines of Alon and Higgins (2005) we expect that  cultural  intelligence  moderates  the  relationship  between  leadership  behaviors  and  global leadership success in a multicultural team during an internationalization process of a SME.   Method  To test our model using structural equations modelling we utilize an online survey which is part of a virtual  international  collaboration  project.  Our  data  set  comprises  of  over  7000  students  from  120 universities  in  40  countries  working  in  international  teams  on  reallife  internationalization  projects provided  by  several  SMEs  from  different  countries.  During  the  project  the  participants  evaluate  the performance  of  their  peers  within  their  team  and  at  the  end  of  the  project  the  solution  to  the internationalization challenge presented by each team is evaluated by five to seven independent experts. This provides reasonably reliable estimates of a leader   s performance and the performance of his/her work team. The survey includes a measure for the emergence of leadership within the team as well as a  number  of  other  leadership  indicators  such  as  the  demonstration  of  leadership  and  coordination intellectual contribution effort and helpfulness the ability to motivate work group members and quality of the final work group performance. Emotional intelligence is measured using the Wong & Law (2002) tool whereas cultural intelligence is assessed using the Ang et al. (2007) measure. General intelligence is measured in a preproject test during which verbal reasoning and memory are measured. Various control variables including nationality age and gender among others will be included in the analysis.   Contribution  Following  the  call  for  research  by  Rockstuhl  et  al  (2011)  we  extend  the  literature  examining  the influence of various intelligences on leadership effectiveness in our case global leadership success. We  will  closely  follow  and  empirically  test  the  theoretical  framework  provided  by  Alon  and  Higgins (2005).    Our  results  contribute  to  the  existing  literature  on  global  leadership  as  well  as  on internationalization  on  SMEs.  We  extend  the  literature  on  global  leadership  by  examining  the antecedents  of  leadership  behaviors  as  well  as  the  pathways  though  which  various  intelligence  18\\t\\tISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS influence global leadership success by testing an existing theoretical model. Our contribution to the literature  on  the  internationalization  of  SMEs  lies  in  examining  how  leadership  contributes  to internationalization  success  of  an  SME.  Our  results  will  have  various  practical  implications  for  the management  of  SMEs  especially  when  it  comes  to  the  hiring  and  training  practices  within  these organizations.

Darouichi1 Vijaya Narapareddy2 1Universit   de Neuchatel Switzerland. 2University of Denver USA; philippe.lamb@unine.ch  The internationalization process of SMEs has been a widely debated research topic at least since the mid1970s (Ruzzier et al. 2006). By contrast interest in the question of the outcome of this process is recent but growing rapidly in the scholarly literature (Cao et al. 2016; Kuivalainen et al. 2012; Manolova et  Manev  2004;  Schwens  et  al.  2017).  And  yet  this  is  a  major  issue  from  a  managerial  standpoint.  Initially empirical research into the factors that affect how well international SMEs perform focused mainly on hightech new ventures in line with the International Entrepreneurship approach (Bloodgood et al. 1996; Mort et Weerawardena 2006; Preece et al. 1999). Later on researchers began to study different kinds of SME in many industrial contexts (K. Brouthers et al. 2015; K. D. Brouthers et Nakos 2004;  Di  Gregorio  et  al.  2009;  Hagen  et  al.  2012;  Hilmersson  et  Johanson  2016;  Hsu  et  al.  2013; Musteen et al. 2010; Pangarkar 2008; Trudgen et Freeman 2014).   Purpose   Due to the growing number of studies addressing the performance issue of iSMEs (internationalized SMEs) there is a pressing need to provide a comprehensive literature review in the field. This literature review paper on the iSMEs performance antecedents and measures aims to explore four key research questions (1) What are the key issues regarding iSMEs performance? (2) What are the determinants and measures of the iSMEs performance? (3) What are the theoretical and methodological approaches used in the field? (4) How to address the performance issues of iSMEs in the future?    Methodology  We conducted an    exhaustive review    (Cooper 1988; Webster et Watson 2002) examining empirical and conceptual researches published between 2002 and 2017 that focus on the assessment of the SMEs internationalization process.  Following Manolova et Manev (2004) a narrative approach was adopted by providing our own interpretation regarding the impact of the antecedents on the iSMEs performance and the performance measures. As such two analytical tools were used tabular comparison of sources and variable grouping (Levy et Ellis 2006; Webster et Watson 2002). Findings Based on these 5 inclusion criteria more than 40 contributions were identified. We organized the contributions into three groups conceptual  papers  quantitative  empirical  studies  and  qualitative  empirical  studies.  Then  the contributions  are  discussed  according  the  key  research  questions.    As  a  synthesis  of  the  findings presentation  and  discussion  we  propose  a  general  model  of  iSMEs  performance.  The  performance antecedents and measures are classified with the supportive references analyzed in the review process.   Value  Our contributions are fourfold (1) clarification of the main concepts and constructs regarding the iSMEs performance (2) proposition of an integrative conceptual model to guide future empirical investigations.

Indeed foreign entry strategies are the key to success in the foreign market in terms of performance and survival (Lu & Beamish 2001). Thus given their prominence these strategies have been one of the main core topics of internal business research in the last decades (Brouthers & Hennart 2007). Regardless of the relevant role of SMEs into the world economy in terms of both GDP and employment previous studies on foreign entry strategies have mainly focused on large MNCs overlooking SMEs (Bruneel & De Cock 2016). Thus the relevance of the research on foreign entries is augmented by its focus on SMEs that  have  been  overlooked  so  far.  Moreover  the  limited  knowledge  on  SMEs     foreign  entries  lack  of  a comparison with the results obtained for large firms. While it is true that SMEs and large firms differ in some instances it is not clear whether these different characteristics affect also their foreign entry strategies. Thus is still not clear whether the major theories of foreign entry strategies (Transaction Cost Economics Institutional theory Resource Base view and so on) are valid also for SMEs. To shed new light on this topic is the focus of this paper. To this aim we investigate foreign entries in the Italian market from 2005 until 2015 using a dataset of 719 investments using the SMEs    definition of the European Union the sample contains 119 SMEs and 528 large firms. Large firms might choose differently their foreign entry strategies because of their economies of scale and specialisation large availability of financial and human resources (Wagner 2001). Moreover the family ownership structure might affect differently the entry and establishment modes of large and SMEs (Bruneel & De Cock 2016; Laufs & Schwens 2014) given that most of SMEs are family controlled. Also the presence of high initial sunk costs to enter a foreign country might limit more SMEs than large firms. Up to now foreign entry research has mainly focused on large firms (Brouthers & Hennart 2007)  irrespective  of  the  theoretical  framework  and  far  too  little  attention  has  been  paid  to  SMEs.  In particular a comprehensive comparison of entry strategies of large firms and SMEs is still lacking. The few studies focusing on SMEs (Brouthers & Nakos 2004; Nakos & Brouthers 2002) do not use a control group of  large  firms  to  compare  the  findings.  Thus  foreign  entry  research  needs  more  comparative  studies (Erramilli and D   Souza1993; Li and Qian 2008). Comparative studies will extend our understanding of how the same determinants have a different effect (magnitude and sign) on the foreign entry choice of SMEs and large firms. The aim of this research is to investigate whether the effect of a set of determinants widely used in previous research studying large MNCs    foreign entry strategies is the same for SMEs. We focus our empirical analysis on the ownership mode selection (joint venture versus wholly owned subsidiary) and on the establishment mode choice (greenfield versus acquisition) using the classification of Brouthers and Hennart (2007). Some of our findings show that SMEs    and large firms    entry strategies are driven by different factors highlighting possible future research paths. For instance our results show that in the manufacturing sector that large firms prefer to establish a wholly owned subsidiary in manufacturing while this sector is not significant for the sample of SMEs. Furthermore SMEs to select a wholly owned subsidiary over (joint venture when the local firm is also an SME while diversified SMEs prefer a (joint venture investment rather than a wholly owned subsidiary. These two effects are not significant for large firms whose ownership mode is mainly driven by the industry growth of the host market the psychic distance and the family control of the local firm. With reference to the establishment mode our findings confirm as well as for the ownership mode the need to further investigate the determinants of SMEs choice. Indeed our analysis shows different results for the two sample. While SMEs    propensity to make a greenfield investment is negatively affected by the age of the SME its experience in the Italian market and if the investment is in the manufacturing sector for large firms these determinants are not significant. Indeed their establishment mode choice is affected by other factors as geographic distance and return on assets. Our results show that SMEs    foreign entry strategies are determined by different factors compared to large MNCs. Thus future studies on foreign entry strategies should focus more on the comparison between SMEs and large firms to identify which are exactly the drivers for the two different groups.

It  is  commonly understood  as     the  discovery  enactment  evaluation  and  exploitation  of  opportunities   across  national borders   to create future goods and services    (Oviatt & McDougall 2005 540). Although the definition is quite broad and includes multiple types of entrepreneurial behavior the main focus of IE scholars has been on entrepreneurs who identify and exploit opportunities across national borders (not on comparative studies) and in particular on firms that (a) see the opportunities spread across the globe and (b) try to access these global markets as quickly as possibly (Jones et al. 2011). These global startups (see Oviatt & McDougall 1994)  are  sources  for  potential  future  growth  but  they  form  a  clear  minority  among  internally entrepreneurial  firms.  A  lion   s  share  of  these  firms  expand  at  a  slower  pace  and  for  many  of  them international operations     although they may have continued for years     remain of less importance than their domestic market activities.  Entrepreneurial internationalization lies at the heart of IE research (Jones et al. 2011)  and  there  the  term  has  been  understood  very  broadly.  In  a  way  that  is  understandable  because internationalization always includes a new entry either with the existing or new products to a new market and a new entry is an essential act of entrepreneurship (Lumpkin & Dess 1996). Whether the behavior of internationalizing  firms  is  entrepreneurial  is  another  question.  Being  entrepreneurial  refers  to  a combination  of  bold  and  opportunityseeking  decisionmaking  with  innovativeness  risk  taking  and proactiveness (Dess et al. 1997). One could argue that the great majority of smaller internationalizing firms do  not  act  entrepreneurially;  on  the  contrary  they  are  nonentrepreneurial  and  conservative  and  their management style is mainly riskaverse noninnovative and passive or reactive (cf. Covin & Slevin 1988). Thus although entrepreneurial internationalization might be experienced by any firm in any industry or context (Jones & Coviello 2005) it does not always happen. Consequently how well do the existing theories capture their internationalization process? Since 1970s International Business research has been dominated by three main theories the OLI framework of John Dunning (1973 1977) internalization theory (e.g. Buckley & Casson 1976) and the internationalization process of the firm (Johanson & Vahlne 1977). The three theories have investigated the same phenomenon from different perspectives OLI framework explaining why and where firms expand overseas internalization theory rationalizing the most efficient organization form to expand and the internationalization process theory how firms expand to international markets (Santangelo & Meyer 2017). Additionally during the past 30 years a considerable number of studies have been published with an attempt to explain the emergence of    born globals    (Knight & Cavusgil 1996) and accelerated process of  internationalization  (HurmerintaPeltom  ki  2003).    None  of  these  theories  seem  to  provide  us  an explanation why some SMEs internationalize incrementally over time for a while but then seem to hit a    glass ceiling    i.e. a maximum level of commitment which is not overcome. On the other hand why is it so that the international  activities  of  these  firms  often  seem  to  be  characterized  by  nonlinear  internationalization (Vissak & Francioni 2013) i.e. their commitment to internationalization varies over time it decreases and increases again often several times? This study addresses the broader research question how does nonentrepreneurial  internationalization  happen  and  why?  We  argue  that  besides  strategic  entrepreneurial internationalization     i.e. purposeful entrepreneurial action which is proactive innovation and sustainable (Autio 2017)     some SMEs internationalize through a more nonentrepreneurial process. These firms do not experience accelerated internationalization through which they increase their commitments on international markets. Instead their internationalization starts and continues to be opportunistic and sporadic rather than a  continuous  process investigates  the  nonentrepreneurial internationalization process by bringing in insights from both entrepreneurship and international business literatures but also with an illustrative case study of an Italian exporter of construction products.   (Bernini  et  al.  2016).   Our  study REFERENCES AVAILABLE FROM THE AUTHORS  22\\t \\t ISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS How to determine the cost of equity capital in small and medium sized private companies? Bernd Britzelmaier Hochschule Pforzheim Germany; bernd@britzelmaier.de The internationalization of capital markets as well as (crossborder) mergers and acquisitions are just two reasons for the need to determine the costofcapital rates of companies (Madura et al 2017; Koller at al 2015). Costofcapital rates are also needed to calculate imputed interest (Coenenberg et al 2016; Britzelmaier et al 2008) and to carry out investment appraisal calculations (Brealey et al 2016) and to implement valuebased management (Rappaport 1986; Stewart 1999).  Costofcapital rates consist of cost  of  debt  and  cost  of  equity  usually  calculated  as  weighted  average  cost  of  capital  (WACC).  To determine the cost of debt is a lot easier as the cost of equity since in almost every case the conditions of credit contracts and bonds are based on contracts and hence legally binding (Brealey et al 2016; Geginat et al 2006).  While stocklisted companies are able to use capital market oriented methods to determine their cost of equity such as Capital Asset Pricing Model (CAPM) or Arbitrage Pricing Theory (APT)  other  companies       such  as  SMEs    have  to  follow  different  approaches  (V  lezPareja  2005; Behringer  2009;  Bertrame  and  Cappelletto  2013;  Britzelmaier  et  al  2013  Bertrame  et  al  2014). Existing literature on cost of equity capital focuses on calculation methods for large companies which also still demand further research (Schlegel 2016). Moreover practical links literature seems to be rather rare (Gegeinat et al 2006; Wei  enberger and Ulmer 2004; KPMG 2012). The aim of this paper is to find out the relevance of cost of equity for SMEs in Baden W  rttemberg and to discuss approaches to determine the cost of equity in small and medium sized private companies. Two case studies illustrate how different approaches can be applied in practice. As this paper discusses the cost of equity capital in  the  context  of  SMEs  the  concept  of  SMEs  needs  to  be  defined  and  characterized.  Despite  the economic  significance  of  SMEs  until  now  there  is  no  uniform  definition  of  SMEs  (Tappe  2009).  In science and business practice several concepts have been established in order to distinguish SMEs from other companies. Basically those approaches can be divided into quantitative and qualitative definition concepts. Based on recent publications on SMEs a combination of quantitative criteria to demarcate SMEs from microenterprises and qualitative criteria to distinguish them from largescale companies is derived (Gonschorek 2009; Tappe 2009). Regarding an investment the cost of capital represents the rate  of  return  on  capital  employed  expected  by  the  corresponding  investors.  Consequently  an investment at least has to meet this expectation of return in order to attract capital. From the investors    perspective the cost of capital has the characteristics of opportunity costs (Coenenberg et al 2016). By allocating capital to a specific investment they forego providing capital to alternative investments with comparable risk structure and duration and therefore also relinquish the related returns. With growing risk the expected return and hence the cost of capital increases (Pratt and Grabowski 2010; Stewart 1999).  From  the  company   s  perspective  the  cost  of  capital  represents  the  minimum  rate  of  return expected as adequate compensation by the providers of equity and debt capital (Brealey et al 2016). Hence  the  company  cost  of  capital  is  divided  into  cost  of  equity  and  cost  of  debt  representing  the expected returns of lenders and investors in isolation (Britzelmaier 2013). Since the cost of debt can be calculated easily this papers focuses on the cost of equity.  Based on literature review and the analysis of  a  number  of  studies  the  paper  displays  the  design  and  the  results  of  own  studies  in  BadenW  rttemberg (Britzelmaier et al 2014; Britzelmaier et al 2018). The studies    results in this paper focus on the degree of application of cost of capital calculations in SMEs and the methods used to determine the  cost  of  equity.  They  show  the  relevance  of  the  topic  to  SMEs  especially  to  larger  ones  with  an international focus. As a first approach to determine the cost of equity for SMEs the CAPM is used since it seems to be the most frequently used in practice (Copeland et al 2002; El Hedi Aurori et al 2012; Pratt and Grabowski 2010; Da et al 2012). Because of the lack of capitalmarket orientation the standard CAPM method cannot be used and analogy analyze and qualitative approaches need to be presented and discussed (Peem  ller 2005; Pfister 2003). To gain an insight view in companies    two case studies were made. The basis for the cases were projects in cooperation with privately held enterprises that exceeded the quantitative thresholds indeed but show the typical qualitative characteristics namely the absence of capital market orientation and therefore limited financing possibilities. To calculate their cost of equity the following approaches are applied (Behringer 2009; Pfister 2003; Peem  ller 2005; Steinle et al 2007; Chua et al 2006; Bufka et al 2004; Britzelmaier et al 2014; Damodaran 2012a; Damodaran 2012b; Copeland et al 2002; Pratt and Grabowski 2010)   23\\t \\t ISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS                CAPM pure play methodAPM peergroup method (including unlevering and relevering beta)CAPM industrybeta methodCAPM analyze methodQualitative approachThe results are compared and differences discussed. Some recommendations can be given on how to deal with cost of equity in SMEs. It can be argued that capital market derived methods though rooted for calculation of cost of equity capital in listed companies may not be the one and only approach for SMEs.  Subjective  approaches  of  cost  of  equity  capital  can  be  applied  instead  or  additionally  saving further assumptions and complexity in already doubtful and assumption flooded finance formulae the most common of which is the CAPM. Most importantly cost of equity should consider the business and finance  risk  of  the  company  and  represent  the  expected  return  on  the  invested  equity  by  the entrepreneurs. As illustrated in the case studies one can recommend using a combination of different approaches to avoid a biased and subjective estimation. The case studies further provide a stepwise approach  which  can  also  be  applied  and  adjusted  by  other  SMEs.    Areas  for  further  research  are manifold  in  this  domain.  Further  research  could  focus  on  larger  samples  in  order  to  gain  validity. Comparative case studies could reveal interesting aspects of the practical implementation in different firms. The publication of further case studies could help practitioners to cope with the issue.

Although coined as a revolutionary and disruptive innovation for all industries the real effect is so far to be seen only in one area     the way startups and SMEs attract financial resources with Initial Coin Offerings (ICOs) or token sales in other words. Apart from funding internationalization fintech industry since the inception was a truly global phenomenon with developers    teams being distributed around the world communicating and collaborating through webbased resources and depositaries. However blockchain pushed it even higher with all aspects of the business process     financing sales investing and others completely being freed from national boundaries. In this paper we use the data from proprietary manuallyconstructed database on all known token sales that took place from 2013 to September 2017 to study the internationalization of the fintech startups    team formation and  collaboration  relations  with  support  community  and  clients  and  new  ways  of  attracting  worldwide investors  with  ICOs.  We  provide  detailed  statistics  on  all  aspects  of  blockchain  financing  and  study  its evolution from the early stages when the annual number of ICOs were below a dozen (20132015) up to the recent times when the total funds attracted internationally have reached USD 6bln in 2016. We argue that the blockchain financing is the new advanced stage of equity and rewardbased crowdfunding and provided a comparative study of token sales vs. crowdfunding and conventional financing methods such as IPOs and Venture Capital (VC). Not only did blockchain revolutionized and truly internationalized the funding process for SMEs but for the first time it also allowed for complete disintermediation of the market trading of the tokens issued during the ICOs. Any investors from any part of the world is able now to buy and sell the tokens on various online exchanges that have no national boundaries and are able to free the investors from socalled    home bias   . In this paper we provide and account of this new phenomenon looking in particular on the     longrun     performance  of  the  issued  tokens  and  the  exchanges     presence  effect.  Focusing  on  the entrepreneurial ventures (EVs) and small and medium enterprises (SMEs) rarely is the internal funds are sufficient  to  finance  their  investment  projects.  Since  the  business  profits  are  highly  procyclical  this  is especially true during the economic downturns. Indeed up until recently the financehungry entities had only two possibilities     to borrow from the local bank or to sell part of their companies to outside investors i.e. venture capitalist (VC) in case of the startups and institutional investors or general public in case of the SMEs  although  the  later  was  rarely  an  option  for  a  relatively  small  company.  The  rapid  technological changes internationalization and advent of the Fintech in the financial industry and its inability to adapt rapidly to the everchanging and more volatile needs of SMEs and EVs have led to unheard before new and innovative  financing  methods  by  which  the  capital  from  financial  markets  is  funnelled  to  the  corporate borrowers bypassing or altering the conventional financial industry   s channels that were severely adversely affected by the ongoing financial crisis started in 2007. Looking at the various funding mechanisms preceding blockchain financing be it IPOs bonds VC or bank loans we observe a striking phenomenon of them being localized to a particular geographical area be it national or some union boundaries defined by common legislation  cultural  linguistic  similarities  or  common  past.  These  limits  are  less  binding  for  large corporations who can tap foreign capital markets by issuing ADRs in US or Eurobonds in foreign jurisdiction. In alternative large wealthy Individuals were always able to invest abroad using private banking facilities whereas small investors were left to deal with local bank or buy national debt or invest in local stock market. Blockchain abruptly has shaken the whole system of borrowing and investing by allowing anybody anywhere in the world to invest in a startup formed by the team members residing in several countries with an office rented say in Singapore with legal entity being registered in Switzerland and ICOs process run under the Virgin Islands jurisdiction. Using social media blogs webbased communications and internet in general the  companies  have  suddenly  obtained  the  possibility  to  attract  financing  from  abroad  free  from  local financial  system  limitations  without  a  need  to  sell  larger  part  of  its  business  to  a  venture  capitalist  or substantial resources spent on marketing and promotion of the capital issue and on extortionate fees to intermediaries without whom the process was doomed. Not anymore. Internet blockchain and distributed ledgers have removed the need for a financial middleman leading to genuine revolution in the way SMEs obtain financing through ICOs.

Hence Despite the studies on the internationalization process of Small Medium Enterprises (SMEs) are not new in the international business literature a demand for new approaches to internationalization seems to emerge in today   s digital economy. In particular the rapid development of digital firms operating in the Internet of Things (IoT) domain has been changing business processes as traditionally perceived. Digital IoT SMEs provide innovative high technology solutions (e.g. intelligent factories smart buildings and  home  devices)  through  the  exploitation  of  global  networks  of  machines  and  devices  connected through the internet. These firms have unique business processes focused on big data generation and exploitation instead of tangible product manufacturing; business models based on services rather than products  (Lee  &  Lee  2015);  complete  different  international  footprint  than  traditional  ones  (World Investment  Report  2017).  For  instance  a  digital  firm  can  develop  foreign  business  with  a  reduced number of assets fewer employees (World Investment Report 2017) and without a physical presence (Eden  2016;  McKinsey  Global firms    internationalization such as the Uppsala (Cavusgil 1980; Johanson & Vahlne 1977) Born Global (Bell et al. 2003; Oviatt & McDougall 1994) and Bornagain Global ones (Kalinic & Forza 2012) seem not to be  entirely  appropriate  in  explaining  the  internationalization  process  of  such  firms  representing  the third wave of internet development. Apparently their international behavior seems resemble that of born  global  firms  and/or  new  international  ventures.  However  new  SMEs  do  not  have  to  unlearn procedures focused on developing a domestic market presence before the internationalization of their business (Autio 2000). Whereby the logic behind the international expansion of digital IoT firms remain unclear up to date. Due to the lack of studies on this issue the open debate among scholars and decision makers and the relevance of the topic this research seeks to understand whether and how digital IoT firms approach the international markets. In particular this work attempts to find an answer to the following  questions  Are  digital  IoT  firms  oriented  toward  the  international  expansion?  If  yes  does internationalization for digital IoT firms follow the same path of traditional firms or a new paradigm of internationalization is emerging? If not what are the reasons for a lack of orientation towards firms    internationalization?    Given  both  the  nature  of  this  work  and  the  scarcity  of  relevant  studies  in  the international business literature an exploratory analysis based on both questionnaires and indepth structured interviews has been developed to answer the abovementioned research questions. In order to select key decision makers with high business knowledge a preliminary online questionnaire with a Computer Assisted Web Interviewing (CAWI) was sent to a sample of 370 digital IoT SMEs operating in Italy  among  different  industries.  The  firm  in  the  sample  were  randomly  selected  through  specific websites which include a list of digital IoT SMEs firms operating in the IoT domain (e.g. www.iotexpo.it www.iotitaly.net  www.net2web.it).  The  first  round  of  emails  was  sent  out  in  September  2016  with  a single followup in October obtaining 22 valid questionnaires which constituted the guidelines for the indepth interviews. The questionnaire contains questions on specific aspects of the internationalization process  of  digital  IoT  SMEs.  The  data  collected  were  then  triangulated  with  additional  primary  and secondary  information  (e.g.  consulting  and  financial  reports  press  releases  industry  reports  trade journal  articles  process  documentation  and  others)  to  increase  the  reliability  and  validity  of  the research. This study has considered 22 digital IoT Italian SMEs operating among different industries. The  final  empirical  data  were  collected  in  2017  via  facetoface  and  telephone  interviews  with  key company decision makers (CEOs chief technology officers top management representatives and IoT products/services  manager).  The  average  interview   s  time  has  been  about  one  hour.    The  analysis highlights the following exploratory findings 1) 50% of the Italian digital IoT firms in the sample is active in exploring new foreign business opportunities through the following internationalization strategies export (36%) joint ventures (36%) licensing (18%) and Foreign Direct Investment (FDI) (10%) mainly in  Germany  Spain  United  Kingdom  and  United  State.  In  particular  36%  of  them  approach  new international  markets  to  acquire     business  benefits     while  27%  are  looking  for  markets  with     high  26\\t \\t ISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS perspective of growth    19% for    risk diversification    and 9% for taking competitive advantages. The main obstacles to the international expansion for this firms    are the lack of financial resources (27%) the  difficulty  in  the     customers     identification     (18%)  the  difficulty  in  the  identification  of  the  best distribution channel (18%) and both administrative and legal barriers (10%); 2) 73% of digital IoT firms have a percentage of foreign sales in the range 0%  25% while 18% of them between 26%  50% and 9% of them in the range 51% 75%;  and 3) before approaching international markets digital IoT SMEs need  to  be  stable  and  competitive  in  the  domestic  market.  Subsequently  they  could  start  a  slow internationalization process.  On the other hand the remaining 50% of firms in the sample do business only in the domestic market due to the following reasons lack of resources and competences (30%) low  knowledge  of  the  local  market  (30%)  products  adaptation  problems  (20%)  lack  of  financial resources (10%) and low knowledge of the new foreign market that should be explored (10%). However 100%  of  the  firms  studied  at  same  point  in  the  future  is  expecting  to  start  and/or  empower  the international expansion in the future in order to be competitive in global markets. This study despite its qualitative nature seeks to introduce a new domain of exploration (the socalled IoT paradigm) in the international business literature. In particular the Italian digital IoT firms studied seem to follow the traditional internationalization models in exploring new foreign opportunities without generating new paradigms  of  internationalization.  Future  research  should  empirically  show  the  internationalization process of this new typology of firms by seeking to answer questions such as At which point in time internationalization should be included in the expansion plan of the IoT SMEs? Does internationalization require rethinking the overall business strategy be including from early stage or adapting at any point in time?

Undoubtedly the digitization and Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) have created the conditions  for  small  and  medium  sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  and  international  new  ventures  (INVs)  to overcome their liabilities of smallness and newness and to compete with large companies and MNEs in  the  international  marketplace.  Within  this  framework  a  new  set  of  innovations  relates  to  the  socalled  Industry  4.0.  Industry  4.0  (I4.0)  represents  a  group  of  advanced  information  technologies presenting  different  features  functions  and  applications  which  may  be  implemented  in  different activities  within  the  companies.  I4.0  includes  big  data  and  analytics  robots  and  cobots  simulation horizontal  and  vertical  integration  Industrial  Internet  of  Things  (IIoT)  cybersecurity  cloud  additive manufacturing and augmented reality. These technologies are supposed to boost the productivity of manufacturing  production  and  the  competitiveness  of  companies  opening  the  way  for  a  new  era  of    Manufacturing Renaissance    (Mosconi 2015). Beyond this the adoption of I4.0 technologies might in certain  industries  strengthen  the  role  of  SMEs  within  the  global  value  chains  (GVCs)  (Alc  cer  et  al. 2016). For instance Laplume et al. (2016) suggested that 3d printing may change the role of MNEs as the  primary  coordinators  of  GVCs  underlining  that  SMEs  could  gain  new  competitive  advantages  by adopting this application e.g. in production. So far few conceptual articles have proposed reflections on the influence of I4.0 technologies mainly in terms of the restructuring of GVCs (Rehnberg & Ponte 2017) ownership (O) localization (L) and internationalization (I) advantages (Alc  cer et al. 2016; Strange & Zucchella 2017) and on the international configuration of companies (Rezk et al. 2016). However most of  the  studies  are  still  conceptual  and  consider  mainly  large  companies  such  as  MNEs.  But  the spreading of ICTs has led the incremental involvement of a variety of actors with I4.0 including SMEs which certainly encounter challenges and consequences during the implementation or development of these  technologies  (Kleindienst  &  Ramsauer  2016).    All  this  considered  further  research  should investigate the influence of I4.0 on SMEs and INVs from an IB perspective particularly there is a gap of empirical research. We developed a multiple case study approach to give a contribution in this direction by  investigating  the  influence  of  I4.0  technologies  on  the  competitiveness  of  SMEs  within  an international  context.  Through  a  purposive  sampling  design  we  selected  16  Italian  manufacturing exporting SMEs from the metals and machinery sector which had already implemented one or more I4.0  applications.  Three  companies  are  INVs  (less  than  15  years  old)  while  the  rest  of  them  are established incremental exporters. In this sample some companies are regionally oriented selling mostly in their home continent while others export globally even in distant countries (Asia America and Australasia). The exploratory qualitative analysis has revealed some preliminary findings leading to the identification of two groups of companies and opening some reflections in terms of international business. The first group includes half of the interviewed companies which have adopted one or more I4.0 technologies with two goals incrementing the efficiency of their plants in the home country and offering more services to their customers. For instance to the first purpose companies have adopted robots  for  more  than  10  years  and  have  also  invested  to  realize  the  vertical  integration  within  the company (with various degrees of implementation). These technologies reduced the operating costs allowing  them  to  remain  competitive  with  their  competitors  located  in  East  Europe  or  in  distant emerging  markets  (e.g.  China  India)  despite  their  mediumhigh  positioning.  Moreover  other technologies such as e.g. simulation have been used to support the design and engineering phases on the  one  hand  and  to  offer  postsales  assistance  on  the  other  hand.  These  services  were  used  to strengthen  the  relationship  with  the  customers.  Along  this  line  pushed  by  big  clients  few  of  these companies have also been developing horizontal integration systems. Horizontal integration required transparency between the client and its suppliers but then strengthens the relationship between them and increases the mutual interdependence in line with Rezk et al. (2016). Consequently SMEs tend to reduce the number of their customers focusing their activities regionally in order to better serve the few important clients with whom they implemented integration (generally MNEs). The second group of SMEs have developed smart and/or connected products (Porter & Heppelman 2014). In this group the competitive advantage is mainly related to flexibility problem solving skills and the products    quality.  28\\t \\t ISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS Since the establishment year the INVs have specifically committed their efforts to create smart and/or connected products with a customeroriented logic from the real beginning. Moreover they started early thinking about developing big data analytics and tend to be more oriented towards a servitization logic (VendrellHerrero et al. 2017). In contrast for the remaining 5 companies connected products were the result of a natural evolving process of continuous investments into innovation and technology. Here again the best customers are large MNEs and the competitive advantage stems from building a tight relationship with them over the years. To sum up consistent with the limited amount of resources available we have observed a selective investment in I4.0 technologies with different results in terms of  international  competitiveness.  On  the  one  hand  technologies  are  the  means  to  obtain  higher efficiency that could be spent against international competitors even from low cost countries and to redirect some resources from production to service activities. On the other hand I4.0 can be considered an end to enlarge the market portfolio as it involves product innovation (and even the business model innovation)  through  smart  products  and  servitization  in  line  with  the  positive  relationship  between innovation and exporting (Golovko & Valentini 2011).

Airbnb  a  digital  marketplace  which  matches  accommodation providers with consumers has emerged as the industry leader in platform home sharing with more than 4 million listings reported in 2017. The shortterm rental tech unicorn claims that notions of trust community  and  increasing  social  awarenesstenets  of  the  sharing  economyare  driving  the unprecedented growth of this new and largely unregulated sector worldwide (Codagnone & Martens 2016; Sundararajan 2016).  This research however considers the term    sharing    to be a misnomer and seeks to classify Airbnb hosts as micro entrepreneurs based on their market behavior in the tourism accommodation sector (Eckhardt & Bardhi 2015). As such Airbnb listings may be considered in the purview of small local businesses and the hosts themselves as social media marketers and hospitality providers. Therein they occupy a very unique space in the tourism market.   The focus of this research is Jeju Island South Korea due to its status as a premiere tourism destination. Also unlike in the capital city of Seoul it is legally permitted to operate home sharing businesses (Yoon 2016). Tourism is the mainstay of Jeju   s economy with over 15 million tourists annually visiting this island of 660000 residents (Adedoyin  2017).  This for entrepreneuriallyminded individuals to start letting residential properties as vacation rentals.  localtotourist  ratio  provides  a  healthy  business  environment Objectives The purpose of this study was to empirically define the presence of platform home sharing on Jeju Island and to analyze consumers    revealed preferences in this market to see if platform home sharing is driven by economic or socialexperiential considerations (Bray 2006). Thereafter the research analyzed the most  predictive  determinants  of  demand  in  order  to  establish  criteria  for  effective  small  tourism accommodation business models.   Method A significant challenge surrounding research of Airbnb is how to obtain market data. Generally the privatelyowned  platform  does  not  release  its  data  in  analytical  form  or  open  its  application programming interface (API) for researchers to make requests. Therefore in order to obtain a reliable dataset  innovative  web  scraping  and  data  mining  techniques  were  instrumental  in  this  research. Afterwards  multivariate  regression  analyses  were  employed  to  estimate  the  most  important determinants of demand in platform home sharing businesses in the local context (Chen 2003; Chung et al. 2004; Perez et al. 2005). To this end classification and regression trees were useful in accounting for the nonlinearity of the data and were able to further explore the relationships between property listing characteristics and the number of reviews (a proxy for property rental rates) as the dependent variable (Loh 2008; Sutton 2004).   Results The results show platform home sharing on Jeju Island is widespread across the entire island and that consumers  are  most  strongly  motivated  by  lower  costs  and  entire  properties  rather  than  shared spaces. Among the 31 types of property listings    houses    priced below 105 Euro per night were more likely to be rented than any other type. Shared rooms were revealed as least preferred among the guests with less than 10% of the total listings. Entire homes however occupied more than 50% of the entire population  in  terms  of  listings  and  60%  of  the  number  of  reviews.  Location  is  a  common  factor associated  with  demand  models  and  this  is  further  supported  in  this  research  as  areas  with  higher concentration  coordinated  with  popular  tourist  sites.  Furthermore  the  host  speaking  additional languages to Korean (especially English and Russian) was perceived as an asset in terms of the number of  reviews.    Further  inferential  analysis  on  hosts  who  list  multiple  properties  as  well  as  sensitivity analyses on the efficacy of satisfaction as a determinant of demand were performed. Hosts who list multiple  properties  did  not  directly  receive  a  higher  average  number  of  reviews;  they  did  however receive  a  lower  overall  level  of  satisfaction.  This  dropin  performance  is  indicative  of  the  emerging market status of these micro entrepreneurs whose business and hospitality management skills are  30\\t \\t ISME 2018 PROCEEDINGS still developing. Notwithstanding it is widely accepted that satisfaction levels on Airbnb are positively skewed and any variance from 5/5 stars merits consideration (Zervas 2015; Zervas Proserpio & Byers 2017).  Yet  given  the  importance  of  reputation  and  management  in  peertopeer  markets  level  of satisfaction for a listing is still a useful metric for analysis.     Discussion and Conclusion The results of this research indicate that the new market of platform home sharing on Jeju Island is driven  by  traditional  economic  forces  of  maximizing  satisfaction  and  minimizing  cost  and  not  the alternative social and or experiential collaborative consumption motivations commonly associated with the  sharing  economy.  Moreover  home  sharing  entrepreneurs  are  successfully  operating  in  a  field dominated by large hotels resorts and a number of small pensions accessible only to Koreanspeaking tourists. As the presence of platform home sharing on Jeju island continues to grow to nearly 7000 active  listings  policy  makers  hoteliers  and  emerging  micro  entrepreneurs  stand  to  benefit  from understanding  the  combination  of  attributes  and  pricing  levels  resulting  in  the  highest  number  of reviews (Bellin 2017). In the future home sharing may expand to a diverse micro entrepreneurship ecosystem selling not only accommodation but also local tourism experiences and activities. In this regard the home could become a multifunctional tourism experience provider under the pretense of the ubiquitous sharing economy but in practice as a thriving twosided market.
