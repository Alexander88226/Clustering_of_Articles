If  correctly  harnessed  these  emerging  technologies  have  the  potential  to  assist economies  in  creating  new  efficiencies  boosting  productivity  and  enhancing  international trade.ICTSD   s  Inclusive  Economic  Transformation  Programme  aims  to  empower  least  developed countries  (LDCs)  across  the  IndoPacific  region  to  take  advantage  of  the  opportunities  and mitigate  the  risks  posed  by  disruptive  technologies.  This  paper  falls  within  that  project  and is  part  of  a  series  of  publications  that  examine  the  potential  of  ecommerce  and  disruptive technologies to advance sustainable development objectives.This paper by ChingFu Lin of National Tsing Hua University Taiwan and HanWei Liu of Monash University Australia explores the scope for disruptive technologies to contribute to sustainable development. Though  the  term  was  coined  years  ago  today  technologies  such  as  blockchain and artificial intelligence are growing rapidly and promising to transform international trade in  a  way  that  will  truly  disrupt  conventional  understandings  of  the  trade  and  development relationship.  The  authors  focus  in  on  implications  for  Cambodia  Lao  PDR  Myanmar  and Vietnam  highlighting  several  ways  in  which  these  technologies  could  be  deployed.  From protecting  property  rights  facilitating  access  to  credit  to  fostering  innovative  food  supply chain management the applications are clear. From  a  policy  perspective  the  pervasiveness  of  the  digital  divide       in  which  many  of  their citizens  struggle  to  get  electricity  and  internet  access       is  a  stubborn  obstacle  to  overcome before disruptive technologies can be put to use in lowerincome countries. The authors propose investments  in  related  infrastructure  to  foster  the  inclusive  use  of  disruptive  technologies. Interestingly they shed light on a whole set of adaptable policy frameworks that can be used to support fastmoving technological areas such as these. Finally the paper briefly explores the new moral and legal questions posed by these technologies. We  hope  this  research  paper  will  help  inform  the  decisions  of  policymakers  businesses  and relevant stakeholders engaged in international trade as they work to advance the United Nations Sustainable Development Goals.Ricardo Mel  ndezOrtiz Chief Executive ICTSDInclusive Economic Transformation viEXECUTIVE SUMMARYClosing the development gap among the Member States of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) in particular that between Cambodia Lao PDR Myanmar and Vietnam (CLMV) and the others has been one of the top agenda items for deeper integration and sustainable development in the region. The CLMV countries have gradually lifted millions of people out of poverty and reduced the poverty rate from 66 percent of the population in 1990 to 18 percent in  2015  thanks  to  decades  of  regional  efforts  like  the  Initiative  for ASEAN  Integration  (IAI). Nevertheless various challenges have persisted despite this remarkable progress towards the Millennium Development Goals set forth by the United Nations Development Programme. Among others  one  of  the  most  critical  tasks  facing  CLMV  is  how  to  effectively  leverage  and  move themselves  a  long  way  down  the  road  to  harness  the  rise  of     disruptive  technologies     and advance towards sustainable development amid the trend of the    Fourth Industrial Revolution   .Southeast Asia as much as the rest of the world is witnessing a historical moment of the    Fourth Industrial Revolution        a collective term that describes how a diverse but interrelated array of    disruptive technologies    is fundamentally transforming how we live work and connect to one another with a speed breadth degree and complexity unprecedented in human history.    Disruptive  technologies          a  term  popularized  by  Clayton  Christensen  and  Joseph  Bower in  the  1990s       promise  to  offer  innovative  sources  of  value  and  opportunities  not  available previously. While disruptive technologies may outperform earlier ones by providing products and services that are cheaper simpler or more convenient than their conventional counterparts they also pose governance challenges to existing legal and policy frameworks. Among others blockchain and artificial intelligence (AI) have been highlighted by the World Economic Forum as  key  enablers  that  will  reconfigure  the  existing  models  of  social  economic  and  political dimensions of our time. As analyzed in detail by this paper blockchain and AIbased tools and innovations have been increasingly implemented in developing and developed worlds and will soon penetrate the global market. The underlying benefits and risks of various applications of the  abovementioned  two  types  of  disruptive  technologies  are  further  assessed  specifically through case studies like the use of blockchain to address the traceability problems for food and agricultural products microfinance and fintech to support SMEs and AI in transforming the provision of goods and services.  For instance AI and blockchain technologies when exploited appropriately have strong potentials to reinvent services and manufacturing sectors innovate food safety and supply chain management facilitate trade through banking innovation improve participation and access of disadvantaged groups and fostering business development through protecting property rights.  As technologies continue to mature the interplay of blockchain and AI has been expanding and mutually reinforcing in wide practical operations and pose crucial questions to policymakers. For instance how can CLMV strategize and unfold the potential of these disruptive technologies to bring their economic growth and social welfare to the next level? What types of regulatory or policy actions are available and how can one identify optimal institutional designs for different contexts?  How  can  CLMV  countries  align  their  sustainable  development  plans  with  disruptive technologies?In the age of AI and blockchain it is imperative to assist the ASEAN Member States in particular CLMV countries in closing the development gap among themselves and with the others. One critical task as pointed out by this paper is to explore optimal policy strategies to efficiently and  effectively  harness  the  rise  of  disruptive  technologies  leverage  technological  advances to improve their existing positions in the global value chain and move a long way down the road  to  sustainable  development.  By  consolidating  the  critical  observations  of  benefits  and  viirisks of various disruptive technology applications this paper offers possible policy strategies in the context of the emerging megaregionalism     such as ensuring adequate accountability transparency and fairness engaging technologically informed and adaptive regulatory reforms and  improving  infrastructure  and  human  capital  to  capture  datadriven  opportunities       that may help achieve the aim of optimizing economic growth and sustainable development for the people of Cambodia Lao PDR Myanmar and Vietnam.Inclusive Economic Transformation  1.  INTRODUCTIONClosing  the  development  gap  among  the member states of the Association of Southeast Asian  Nations  (ASEAN)  in  particular  that between  Cambodia  Lao  PDR  Myanmar  and Vietnam  (CLMV)  and  the  others  has  been one  of  the  top  agenda  items  for  deeper integration  and  sustainable  development  in the region. The CLMV countries have gradually lifted  millions  of  people  out  of  poverty  and reduced the poverty rate from 66 percent of the population in 1990 to 18 percent in 2015 thanks to decades of regional efforts such as the Initiative for ASEAN Integration (IAI) (ASEAN 2017).  Nevertheless  various  challenges  have persisted  despite  this  remarkable  progress towards  sustainable  development.  Among such challenges one of the most critical tasks facing  CLMV  is  how  to  effectively  harness the  rise  of     disruptive  technologies     and move  themselves  a  long  way  down  the  road to  sustainable  development  amid  the  trend of the    Fourth Industrial Revolution    (Schwab 2015).Southeast  Asia  as  much  as  the  rest  of  the world  is  witnessing  the  historical  moment of  the     Fourth  Industrial  Revolution          a collective  term  that  describes  how     the  way we  live  work  and  relate  to  one  another    is  being  transformed  fundamentally  with enormous     scale  scope  and  complexity    unprecedented  in  human  history  (Schwab 2015).  Central  to  this  Revolution is  the emergence and rapid evolution of    disruptive technologies          a  term  popularized  by Clayton Christensen and Joseph Bower in the 1990s       which  promise  to  offer  innovative sources  of  value  and  opportunities  not available  previously  (Christensen  and  Bower 1996).  While  disruptive  technologies  may outperform earlier ones by providing products and  services  that  are  cheaper  simpler  or more  convenient  than  their  conventional counterparts  (Christensen  1997)  they  also pose  governance  challenges to  existing legal  and  policy  frameworks.  Among  recent 1technological  megatrends scientific  and intelligence  (AI) blockchain  and  artificial have  been  identified  by  the  World  Economic Forum  as  key  enablers  that  will  reconfigure the social economic and political dimensions of  our  time  (WEF  2015).  From  the  view  of sustainable development AI may help achieve economic growth and reduce inequalities.ledger technologies Distributed (DLTs colloquially known as blockchain) as the name suggests  are  built  upon  an  interdependent chain  of  secured  blocks  that  brings  together existing technologies like cryptography peertopeer  networks  and  consensus  protocols (De Filippi and Wright 2018 2). Depending on the  level  of  openness  and  decentralization blockchains  can  be  broken  down  into  two types     permissioned     and     permissionless   .1 The  former  involves  a  central  authority  and are  not  open  for  everyone.  Permissionless blockchains  by  contrast  have  no  central authority  and  are  collectively  managed  by various  nodes  spread  across  the  globe  with each  node  having  the  same  copy  of  the  data based  on  prescribed  software  protocols.  The decentralized feature  makes  blockchains tamperproof  so  that  people  can  interact  in a  transparent  and  nonrepudiable  manner. As  blockchains  can  be  deployed  by  public private or hybrid actors an increasing number of corporations and governments have applied different types of blockchains to serve various functions.  Cryptocurrency  digital  identity real  property  registration  the  InternetofThings  (IoT)  smart  contracts  traceability mechanisms  and  supply  chain  management are  just  a  few  notable  blockchainbased applications. AI  on  the  other  hand  is  an  umbrella  term that blends a range of techniques such as data analysis machine learning and deep learning and  can  be  roughly  divided  into  two  types    strong  AI     and     weak  AI   .  The  former  also known  as     artificial  general  intelligence    1  There are two other types hybrid blockchains and distributed ledgers which are based on directed acyclic graphs (DAGs) (Ferrarini et al. 2017 45). Inclusive Economic Transformation 2(AGI)  refers  to  systems  capable  of  virtually every  intelligent  action  while  the  latter  is often  crafted  for  a  specific  task  and  is  thus referred to as    narrow AI    (Copeland 2000). AI has been applied across many novel contexts like  transportation  (e.g.  Google  selfdriving cars)  banking  (e.g.  Merrill  Edge  Guided Investing  a  roboadviser)  law  enforcement (e.g.  Traffic  Jam  a  tool  combating  human trafficking)  legal  practice  (e.g.  LawGeex a  contract  review  and  management  system) and  healthcare  (e.g.  IBM  Watson)  though most of these remain weak AI. increasingly implemented Blockchain and AIbased tools and innovations have  been in developing and developed worlds and will soon penetrate the global market. Furthermore as technologies continue to mature the interplay of  blockchains  and  AI  has  been  expanding and  mutually  reinforcing  in  wide  practical operations. In light of such developments how can  CLMV  strategize  and  unfold  the  potential of these disruptive technologies to bring their economic  growth  and  social  welfare  to  the next level? What types of regulatory or policy actions are available and how can one identify optimal institutional  designs  for  different contexts?  How  can  CLMV  countries  align  their sustainable development plans with disruptive technologies?  To  address  these  issues  the rest  of  this  paper  proceeds  as  follows. Section  2  begins  by  identifying  some  salient contributions  of  disruptive  technologies  to economic growth and sustainable development in the developing world. We further point out important ramifications that not only highlight how  certain  institutions  or  governments  have reinvented  their  governance  mode  as  public and private institutions but also shed light on potentially bigger roles disruptive technologies can  play  for  most  of  the  developing  world      including  CLMV  countries.  On  this  basis  we will  then  address  CLMVspecific  implications by  contextualizing  their  political  social  and economic  underpinnings  and  examining  the opportunities  and  challenges  in  three  areas financing food safety and supply chain control and the manufacturing sector. Our observations in section 2 lead us to take one step further to map  the  possible  policy  strategies  that  CLMV countries  may  leverage  in  section  3  along four dimensions legal technical human and institutional. Section 4 concludes. 32.  PUTTING  DISRUPTIVE  TECHNOLOGIES  INTO  PRACTICE  LAYERS OF IMPLICATIONS FOR SOUTHEAST ASIAThe  farreaching  ramifications  of  blockchains and  AI  have  been  documented  in  media literature and political arenas in recent years. While  much  of  the  focus  is  centered  on  the implications  for  the  developed  economies blockchains  and  AI  will  similarly  reshape  the landscape  of  the  developing  world.  Due  to space  constraints  we  more  closely  examine the  role  of  disruptive  technologies  for  five issues  land  registry  identity  trade  finance food  safety  and  supply  chain  management and  manufacturing.  These  areas  are  of  clear relevance  to  the  sustainable  development  of the  Global  South.  As  discussed  below  each case  demonstrates  the  potential  benefits to  the  developing  world  and  at  the  same time  underscores facing policymakers.the  challenges 2.1  Fostering Business Development by Protecting Property RightsA nation   s economic prosperity is often premised on  a  modest  legal  infrastructure  protecting property  and  contract  rights  (Posner  1998). Valid  property  rights  are  the  building  blocks for  investment  productivity  and  economic growth.  Studies  indicate  that  a  clear  and effective delineation of property rights can not only put owners in a better position of getting credit from banks but also offers incentives for foreign investors. More broadly a credible and uptodate land administration system can help all  parties  involved       governments  financial institutions buyers and sellers     to track the deal correctly appraise the value of property for  various  purposes  (e.g.  taxation)  and reduce  transaction  costs  (World  Bank  2018a). While  this  looks  rather  promising  not  every developing country maintains an adequate land registry  which  makes  secured  transactions more  pricey  and  problematic  (Mendes  2018). Rampant  bribery  and  corruption  add  further complexity  to  this  context.  In  Ghana  for instance  landrelated  matters  remain  the major source of disputes accounting for some 70 percent of Ghanaian court cases (Berryhill et al. 2018). This is in large part due to the lack of  effective  land  registry.  Studies  show  that traditionally the average time to confirm land ownership and realtime land information from the  government  was  about  one  year  and  one month respectively. To resolve this problem the  Ghana  government  relied  on  Bitland  the Ethereumbased  digital invented by  BenBen  to  overhaul  the  system.  Bitland was  able  to  reduce  the  abovementioned processing  time  to  three  months  and  three days respectively and enhanced transparency can  mitigate  concerns  about  property  fraud and  corruption  thereby  increasing  efficiency gains (Kshetri and Voas 2018). registry Similar initiatives can be found in the rest of the developing world like Honduras India and Georgia (Oprunenco and Akmeemana 2018; Shin 2017). Honduras for instance teamed up with a  Texasbased  startup  Factom  to  move  its land registry onto blockchain. The underlying purpose is to rebuild people   s trust in the land administration scheme. For decades Honduras has struggled with land conflicts a majority of its lands are unregistered and the expansion of  mining  and  energy  projects  fueled  landrelated  violence  (Chandran  2017).  Plus  it  is common to see government officials alter the titles for their own interests or in exchange for bribes (Maxim 2015).The  above  cases  have  lessons  for  Southeast Asia  including  CLMV  countries.  As  per  the most  recent  Doing  Business  Report  issued by  the  World  Bank  for  instance  Cambodia Laos  and  Myanmar  still  use  paperbased systems to keep the majority of title or deed records  in  their  largest  business  cities  and lack  electronic  means  to  record  boundaries check  plans  or  provide  cadastral  information (World  Bank  2018a).  While  Vietnam  and  Laos have  begun  to  use  electronic  databases  to check  the  rights  attached  to  properties neither  Cambodia  nor  Myanmar  offers  such provisions.  Moreover  transfer  of  titles  can also involve extra paperwork for the purpose Inclusive Economic Transformation 4of publicity. In Myanmar for instance parties to  the  transactions  are  required  to  as  part of  the  registration  process  announce  their agreement  in  one  of  the  state  newspapers to allow those with claims to the property at least two weeks (though typically one month) to  come  forward  before  the  registration  can be finalized. Overall the index score of CLMV countries  in  terms  of  quality  of  property registration  are  Cambodia  (7.5);  Laos  (10.5); Myanmar  (5.5);  and  Vietnam  (14.0)  which are  all  below  the  average  score  of  East  Asia and the Pacific Area (15.8). This suggests that CLMV  countries  can  tap  into  the  potential of  disruptive  technologies  by  upgrading  the traditional  paperbased  land  administration systems  to  blockchainbased  ones.  Some industry stakeholders in Vietnam for instance have  suggested  blockchain  as  an  innovative way  to  boost  the  real  property  market  (Viet Nam  News  2018).  However  much  remains  to be done before these reforms can take place with the political climate and special interests as important hurdles.2.2  Improving Participation and Access  of Disadvantaged Groups secure  and Another  major  impediment  to  sustainable development is the lack of identity documents. An     inclusive trustworthy identification system    that ensures individuals    access  to     rights  services  and  the  formal economy     is  identified  as  a  key  component of  the  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (World Bank  2018b).  Yet  evidence  reveals  that  as  of 2017 there were still around 1.1 billion people lacking official identity documents and more than  half  of  them  lived  in  lowermiddleincome economies (Desai et al. 2017). People without appropriate documents may be denied access to a range of rights and services such as  finance  education  health  legal  redress and  social  benefits.  Such  an     identification gap     can  inhibit  disadvantaged  groups  from participating in social economic and political life.  This  problem  can  be  exacerbated  in  the context of asylumseekers and refugees where most of them are forced to leave their homes without  verifiable  documents.  While  there individuals from  obtaining are efforts to moderate these concerns some of the approaches that are implemented in a more  formalized  manner  may  instead  restrict certain legal documents. Disruptive technologies appear to be a promising alternative to fix this problem. Beginning in 2017 for instance the World Food Programme  (WFP)  of  the  UN  launched  the    Building  Block     program.  Using  irisscanning technologies  and  blockchains  this  program helped  Syrian  refugees  verify  their  identities and directly deduct what they spent from the amount  of  aid  they  received  from  the  WFP (Bacchi  2017).  The  benefit  of  this  program  is salient  transforming  paperbased  documents into  blockchainenabled  identity  can  on  one hand  better  protect  refugees  because  their identities  remain  immutable  and  cannot  be lost  or  destroyed  and  on  the  other  enable the WFP to make cash transfers in an efficient secure and costeffective way by undercutting the role of middlemen while tracking the fund flow (WFP 2018; Jafrey 2018). to technology Noting that blockchains can promote transparency  and  reduce  fraud  and  corruption charity  organizations  have  also  applied  this disruptive their  donation platforms.  The     Ant  Love     launched  by  Ant Financial  an  affiliate  of  China   s  Alibaba  is one  prime  example  that  empowers  people  to track their donations with a view to improving the  accountability  of  Chinese  philanthropic organizations  (Chen  2016).  Using  blockchain technologies in solving identity issues matters to Southeast Asia a region hosting more than a  million  refugees  and  stateless  people  and some  51000  asylumseekers  in  2017  (UNHCR 2017).  Its  significance  can  be  best  illustrated by the Rohingya crisis in which a large number of  Rohingya  refugees  fled  from  Myanmar  to Bangladesh  and  Malaysia.  According  to  one source  94  percent  of  Rohingya  refugees  are not  in  possession  of  documentation  of  any kind  while  another  5  percent  hold  the  socalled     White  Cards          a  temporary  noncitizenship document     deemed invalid by the Myanmar government in 2015 (Rohingya Survey 2017). With the aid of UNHCR the Bangladesh government  set  up  biometric  registration  5to  help identify  the  refugees  properly. Considering  the  ramifications  of  their  data being controlled by a centralized authority and the  longterm  development  of  the  Rohingya community  there  has  been  a  call  for  the creation of a    Rohingya Project    to empower the stateless and financially excluded Rohingya people through a more secure and transparent blockchain system (Rohingya Survey 2017).ASEAN       Indonesia  Malaysia  the  Philippines Singapore and Thailand     it is personal funds rather  than  bank  loans  which  serve  as  a primary source of financing (Tan and Ng 2015 11). Although there are no relevant data about the  CLMV  in  this  regard  all  but  Vietnam  are underperforming  as  compared  to  the  other ASEAN counterparts in terms of getting credit generally. 2.3  Facilitating Trade through  Banking InnovationSustainable  development  rests  on  a  robust global  trading  system.  International  trade  in turn  is  underpinned  by  adequate  financing credit  and  credit  insurance  provisions  to help  exporters  and  importers  in  different jurisdictions  to  receive  payments  mitigate risks  and  expand  operations.  Despite  its significance  however  trade finance  has remained  a  major  impediment  for  small  and medium enterprises (SMEs) to engage in global trade. Unlike larger firms SMEs typically lack a  financial  track  record  sufficient  skills  and knowledge  and  collateral  to  secure  credit facilities  from  financial institutions.  Such concerns  are  particularly  true  for  SMEs  in lowerincome  economies  who  have  relatively small  banking  industries  that  are  not  of interest  to  global  financial  institutions  (WTO 2016). Another issue related to SMEs access to trade finance is asymmetry of information in crossborder transactions. It is not necessarily the  case  that  financial  institutions  will  have information  on  whether  the  applicant  has already received financing based on the same invoice;  besides  double  financing  it  is  not uncommon  to  see  fake  invoices.  These  issues have  been  pervasive  in  parts  of  Asia  adding further complexity to trade finance.A  recent  survey  by  the  Asian  Development Bank (ADB) suggests that 74 percent of SMEs    requests  for  trade  financing  were  rejected while  the  rejection  rate  was  only  26  percent for multinational enterprises (MNEs) and large companies (Di Caprio et al 2017 3). There is no exception  for  ASEAN  another  report  reveals that for SMEs in the five original members of Both  private  and  public  sectors  in  Southeast Asia  have  begun  to  improve  SME   s  access  to bank lending. Some governments like Thailand seek to help SMEs provide adequate collateral as required for their transactions by enacting a Business Collateral Act (Ferrarini et al. 2017). Others  such  as  the  Philippines  and  Malaysia have introduced programs to help SMEs secure credit by setting credit volume targets for SMEs as a mandatory requirement a credit guarantee program or comprehensive credit information regarding SMEs (ADB 2014 68). More recently disruptive  technology  seems  to  be  another promising  solution  to  streamline  finance.  In 2017 for instance HSBC and Bank of America teamed  up  with Infocomm  Development Authority  of  Singapore  to  improve  the  letter of credit transaction processes via blockchain technologies  (Suominen  2018  9).  Likewise in  Thailand  a  group  of  banks  launched  the    Thailand  Blockchain  Community  Initiative    to  create  a  blockchainbased  platform  to facilitate  the  use  of  letters  of  guarantee (Ono  2018a)  which  could  help  banks  reduce overhead and infrastructure costs by US$1520 billion annually through 2022 and reduce errors and inconsistencies (Suonminen 2018 33). While the CLMV have not yet rolled out similar initiatives  these  countries  may  follow  suit at  some  point.  In  Cambodia  for  instance the  National  Bank  of  Cambodia  is  reportedly engaging  with  a  Tokyobased financial technology startup to create a blockchainbased payment system to offer people a secure costeffective  method  of  money  transfer  (Nikkei 2017).  This  would  help  this  nation  remove the impediments to better banking services     low  quality  staff  ATM  accessibility  and  poor digital capacities (Kotoski 2016a). Stakeholders Inclusive Economic Transformation 6in  Vietnam   s  banking  industry  seem  keen to  tap  blockchain  technologies  to  serve  its massive underbanked population (Hynes 2018). Blockchain  technologies  if  adopted  in  the banking system of CLMV countries can not only support SMEs but also facilitate labor mobility in  this  region.  According  to  the  International Labour Organization (ILO) for instance there are  around  400000  Vietnamese  workers  now present in more than 40 countries worldwide creating  annual  inflows  of  remittances  of some  US$2  billion  in  recent  years  (ILO  no date). Rebuilding the payment system through blockchains  could  enable  migrant  workers  to move  their  money  back  home  without  the middleman. In a way this may help the Mode 4 trade of CLMV countries under the framework of the General Agreement on Trade in Services (GATS) of the WTO.2.4  Innovating Food Safety and  Supply Chain Management industry The  agrifood is  of  paramount importance  to  the  economy  in  Southeast Asia.  For  example  in  2014  the  agricultural and  fisheries  sectors  accounted  for  about  51 percent of GDP and 30 percent of employment in  in  Cambodia  42  percent  of  GDP  and  10 percent  of  employment  in  Thailand  and  47 percent of GDP and 18 percent of employment in  Vietnam  (OECDFAO  2017).  Among  all  the business actors in ASEAN over 95 percent are SMEs which play a critical role in the region   s economic growth and sustainable development (ACCA  2016;  Iqbal  and  Rahman  2015).  As  the production  distribution  and  consumption of  food  has  become  globalized  against  the background  of  trade  liberalization  in  recent decades  the  Southeast  Asian  countries  are not  immune  from  regulatory  challenges  in relation  to  domestic  and  crossborder  issues of  food  safety  and  quality  trade  facilitation and supply  chain  management  product standard  compliance  and  market  access  and food fraud and fair competition. Nevertheless governments and enterprises especially those in CLMV countries may have at their disposal limited financial resources  or  technical  capacity  to  respond infrastructural support to  these  complex  challenges  at  the  local regional and global levels.  (e.g.  machine learning  algorithms Blockchains  and  AI  among  other  disruptive technologies may be able to help CLMV respond to  such  challenges  in  various  ways.    In  some cases  AI  technologies  are  being  developed and applied in both developed and developing countries  to  increase  farmland  management and  productivity learning algorithms  combined  with  drone  technology to  efficiently  plant  and  cultivate  crops)  and reduce  sanitary  and  phytosanitary  diseases (e.g.  machine image classification  and  animal  facial  recognition to  speedily  identify  unhealthy  animals  and plants)  (Jagannathan  2018).  In  other  cases blockchains have effectively transformed how we  conventionally  think  about  food  safety certification  and  traceability.  For  instance IBM  has  been  collaborating  with  certain major  retailers  (such  as  Walmart  which  has required its upstream suppliers of leafy greens to comply with a new standard by September 2019)  to  use  the  cloudbased  IBM  Food  Trust platform  to     blockchainize     the  food  supply chain  (Wolfson  2018;  Ganne  2018  79).  The daytoday  management  of  food  production and  distribution  along  the  global  value  chain (especially for players in the developing world) is  by  and  large  manual  and  paperbased  and therefore a laborintense and timeconsuming endeavor. The IBM Food Trust platform places a physical supply chain on its virtual blockchain connecting  all  participants  globally  (each represents a node) to upload their data to the system and generate a transparent traceable immutable  and  shared  record  of  production details quality specifications and origin facts sustainability  and  fair  trade  certifications and  storage logistics information (IBM Food Trust no date). The use of blockchain cuts off intermediaries and third parties  facilitates  realtime  transparency and  pinpoint  traceability  and  enables  much faster  reactions in  cases  of  food  safety outbreaks     thereby considerably reducing the cost of transactions and recall as well as the likelihood and scale of damage.  In addition to the benefits for better food safety governance import/export  and  blockchains  may  also  help  entities  along  the supply  chain  identify  inefficiencies  provide verifications and certifications and maximize shelf life to reduce waste (IBM Food Trust no date). Blockchains can also be combined with smart contract systems or other AI techniques to  increase  efficiency  simplify  transactions ensure compliance and security and promote trade  facilitation  across  borders  resulting in  more  inclusive  and  sustainable  agrifood supply chains (Tripoli and Schmidhuber 2018).and consumer In  CLMV  there  has  been  a  growing  demand for  leveraging  blockchain  and  AI  technologies to  modernize  agrifood  production  and distribution to boost efficiency transparency and competitiveness.  Cambodia for example has  worked  with  Oxfam  to  use  a  blockchain system called    BlocRice    that helps smallscale organic rice farmers in Preah Vihear province in    traceability  smart  contract  and  cashless payment communication (Oxfam Cambodia no date). Such a blockchainbased initiative  helps  small  farmers  and exporters  use  technology  to  gain  negotiating power  and  to  get  fair  prices.  These  small players have to sell quickly under pressure to repay highinterest loans (usually provided by traders) oftentimes are neither protected by valid contracts nor paid accordingly and who generally  lack  market  power  and  information necessary for negotiating terms and conditions (especially regarding prices) with traders and middlemen (Ono 2018b).  Recent developments in Vietnam also indicate a  promising  path  towards  effectively  using blockchain  and  AI  technologies  to  increase market  value  and  competitiveness  livelihood of SMEs in the agrifood sector and sustainable development in the country.  Concerned about lagging behind Thailand in the world agrifood market due to high prices lower quality and the  lack  of  information  the  Deputy  Director of  the  Vietnam  Agriculture  Academy  has stated that Vietnam   s products will encounter difficulty  in  accessing  high  value  chains  and markets  if  the  players  do  not  replace  their outofdate  technology  with  advanced  ones (VietNamNet Bridge 2018). In this light Infinity 7Blockchain Labs has launched the blockchainbased    Fruitchain    platform     which provides realtime production packaging shipping and quality  information  to  consumers  and  trading partners       to  strengthen  Vietnamese  fruit farmers     and  suppliers     capacity  in  terms  of supply  chain  management  traceability  and transparency standard  certification  and international  competition  and  sustainable development  (Infinity  Blockchain  Labs  no date).  Similarly TEFOOD recently recognised by  the  Food  and  Agriculture  Organisation  of the United Nations (FAO) as a partner has also implemented  blockchainbased  farmtotable traceability platforms in the livestock and fresh produce sectors in Vietnam.  In 2016 TEFOOD established  a  pig  tracking  system  along  the entire supply chain to track 10000 pigs daily and it also worked with local governments to train over 6000 companies in South Vietnam; in  2017  TEFOOD  trained  twentytwo  regions of  Vietnam  to  track  350000  chickens  and 2.5  million  eggs  daily;  and  since  2018  the company  has  engaged  in  national  livestock registration  and  management  as  well  as tracking mechanisms for fruits and vegetables (TEFOOD no date).2.5  Reinventing Services and Manufacturing Sectors via AIWhile there are now numerous AI applications that have been deployed in developed countries to  upgrade  manufacturing  and  services  the use  of  AI  in  CLMV  countries  has  remained relatively rare.  Nevertheless AI technologies have equal potential in CLMV countries to help transform services and manufacturing sectors boost  economic  growth  and  provide  critical public  services  in  similar  ways.  According to  the  ASEAN  Secretariat  the  application of  disruptive  technologies  could  generate internal  growth  and  external  investment  and significantly  increase  productivity  by  2030 resulting  in  an  additional  US$220  to  US$625 billion in terms of annual economic impact in the region (ASEAN 2016).Optimal  use  of  disruptive  technologies  such as  blockchains  and  AI  systems  can  empower Inclusive Economic Transformation 8business  (including  SMEs)  and  citizens in CLMV  countries  to  ensure  economic  growth and  sustainable  development.    For  example together  with  robotics  AI  systems  can  be applied in traditional factory sites to modernize the labor and experienceintensive production process  into  a  smart  manufacturing  process increasing  productivity  ensuring  quality reducing production cost and preventing harm from  strenuous  or  dangerous  work.    While robots  have  already  been  used  on  a  large scale  in  manufacturing  since  the  beginning of  industrial  automation  in  the  1970s  the development  and  application  of  AIsupported robots  is  expected  to  grow  significantly  in the  coming  decade  (the industrial  robot market  was  estimated  to  account  for  US$29 billion  in  2014  and  around  230000  industrial robots  were  sold  in  2014       both  numbers are  predicted  to  increase  in  the  near  future) (Stankovic et al. 2017 8). The combination of AI technologies and robots can also be used to upgrade  work  and  service  in  various  settings such  as  restaurants  waste  processing  sites train  stations  and  airports  farms  hospitals elderly government agencies.  Providing  assistance  and  care  to aging and disabled populations can contribute to  the  overall  quality  and  accessibility  of social  welfare  system  (Stankovic  et  al.  2017 9).  Automated  vehicles  and  smart  transport infrastructure may also increase the potential of production logistics and distribution network offering more efficient and sustainable options for  business  to  trade  and  connect.  While the  empirical  employment  impact  of  AI  and robotic technologies is yet to be ascertained various  AI  and  robotic  innovations  have  been diffused  to  developing  countries  (including CLMV  countries)  through  global  supply  chains and multinational businesses to upgrade local manufacturing  and  increase  product  quality (Stankovic et al. 2017).centers care and Blockchains  may  provide innovative  and inclusive ways for individuals to access services which  were  previously  unreachable  and  for businesses  to  trade  with  each  other  across existing  barriers       via  new  sources  of  market information  new  channels  of  education  and employment  and  new  platforms  of  financial services  (WEF  and  ADB  2017  8).  In  CLMV countries  blockchains  and  AI  systems  may offer  new  opportunities  in  contexts  where many SMEs have limited capacities for obtaining in  a  fair  and  efficient  manner  information financial  services  business  networks  and global market access. For instance while less than a third of the population in Myanmar and Vietnam have a bank account with conventional financial  institutions  blockchain  is  poised  to    revolutionize payments and logistics enabling small firms to interact on a trusted basis despite never  having  met  each  other     empowering SMEs  to  trade  in  novels  ways  in  global  digital marketplaces and therefore    unleash a world of microtransactions    (WEF and ADB 2017). in In  addition  blockchains  and  AI  systems  are able to bring innovative models for delivering various  business  and  public  services  most notably  health  services less  advanced countries such as CLMV. The development and application  of  telemedicine  (such  as  online or  portable  medical  expert  systems  mobile health advisors or unmanned drone delivery of medical products) for rural areas is an adequate example.    Commentators  have  affirmed  that while  many  countries  have integrated  AI technologies  into  their  healthcare  systems to  generate  benefits like  cost  reduction increased  access  and  distributional  justice there  is  tremendous  potential  for  AI  systems to  facilitate  and  revolutionize  healthcare provision  in  resourcelacking  countries  (Wahl et  al.  2018).  For  instance  while  the  Internet penetration rate in CLMV is not as high as that in most developed countries the rapidly growing number  of  smartphones  (i.e.  the  necessary basics increasing the  supply  of  quality  data  in  a  network  of electronic  devices  which  can  support  the provision  of  health  services  in  resourcepoor scenarios.  With  adequate  investment  in  cloud computing in  digitizing health information  AIsupported  expert systems  may  be  deployed  in  CLMV  and  other less  developed  countries  in  many  ways.    In some  circumstances  expert  systems  can  help communicate  health  information  to  patients for  AI  applications) infrastructure  and is  9when  personal  interactions  are  infeasible; in  other  cases  expert  systems  can  be  used to  assist  physicians  (or  in  some  rural  areas community  health  workers) in  diagnosing and  making  treatment  decisions;  and  in  even more  exceptional  conditions  (usually  in  poor communities) expert systems may be used to act  in  lieu  of  human  doctors  when  they  are nonexistent  (Wahl  et  al.  2018).    In  a  broader setting AI technologies are being exploited to    predict model and slow the spread of disease in epidemic situations around the world    (Wahl et al. 2018). In Manila for example researchers who have studied epidemic patterns of dengue fever  recently  leveraged  a  machinelearningbased system to identify weather and landuse factors  pertinent  to  the  transmission  of  this disease (Wahl et al. 2018). With no doubt such AI  technologies  can  be  equally  beneficial  to CLMV countries.Inclusive Economic Transformation 103.  ALIGNING  DISRUPTIVE  TECHNOLOGIES  WITH  SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT  POLICY  STRATEGIES  IN  THE  AGE  OF  MEGAREGIONALISM Thus far  this  paper  has  discussed  the development  and  deployment  of  DLTs  and  AI technologies  for  the  provision  of  public  and private goods and services. This section takes one  step  further  to  discuss  possible  policy strategies  along  the  regulatory  institutional technical and human dimensions. To elucidate the potential of disruptive technologies to bridge the  development  gap  vis  vis  industrialized nations  amid  the  trend  of  megaregionalism there are hurdles facing policymakers in CLMV countries.  As  explained  below  some  of  these challenges  such  as  the  lack  of  adequate physical infrastructure and human capital are not new. Yet CLMV can face even heavier stress to catch up with the developed world because of  the  fastgrowing  disruptive  technologies. Other  emerging  issues  like  mapping  out  an adaptive and anticipatory regulatory approach in  response  to  the  dynamics  of  the  digital world and taming AI and blockchains through transparency  accountability  and fairness have  become  even  more  challenging  tasks facing CLMV. We identify major challenges and potential policy options below.3.1  Improving Infrastructure and Human Capital to Capture DataDriven OpportunitiesAs  explained  disruptive  technologies  can cause  fundamental  changes  throughout  the world  including  developing  countries.  But how  developing  countries  can  benefit  from these new changes to bridge the development gap  between  haves  and  have  nots  within  and between countries is in large part premised on infrastructure. As demonstrated by the Digital Adoption Index (DAI) issued by the World Bank CLMV  countries  lag  way  behind  their  ASEAN counterpart Singapore in terms of digitalization. While Singapore sits at the top of the rankings Vietnam  Cambodia  Laos  and  Myanmar  rank 91st  101st  109th  and  160th  respectively.  This reflects in part the shortfall of Internet access and  electricity  in  these  countries.  Despite years of efforts via initiatives like    eASEAN    for instance a large number of inhabitants in Myanmar  Laos  and  Cambodia  remain  offline. The  number  of  internet  users  per  100  of  the population  was  about  84  for  the  developed world  at  the  end  of  2017;  by  contrast  these three countries had user density of somewhere between  3349  (ITU  no  date).  Shortfall  of electricity  is  another  critical  issue.  Studies show that in 2014 only half of the inhabitants in  Cambodia  and  Myanmar  had  access  to electricity (WEF and ADB 2017). It  seems  unlikely  that  populations  without access  to  the  Internet  and  electricity  would readily  take  to  using  blockchain  let  alone relevant  applications  in  meaningful  ways. As  an  example  in  point  Myanmar  Laos  and Cambodia  have  not  joined  the  ASEAN  Single Window  a  platform  to  facilitate  trade  and expedite electronic exchange of customs data that  may  harness  the  potential  of  blockchain. Adding more complexity is the operational costs for storage bandwidth computing powers and encryption technologies involved as blockchain and  AI  mature  overtime  (Kasireddy  2017). CLMV  should  hence  continue  to  work  on  the improvement  of  infrastructure  by  offering  a stable  and  quality  supply  of  connectivity  and electricity at affordable costs which would of course require substantial fiscal resources. This would help mitigate the digital divide     a major challenge  to  further  economic  integration in  the  digital  realm  in  the  age  of  disruptive technology (WTO 2018).Another  related  hurdle  for  CLMV  to  grasp the  opportunities  presented  by  disruptive technologies is the lack of skilled manpower to catch up with the shifting datadriven economy. In  Vietnam  for  instance  the  shortage  of information  technology  (IT)  personnel  for  the year  20172018  alone  is  projected  to  be  some 70000 staff and the number will increase by 500000  employees  by  2020  (Tuan  2017).  The quality of manpower is yet another problem as  11evidenced by the average productivity lagging behind  many  of  its  ASEAN  counterparts  like Singapore  and  Malaysia  (VietNamNet  Bridge 2017).  Emerging  AI  big  data  and  blockchain as well as their crosssectoral implications put great  pressure  on  CLMV  to  improve  computer science  education  and  training  to  close  a critical  gap  in  skill  sets  for  jobs  in  hightech industries  and  encourage interdisciplinary collaboration.  From  a  trade  law  perspective this  may  also  call  upon  CLMV  to  revisit  their existing  commitments  mutual  recognition agreements and visa and work permit processes to  effectively  facilitate  crossborder  labor mobility  within  or  outside  the  multilateral regional  or  bilateral  economic  arrangements in response to market demands.2 3.2  Engaging Technologically Informed and Adaptive Regulatory Reforms Diffusion  of  disruptive  technologies  depends on not only physical infrastructure and human capital  but  also  an  adequate  regulatory framework.  Yet  it  has  been  a  daunting  task for governments to craft an optimal regulatory framework  when  it  comes  to  technological innovation.  While  protecting  public  interests and  preventing  market  failures  is  certainly imperative  how  to  achieve  this  without deterring  innovation  is  by  no  means  easy. For  one  the  questions  of  when  and  how  to regulate can be problematic because they turn on  the  underlying  risks  public  perceptions legal  tradition  (i.e.  common  law  or  civil  law) and  various  economic  social  and  political underpinnings  (Black  and  Baldwin  2010).  For another  the     pacing  problem          a  situation where  technological  progress  always  outpaces legal development     makes innovations a moving target to catch up with (Marchant and Wallach 2013).  A  heavyhanded  regulatory  approach adopted  too  soon  could  reduce  investments in  research  and  development  (R&D)  activities below  some  optimal  level  thereby  stifling innovation.  Costs  of  government  failures      mismatches  between  adequate  regulation  and the corresponding problems     can be significant and  sometimes  more  expensive  than  other policy options (Breyer 1984). in All these  problems  become  particularly prominent the  context  of  disruptive technologies  that  evolve  and  revolutionize rapidly  and  exponentially  high  uncertainties about their risks benefits and future direction and a wide range of applications across sectors and  national  borders.  Challenges  can  be  even more acute for developing countries     including CLMV     due to their relative low regulatory and policy capacities as compared to their developed counterparts.  To  unfold  the  potential  of disruptive technologies and avoid the immense costs  of  government  failures  by  picking  the wrong  side  while  the  world  is  resetting  itself CLMV  need  to  rethink  the  traditional  linear approach  by  taking  into  account  the  unique nature of disruptive technologies     fastmoving crosssector  and  crossborder.  A  flexible experimental  regulatory  model  based  on  the notion of inclusiveness and multistakeholderism would  seem  a  promising  option  (WEF  and  ADB 2017).  This  would  call  for  a  principlebased approach to ensure regulatory decisions can be more  openended  subject  to  new  knowledge and input from stakeholders in both public and private sectors. To this end CLMV policymakers should  tap  into  big  data  to  map  out  whether when and how to govern new challenges. The emergence of the socalled    sandbox    approach in  the  banking  and  financial  sector  is  a  prime example  of  an  alternative  governance  mode. The rationale underlying the sandbox approach is  to  facilitate  innovation  by  creating  a     safe space     for  businesses  to  test  new  products and  services  without immediately  fulfilling the  licensing  requirements  under  the  existing framework (FCA 2015). In ASEAN countries like Singapore  Malaysia  Indonesia  and  Thailand have set up sandbox schemes for fintech.2 In the Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for TransPacific Partnership (CPTPP) to which Vietnam is a party for instance Annex 10A sets forth provisions to facilitate the recognition of professional qualifications licensing or registration. Also Vietnam has undertaken under the CPTPP to allow the entry of    Contractual Service Suppliers    in sectors like    Computer and related services       Engineering services    and    Integrated engineering services.     Inclusive Economic Transformation 12While this sandbox approach seems promising there  are  hurdles  facing  CLMV  too.  Although the  requirements  of  the  sandbox  approach can vary in different nations    innovativeness    is  often  a  prerequisite  for  a  firm  to  benefit from the licensing exemption (Bromberg et al. 2017). Determining whether a proposed service or product is innovative enough often involves certain  judgment  calls  that  require  relevant expertise and skill sets. To facilitate diffusion of disruptive  technologies  and  their  applications without  creating  unnecessary  obstacles  to international trade and investment it is crucial for  CLMV  to  draw  lessons  from  other  nations not only in crafting new legal frameworks but also  the  way  of  implementation  in  practice. Regulatory  cooperation  be it  bilateral regional  or  multilateral  is  much  warranted to  avoid  negative  ramifications  of  arbitrary exercise  of  discretionary  powers.  ASEAN   s Financial Innovation Network is such an example that  promotes  collaboration  and  facilitates development  of  and  experimentation  with innovative financial products and services in the region (MAS 2017).  Nevertheless as promising as  a  sandbox  framework  at  the  ASEAN  level may be challenges may arise from the diverse regulatory  landscapes  in  different  member states  and  thus  wellinformed  evaluation is  required.    For  example  some  countries in  the  region  have  welldesigned  property law  and  contract  law  systems  while  others have  serious  problems  in  law  enforcement and  independent  judicial  review;  some  have stringent  privacy  protection  regimes  while others are underdeveloped in this regard.systems  and International cooperation also plays a role in at least two other aspects. First it could help to establish  common  standards  and  to  moderate ramifications  of  the  lack  of  interoperability across countries.  Existing blockchain  platforms  for  instance  do  not speak to one another which poses challenges for  widescale  deployment  of  blockchains (WTO  2018  7;  Ganne  2018  94).  The  second aspect  goes  beyond  the  purely  technical aspect of interoperability by bringing together policymakers in shaping mutual understandings of various values attached to these disruptive technologies  in  different  jurisdictions.  This has broader implications from the perspective of  international  economic  law.  It  has  been debated  for  instance  whether  and  to  what extent robots should gain legal personhood. If so will robots still be considered products or services for the purpose of the WTO? Could we consider them to be    service providers    that are subject to certain educational and professional qualification requirements and thus to trade negotiations     even though they may not neatly square into the existing framework of Mode 4 a  notion  based  on  a     natural  person   ?  Other issues  such  as     likeness     can  be  equally  or even  more  problematic  when  it  comes  to evaluating different treatments given to robot and  human  service  providers.  Addressing  all these  questions  would  require  policymakers      including  those  from  CLMV       to  work together  and  explore  the  common  values shared by diverse groups of stakeholders with different  cultural  backgrounds.  Considering the  vast  diversity  in  the  region  in  terms of technological  development  economic structure  legal  systems  and  positions  in  the global value chain different nuanced patterns of  disruptive  technology  application  may  call for different policy responses. Having said that any unilateral regulatory intervention without regard to the crossborder nature of disruptive technologies  and  their  spillovers  can  create more problems than they solve. this region For  CLMV  to  reap  the  benefits  of  disruptive technologies  there  are  many  other  hurdles lying  ahead.  For  instance  cryptocurrencies may  undermine  already  fragile  antimoney laundering  and  terrorism  financing  schemes in (Kotoski  2016b).  Market concentration  and  anticompetitive  conduct due  to  the  nature  of  the  digital  markets require  CLMV  governments  to  reconfigure their  competition  laws  and  policies  (WTO 2018).  Transparency  brought  by  blockchain can  influence  the  political  will  to  engage  in deeper  reform.  This  is  what  happened  with Honduras   s land registration reform     Fatcom   s blockchain  project  was  socalled     stalled    because  of  political issues  (Kirby  2015). Moreover the dearth of adequate privacy and  13data protection laws to meet requirements set out  by  the  APEC  Privacy  Framework  ASEAN Framework  on  Personal  Data  Protection or  the  General  Data  Protection  Regulation for  instance  can  not  only  raise  human  right concerns  but  also  inhibit  crossborder  data flows  in  these  countries  thereby  reducing incentives for foreign investments in hightech industry  (Greenleaf  2014).  These  and  many other  factors  are  all  important  underpinnings of  the  diffusion  of  disruptive  technologies  in the long run.courts  in  various  settings  (State  v.  Loomis 2016).  It  can  be  problematic  to  detect  and address  the  bias  effectively  because  of  legal and  technical  constraints.  These  AI  systems can  operate  as  a     legal  black  box     as  they are  often  treated  as  proprietary  technologies and  are  thus  protected  by  trade  secrets  or otherwise.  Even  more  problematic  is  the    technical black box   ; the outcomes produced by  certain  sophisticated  AI  based  on  artificial neural  networks  are  barely  explainable  even by their creators (Liu et al. unpublished).3.3  Ensuring Adequate Accountability Transparency and Fairness Like other developing countries CLMV are most likely  to  be  recipients  that  borrow  disruptive technologies  from  the  more  technologically advanced  world.  As  promising  as  these innovations may be there are challenges ahead in  the  process  of  transplanting  new  business models or systems into CLMV. These challenges are  by  and  large  centered  on  the  notions  of transparency  accountability  and  fairness. While disruptive technologies reinvent business models  by  making  conventional  machines  and processes even smarter the costs of potential misuse  or  abuse  of  such  technologies  can sometimes outweigh the potential gains.  Hidden bias for instance has been a recurring theme that  engenders  enormous  legal  policy  and ethical debates. Built on data and algorithms AI  systems  are  designed  to  spot  patterns map  out  realworld  problems  and  propose solutions.  This  entails  a  complex  process  of data  collection  feeding  massive  amount  of data  and  training.  As  humans  are  involved  in all  these  processes  there  are  evident  risks of  subjectivity.  If  there  is  any  sort  of  bias  in the training dataset that would be translated into  the  recommendations  or  decisions  of the  AI  systems.  Unwanted  ramifications  can also  emerge  due  to  an  incomplete  dataset  or the  design  of  algorithms.  As  seen  in  State  v. Loomis in Wisconsin USA for instance the risks of racial discrimination are already present in the  U.S.  criminal  justice  system  where  the datadriven  approach  has  become  popular in  assisting  law  enforcement  authorities  and Admittedly to address these black box problems and validate datasets that are suitable for the local contexts and to ensure biasfree AIbased applications  can  be  extremely  challenging  for developing countries without sufficient technical or institutional  capacities.  Nevertheless CLMV  should  weigh  in  on  these  factors  when importing AI systems from the West.  In ASEAN Singapore  has  taken  the  lead  to  explore  the framework  to  foster  responsible  development and  adoption  of  AI  (PDPC  2018).  In  addition government procurement could serve as useful leverage  for  CLMV  governments  as  a  user  of AI systems in the provisions of public services to negotiate better terms and scale down the scope  of  nondisclosure  thereby  moderating the  legal  black  box  problem.  To  unfold  the technical black box of AI and build trust in the ecosystem calls for sustainable development of technological  capacity  and  ethically  informed R&D in AI and other new areas of endeavors. In doing so CLMV can also moderate the concerns of vendor lockin by reducing their reliance on foreign technologies and creating their homegrown  AIs  or  blockchains       although  this  is unlikely to occur soon as most useful data are still  controlled  and  utilized  by  select  firms  in the developed world. There is a long way to go to  achieve  data  fairness  for  the  Global  South (Cordova 2018). There are also issues in relation to blockchains. As much as blockchains can provide innovative upgrades  and  solutions  to  existing  challenges in  the  developing  country  settings  worries the  proprietary may  be  surfacing blockchainenabled themselves.  from solutions Inclusive Economic Transformation 14While  blockchains  can  help  empower  SMEs and  individuals  to  take  part  in  innovative trading  networks  full  access  to  benefits  of blockchains innovations may be strategically (or inadvertently) limited to certain businesses or groups in an advantaged position in the market or society thus excluding many from superior tools or information and undermining equitable participation  in  the  long  run  (Schia  2018).  In this regard CLMV may likewise leverage their government  procurement  policy  tools  to mitigate  potential  problems  of  technological monopoly  or  unfair  business  practices.  To ensure  fairness  and  alleviate  inequality  when importing  blockchainbased  innovations  from the  developed  world  and  applying  them  to their  societies  CLMV  should  not  only  ensure regulatory infrastructural  technical  and institutional  readiness in  the  process  as mentioned  above  but  also  provide  tailored assistance  to  local  businesses  and  individuals to  allow  them  to  meaningfully  participate  in the  ecosystem.  A  plausible  policy  option  is to  build  publicprivate  partnerships  under  a governance  structure  that  facilitates  access rights  fair  use  and  inclusiveness  promotes interoperability  and  standardization  for  easy integration and brings values to all parties. 154.  CONCLUSIONIn the age of AI and blockchain it is imperative to  assist  the  ASEAN  Member  States  and  in particular  CLMV  countries  in  closing  the development  gap  among  themselves  and with  others.    This  article  has  pointed  out that  one  critical  task  is  to  explore  optimal policy strategies to efficiently and effectively harness the rise of    disruptive technologies    leverage  technological  advances  to  improve their  existing  positions  in  the  global  value chain and move a long way down the road to sustainable  development.  This  article  draws on  the  existing  scholarship  and  empirical evidence  to  investigate  two  major  types  of disruptive  technologies  that  can  serve  as a  crosscutting  infrastructure  or  platform for  broad  applications       blockchain  and  AI two the  abovementioned technologies       and  to  assess  their  potential impacts  on  CLMV  countries.  The  underlying benefits  and  risks  of  various  applications of types  of disruptive  technologies  are  further  assessed specifically  through  case  studies  such  as  the use  of  blockchain  to  address  the  traceability problems  for  food  and  agricultural  products microfinance  and  fintech  to  support  SMEs and AI in transforming the provision of goods and  services.  By  consolidating  the  critical observations  of  benefits  and  risks  of  various disruptive technology applications this article offers  possible  policy  strategies  that  aim  at optimizing  economic  growth  and  sustainable development for the people of Cambodia Lao PDR Myanmar and Vietnam.Inclusive Economic Transformation 16REFERENCESACCA  Association of Chartered Certified Accountants. 2016.
