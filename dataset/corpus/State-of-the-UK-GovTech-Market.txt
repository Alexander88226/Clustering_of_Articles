A new generation of technology is changing the way a nation  or indeed a local government  collects taxes delivers services distributes welfare maintains security and more. In time and perhaps a surprisingly short time the whole way a state engages with its citizens will be different. Driving this change is the rise of GovTech  new technologies applied to public services and specifically designed for government purposes.The phenomenon is global. And just starting. Denmark has shown the way with NemKonto a citizen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s account for payments to and from government. Its eIdentification scheme NemID gives every citizen a secure means of personal identification online. Out of a population of little more than 5 million people 4.8 million already use NemID. Yet it did not exist five years ago. This one story shows what an innovative government can do and just how quickly the public will respond.On the other side of the world in the Indian state of Karnataka the government has rolled out a database to manage millions of land records. Farmers need a copy of their landownership to apply for a bank loan. Before the service the process was long costly and very painful. Now that it has become digitised it is hugely popular even with semiliterate farmers. Similar examples can be found from Albania to Zambia. A number of factors are driving this transformation particularly fast in the UK including  Rising expectations by citizens  Continued budgetary pressures  Devolution and a new wave of Metro Mayors  Demographic shifts inside public administrations  The end of legacy IT systems which are overly centralised and nonresponsive  The availability of new technologies like artificial intelligence cloud computing and data science   Government commitment to greater SME spend and GovTech innovations\\x0c  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKET  |  5 WE ESTIMATE THE UK GOVTECH MARKET TO BE \\xc2\\xa320 BILLION  BY 2025The picture that emerges is extraordinary. But as Ron Bouganim of the US GovTech Fund says \\xe2\\x80\\x9dit is still a market hiding in plain sight\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. With this report we hope to reduce the opacity which often shrouds the public sector. We encourage more entrepreneurs to consider opportunities in GovTech while helping policymakers buyers and investors see the depth of the market. The end result could be spectacular. Few countries will get the opportunity to transform large swathes of publicsector services in the way that we will in the UK. We founded Public to help technology startups transform public services. We intend to make the UK a pioneer of digital transformation. And by doing so we will improve the quality of our society and the lives that we lead. We hope that in this report you will see what we see \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and that you will seize the opportunity.Good readingDaniel Korski & Alexander de Carvalho CoFounders of Public The UK has an extraordinary opportunity to seize this emergent market. Government at central and local levels should aim to make the UK the best place globally for GovTech businesses to start and operate. And the UK should then help the best GovTech companies to expand to become major international players.Why the UK? Government reforms especially since 2010 have seen the UK lead the world in government digitisation. No other country currently combines size of market with such a ready public acceptance of the digital world. Devolution is now bringing opportunities to cities such as Birmingham Manchester and Bristol which are showing the way for technologyenhanced approaches to public service. Even the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s departure from the EU may herald opportunities as it will require to a short deadline the complete reformation of certain services including rural payments and border controlThe GovTech market is estimated to be worth $400 billion globally. Research in this report estimates that the UK GovTech market could be worth \\xc2\\xa320billion by 2025. This would make it one of the most important digital sectors of the economy. The breadth and diversity of GovTech entrepreneurship shine through in our Public 100 list which is the most comprehensive list of UK GovTech firms published to date. Companies are now looking to transform everything from traffic management and dentistry to the way welfare is paid and flood protection is managed. This report charts the GovTech opportunity. We show how exciting the GovTech landscape already is with many premier startups vying to transform public services. We showcase the successes that businesses have already achieved at central and local levels of government. We debunk the concern that purchase cycles for government are an impregnable barrier. And we seek to show where the most encouraging developments are across different layers of government.\\x0c6  |  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKETEXECUTIVE SUMMARYD emands on government services are increasing at an extraordinary pace due to a growing and ageing population evergreater security concerns budgetary restraint and higher expectations from digitallysavvy citizens. People demand more of the state as they have become accustomed to smartphoneempowered lives. Yet the state unlike private enterprise is struggling to innovate. Introducing new technologies coupled with new business models will enable governments to transform public services by providing intelligent solutions directly to individual citizens at the same time as reducing or avoiding costs and increasing efficiencies.THIS REPORTGives a history of the UK GovTech market from 1997 when Tony Blair first introduced egovernment initiatives through to the most recent Government Transformation Strategy in 2017. These reforms have made the UK a market leader. Though the pace of centrallyled digital reform has slowed recently the overall direction of travel is undoubted not least as local governments from Glasgow to Leeds have picked up central government slack.Provides a comparison between the \\xc2\\xa36.6 billion UK FinTech and UK GovTech markets Funding of GovTech companies grew significantly in 2016. Just as in the early stages of the development of UK FinTech the UK GovTech sector will benefit from a fertile environment for further growth. UK has the right commercial ecosystem of talent capital and policy. It also has the market  with increasing demands by its citizens and the obsolescence of its expensive legacy IT systems.Showcases the breadth of the UKwide GovTech ecosystem which is emerging Some exciting companies in our review include the surveillanceenhancing algorithm developer Calipsa the midwife/patient advice platform Ask the Midwife the allinone online healthcare platform for homecare Cera and Pockit a company using new technology to provide bank accounts geared towards supporting the most impoverished and marginalised in society.Forecasts that the UK GovTech Market will reach \\xc2\\xa320 billion by 2025 This will be fuelled by a renewal of large IT contracts a shift towards procurement from SMEs investment into emerging technologies applied to public needs and by the rise of companies whose products enhance not only the lives of the individual but also have impacts which more generally permeate society. The UK is well placed to take up the mantle as the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s leading GovTech hub.Lists the Public 100  the most comprehensive list of lists of UK GovTech firms To help create a clearer baseline of the GovTech market in the UK we have created the most comprehensive list to date of 100 productled GovTech companies. This list reveals that companies that are helping government to deliver direct services \\xe2\\x80\\x93 aspects of health advice or the issuing of licences for example \\xe2\\x80\\x93 represent 38 percent of the survey when measured by the size of their balance sheets making it one of the areas that has seen the greatest level of investment. However the largest segment of our GovTech list is made up by comprises supporting the way governments administer themselves \\xe2\\x80\\x93 run databases manage their staff protect their systems for example. Companies focused on engagement with citizens infrastructure and regulation make up a smaller part of the GovTech market. These companies now stand ready to grow more rapidly.Shows that public sector sales cycles have become significantly less complicated Progress over the past few years has been considerable. Based on our research these onceexasperating sales cycles now last on average between 2 months and 18 months. Three recurring themes that have helped \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwinners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to succeed in the sales process are (i) compliance;(ii) a clear route to market; and (iii) a sense of mission.\\x0c  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKET  |  7 WHAT DOES GOVTECH MEAN?FOR CITIZENS GovTech will improve the quality of publicsector delivery across healthcare transport decision making citizen engagement and more. Indeed every facet of everyday life in the relationship between citizen and the state will hinge on these new technologies.FOR POLICYMAKERS GovTech presents a unique opportunity to accelerate productivity and create jobs. It gives UK the chance to boast a worldleading government capable of making dataled decisions which can then be executed efficiently to better serve the public.FOR BUYERS across various levels of government GovTech may initially present a steep learning curve as they discover the potential of technologies to achieve policy outcomes. Companies such as Apolitical are helping to bridge this gap. Over the longer term we will have more transparent buying which will lead to cheaper solutions for the public purse. Regional collaboration  the effect of devolution \\xe2\\x80\\x93 will bring a burgeoning GovTech market across the nation.FOR STARTUPS GovTech presents a rapid growth market. But more importantly it gives entrepreneurs a chance to make a real difference in the society we share. Quite simply it will make the UK a better place to live. The wealth of entrepreneurial and engineering talent in the private sector is enormous.FOR INVESTORS GovTech companies represent an untested opportunity. However the size and scope of the needs they will address and the potential returns this will offer should prove very compelling. The GovTech sector is nascent but for this very reason it represents a compelling opportunity for VCs to gain early access to companies with the right tools to leverage the power of technology to deliver profitability and therefore truly disrupt in a sector that has historically struggled to produce VClike returns. GovTech companies will also appeal to those investors looking to promote and expand on the growing theme of investing in companies that do right not only by their shareholders but also by the society in which they operate.FOR POLITICAL LEADERS The opportunity to bring together policy outcomes delivery and datadriven evaluation in new and groundbreaking ways whilst stimulating a nascent and vibrant market in the UK is powerful and should remain a priority for the foreseeable future.BREXIT AND THE GOVTECH MARKETPredicting the impact of Brexit on any market has not become easier one year on from the referendum. For the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GovTech market it is clear that Brexit represents both opportunities and risks. If Brexit leads to a larger rethink of governmental systems from rural payments to customs arrangements and identification then it must inevitably drive a significant adoption of new technologies and new suppliers. If leaving the EU leads to a rethink of procurement policies and regulations with a preference given to UK firms then there will undoubtedly be a shortterm boost to a sector which is still very UK based. However if this leads to reciprocal barriers for UK startups seeking to enter European markets then HMG would have to redouble its support for GovTech startups to succeed in nonEuropean markets. If Brexit impacts the economy \\xe2\\x80\\x93 and crucially investor confidence \\xe2\\x80\\x93 then all digital markets including the GovTech market will suffer. Access to European capital not least from the European Investment Bank is also important to the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s VC market and any shortfall will need to be made up. Access to European talent is crucial to the UK GovTech market. We need only look at the Public 100 list to see how many of these companies have been built by immigrants from Europe and beyond. The drive to build the skills of young people in the UK is welcome but will not yield results in the timeframe required for the UK to ensure that it becomes the world\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GovTech hub. So any impact on the access to skills whether because of quotas bureaucratic obstacles or even just the tone of public discourse will be detrimental to the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GovTech market. \\x0c8  |  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKETTHE UK GOVTECH MARKETCHAPTER 1HISTORY Government IT has traditionally been dominated by a few large suppliers.

This subsector accounts for 40 percent of companies listed in the Public 100. 20.16.6Sectors of the GovTech market  There have been many attempts to categorise the GovTech market including the introduction of new abbreviations such as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCivTech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRegTech\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. We counted at least seven different categories of GovTech companies currently in use; and there are undoubtedly many more. To us GovTech refers to cuttingedge technology products developed for  or tailored to  public services. It is probable that this new set of transformative products will disrupt the traditional B2G model and will likely come from startups and SMEsNet new contractsMarket size2015 To segment the GovTech market we use a simple system of five different subsectors each one centred on a specific publicservice role administration delivery regulation participation and infrastructure. This system applies to the GovTech sector as it is broadly defined meaning all technology used for public services delivered by central governments local authorities or agencies. Or indeed whether they are delivered by the private or third sectors.

A more detailed discussion of positive externalities defined as all positive benefits to a third party from the delivery of a good or service can be found in Appendix 1 alongside a broader explanation of our methodology.It is worth noting from data below that Central Government spent about \\xc2\\xa312 billion in the SME sector in 20153 with a wider public sector procurement spend of roughly four times that size.

DIVIDENDS FROM GOVTECHFor the public sector the introduction of new technologies has enormous potential to free up back office resources which can be transferred to the frontline  whether to A&E clinics fire departments or schools. In addition back office resource staffed with better technology will be able to provide more effective outputs. Further new technologies have the potential to help the public sector avoid costs altogether through preventative datadriven interventions. For example reducing the number of people who come to A&E because they have been given more accurate information online or improving attendance in schools through online peertopeer support networks.While nominal spend on type of ICT and BPO procured by government has changed year on year the proportion has varied very little in the past  National Audit office (2016).

Most strikingly the Chancellor of the Exchequer Philip Hammond said in his June 2017 speech at Mansion House that the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s future success in the midst of Brexit would \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinvolve the deployment of new technology\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in how Government works.13 We have also mentioned that citizens are demanding a fundamental change in the way they engage with governments. It follows that the public sector will need to become more techenabled as its citizens do. What is clear in this landscape is that change has already begun to manifest itself. The question is not whether governments will embrace digitisation but rather how and on what timescale? How fast and deep will this adoption be?We have a sufficient set of conditions in place for the UK to emerge as the world leader in GovTech. The UK has a unique combination of proximity to talent and knowledge access to capital and investment appetite as well as a deep regulatory and political system all of which will help to accelerate the digitisation process.. This is precisely how the UK became a world leader in FinTech starting in London and then expanding to other cities such as Manchester Newcastle Edinburgh Leeds and Bristol. Newcastle has become a hub for GovTech since HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) based its new digital headquarters there in 2014. Opencast software a company based in Newcastle and run by entrepreneur Mike O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Brien has provided a wide variety of solutions including a renewable energy data analytics platform to help cut the costs of electricity generated by wind farms. The platform helps to identify malfunctioning equipment which cost the UK offshore wind industry an estimated \\xc2\\xa3150 million in 2012 alone.14 Another parallel to draw is that of the challenges banks and government face with their legacy systems.15 These systems are expensive and ORE Catapult (2014).

But there are barriers to moving everything to the cloud such as incompatibility security and issues with source data. In the next replacement cycle many publicsector organisations will shift to the cloud abandoning the expensive and outdated onpremise solutions with which they have historically operated. A \\xe2\\x80\\x98no change\\xe2\\x80\\x99 approach to legacy contracts is increasingly viewed as an outdated perspective. When the NHS Business Service Authority (NHSBSA) brought on a new contract for the prescription payment service it realised savings of up to \\xc2\\xa336 million between 2011 and 2012 alone  reliance on the new contract was 90 percent cheaper than its previous legacy contract.The implications of legacy systems for GovTech are that once the government successfully recognizes the issue of vendor lockin it can try to separate as the NAO puts it \\xe2\\x80\\x9cbusiness application from physical software\\xe2\\x80\\x9d making it possible for startups and SMEs to contract with HMRC DWP the NHS and other departments despite their current inability to manage the huge contracts that exist for cumbersome core services like income tax. Some problems may be solved more creatively and efficiently by smaller companies  for example staff scheduling and management issues which Rotageek seeks to solve through its SaaS technology. Or Cera whose platform includes functionality which assists caretakers with elderly patients by giving them advice based on care records created through past interactions with Cera. One might argue that Cera could operate even better if it integrated with NHS digital patient records  which will be digitised by 2020. As long as security protocols are followed cloud solutions are less exposed to cybersecurity risks which has become a greater concern in the wake of ransomware attacks such as the 2017 attack on the NHS.16 Legacy IT as in the case of the NHS is often unsupported by its current or previous supplier who may not have provided software updates for years. Large antiquated IT systems require upkeep and maintenance on top of the huge initial outlays for installation. This increases operating expenditure and drains cash from frontline delivery. oflegacyICTBookCopy2.pdf. We define legacy ICT as systems and applications that have been operationally embedded within a business function but superseded by newer and often more effective technologies or changed business needs for example the need to deliver a new policy or deliver a service in a different way.National Cyber Security Centre (2016).

The list is not exhaustive; there are many GovTech companies that we have not named. But the Public 100 list presents the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most interesting productled GovTech companies which have traction in the public sector. These are the companies that are transforming (rather than merely finetuning) government practices. Crucially we have excluded firms that may well transform services in future but are not yet at the starting line. We hope to include them on an even better list next year. And we have deliberately focused on startups and SMEs. For us GovTech refers to cuttingedge technology products developed for or tailored to public services and these are most likely to be created by startups and SMEs whose offerings will disrupt traditional large suppliers. The list highlights a number of key characteristics of the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GovTech market The greatest segment of the GovTech market comprises those companies supporting the way governments administer themselves  run databases manage staff protect their systems. Driven by the cloud migration agenda and an increased focus on cybersecurity this area has grown significantly in the past few years and will continue to be a highgrowth area in the foreseeable future. This is unsurprising; the first step in transforming the sector will be in enhancing the current capabilities and improving the way the system runs in and While the UK GovTech market has been growing there has been no comprehensive overview of the market\\xe2\\x80\\x99s most dynamic companies. This has contributed to a lack of attention to the market and the comparatively low though fastgrowing venture capital investment in the sector.To help create a clearer baseline of the GovTech market in the UK and to show investors and buyers what exists Public has curated the most comprehensive list of 100 GovTech companies to date. These are companies that we believe are beginning to transform the public sector. We built the data from UK procurement contracts DueDil Crunchbase Angelist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGovernment Innovation\\xe2\\x80\\x9d list as well as desktop research and interviews. We looked at five qualitative and quantitative variables when constructing the company list including leadership company structure company size innovation and impact on public services. This survey is intended to chart the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s GovTech startups. We used the European definition of SME as criteria for companies included in the survey less than 250 employees an annual turnover not exceeding \\xe2\\x82\\xac50 million and an annual balance sheet not exceeding \\xe2\\x82\\xac43 million. In the UK an SME must satisfy any two of the following three criteria having less than 250 employees less than \\xc2\\xa325 million in annual turnover and gross assets of less than \\xc2\\xa312.5 million. The full methodology can be found \\x0c16  |  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKETof itself. This is the first barrier to progress. These businesses tend to be lean generally softwareled companies that have effective balance sheets (as evidenced by the graph displayed) and if managed in line with the wider software industry will generate high gross margins.GovTech companies are helping government to directly deliver services  policing healthcare licences  through new channels or by enhancing current mechanisms. They represent 38 percent of the list of companies and 29 percent of the total Public 100 balance sheet  the second largest category. The immediate benefactors of transformation to delivery will be frontline public servants and citizens who engage with their government. For example look at Cera a healthcare marketplace focused on homecare which enables a patient to order not only the treatment and prescriptions they need but a whole host of auxiliary services  such as food or taxi services  which enhances value to the user brings together disparate elements of the healthcare value chain and alleviates pressure on frontline nurses and care workers.Companies in the GovTech market that focus on infrastructure represent a relatively small part of the market at 8 percent but represent the highest percentage of the balance sheet of the overall list namely 31 percent. Infrastructure here reflects companies implementing hardware such as sensors or controls which are used to deliver public services. Infrastructure changes are inherently higher risk and require heavy investment in advance. However this also reflects the potential returns on investment if the implementation of new infrastructure is successful. What we mean by infrastructure here is the physical hardware that supports the usage of innovative software and enables fundamental changes in the world that can be done by public servants. We use classic examples such as sensors and digital controls and drones which could be used for a whole host of purposes once implemented but as mentioned are a heavy investment and therefore a bigger risk.Citizen Participation is still a developing area for government. It accounts for 10 percent of the Public 100 but only 2 percent of the cumulative balance sheet and includes community forums epetitions and other tools that promote social inclusion. The vast majority of the Participation companies in the Public 100 were set up in the last 3 years and use the very latest technology to enhance the way the state can encourage citizen participation and feedback.Companies offering services to bolster Regulation are similarly an area of growth. In light of regulation and the focus on security transparency and accountability in the public sector companies which enhance the level of due diligence the public sector can perform on suppliers and on other parties will become increasingly important and these companies will experience fast growth in the future. In particular Regulation companies showed strong traction in 2015 perhaps due to the upcoming GDPR legislation which will come into effect in May 2018. Two of the fastest 10 growing companies in the Public 100 are regulation focussed. Companies like Agvesto are applying technology to Agriculture or PassFort which is working in the AML and KYC spacehighlight the breadth of industries that GovTech encompasses.Looking at the retained earnings of our GovTech businesses by segment we see improving profitability across the board even in administration (which cumulatively as a segment made a loss in 2014). This suggests that the industry is gaining traction and that business are unlocking some of the value within the public sector. Over half of the Public 100 are based in London although their customers are spread throughout the UK and internationally. Outside London there are GovTech companies based in all areas of the UK with a particular strength in the Northern Powerhouse such as Ideagen who are one of the fastest growing companies in the Public 100 and Answer Digital who are revolutionising user experience in the health and social care market. We look forward to discovering more companies across the UK as we continue to chart the UK GovTech landscape.\\x0c  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKET  |  17 Public 100Delivery AdministrationParticipationInfrastructureRegulationAccuRxAdzunaNervecentreFactmataThe Nostrum GroupNetwork LocumFlyingBinaryYotiArtifax SoftwareOnfido GovcoinZen EducateAsk the Midwife Open Cast SoftwareIConnectBramble EffectOpen CosmosC3ia SolutionsPinipaCalipsaRotageekCastleton SoftwareScientiaCera SediciiClinisys SolutionsServelec CorelogicConnexicaShowmyhomeworkContegoCypadTactuumTotalmobileDigital ConnextionsAffinitextAnswer DigitalAmtSybexCognitive Logic CalviumCloud OkoConnect Internet SolutionsCyberlyticDarkTraceDataCenteredDr Foster IntelligenceEchoEnvitiaFirmstepFutureGovImmersive LabsJAC Computer Services JontekKeysoftKompliLittle Bridge Imperial Civil EnforcementIntruderJoyrideKhipuKpmd ITApoliticalDelibFiresoulsHealthUnlockedMind of my OwnNeighbourly Lima NetworksNovoville LiquidlogicRepresent.meMDS TechnologiesSpacehive ObillexYoomee Digital Open Objects BecryptPatients Know BestCitymapperPrivitarQSolution RecordsureRipJarEbeniEsteem SystemsLamasatechNeurofenixQuickCodeOptimitySec1Skillslogic SoftwireSocial TelecomsAgvestoIdeagen PassFortXihelmpublic.ioDeep Sky BlueSQR SystemsExegesis Spatial Data Management Squirrel Financial Wellbeing Top 10 fastest growing Public 100 companies 4\\x0c18  |  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKETPublic 100 Sectors & GeographyVolume and value of companies in Public 100 by sector FY15 (%)Proportion (volume)Proportion (balance sheet)14403881042931224AdministrationDelivery InfrastructureParticipationRegulationGeography (by profit & volume/category)ADMINISTRATIONDARKTRACEThis is a category of GovTech companies that power the way governments whether central or local administer themselves. Companies in this category are used by more than 1.5 million nonfrontline public sector workers and are crucial to the functioning of the state17. It is a segment of the market which has recently been transformed by a number of developments the most important of which have been the introduction of cloud services and the increased importance placed on cybersecurity. EdinburghBelfastCloud services are ondemand computing resources over the internet generally on a paid subscription basis.18 The \\xe2\\x80\\x98Cloud First\\xe2\\x80\\x99 policy originally published in 2013 mandates that during any procurement process public Leedssector organisations should \\xe2\\x80\\x9cconsider and fully evaluate potential cloud solutions first \\xe2\\x80\\x93 before they consider any other option.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Companies like Network Locum Pinipa and Cloud Oko in the Public 100 list embody the trend towards flexible cloud services. ManchesterCardiffThis is a trend that will only pick up pace. As departments seek to deliver more digital services  for example the NHS commitment to digitise all patient records by 2020  there is likely to be even greater growth in this segment. 19 But this comes with a number of challenges. Insufficient inhouse skills and a lack of knowledge about the safety of cloudbased services could hamper growth. Perhaps more importantly how data will be regulated and allowed to flow across borders will be an important part of the Brexit negotiations. 317  The Guardian. (2017). UK voters are being sold a lie.

Total public sector sales amount to over \\xc2\\xa34.1 million.BirminghamCambridgeThe introduction of the GDPR in May 2018 as well as anticipated judicial decisions on current legal terms and bases for the transfer of data will also determine the pace of growth of GovTech companies in this segment. LondonBristolThe second driver of growth in this part of the GovTech market has been the increased focus on cybersecurity. The UK has been at the forefront public.ioof developing new cybersecurity technology thanks to a developed ecosystem not least inside government and in the financial services sector. Cambridge in particular is a fertile ground for cybersecurity startups including Public 100 companies like Bitsight Technologies and DarkTrace. Cylon a Londonbased cyber accelerator has also helped scale a number of companies on the list including Hook Intruder Cyberlytic High Side SQR and Immersive. In the National Cybersecurity Strategy 20162021 the \\x0c  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKET  |  19 government announced an investment of  \\xc2\\xa31.9 billion with the aim of boosting cybersecurity and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprotecting critical infrastructure deterring our adversaries and developing whole society capabilities.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d20 In addition the UK exports an estimated \\xc2\\xa31.8 billion of cybersecurity technology according to GCHQ.21 DELIVERY Delivery is a category of the GovTech market focused on the direct delivery of services  from doctors and police officers to employees in job centres and small vital groups such as those responsible for flood management. The segment accounts for 38 percent of companies on our list (but 29 percent when measured by balance sheet strength) making it one of the areas in GovTech which has attracted very strong investment. There are over 4.2 million UK employees who operate on the frontline delivering public sector services.22 Companies who in particular deliver innovative mobile platforms and payments technology will enhance the ability of these civil servants to perform and meet the needs of their citizens.One startup Govcoin has piloted with the Department for Work and Pensions in a scheme that allows welfare claimants to open virtual jam jars for various expenses and receive their benefits instantly which are recorded on a decentralised public ledger using blockchain technology. If Govcoin can help government reduce errors from welfare payments it could potentially save \\xc2\\xa33.5 billion annually which is the amount the government overpays due to fraud claimant error and official error.23 NERVECENTRE Nervecentre provides a mobile platform to hospitals to help manage workflows. The company provides a range of services including electronic whiteboards that allow doctors to monitor patients\\xe2\\x80\\x99 vitals from their phones mobile task management ensuring that clinicians can communicate with each other about patients and mobile \\xe2\\x80\\x9chandovers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that allow doctors to share information about patients with other doctors and nurses with greater ease.Nervecentre is a bootstrapped business that is approaching \\xc2\\xa310 million in annual recurring revenue and works with over 30 NHS trusts. The UK is increasingly mobile with 125 mobile phone subscriptions for every 100 inhabitants.24 This is leading to increasing demands for smart public sector delivery. For example social workers are now using third party apps to communicate with atrisk children. A company called Echo allows users to make requests for new medication through its app. These requests are then sent to an NHS GP for approval. Lastly there is a significant influx of innovative healthcare and education software companies. Among our Public 100 companies look at accuRx which reduces the negative externalities of antibiotics by keeping track of prescriptions in real time or at Little Bridges a company that helps children learn language skills through creating interactive profiles or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cavatars\\xe2\\x80\\x9d online that allow them to communicate with other children.

Accessible at https//www.24 cia.gov/library/publications/theworldfactbook/geos/uk.html\\x0c20  |  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKETINFRASTRUCTURE The infrastructure category of the Public 100 list accounts for 8 percent of the companies. Growth in this area will primarily come from three areas transportation data storage and embedded technology (public realm Internet of Things). Transport for London (TfL) has been on the cutting edge of innovation with its work on open data cycling superhighways and pilot projects. One company Calipsa has been working on a pilot with the Department for Transportation (DfT) to add an additional layer of artificial intelligence to automate the surveillance of camera feeds which is estimated to have saved up to \\xc2\\xa33.2 million. Joyride one of the Public 100 startups has worked with transport authorities to collect data through their sensors and software on where parents cycle with children to help design safer bike lanes for cyclists. As cities like Manchester and Birmingham take greater control of their transport systems there are likely to be new commercial opportunities for startups in this segment of the GovTech market. Data storage is another key area for innovation. Data storage infrastructure will need to develop to support the requirements from new technologies and services. While larger companies have traditionally dominated this market new solutions and companies will emerge in this area as several large highprofile IT contracts wind down. We believe this could be a large and profitable segment of the market in future.Embedded technology in the form of sensors in the public realm will enable the monitoring of traffic flows poor air quality walking and cycling. Data gathered from this will be the foundations for new policy solutions by city government tackling issues which are growing in importance to citizens and firmly on the political agenda.CITYMAPPERCitymapper which has raised \\xc2\\xa332 million from a number of notable investors including Facebook board member Yuri Milner and Benchmark Capital is often considered a consumer rather than GovTech company. However Citymapper is on the cutting edge of a larger trend of consumer companies like Airbnb and Lyft looking at government as a vertical. Citymapper released a new smart bus route called the CMX1 earlier this year based on accumulated journey data. Citymapper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s software will rethink current bus routes and provide new and better routes augmenting London\\xe2\\x80\\x99s public transport efficiency.PARTICIPATION Participation is still a developing area of GovTech. It refers to engagement between governments and citizens  whether this is voting complaint procedures or plebiscites. Today it accounts for 10 percent of the Public 100 companies. This category of GovTech companies covers a wide range of purposes. Some companies are bridging social media and government services to give deeper and more immediate insight into citizen sentiment. While most platforms facilitate connections between citizens or between citizens and government we have seen other applications that connect civil servants local community leaders and even government contractors. Public 100 company Apolitical is a social media platform that connects civil servants around the world who are tackling similar problems. It provides case studies of what is being tried elsewhere. It makes connections between experts and their government counterparts who can help officials in their work. They have contracts with the UK Cabinet Office and the governments of Australia and the UAE and are supported by the European Union. Represent.me is a representative democracy platform enabling online deliberation and data gathering on government or community proposals to assist better civic decisionmaking. Clients include unions and public agencies.\\x0c  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKET  |  21 NOVOVILLENovoville is great example of how citizen engagement has moved into the 21st century. A recurring concern has been the inability of governments to communicate with citizens and viceversa. This could be anything from failing to alert certain residents that their property may be flooded or simply asking for feedback via an online survey for a planned project.Novoville helps to bridge the gap between citizens and their local governments. With the help of a mobile app citizens can file reports or requests to their council express their opinion for the future of their neighborhood and get updates on important events. All of the requests are forwarded to the council dashboard in real time. This helps councils assign and resolve requests faster and more efficiently. Any update on the progress of your requests is communicated back to the phone of the citizen. An impressive 78 percent of requests citizens submit through the app are settled within one week generating more efficient outcomes. Novoville is already operating in 40 cities across Europe.\\x0c22  |  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKETREGULATION In the near future regulation is set to become an area of growth in the GovTech market. After the 2008 financial crisis the mood in the UK became less favourable towards lighttouch regulation resulting in stronger legislation regarding financial services. Companies and governments are taking due diligence more seriously. We have seen a number of startups fill demand for products that facilitate compliance in the public and private sectors. A common problem faced by both government and the financial sector is how to update operational processes to meet changing regulations. PassFort a UKbased company has developed a Smart Policy software platform that enables businesses to create programmable versions of paperbased compliance policies. PassFort\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first application of the technology targets AML and KYC regulations. Another heavily regulated area is security and the use of citizen data. In the past the UK Government has struggled to design better policies and use big data due to privacy concerns. Privitar another GovTech company is building a software product that enables its customers to use sensitive personal or confidential citizen data. Using Privitar\\xe2\\x80\\x99s products policy makers will be able to assess the effects of public policy with more evidencebased quantitative methods and an uncompromising approach to data privacy.RECORDSURERecordSure offers a SaaS platform that helps government organisations securely record store and analyse sensitive audio information. In a nutshell RecordSure listens intelligently to conversations between agents/interviewers and customers and automates the assessment of the conversation using artificial intelligence natural language processing and machine learning. In the past governments have tended to use manual taping which is a far less effective and efficient method of recording conversations and until now have had no way of analysing those interactions. The Home Office utilises a bespoke version of RecordSure\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Capture solution to streamline the recording and storage of interviews required for legal purposes.

But the reality is far better than many realise. Governments will always have to jump through various bureaucratic hoops in a way that many private companies will not have to. That is only right and proper; taxpayers money needs to be spent wisely and the everpresent risk of collusion must be guarded against. But years of suboptimal outcomes and a reliance on large vendors who overcharge and struggle to innovate have prompted many government departments both centrally and locally to devote more energy to improving the procurement process. From 2010 onwards the efforts of Francis Maude the then Minister in the Cabinet Office Chief Procurement Officer Bill Crothers and GDS head Mike Bracken helped drive significant steps towards demystifying the procurement process. There are now greater opportunities for smaller firms not least with the introduction of the government digital marketplace GCloud. The commitment to buy 33 percent of public products and services from SMEs is a particularly important change which will benefit GovTech startups. Sales cycles today are significantly less complicated than even a few years ago. And while the UK still operates under an EU and OECD framework  and will presumably do so in the foreseeable future  this provides plenty of leeway to make changes happen. From HMRC to the DVLA digitallycapable leaders have brought scores of startups into government to transform services. Most departments have also brought in senior CTOs from the private sector who may be better equipped to understand how to benefit from the new capabilities startups can bring to government. And the Crown Commercial Service the UK government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s procurement agency is changing the way government buys products. It will hopefully build on the success of GCloud. Based on Public\\xe2\\x80\\x99s conversations with 25 companies at funding stages ranging from seed to series C and with aggregate government contracts from just \\xc2\\xa32000 to \\xc2\\xa34.4 million in the UK sales cycles  which we define as proof of concept to production  took between two months and 18 months. And we have identified three recurring themes that have helped \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwinners\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to succeed in this sales process. These are (i) compliance; (ii) route to market; and (iii) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmissionism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Our evidence suggests it is possible to shorten government sales cycles to as little as three months depending on the size of contracts and the government entity.\\x0c24  |  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKETProcurement Process Route to marketDecide methodSales process Small contractsSales processLarge contracts4 routes to market1Free trial2System integrator/B2B3Pilots competitions and open calls4Framework agreement/B2GSales process for small contractsFor lower thresholds the OJEU offers some suggested proceduresUnder \\xe2\\x82\\xac5k1+ supplier quoteSelect lowest quote\\xe2\\x82\\xac550k3+ suppliers with written quotesSelect most suitable offer\\xe2\\x82\\xac50106k5+ suppliers with written quotesSelect suitable offerMEATCriteria for supplier selectionSales process for large contractsOJEU Regulation Application (\\xc2\\xa3k)10 DaysOther suppliers can contest decisionRelevant framework\\xc2\\xa3106kor\\xc2\\xa3164kCentral GovOther contracting authorities1Business caseSupplier sectionWinner awardFinal decisionTendersElectronic Dailypublic.io\\x0c  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKET  |  25 IT IS POSSIBLE TO SHORTEN GOVERNMENT SALES CYCLE TO AS LITTLE AS THREE MONTHSspace including compliance route to market and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmissionism.\\xe2\\x80\\x9dWe define \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMissionism\\xe2\\x80\\x9d as as a sincere desire to improve society. Our evidence suggests that it is possible to shorten government sales cycles to as little as three months depending on the size of contract and procuring governmental entity.Competitions open calls and pilots Government is increasingly adopting new approaches to meeting citizen or service needs. CivTech 2.0 supported by the Scottish Government is perhaps the leading example of an applied challenge/open call approach to the GovTech sector.  Rather than offering specific requirements for tender CivTech invites entrepreneurs to offer innovative solutions in a governmentbacked programme.25 In other instances government may be open to free trials or pilots. There are two reasons for offering a free trial. First software companies who have low implementation costs (e.g. SaaS) should offer trials for free. Second free trials may make sense if the solution is a very new approach to a public sector problem (e.g. accuRx a company which reduces negative externalities from antibiotics through working with clinics). There are exceptions for example if implementation costs are high most companies do charge for a more formal pilot. Due to the dearth of guidance available a standardised pilot value is difficult to quantify. For more information please see 25 https//civtech.atlassian.net/wikiHOW THE PROCESS WORKSThe cycle can be broken into four sections (i) preprocurement work; (ii) the tendering and awards phase; (iii) postacceptance negotiations and delivery scoping in the contract; and (iv) supplier management.There are four routes to market when selling to government. There are two direct sales methods which can take the form of either (i) a freetrial format; or (ii) a sale to a systems integrator (SI) that has an existing contract or that sits upon a framework agreement. Alternatively companies can sell directly to government through a pilot or funded competitions. (These pilots tend to be of smaller contract value and are therefore less onerous on both buyer and seller during the procurement phase.) Going through a framework agreement is the fourth and most onerous form of sale. This is a necessary procedure for more complex projects which require thorough diligence on the part of the government to establish the strongest bidder. For these last two routes to market we present a detailed procurement roadmap showing that for smaller value contracts the process is much simpler with none of the Official Journal of the European Union (OJEU) restrictions. It is only when contract values rise above \\xc2\\xa3164000 for local authorities and above \\xc2\\xa3106000 for central government that OJEU regulations kick in and a corresponding tendering process is required.Government sales cycles  Long government sales cycles are often described as the most challenging barrier to entry in the GovTech market. But they can also provide a competitive advantage by keeping potential competitors (who may be less ready less motivated or less informed) out of the bidding process.Length of sales cycle Based on conversations over the past six months with 25 companies between seed and series C funding stages who have sold between \\xc2\\xa32000 to \\xc2\\xa34.4 million to the UK government the case is more optimistic. The sales cycle which we define as proof of concept to production took between two months and 18 months. We have identified three recurring themes that have helped successful bidders to overcome hurdles and succeed in the GovTech \\x0c26  |  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKETSystems integrators (SIs) a simple route to market  Systems integrators offer a sustainable strategy for international expansion regulatory compliance and sales. Some startups choose to sell directly to an SI which helps them generate scale and achieve public sector delivery credibility. The benefit to SIs is the ensuing ability to offer innovative and cuttingedge technology as part of their proposition to government without the need to build such tools inhouse. In city government London Ventures is a partnership between the private sector (EY acting as an SI) and London Councils aimed at codesigning and scalingup a cohort of SMEdeveloped services across the capital\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 32 boroughs.FRAMEWORKS  the most common route to market  A framework agreement acts as a preferred supplier list public sector bodies will often only procure from companies who are suppliers listed on the framework. The Crown Commercial Service (CCS) which is the body offering procurement services to the public sector has many active frameworks but the most used framework for technologybased companies is the GCloud.GCloud is now in its 9th iteration and boasts an SME spend ratio which consistently outstrips public sector averages. Acceptance to the framework is far from a guarantee of work because there are formal tenders for contracts which are put to companies on the framework. However acceptance is a big step to achieving scale in the public sector arena. There are recurring application windows in which new companies can apply to join the framework.COMPANIES SHOULD BE ABLE TO SHORTEN THEIR SALES CYCLES AND BECOME VIABLE CONTENDERS IN THE GOVTECH MARKET.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cMISSIONISM\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  the importance of a social motivation GovTech companies should be able to demonstrate their social value and ideally in some quantitative manner. The importance of social impact has been driven by the Social Value Act which was passed in 2013 to mandate that commissioners think about social environmental and economic benefits before procuring contracts at higher thresholds. Firesouls a UKbased startup helps companies comply with the Social Value Act by finding them social community partners with whom to work.  There is room for improvement. Obstacles still exist mainly around transparency  startups feel \\xe2\\x80\\x9copen competition\\xe2\\x80\\x9d doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t exist. In addition the sales process is made more difficult by an inability to interact directly with relevant government entities (i.e. detailed technical RFPs are not written by those providing the relevant services). Companies should be able to shorten their sales cycles and become viable contenders in the GovTech market. To achieve this they will need to (i) strategise around regulatory compliance; (ii) keep in mind implementation costs while offering pilots; (iii) find solid partners; and (iv) prove their social mission.\\x0c  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKET  |  27 CONCLUSIONThe UK already has an established and worldleading technology sector and is also recognised as a digital superpower. But the competition is intensifying and over the coming years we will see further challenges emerging. Most recently larger countries such as the United States Canada and France have begun following pioneers like Denmark Estonia and Singapore into the GovTech arena.  The advancement in the digital transformation of UK public services which began in earnest in 2009 is now entering a new phase as technological capability improves.These technological improvements combined with the existing digital talent pool in the UK and the access to capital should create a golden opportunity for the UK to become the GovTech centre of the world. The stage is set for a boom which will create a large number of GovTech companies and generate a great number of jobs. At the same time this industry will provide better and cheaper public services. And it will show that the many digital advances of recent years have not just made shopping easier or helped a small metropolitan elite but have also been able to help solve real societal problems and bring benefits to every segment of our country. However policymakers from central to local government must support GovTech if the potential dividends both commercial and societal are to be realised. That means finding ways to incentivise the adoption of new technologies within the public sector and proactively thinking about easing the procurement process for startups. WE BELIEVE THAT  THE NEXT FEW YEARS WILL BE SPECTACULAR FOR UK GOVTECH AND  AS A RESULT FOR THE  UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99S DIGITAL ECONOMYIt also means helping GovTech firms export and ensuring that postBrexit GovTech companies can continue to access talent investment and overseas markets. The process of transformation must not simply see large vendor contracts roll over. When buying the next generation of systems and tools the government must have the courage and foresight to give startups a fair crack at the commercial opportunities. The Public 100 list demonstrates a depth in the GovTech market  the list contains many commercially solid earlystage and highgrowth startups that are designing products purposefully built for the public sector. The GovTech market can and will grow and it is already quite impressive. We believe that the next few years will be spectacular for UK GovTech and as a result for the UK\\xe2\\x80\\x99s digital economy. Few countries have the kind of opportunity that the UK now has the full extent of which we hope we have shown in this inaugural report. We will do whatever we can to seize this opportunity and we hope that you  whether you are an innovator investor public sector buyer or policy maker  will join us in seizing it. \\x0c20%18%18%17%15%22%28  |  STATE OF THE UK GOVTECH MARKET21%21%15%18%37%33%34%33%36%FY13FY14FY15FY16FY17YTDSource Porge IlluminatorSoftware Applications Development & SupportNetwork & Comms ServicesBack Office Admin ServicesICT Support Services & Systems IntegrationFY13FY14FY15FY16FY17YTDAirwave Solutions Atos Aspire (consortium) BT Group Capgemini  Capita CSC Fujitsu Hewlett Packard IBM Leidos EuropeSerco GroupSopra Steria VodafoneOthersSource Porge IlluminatorHistory of UK Digital Government ReformDigital Britain report pledges to make UK a leader in the global digital economyNew agenda set for digital government and crossgovt spending controls2012.

Looking at current spend on innovation and forecast to the end of 2017 we compounded the growth of these investments as an asset class out to 2025 giving a valuation of about \\xc2\\xa3300 million by 2025. What is missing here is truly new technology. Further studies will need to spend time understanding which emerging technologies are transforming the public sector and aim to quantify concretely the expected value this could provide and this how much the public sector would compensate for the service.Positive externalities of private companies really consist of the value added by companies whose product enhances citizen experience. The archetypal example given here is CityMapper. Most of the companies that we studied do not have revenues. One approach could have been to make some assumptions around the value added back to the economy for time savings happiness gains etc. however it was considered more prudent to consider the investment in R&D made by the public sector and by venture capitalists in GovTech. R&D spend is taken from figures published by ONS venture capital investment was measured from PwC\\xe2\\x80\\x99s study into GovTech deals. For venture capital returns we looked at Preqin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s global summary of private equity and venture capital and picked the median rate of return actually achieved globally by private capital (1214 percent) to compound venture investment.As we expand upon our work more will be done to build a bottomup model based on industry activity. Although we must be clear that the GovTech market is larger than simply IT expenditure we believe that a good base to start from is the government spend on ICT. In 2015 this was about \\xc2\\xa36.6 billion and if we look at BPO expenditure we get a combined spend of \\xc2\\xa312 billion. These numbers are based on Tussell data and Porge data sourced from actual invoices respectively. This is therefore considered a low estimate of the market but we believe that prudence in establishing a base is best practice. In sizing the net new contract opportunities we have looked at annualised ICT & BPO expenditure (again this is conservative when compared to the true value of the market). We took the cumulative growth rate from 20112015 and projected this out to 2025. We chose not to adjust for inflation etc. because we are currently in a highinflationary period and hence this may overestimate growth figures. From here we assumed that the government would achieve its desired 33 percent ratio of procurement from SMEs and took this expenditure as the baseline for net new contracts. We took the sum of contracts spanning 2024 to 2026 because it would be incorrect to assume that all contracts fall for renewal within any one year and therefore it is deemed appropriate to take 3 years as a proxy contract length and sum over three years. In truth many of the larger contracts extend beyond three years and therefore we are again erring on the side of caution here.One important assumption we made in both the new technologies and positive externalities calculations was the rate of return on investments in innovation. Taking the riskfree rate of return at the end of November 2016 (when a lot of investment was announced in emerging technology 26) which was 4.53 percent we assumed that for any rational investor to supply capital to a nascent market they would expect to receive at least twice the riskfree rate of return to compensate for the implicit risk of earlystage investment in GovTech. This gives us a projected annual rate of return of 9.06 percent; and this is the rate at which we have compounded capital gains.HM Government (2017). Industrial Strategy.

Structure is simple. We only included companies with a corporate status. No joint ventures or subsidiaries.Company size was the differentiator for us.
