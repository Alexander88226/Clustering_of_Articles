Disruptive information technologies such as business intelligence cloud big data and analytics continue to evolve as they combine with the Internet of Things (IoT) and other catalyzing platforms. Other trends in technology such as augmented reality blockchain advanced robotics virtual reality 3D printing drones machine learning and many others are rapidly accelerating [2]. Additionally  some  fundamental  forces  are  constantly  driving  and  facilitating  changes  in  business  and economy.  These  include  globalization  climate  change  and  the  environment    the  innovation  economy urbanisation connected living crowd funding and so forth[2]. Overall these emerging trends are reshaping and dramatically transforming the way we live and work [3]. While new opportunities are emerging new trends may also cause a threat as they require changing the current way of doing business which might impact profitability [4].Nevertheless there are many great examples of successful integration of new trends in technology business and society with existing business activities to realize new opportunities as well as to catalyse changes in the  related  markets  industries  and  sectors.  Understanding  the  key  trends  is  therefore  the  first  step  of sensing the business environment and integrating them in the business.This research project involved investigating key trends \\xe2\\x80\\x93 technology business and social \\xe2\\x80\\x93 relevant to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) in Queensland.  It also explored the key challenges businesses face and what kinds of government support could be provided to cope with the advances in the digital economy. SMEs (those hiring less than 200 people) represent about 99.7% of the businesses with a share of 70% of total employment in Australia. They are the most important source of innovation in the economy and key driver of future economic growth [5]. Researchers and practitioners argue that the technology adoption rates in smaller sized businesses is weak [6]. Our goal is to create awareness towards the emerging trends and examine policy options to cope with challenges in the digital future. 4QUT Chair in Digital Economy\\x0cStudy MethodIn late 2016 the Queensland Government Department of Science Information Technology and Innovation (DSITI) engaged the Chair in  Digital  Economy  (the  Chair)  based  at  Queensland  University of  Technology  (QUT)  to  perform  environmental  scanning  on the  emerging  trends  which  are  expected  to  impact  SMEs.  An extensive literature review was undertaken and survey instruments were  developed  for  technology  business  and  social  trends.  The instruments also included aspects of challenges to cope with the trends and were piloted extensively with domain expert researchers at  QUT  industry  representatives  and  businesses  during  February to  March  2017.  An  online  survey  was  then  conducted  targeting Queenslandbased businesses. Given below are further details on the research process. Research problemThere is a lack of research on the technology business and societal trends in the SME context. Secondly there is a lack of research in Australian  and  Queensland  contexts.  Existing  research  describes environmental  scanning  as  a  necessary  precondition  to  strategy formulation by firms as understanding the external environment helps  firms  to  develop  their  responses  and  to  secure  or  improve future position. This research will provide helpful input in this regard. Review of literature An  extensive  literature  review  was  conducted  to  get  insight  into the emerging technology business and social trends and to shape the questions to be asked to the businesses. A brief result from the literature survey is presented in the later part of this section.Development and testing of the survey questionnaire Based  on  the  review  of  literature  questions  for  an  online  survey were developed focusing on the emerging trends challenges and barriers  SMEs  face  to  cope  with  the  changes  and  their  business performance  as  well  as  what  government  could  do  to  support businesses  to  cope  with  the  challenges.  The  survey  instruments were  tested  rigorously  with  five  companies  before  launching  to participants. Appendix 1 provides the questionnaire for the survey.  Implementation of the online survey The online survey tool KeySurvey was used to conduct the survey. Because there are no known public databases which provide details of  the  owners/managers  of  firms  the  survey  was  administered through  the  QUT\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Chair  in  Digital  Economy  and  Department  of Science Innovation and Information Technology (DSITI) websites. Social  media  channels  such  as  Twitter  and  LinkedIn  were  used to  encourage  businesses  to  participate  in  the  survey.  Owners/managers of 51 companies in Queensland participated the survey. Analysis and presentation of results The  survey  data  were  downloaded  in  an  Excel  spread  sheet  and analyzed by means of descriptive statistics.Research limitationsThere are a number of limitations to this study. The first limitation is the small sample size. This is due to difficulties with  identifying  or  accessing  email  addresses  of  the  owners/executives of Queensland firms. We recommend a more detailed and larger study to provide more conclusive findings. The second limitation is that we cannot conclude any interaction between technology business and social trends that is technological changes causing other trends to occur or vice versa. A qualitative type of study would be required in order to test causality. The third limitation of this study rests on the data collection through an  online  process.  There  might  be  biases  inherent  in  the  data collection process due to lack of Internet access and/or experience 5Environmental Sensing Report\\x0cwith  electronic  surveys.  There  might  be  concerns  over  possible security or confidentiality issues. The most prevalent and disruptive technology trends common in existing literature areInternet of Things (IoT) \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Artificial Intelligence and Automation of Knowledge Work \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Big Data/ Advanced Data Analytics \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Cloud Technology \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Autonomous & SemiAutonomous Vehicles \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Robotics Other disruptive technologies mentioned in the literature include augmented reality Blockchain virtual reality advance materials and nanotechnology  energy  storage  renewable  energy  advanced  oil and gas exploitation and recovery drones and nextgen genomics. Appendix A provides some definitions of these technologies.

The Queensland EconomyWith  a  Gross  State  Product  (GSP)  of  314.5  billion  in  the  2015  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 16  financial  year  Queensland  is  the  third  largest  economy  in Australia. The Queensland economy is primarily built upon mining agriculture tourism and financial services. Aided by a strong export portfolio of coal metals meat and sugar; the  economy  experienced  a  period  of  robust  economic  growth during 1992 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2008 (17 consecutive years) (Figure 1). The pace of economic growth was disrupted significantly following the Global Financial Crisis in 2008 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 09. Population growth though historically steady at 2% has declined moderately in recent years (Figure 2). The relative change of these two factors led to a decline in the growth of income per capita in recent years \\xe2\\x80\\x93 recovery of this remains a key challenge for the government in the coming years.     Figure 1 Growth in Gross State Product and resident population in Queensland (19872016)  Source  Cat  no  3101.0  Australian  Demographic  Statistics  and  Cat  no  5220.0 Australian National Accounts State Accounts.

Australian Bureau of Statistics. 7Environmental Sensing Report\\x0cOther  changes  include  major  demographic  shifts  towards  the increase in elder populations relative to other age groups with the ratio projected to rise in the future in Australia (Figure 3). While these changes pose greater challenges for the government in terms of greater  demand  for  age  pensions  and  healthcare  spending  the ageing  population  is  an  asset  as  elders  provide  a  wealth  of  skills knowledge wisdom and mentorship[17]. The digital economy will be able to provide a great opportunity to embrace digital life and contribute productively to the economy.  Technological changes are shaping society and its norms and values (referred  to  as  digital  immersion).  On  the  other  hand  growing demand and expectations are putting pressure on resources leading to  a  greater  level  of  calls  to  produce  more  from  less  (innovation economics) [17]. We can therefore expect very challenging years for the Queensland and Australian economies ahead. Figure 3 Population Growth Indices in Australia by age groupSource Australian Treasury https//demographics.treasury.gov.au/content/_download/australias_demographic_challenges/html/adc04.aspOther challenges such as climate change and globalization continue to influence business and the economy. With the unprecedented growth  in  Internet  technology  the  world  has  become  more connected and people are moving at a faster pace to communicate with  each  other  and  obtain  information.  All  economic  agents (citizens businesses and governments) are moving to a connected virtual world to access and deliver services reduce market failure and exploit business opportunities. 8QUT Chair in Digital Economy\\x0c9Environmental Sensing Report\\x0cTECHNOLOGY TRENDS AND CHALLENGES10QUT Chair in Digital Economy\\x0cDisruptive potential of technologies to impact business and industry \\xe2\\x80\\x98D\\xe2\\x80\\x99 curve\\xe2\\x80\\x98Disruptive  technology\\xe2\\x80\\x99  is  technology  which  has  the  potential  to transform life business and the economy. However the extent of disruption  differs  widely  between  different  technologies.  This  is shown in the figure below which indicates the differential potentials of  technologies  to  impact  Queensland  businesses  and  industries in the next 12 to 24 months. We plot this as a disruptive \\xe2\\x80\\x98D\\xe2\\x80\\x99 curve (Figure 4). In our survey the disruptive potentials of any specific technology (e.g. 3D printing) were measured on sixpoint Likert scale (Very high potential  High  Potential  Moderate  Potential  Low  Potential  Very Low Potential and Not Sure). Respondents were asked to rate the disruptive potentials for various technologies. Based on the overall response  for  these  different  types  of  technologies  a  potential disruptive  score  was  developed.    According  to  the  disruptive  \\xe2\\x80\\x98D\\xe2\\x80\\x99 curve  in  Figure  4  the  top  most  disruptive  (very  high  and  high) technology is found to be \\xe2\\x80\\x98business intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x99 which is given a score  of  100.  Other  technologies  were  scored  relative  to  business intelligence.  Following  business intelligence  the  other  most potentially disruptive technologies are cloud based solutions highspeed  wireless  INTERNET  digital  technology  platforms  artificial intelligence Internet of Things (IoT) open data infrastructure and intelligent apps and others as presented in the disruptive \\xe2\\x80\\x9cD\\xe2\\x80\\x9d curve figure. Why do some technologies qualify as more disruptive than others? This depends on the particular context in which a business operates. For  example  in  the  small  business  environment  the  choice  of \\xe2\\x80\\x98business intelligence\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as most potential technology makes sense as most business executives in this environment have just started to understand the power of data and its potential use in strategic decisionmaking  [18].  Clearly  this  trend  reflects  the  new  ways  of making business decisions and improving business performance. Similarly cloud computing is thought to be hugely disruptive due to its potential to displace traditional inhouse storage of information. The survey results indicate the availability of \\xe2\\x80\\x98high speed wireless Internet  technology\\xe2\\x80\\x99  as  a  potential  disruptive  technology.  Whilst Telstra has recently launched a new 4G highspeed network having a reliable and highspeed Internet connectivity remains a key issue for small businesses in Queensland[19 20]. The Quarter 3 2016 State of the Internet Report ranked Australia 50th for its average Internet connection speeds and found that almost a quarter of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s population still receives less than half of the national average speed (9.6 Mbps) [20]..Figure 4 Disruptive \\xe2\\x80\\x98D\\xe2\\x80\\x99 curve of technologies11Environmental Sensing Report\\x0c Technology horizon present and future use of technologies  Survey participants were asked whether they would consider using any  of  these  technologies  in  their  own  business.  Respondents provided feedback on a fivepoint Likert point scale A. Yes already in use B. Yes would consider use within 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 2 years C. Yes would consider use in 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 5 years D. No not applicable to the business E. Not sure. We refer to this technology horizon as the data provides a good understanding of present and future use of technologies in the next five years. The summary results are presented in Figure 5 below. In Figure 5 the red bars represent the present use of technologies. The yellow and red bars represent the possible use of a technology in  next  12  years  and  35  year  respectively.  The  number  within  a specific colour of a bar represents the percentage of total responses for each technology. Note the total numbers in a bar do not add to  100  but  the  gap  represents  the  Likert  point  scale  D  and  E  as described above.    According the Figure 5 the five mostused technologies at present are cloud based solutions digital technology platform highspeed wireless  Internet  business  intelligence  and  intelligent  apps.  The five highest potential use of technologies in the next two years are business  intelligence  adaptive  security  architecture  augmented reality open data infrastructure artificial intelligence and machine learning.  Again  in  3  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  5  years  the  highest  potential  technologies would be virtual reality energy storage perovskite solar cells (high efficiency  solar  power  cells)  blockchain  and  adaptive  security architecture (Figure 5).In Use12 years35 years12Figure 5 Use of technology in 05 year horizon.QUT Chair in Digital Economy\\x0cTechnology challenges in your businessbusiness processes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as a major challenge for them.  From  asking  respondents  about  the  technology  challenges  a number  of  important  issues  emerged.  The  survey  respondents voted  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x98cost  of  technology  investment\\xe2\\x80\\x99  as  being  the  top information technology challenge. The telecom market in Australia is highly monopolized with Telstra the largest network provider in the country charging some of the highest Internet pricing in the world. It is claimed that bandwidth pricing in Australia is 17 times higher than the benchmark in Europe [21]. The cost of technology investment does not only come from the cost of Internet but also from the associated cost of data analytics and the cost of employees. The survey respondents indicated \\xe2\\x80\\x98aligning information technology processes to business process\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is a key challenge. The CEO of one of the companies mentioned \\xe2\\x80\\x98the time it takes to align IT processes to Among  others  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Internet  connectivity\\xe2\\x80\\x99  \\xe2\\x80\\x98reliability  of  technology\\xe2\\x80\\x99 \\xe2\\x80\\x98difficulties  in  selecting  appropriate  technology\\xe2\\x80\\x99  and  \\xe2\\x80\\x98time  to make changes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 remain as key challenge for the businesses. Figure 6 shows the information technology challenges identified by the businesses.Survey participants indicate risk management and IT abuse and fraud  as  the  least  challenging  issues  for  them.  However  this finding  does  not  reflect  the  relative  importance  of  the  issues. Rather relative challenges SMEs face especially in the context of their digital maturity. Previous studies indicate a lack of awareness about  IT  risk  management  issues  in  SMEs  (http//www.dcs.gla.ac.uk/~karen/pdf/flyerReport.pdf).  However  we  leave  indepth analysis of this issues for our next research.Figure 6 Information technology challenges in the businessNote  Respondents  were  asked  to identify three challenges at most.13Environmental Sensing ReportCost of technology investmentInternet connectivityTime to make changes and adjustGovernance (policies and implementation)Aligning IT processes to business processesDif\\xef\\xac\\x81culties in selecting particular technologyEmployee acceptance on technologyOperating cost of technologyITReturn from IT investmentRisk managementIT abuse and fraudLack of info on new techCustomer acceptance on  new technologyReliability of new technology40%35%31%27%25%25%21%17%15%13%8%8%8%6%2%Information technology challenges in the business\\x0cPace of technological change relative to businessRegarding the pace of technological change relative to business the survey respondents provided mixed results. About 48% of the survey respondents believe technology is moving at a faster pace than  their  business  can  comprehend  while  the  rest  voted    \\xe2\\x80\\x98No\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and  \\xe2\\x80\\x98Not  sure\\xe2\\x80\\x99  (Figure  7).  On  the  other  hand  more  than  60%  of the respondents defined themselves as a first mover on trusted technology (Figure 8). Nonetheless a generic conclusion from the results  in  Figure  8  is  difficult  to  make  as  those  people  having  a good  sense  of  the  external  environment  and  technology  might tend  to  participate  the  survey.  Accordingly  the  relative  weight of  the  options  in  Figure  8  may  change  when  a  larger  sample can  be  employed.  Our  results  indicate  that  a  large  segment  of participating companies still find technological integration a key challenge for their business (as discussed in the previous section that \\xe2\\x80\\x98aligning IT processes to business process\\xe2\\x80\\x99 was ranked second most important challenge for their business). The CEO of one of the companies identified \\xe2\\x80\\x98the time it takes to align IT processes to business processes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as a major challenge for them.Figure 7 Pace of technological change (Q.

These  trends  emerge  regardless of the demographic characteristics of a company. Business trends can be found in the creation of new products or services in new business models or in the environment.Queensland  businesses  view  some  business  trends  as  more dominant  than  others.  The  top  three  emerging  business  trends are  data  and  analytics  digital  product  and  services  and  digital entrepreneurship  (Figure  9).  These  trends  reflect  advances  in digital economy and are consistent with the technology trends as discussed above (e.g. business intelligence which deals with a huge amount  of  data).  The  demand  for  \\xe2\\x80\\x98data  and  analytics\\xe2\\x80\\x99  has  grown rapidly in recent years and there might be a great opportunity for startups and entrepreneurs in the Queensland context. The Chief Executive Officer of one food manufacturing company commented that they spend a huge amount of money for social analytics from a  USbased  company  yet  they  are  not  happy  with  the  service provided. If  local  businesses  emerge  providing  similar  services  this  might meet the surge in demand in this field that the results from the survey  indicates.  Policymakers  providing  hubs  and  incentives should  be  aware  of  this  need.  Estimates  find  that  big  data  and analytics could unlock trillions of dollars in business value by 2020. Other  emerging  trends  in  business  are  automation;  the  sharing economy  and  distributed  trust;  customer  empowerment;  social enterprise; the freelance workforce and crowd funding. These are the  emerging  business  models  (e.g.  Uber)  and  will  potentially  be the major thrust for the Queensland economy in the near future. 16Figure 9 Top business trends. Numbers show the % share of respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 preferences over other categories. Total numbers do not add to 100 as respondents were asked to identify a maximum of three top business trends.Figure 10 Interest index on crowd funding in Australia in recent years. Note Numbers represent search interest relative to the highest point on the chart for the given region and time. A value of 100 is the peak popularity for the term. A value of 50 means that the term is half as popular. Likewise a score of 0 means the term was less than 1% as popular as the peak.Source Google Trends (data downloaded 28 May 2017 10.28 pm) QUT Chair in Digital EconomyTop business trends\\x0cData and analytics A key feature of the digital economy is the emergence of a huge amount of unstructured data. Advanced analytics allow businesses to gain insights from this data and improve performance. Estimates find that big data and analytics could unlock trillions of dollars in business value by 2020. Digital product and services The first digital revolution is seeing the emergence of thousands of digital products and services. This includes  both  tangible  products  such  as  smart  phones  digital Television  smart  sensors  to  egoods  such  as  Netflix  ebook Google and Blockchain to name a few. Digitalized services provide a complete new service model with limited human involvement. Digitalised goods and services will drive economic performance and productivity in the future.Automation  Automation  or  automatic  control  is  the  use of  various  control  systems  for  operating  equipment  such  as machinery  processes  networks.  Automation  will  improve productivity  by  saving  labour  per  unit  of  output  and  by improving precision accuracy and quality. However this creates a new threat to employment.Digital  entrepreneurship  Digital  entrepreneurship  is  both  a driver and product of the digital environment. It encompasses both  the  creation  of  new  ventures  and  the  transformation  of existing business models to develop completely new products or services as well as the novel use of existing technologies.  Sharing economy and distributed trust The sharing economy is  the  product  of  the  environment  where  both  physical  and intellectual  assets  can  be  shared  as  services  and  to  make money. Uber is a great example of the sharing economy and so is the social web Botsman which enables programmers to share codes. A key feature of the sharing economy is to create a model of trust in using assets. Customer  empowerment  One  of  the  key  trends  in  the digital economy is engaging and empowering customers. Our  previous  research  on  Queenslandbased  businesses indicates  that  customercentricity is  a  key  feature  of relative  performance  of  firms.  [18].  Successful  firms  in the  digital  economy  not  only  understand  the  customer \\xe2\\x80\\x98pain\\xe2\\x80\\x99 when they think about innovation but also become experts  on  customers  and  allow  personalised  services. For  example  the  Brisbanebased  company  The  Print  bar (http//www.theprintbar.com/)  allows  customers  to  design their  own  Tshirt.  Similarly  USbased  Nordstrom  (http//shop.nordstrom.com/)  which  supplies  globally  offers personalised stylist services to its customers.Social  enterprise  Social  enterprises  are  both  forprofit and  nonprofit  organisations  that  consider  social  values and  responsibilities  as  a  core  aspect  of  their  business. Social enterprises seek to create a win \\xe2\\x80\\x93 win game for both company and society. Freelance workforce In today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy a large number of workers are making the choice to work as a free agent rather than working within the grind of corporations. This transition has been enabled by popular digital freelancing platforms such  as  Upwork.com  and  Freelancer.com.  It  is  estimated that freelancers now make up of 35% of the workforce in the US  economy  and  the  number  is  growing  rapidly  (https//www.upwork.com/i/freelancinginamerica/2016/).  Crowdfunding  Crowd funding is the practice of funding creative projects by raising capital from a large number of people. It evolved rapidly in recent years due to the use of internet platforms (e.g. Kickstarter and IndiGoGo). Interest in crowd funding has surged multifold in recent years. 17Environmental Sensing Report\\x0cSOCIAL TRENDS 18QUT Chair in Digital Economy\\x0cSocial trends that shape life business and economy The  pace  of  technological  progress  is  so  high  that  it  is  shaping societal  norms  and  values.  This  is  reflected  in  the  survey  with about 48% of participants identifying \\xe2\\x80\\x98Digital immersion\\xe2\\x80\\x99 as a top social  trend  in  the  digital  economy.  Technological  advances  are touching every aspect of life from food to travel education to jobs grocery  to  clothing  shelter  to  health  care  and  so  forth.  However technology is not the only force that is driving transition to the new economy. The other important forces of changes are globalization and demographics [15].

Broadly governments can play a major role in setting up the policies and regulations so digital  markets  operate  efficiently.  Governments  also  frame  tax policy  and  spend  money  on  digital  infrastructure.  Government investment and procurement can support local businesses to grow. Our previous report [18] identified three areas where public policy can play a great role to support growth of business. They are \\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Building confidence through bringing people together to share stories of success with others\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Providing incentives that reduce the cost of doing business and\\xe2\\x80\\xa2  Enabling talent with the knowledge skills and ability to build strong firmsIn this report we revisit the policy options with a particular focus given to building the technology capability. The top five preferences are Provide incentives (57%) Government grants and funding (53%) Enable  innovation  through  hubs  and  groups  where  people  can connect (49%) Access to government procurements and contracts (45%)  and  Build  business  confidence  (40%).  Businesses  also viewed  Partnership  between  Public  and  Private  Digitalisation  of government services Improving regulatory framework to support new business models using digital technologies as import supports that government can provide. The CEO of one business mentioned the Cost of compliance as an area where government can pay attention as the business needs to incur the cost at multiple points of the supply chain.

These industries are Beef Education and Training Fintech Health Care and Social Assistance Manufacturing Spatial and Veterinary services. The  case  studies  provide  insights  into  industry  background technological  advances  technology  horizon  and  other  trends and  challenges  relevant  to  these  industries.  While  each  of  these industries  have  different levels  of  technological  uptake  and challenges one common finding from the case studies is that all industries are heavily disrupted by the technological change. Given below are the description of technological disruption in each of the industries.  Queensland beef industry which is the Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest supplier of  beef  and  beef  products  owns  huge  amount  of  data  from  its supply  chain.  Survey  participants  indicate  that  it  is  important  to invest in a data feedback loop to realise the full potential of data and improve efficiency. By analysing the collected data by its processors it is possible to assess the extent and cost of carcass downgrades caused  by  parasites  disease  and  husbandry.  The  most  disruptive effect  on  the  industry  in  the  near  future  will  come  from  mobile internet  blockchain  business  intelligence  cloud  based  solutions open  data  infrastructure  and  DEXA  (advance  body  composition scanning to assess distribution of lean muscle fat water and bone.     Technological changes have significantly disrupted the education and  training  industry  by  transforming  the  way  data  knowledge has been stored accessed disseminated analysed and presented. Augmented  reality  artificial learning intelligent apps and adaptive security architecture are the potential intelligence  machine disruptive  technologies  in  the  near  future  (12  years).  The  top information  technology  challenges  for  this  industry  are  internet connectivity employee acceptance of technology and information technology management.Australian  fintech  industry  which  has  grown  by  more  than  10 times in its size from 2011 to 2016 characterise themselves as first movers in terms of adopting new and trusted technologies. The top information technology challenges for this industry are customer acceptance  of  technology  information  technology  governance and reliability of technology.      The  healthcare  and  social  assistance  industry  which  is  the largest  employer  in  Queensland  over  4  years  has  experienced major technological advances such as robotics surgery 3D imaging information  technology  systems  that  allow  realtime  access to  patient  information  and  online  medical  services.  The  most disruptive effect on this industry in the near future will come from business  intelligence  cloud  based  solutions  intelligent  apps  and digital technology platforms. The  manufacturing  industry  which  is  the  4th  largest  sector  in Queensland  in  terms  value  added  finds  aligning  of  information technology to business process as top technology challenge. Current technological advances in this industry include 3D printing digital engineering  digital  platforms  business  intelligence.

This allows for the creation of unique and sophisticated products without the need for complex equipment.  Although 3D printing technology has been in existence for around 30 years it is becoming cheaper and faster over time leading to more widespread use and increased applications. Adaptive securityAdaptive  security  is  a  flexible  approach  to  safeguarding  systems data whereby security systems are able to recognize threatrelated behaviours as opposed to specific files and codes used by viruses [23].  This  essentially  provides  companies  with  increased  ability to  manage  risk  by  adapting  and  responding  to  a  complex  and constantly changing environment. Artificial Intelligence and automated machine learningArtificial  intelligence  gives  machines  and  systems  the  ability  to acquire and apply the knowledge needed to carry out tasks that normally  require  human  intelligence.  These  abilities  can  include visual perception speech recognition reasoning decisionmaking and  the  ability  to  move  and  manipulate  objects  [24].  Automated machine learning gives machines the capacity to adapt and change behaviour to overcome inefficiencies [25].Augmented realityAugmented  reality  is  technology  that  superimposes  computergenerated information on a user\\xe2\\x80\\x99s view of the real world \\xe2\\x80\\x93 providing integration of the physical and digital worlds [26].BlockchainBlockchain  is  a  digital  ledger  that  allows  transfer  of  value  within 35Environmental Sensing Report\\x0ccomputer networks without the need of a thirdparty intermediary [27].Business intelligence Business intelligence refers to technology applications and practices for  collection  integration  analysis  and  presentation  of  business information \\xe2\\x80\\x93 to support better business decisionmaking. Business intelligence  technologies  allow  executives  to  easily  interpret  big data to make strategic decisions to exploit business opportunities. Cloud based solution\\xe2\\x80\\x98The  cloud\\xe2\\x80\\x99  is  a  metaphor  for  \\xe2\\x80\\x98the  Internet\\xe2\\x80\\x99  in  Internet  based computing.  Cloud  based  solutions  allow  businesses  to  access different services such as servers storage and applications through the Internet.Digital engineeringDigital  engineering  (also  called  Building  Information  Modelling (BIM))  is  the  process  of  designing  buildings  and  structures collaboratively using a system of computer models as opposed to independent sets of drawings [28].Energy storageEnergy storage systems absorb and release energy on demand to supply energy or power services. This can optimise the performance of existing energy systems and facilitate integration of renewable energy resources [24].GIS technologyGeographic Information Systems (GIS) are computer systems that capture store check and display data related to positions on the Earth\\xe2\\x80\\x99s surface. GIS enables people to more easily see analyze and understand patterns and relationships [29].Highspeed wirelessHighspeed  wireless Internet without wires or cables.36is  technology  that  provides  highspeed Internet of Things (IoT)The  Internet  of  Things  refers  to  a  web  of  sensors  devices  and objects connected via the Internet [24]. The IoT will allow for more efficient allocation of resources and automation with sensors being introduced in homes clothes accessories cities transport energy networks and manufacturing processes [27]. Intelligent appsIntelligent  apps  use  machine  learning  technology  to  analyze historical and realtime data to make predictions and decisions for users [30].Intelligent Things (Robots)A robot is a machine capable of carrying out a complex series of actions automatically. Advanced robotics is already being deployed in  many  fields.  It  is  expected  that  robots  will  disrupt  the  labour markets as a whole in the near future. Open dataOpen  data  is  the  concept  that  public  information  should  be available to be freely used reused and redistributed by anyone for any purpose [31].Perovskite solar cellsPerovskite  solar  cells  are  a  type  of  solar  cell  that  include  the perovskite structure compound as the lightharvesting active layer.
