Innovations and technology will always break first and then the regulation will come as a response that will give legal certainty to these new technologies.Countries should continue to adopt and promote mechanisms in support of entrepreneurship systems and the Fintech sector specifically. ConclusionsCollaboration between the main actors of the ecosystem. Information exchange always allows us to have a better understanding of the operation requirements and processes of innovative models. Combine interests and efforts to promote the development of financial innovation and expand knowledge about the benefits that this sector brings. Even so the region still faces many questions about the perfect path to follow in regulatory terms.Not all enterprises are technological but given the difficulties of growth and the need for adequate support mechanisms government and private sector must focus on the development of technological enterprises that allow the evolution of the digital ecosystem that we search.
