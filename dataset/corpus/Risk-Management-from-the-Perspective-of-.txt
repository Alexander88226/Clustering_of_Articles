Methodology Data were collected in two stages first with face to face interviews and then with an online survey to analyze how startups think and act about risks. After that data was descriptively analyzed and a Pearson correlation was generated to verify patterns in the risk analysis process in the startups. Finally a risk management method adapted to the context of startups was suggested to facilitate the use in this type of company. Findings  As  results  of  this  study  it  was  found  that  startups  view  the  concept  of  risk  in different  ways  and  that  the  lack  of  familiarity  with  this  topic  and  the  empiricism  while analyzing  risks  are  independent  of  the  operating  time  and  capital  invested  in  startups  but those  which  have  a  consolidated  strategy  have  also  better  structured  risk  management processes. Limitations  The  sample  size  used  in  the  research  is  considered  a  limitation  and  may  be expanded in future works for better understanding the startups environment. Practical implications Startups can use this study mainly the adaption suggested in section five to better structure their risk management processes. Originality/value  Literature  regarding  risks  management  does  not  often  include  the innovation  context  of  startups  which  are  companies  that  deal  all  the  time  with  high  risk decisions. This study seeks to help to fill this gap in the literature.  Keywords Risk Startup Risk Management Innovation.  1. Introduction Startups  are innovative by  nature. Thus startups  have the characteristic of being companies that deal with high levels of uncertainty and dynamicity exposed to innumerous risks. Recent cases as the mass employee dismissal at Medium (Feldman 2017) and the bankruptcy of the Brazilian company Fleety (Moreno 2017) at the end of 2016 illustrate the wide range of risks                                                 1 Universidade Federal do Rio Grande do Sul.

ISSN 2183559 that new business  models  face.  Novel  value propositions  are not  being approved that easily by  customers  that  have  never  tried  the  new  ways  of  consumption  upon  which  these  value propositions are built or even by authorities that have the power for regulating controversial aspects  of such  new business  models. Risks of various natures are aplenty in  the context  of startups and often may be fatal (van Gelderen at al. 2005). However  and  despite  the  fact  that  the  discipline  of  Risk  Management  already  offers  a number  of  widely  consolidated  methods  startups  do  not  seem  to  use  the  traditional  tools provided by this research field. Enterprisewide risk management remains largely a topic of interest and practical implementation in large firms with limited applications of technology (K  hler  and  Som  2014)  or  projectlevel  risk  management  in  startups  or  informal  strategies such as tapping personal networks for financial risks (Kim and Vonortas 2014). Discussion on  enterprise  risk  management  in  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs)  is  somewhat fertile (Falkner and Hiebl 2015; Brustbauer 2016) but issues and recommendations are too generic and/or not readily applicable in the context of startups (Naude and Chiweshe 2017). For  instance  there  is  evidence  that  innovationoriented  SMEs  may  be  more  active  in  their risk  management  strategies  (Brustbauer  2016)  but  the  results  do  not  discriminate  startups from traditional innovative SMEs and details on appropriate risk management approaches for each type of SME are lacking.  Overall it can be argued that risk management literature is scarce regarding specific models techniques  and  tools  tailored  towards  startups  which  are  companies  that  have  to  constantly deal with high risk decisions that may mean the upgrowth the continuity or even the end of its activities. It has been hinted that startups do manage risks particularly those that operate in  knowledgeintensive  sectors  but  actual  risk  management  strategies  seem  to  be unsystematic  and  focused  on  risk  mitigation  only  (Kim  and  Vonortas  2014).  The  lack  of resources  for  developing  and  implementing  risk  management  solutions  that  characterizes SMEs especially in the form of specialized staff and/or funding for hiring consultancy firms is  particularly severe in  cashstrapped  startups.  Moreover the issue of balancing innovation (which frequently requires a risk taking orientation) and risk management capability building opens  up  complex  decisions  in  the  context  of  startups  which  are  often  challenged  by concomitant  business  model  experimentation  and  formal  business  structuring  (Gurd  and Helliar  2017).  Finally  the  individual  characteristics  of  startup  founders  and  initial  teams members such as their personalities and social capital resources may impact the importance attributed  to  formal  risk  management  in  such  firms  (Gao  et  al.  2013)  as  well  as  specific measures startups adopt to identify assess and mitigate risks (Kim and Vonortas 2014). This  research  seeks  to  advance  the  understanding  about  risk  management  in  the  context  of startups.  The  objectives  of  the  study  are  (i)  to  understand  how  startups  understand  the concept  of  risks;  (ii)  to  find  out  how/if  practices  of  risk  management  are  adopted  in  those companies;  (iii)  to  suggest  appropriate  risk  management  tools  to  be  used  in  startups.  The study has an exploratory approach and has no ambition of delivering definitive answers to the matter. However it seeks to create initial propositions in the field of risk management in the context of startups that should be further expanded in future research. From a first attempt to diagnose the situation risk management tools and techniques adequate  to the reality of  risk management of those companies are suggested. From that we hope to provide startups with starting guidelines about how to develop effective risk management processes.  2. Literature Review Innovation  in  products  services  and  business  models  has  been  increasingly  present  in  41   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054. ISSN 2183559 dynamic and competitive environments (Teece and Linden 2017) being considered essential to  the  survival  of  companies  in  that  context  (Trott  2012).  However  enterprises  take  risks while innovating (Bessant 2003). In this sense risk is defined by Hubbard (2007) as a state of  uncertainty  in  which  possibilities  of  loss  and  undesirable  results  exist.  Purdy  (2010) presents  the  notion  of  uncertainty  affecting  objectives  while  Damodaran  (2007)  states  that risk is related to the probability of having a different return on investment than expected an approach  that  considers  both  negative  (downside  risk)  and  positive  results  (upside  risk)  a staple of what Verbano and Venturini (2011) call strategic risk management. In this scenario a number of approaches were proposed to manage risks in large firms. ISO 31000  (International  Organization  for  Standardization  2009)  a  derivative  from  the Australian  and  New  Zealander  norm  AS/NZS  4360  (Standards  Association  of  Australia 1999) presents a fivestage risk management process (i) context establishment which is the definition of strategic objectives of the company  and the evaluation  of external  and internal factors  that  may  influence  the  organization  performance;  (ii)  risk  identification  when  some issues as what can happen how when and why are periodically reviewed; (iii) analysis or understanding  of  risks  and  its  consequences  and  probabilities;  (iv)  evaluation  which  is  the stage of analysis about the level of each risk and its priority; and (v) risk treatment. Besides these stages two others occur in between the whole process communication and monitoring (International Organization for Standardization 2009). In  this  sense  the  method  proposed  by  the  Committee  of  Sponsoring  Organizations  of  the Treadway Commission (COSO) brings similar aspects disseminating the notion of Enterprise Risk  Management  (ERM)  (Moeller  2007;  Verbano  and  Venturini  2011).  This  concept  is defined as the process applied when determining the strategy in the whole company aiming to  identify  events  that  might  affect  it  managing  risks  to  generate  a  reasonable  safety  for accomplishing its objectives (Moeller 2007) while also creating a companywide culture or risk management using expected economicfinancial returns as guidelines to identify assess and  manage  many  different  categories  of  risks  (Verbano  and  Venturini  2011).  The  method proposed  by  the  entity  uses  as  stages  (i)  definition  of  internal  environment  (ii)  objectives fixation  (iii)  events  identification  (iv)  risks  evaluation  (v)  risk  response  (vi)  control activities  (vii)  information  and  communication  and  (viii)  monitoring.  That  way  the  ERM acts as a view in every sphere of the company something that can be applied to the startups context  as they  are companies in  initial  stages what  allows better risk analysis and control than in bigger and already consolidated companies. While dealing with complex innovation environments Tidd (2001) points out uncertainty and complexity  as  determinants  in  that  context.  That  way  startups  which  are  organizations created  to  seek  a  repeatable  and  scalable  business  models  (Blank  and  Dorf  2012)  need  to deal  with  these  variables  in  order  to  succeed.  Crossan  and  Apaydin  (2010)  state  that  it  is important to know how to tolerate failures and to be open to risk taking in order to innovate at the  organizational  level.  Besides  they  point  out  the  need  for  establishing  a  link  between results of an innovation and firm performance in appropriating value from innovation. Purdy (2010) affirms that a better consistency in definitions and risk processes leads to a better level of trust in the decisionmaking process which is useful and necessary in the startup context. Bessant  and  Tidd  (2007)  argue  that  the  development  of  new  products  and  services  is  a gradual  process  of  uncertainty  reduction  starting  from  ideas  passing  through  intermediary stages until getting to the success of commercialization.  Startups  which  are  companies  that  constantly  innovate  (Ries  2011)  are  part  of  the  initial stages  of  this  gradual  process  in  which  uncertainty  is  at  its  highest  level.  According  to Beregheh et al. (2009) innovation is considered a process that occurs inside companies and  42   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054. ISSN 2183559 that transforms ideas in new products services or processes providing those companies with better conditions to compete. Crossan and Apaydin (2010) expand the concept considering it both as a process and a result. They present the social sphere in addition to the economic one and include the development of new methods of production and new management systems as types  of  innovation.  Boje  et  al.  (2012)  affirm  that  the  current  competitive  environment  is turbulent and unpredictable and Falconer (2002) points that managers should enable change as  part  of  firmlevel  learning  process.  In  this  sense  Bessant  (2003)  affirms  that  innovative companies constantly reinvent themselves regarding threats and opportunities imposed by the environment which might mean the adoption or creation of new technologies. Firms  thus  must  improve  their  innovation  capabilities  in  order  to  decrease  or  at  least manage the uncertainty associated with innovation generation and adoption. What precisely is innovation capability and what role risk management plays in it is still an open question however.  Gurd  and  Helliar  (2017)  discuss  the  role  of  the  company  leader  as  an  innovation enthusiastic versus a control manager while Hyytinen et al. (2015) show that innovativeness is negatively associated with the subsequent survival of the startups. These discussions show that  startups  are  different  from  smallmedium  sized  traditional  companies  as  they  need  to deal  with  the  issue  of  finding  its  own  business  model  in  a  context  of  high  risk.  As  a consequence traditional management  approaches do not  work in this environment  and tend to lead to failure (Blank; Dorf 2012). Strategic plans are not the best way of planning under change  environments  because  long  term  projections  are  not  reliable.  In  addition  for  a company  which  is  developing  its  product  and  may  change  the  customer  segment  it  is difficult  to  have  a  consistent  strategy  (Ries  2011;  Blank;  Dorf  2012).  To  deal  with  this problem  agile  management  approaches  were  developed  focusing  on  development  cultures that embraced receptiveness acceptance to change and flexibility (Misra et al. 2012; VerduJover  et  al.  2017)  which  may  all  be  antecedents  or  success  factors  in  implementing  risk management  strategies.  Similarly  there  are  many  practices  applied  to  project  management related to change collaborative development value proposition and robustness (Misra et al. 2012; Moran 2015) that may contribute to risk management in startups but they are usually not integrated in a comprehensive solution (Kim and Vonortas 2014). In the Brazilian context factors pointed as contributors to startups discontinuity are invested capital  and  location (Arruda et  al. 2014).  The  same authors show that companies that  have money to run for one year or more in the beginning of their operations have twice the chances of survival than those which have capital to survive less than a year. Besides that companies installed  in  business  incubators  accelerators  or  technologic  parks  have  three  times  less mortality risk than those that do not have access to such protective environments (Arruda et al 2014). This was further investigated by Etges and Souza (2015) who found that startups installed  in  scientific  and  technologic  parks  can  mitigate  many  of  the  risks  which  they  are exposed  to  as  staff  turnover  and  difficulty  of  keeping  up  with  technology.  These  risks  are mitigated due to the fact that the academic environment helps startups to get adequate human capital to  their activities (Etges  and Souza 2015) which may even include  supporting staff with  risk management  capabilities. Regarding  companies    perceptions about  the factors that lead to firm survival product market acceptance harmony between founders and managers    capacity to adapt to the market shifts and needs are highlighted. Lack of commitment by the founders nonalignment between personal and professional interests of the founders and lack of capital to invest in the business are highlighted as the primary failure factors (Arruda et al 2014). Although the lack of a risk management capability has not been explicitly pointed out as a key cause of startup failure the indirect effects of not effectively managing risks may be a potential source of performance impairment that may be fatal to nascent enterprises.   43   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054. ISSN 2183559 3.  Method Despite  being  considered  as  risk  capital  businesses  little  is  said  about  how  startups  may analyze  and  deal  with  risks  that  are  inherent  to  its  corporate  environment.  Therefore  this study is inserted in a fragmented field of research initiatives and there is no consensus about how startups should conduct risk management. Hence this research is exploratory seeking to present the perception of startups leaders about risk in that type of company and developing an  adaption  of  a  risk  management  method  to  the  startups  context.  From  the  results  of  this research  hypotheses  may  be  suggested  and  tested  looking  for  a  general  understanding  of startups behavior regarding risk management. Data collection was executed in two stages. The first one was qualitative in nature and used interviews  with  Brazilian  startup  founders.  Eight  people  from  different  companies  selected by  convenience  and  availability  were  interviewed  with  the  support  of  a  semistructured questionnaire  with  predefined  questions  to  help  the  interviewer  to  guide  the  course  of  the conversation. Questions were allocated in three blocks.  The first  block was a verification of prerequisites for the startup  to  be able to  participate in the study.  As acceptance criteria to  participate in  the survey were considered the following conditions (i) to have a company register (in Brazil it is called CNPJ) criteria that shows a legal  level  of  commitment  of  the  respondent  with  the  company;  (ii)  the  company  received investment either from founders or third parties this presents a financial commitment from the  partners;  (iii)  the  company  have  not  yet  reached  the  breakeven  point  criterion  that characterizes  startups    still  does  not  survive  on  its  own  in  the  market.  Besides  that identification information such as name job title and academic education of the interviewee and firm age were asked. The  second  block  consists  of  qualitative  questions  in  order  to  verify  how  the  company understands analyses and deals with the risks to which it is exposed. Questions were based in the  main  stages  of  risk  management  as  proposed  by  ISO  31000  (International  Organization for Standardization 2009) and general stages such as identification analysis evaluation and treatment  of  the  risks  (Purdy  2010).  Based  on  that  model  the  following  questions  were proposed  (i)  What  do  you  understand  as  risk?;  (ii)  What  are  the  biggest  risks  to  your company today?; (iii) How are risks analyzed in your company? (iv) What is the strategy to deal with those risks? Thus it was possible to semantically  analyze how convergent are the knowledge and practices of risk management among the interviewees. The aim of the third block was to validate the interview and also to understand the company context.  The  following  questions  were  made  (i)  Does  the  company  have  defined  goals  and strategic objectives?; (ii) Does the company have a definition of internal and external factors that  may  impact  its  performance?  Something  like  SWOT  analysis?;  (iii)  What  is  your  risk profile  (prone  moderate  averse  to  risk)?;  What  is  your  company   s  profile  risk  (prone moderate  averse  to  risk)?  Thereby  it  was  possible  to  understand  the  use  or  nonuse  of planning and management practices as well as the company strategic appreciation of risk. The second research stage was quantitative based on results of the first one. The goal of this stage was to get answers to the same questions from the previous stage with a bigger number of startups something that would not be possible through facetoface interviews. Therefore an online survey with the same questions form the first stage was made. The survey was sent to  Brazilian  startups  associations  groups  incubators  accelerators  and  technological  parks. Similar  criteria  were  used  to  validate  answers  (i)  the  startup  should  have  CNPJ  (ii)  the startup  should  have  received  investment  (iii)  the  respondent  should  have  a  management position in the startup. A total of 46 responses were collected and 31 were considered valid  44   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054. ISSN 2183559 according  to  these  criteria.  After  this  data  were  analyzed  by  descriptive  statistics  and  an analysis of Pearson correlation was done between some of the main variables collected in the second stage (Table 1).

The  second  stage  however  generated  a  greater number  of  answers  and  allowed  the  suggestion  of  some  proposals  to  the  process  of  risk management in Brazilian startups.  4.1.    Qualitative Stage Results From  the  first  block  of  questions  it  was  possible  to  briefly  analyze  the  profile  of  the interviewed  companies.  The  evaluated  startups  have  different  backgrounds.  There  are companies  working  in  the  energy  industry  3D  printing  education  knowledge  management and digital marketing. The operating time also varies from six months to three years which could suggest a different maturity level for risk management although that was not identified in  the  quantitative  research  stage.  Some  had  a  low  investment  (four  to  30  thousand  reais) some were funded by public investment from P&D entities (from 100 thousand reais to little more than a half million reais). Lastly there was one company funded by venture capital with six  million  reais  of  investment.  Despite  the  disparity  of  investment  quantities  none  of  the startups got to the breakeven point. Half  of  the  startups  are  installed  in  incubators  and  the  others  in  shared  or  own  offices. Besides  one  of  the  companies  has  Brazilian  founders  but  is  based  on  Canada.  All  of  them have CNPJ with the exception of the foreign company  which has an equivalent  register in Canada. Most of the interviewees are CEOs and all of them are partners of their companies  45   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054. ISSN 2183559 therefore being able to give a clear vision of the intentions and strategies of their business. Analyzing  the  first  question  of  the  second  block  it  is  possible  to  notice  some  negativity attributed  to  the  meaning  of  the  word  risk  by  some     Probability  of  things  going  wrong       Dangers  in  the  path  from  a  starting  point  to  a  final  point        Things  you  cannot  control   . Others  face  risk  as  something  neutral  that  can  be  either  bad  or  good  and  only  one interviewee  used  the  word     opportunity     in  his  answer.  Regarding  to  which  risks  the respondents  identified  as  the  biggest  ones  to  their  companies  three  items  were  highlighted nonacceptance  of  the  value  proposition  by  the  market  problems  related  to  the  Brazilian government such as bureaucracies or high taxes and the lack of enough cash flow to maintain the  company  activities.  It  was  also  observed  that  half  of  the  companies  analyze  risk empirically  and that operating time or investment  don   t correlate with  this aspect  meaning that  even  more  experienced  or  more  financially  compromised  startups  might  analyse  their risks just based on opinions. The youngest company (six months) affirmed that they don   t to risk  analysis  due  to  their  low  investment  (four  thousand  reais)  until  this  moment  therefore they understand that it is not necessary to have a deeper understanding of the risks involving the  business.  Better  organized  startups  in  relation  to  risk  management  practices  pointed  out examples  of  tools  such  as  control  metrics  management  spreadsheets  market  monitoring related  to  competitors  and  new  technologies.  Besides  that  it  was  possible  to  notice  that startups  with  founders  graduated  or  with  professional  experience  in  management  showed  a greater structuring in relation to risk management activities than companies that had founders with  less  training  in  management  but  greater  technical  skills  about  the  product.  It  is noticeable that none of the startups uses analysis as those presented by methods diffused by the literature. Regarding  the  last  question  of  the  second  block  which  refers  to  strategies  to  deal  with  the risks  one  aspect  that  appeared  in  most  of  the  interviews  was  the  search  for  information related to market clients technology and the product itself. Besides that aspect agility in the product  development  contingency  measures  for  unexpected  results  and  validation  of  the product with the client were pointed out by some of the startups. Examining  the  validation  questions  of  the  third  block  it  is  possible  to  conclude  that  all startups have defined goals and objectives although not all of them wanted or could specify their  strategy  but  the  difference  in  operating  time  of  those  who  didn   t  care  to  share  this information is clear the more experienced the startup is the better structured its strategy was. In  addition  to  that  it  was  possible  to  understand  that  all  startups  have  some  idea  of  the environment  surrounding  them  but  few  of  them  do  active  monitoring  to  keep  internal  and external  factors  that  might  influence  their  business  up  to  date.  Finally  by  observing  risk profiles  of  both  interviewee  and  company  it  was  possible  to  notice  that  half  the  surveyed people  consider  themselves  prone  to  risk  while  the  other  half  consider  their  positioning  as moderate regarding risk  propensity. No person or company  was evaluated as averse to  risk something that can be expected in the scenario of enterprises working with innovation.  4.2 Quantitative Stage Results From the startups that had their answers validated at the online formulary stage most of them has  more  than  two  years  of  operating  time.  The  investor's  commitment  in  relation  to deposited  values  in  those  startups  is  noticeable  60%  of  the  companies  received  between R$100.000 and R$2.000.000 (33% in the band of R$100.000 to R$500.00 and 27% between R$500.000  and  R$2.000.000).  Besides  that  72%  of  the  companies  still  didn   t  recover  the invested money. From those that did 85% received between R$100.000 and R$500.000.  46   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054. ISSN 2183559 A  large  majority  (86%)  of  the  enterprises  declared  that  they  have  clearly  defined  strategic goals and 88% of them presented valid answers with objectives quantitative definitions and specific deadlines when asked to provide examples of strategic goals. In addition to that 70% of  the  companies  have  a  definition  of  external  and  internal  factors  that  may  influence  their performance. About the respondent's risk profile 60% affirm to risk prone and 40% affirm to have a moderate risk profile. In relation to the companies    risk profiles however there seems to  be  a  bit  more  caution  as  63%  indicated  that  their  startups  have  a  moderate  risk  profile whereas the other 37% have a risk prone profile. When  asked  about  what  they  understand  as  risk  most  of  the  respondents  (72%)  showed  a negative perception materializing itself in words such as    problems       threats       adversities       barriers       losses    among others. On the other hand only 7% of the respondents seemed to have a vision of risk associated to the possibility of gain or return greater than normal. The remainder  associated  risk  to  the  definition  of  Damodaran  (2007)  in  which  both  scenarios (positive and negative outcomes) are considered. The risk analysis occurs empirically and without aid of any risk management tools in most of the startups (70%). 22% of them utilize proper tools to this context and 7% affirm that don   t analyze risks at all. Moreover even in startups with more than two years of operating time most of them (77%) analyze their data empirically. This distribution raises the hypothesis that startups are interested in analyzing risks since they do it empirically. However they seem to have little access to risk management tools or proper tools to the startup scenario. When asked about strategies to deal with risks 35% execute an internal control that could be financial of product trainings or action plans. 21% monitor their market 18% make regular tests  and  only  one  company  explicitly  affirmed  to  look  for  client  feedback.  Seeking  for clients     opinion  is  one  of  the  pillars  of  the  Lean  Startup  methodology  (Ries  2011)  which points to  obtaining quick answers to  the business hypotheses in  order to  minimize errors in this  kind  of  company.  The  behavior  presented  by  most  of  the  companies  contrary  to  what Ries  (2011)  suggests  seems  more  like  consolidated  enterprises  than  startups.  In  that  sense agility  seems  to  be  losing  strength  to  stable  practices  of  incumbents  in  the  market  which might  mean  a  problem  related  to  the  difficulty  in  reaching  the  exponential  performance expected in the case of startups. In addition to the analysis generated from the description of the data obtained in the survey a Pearson  correlation  analysis  was  also  generated  (Table  2)  and  the  results  contribute  to  the propositions  of the first phase. The maturity level  of the risk analysis process  has a slightly negative  correlation  index  (0.22)  with  startup  operation  time  which  means  that  older companies  have  as  much  or  even  less  structure  for  risk  analysis  than  newly  established companies. The invested value has a slightly positive correlation index (+0.18) with the maturity level of the  risk  analysis  process  which  may  raise  some  hypotheses  (i)  for  some  of  the  companies with  the  highest  levels  of  investment  there  is  a  structure  that  allows  the  systematization  of risk  analysis  process;  (ii)  companies  with  higher  investments  have  investors  who  demand protection  practices  in  relation  to  risks  what  influence  these  companies  to  have  better established processes for this. Anyway the positive correlation found is low suggesting that analysis  based  on  opinions  and  feelings  are  common  in  startups  with  higher  levels  of investment  and  that  the  risk  management  process  is  not  much  more  priority  in  these companies than in less capitalized ones. On  the  other  hand  there  is  a  sign  that  companies  that  define  strategic  objectives  and  goals also  better  organize  their  risk  analysis  process  (Pearson  coefficient  =  +0.42).  In  addition  47   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054. ISSN 2183559 companies  that  analyze  the  market  in  which  they  are  inserted  evaluating  opportunities  and threats  also  seem  to  signal  a  greater  propensity  to  better  organize  risk  analysis  (Pearson coefficient  =  +0.34).  These  two  correlations  are  the  strongest  found  in  the  set  of  analyzed cases and may indicate that for the process of risk analysis to occur in a more organized way in the startups it is necessary to have a first stage of strategies analysis and planning since without  these  initial  definitions  there  seems  to  be  insufficient  alignment  for  the  risk management process to take place. Finally  the  correlation  between  the  method  of  risk  analysis  and  the  issue  of  breakeven  has almost no index (0.07) which suggests that there is a random behavior between investments recovery and systematization of the risk analysis process.

Appropriateness of the risk management process to the startup context Based on the analysis carried out with the startups it is possible to notice that the companies which are entering the market need adapted risk management methods in order to be able to execute its activities. It is also important to highlight that adaptions in these methods can be useful for startups to create value and not only to be a bureaucratic process. In this study we propose  an  adaption  of the  standard  ISO  31000  (International  Organization  for Standardization  2009)  as  it  is  a  wellknown  method  for  risk  management.  The  original method is presented in Figure 1. First  it  is  important  to  highlight  the  correlations  identified  between  strategies  analysis  and planning  and  the  method  of  analyzing  risks  in  the  surveyed  companies.  These  findings  can drive the management structure  for the  company to  reach a better risk management.  Before trying  to  deal  with  risk  management  it  is  necessary  to  structure  the  strategic  analysis  and planning  defining  objectives  and  goals  for  the  company  and  analyzing  opportunities  and threats of the market. In the context of the risk management process in startup communication and consultation should be part of daily quick changes and pivots (Ries 2011). However these stages of the risk  management  process  need  to  be  highlighted  considering  it  seems  to  occur  in  the minority of the analyzed startups. Thus facing this scenario we propose an approach that can  48   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054. ISSN 2183559 be mixed with agile practices such as SCRUM (Shwaber and Beedle 2001) where a revision practice of communication and consultation stages is suggested mainly for startup managers first the company   s stakeholders groups need to be defined; after that it is suggested that at least  once  a  month  or  ideally  in  sprint  retrospective  meetings  one  of  the  managers  keep responsible for quickly presenting opinions from each stakeholders groups.  The context establishment stage seems to be something already incorporated to the reality of startups given the fact that almost all startups do some kind of planning goals and objectives definition  and  analyze  internal  and  external  factors  that  influence  the  company   s performance.  The  main  risks  brought  by  partners  of  the  companies  diverge  in  some  parts from Arruda et al (2014) showing the possibility of not having a consolidated understanding on  the  subject  seen  that  in  general  those  are  new  companies  and  its  partners  are  still  in  a learning process. This emphasizes the importance of the risk identification stage. Thus in that stage we suggest startups to evaluated factors related to (i) partners the amount of them that devote full time the harmony between them their ability to adapt the business to the market needs and changes commitment and personal and professional interests alignment of the partners; (ii) environment the place where the startup is installed that may facilitate or complicate the functioning and human resource caption/attraction; and (iii) economic aspects product  or  service  acceptance  of  the  market  and  capital  volume  invested.  Furthermore  it  is important  to  review  items  such  as  amount  of  full  time  devoted  partners  that  have  no  other income  sources  and  the  possibility  of  incubation  or  acceleration  in  places  with  reduced functioning costs. These  aspects  are  points  to  be  elucidated  in  the  identification  stage  in  order  to  verify  their relevance  or  not.  In  addition  to  them  it  is  suggested  to  verify  political  technological  and legal aspects that if altered may change the entire course of the startup. An example of that was  the  changes  in  the  credit  card  market  proposal  made  by  the  Brazilian  government threatening fintech operations such as Nubank (Miozzo 2016). Besides those  aspects  other points considered as risks by team members should be pointed out according to the context in which the company is inserted and its development stage. According to  answers  given by the startups  the  stages of  risk analysis  and evaluation are usually  driven  by  empiricism  and  almost  never  have  arguments  based  in  facts  or  data  just opinions  and  feelings.  With  risk  identification  and  regular  stakeholders     opinions  gathering (performed  in  communication  and  consultation  stage)  it  is  possible  to  move  on  to  analysis stages  in  which  each  risk  identified  in  the  previous  stage  must  be  evaluated  in  relation  to consequences it may cause. The evaluation stage complements the analysis stage by being the one where the decision about each risk level and priority is taken.  The treatment stage must be executed in two phases first one is to define what to do about each  risk  mitigate  avoid  accept  or  transfer.  Based  on  that  the  need  of  action  plans  is defined followed by those plans definitions and execution. Thus we propose the company to have a specific moment for the execution of both analysis and evaluation stages along with the first phase of treatment stage in periodic meetings of the startup managers.       49   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054. ISSN 2183559 Figure 1. Risk management process  Source International Organization for Standardization (2009).  Monitoring  and  review  must  be  a  periodic  process  and  both  an  active  and  passive dimensions  may  be  highlighted.  As  startups  are  companies  with  short  management  cycles actions must be developed measured and its results and learnings must be verified in a quick way  (Ries  2011).  Hence  risk  management  monitoring  and  revision  is  suggested  to  be executed in two levels (daily and sprint) following the SCRUM agile method (Shwaber and Beedle  2001)  widely  used  as  project  management  method  by  startups.  In  daily  meetings internal and micro level risks should be approached as they can be easily solved while in the sprint retrospective meeting it is necessary to review how/if risks are affecting the company objectives and goals also verifying the need of incorporating new risks and its treatments and monitoring.  Active  monitoring  may  be  conducted  by  staff  specifically  trained  to  identify risks  while  passive  monitoring  may  be  part  of  everyone   s  tasks.  The  latter  would  imply  a minimum level of knowledge about what is risk and how to identify it and thus may be out of reach for the smallest or less resourceful startup.  6.  Conclusions This  research  presents  evidence  of  the  lack  of  familiarity  of  Brazilian  startup  management teams with risk management methods an issue that is potentially detrimental to the success of  new  ventures.  Both  qualitative  and  quantitative  data  suggest  this  lack  of  familiarity  is unrelated to founders    experience or the total amount of invested capital (which by its turn may signal external recognition of the merits of the new business) which is an alert not only to founders but also to incubators accelerators and venture capital investors. Taken together these signs may point to an overall lack of awareness regarding the importance of enterprise risk management in the notably riskheavy Brazilian startup environment. Although  lacking  knowledge  about  it  it  was  possible  to  notice  that  startup  managers  are largely interested in  building risk management capabilities for their companies recognizing that dealing in a more efficient way with practical tools to manage risks may be beneficial to  50   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054. ISSN 2183559 such  firms  given  that  their  companies  deal  with  the  results  of  risk  decisions  all  the  time. However the methodologies that the current  literature presents are too  robust to  the  startup reality  which  highlights  the  need  of  simpler  methods  appropriate  to  this  initial  phase  of business organizations. So a first attempt to adapt the widely known model presented in the ISO 31000 (International Organization for Standardization 2009) was proposed making use of  management  practices  reportedly  already  known  and  adopted  by  startups.  The  rationale behind  the  proposed  adaptation  is  to  first  familiarize  startups  with  the  risk  management process  by  using  what  they  already  know  and  apply  building  more  complex  and sophisticated  solutions  as  risk  management  capability  matures  within  these  companies. Moreover  even  simple  practices  such  as  those  identified  in  the  empirical  research  may  if adequately integrated in a proper risk management model contribute immensely to startups    success. In  relation  to  popular  approaches  to  structuring  startups  such  as  Lean  Startup  (Ries  2011) and SCRUM (Shwaber and Beedle 2001) which are fundamentally built upon the concept of testing  and  experimentation  it  is  remarkable  that  few  companies  reported  the  use  of systematic testing to decrease the levels of risk. A grassroots adaptation of these wellknown startup principles to risk management would not be a surprise to researchers given that risk management approaches to technological projects already employ similar reasoning (Keizera et al. 2002) and instances of trialanderror learning risk management in startups have been already identified (Sommer et al. 2009). Furthermore the search for customer feedback was not  mentioned  as  a  risk  identification  strategy  even  as  customer  involvement  in  innovative activities  has  been  largely  accepted  as  modern  startups     modus  operandi  (Coviello  and Joseph 2012). This leads to the interpretation that Brazilian startups may be trying to behave as  consolidated  and  stable  enterprises  too  soon  which  may  possibly  affect  their  risk management capabilities and consequently hamper their growth. Finally a number of limitations must be noted. A first limitation regards the nature itself of risk a certain foreseeability is involved in the notion of risk management. Thus this research did not investigated aspects related to a related and fruitful stream of research in innovation studies that of management approaches to deal with unforeseeable uncertainties (e.g.  Loch et al. 2008; Sommer et al. 2009). Instead a strict ERM approach was chosen a choice that defined  our  interpretation  of  risk  management  and  consequently  influenced  our  research design. As a result our results must be interpreted with this limitation in mind. Additionally there are limitations that arise from our methodological choices. First the sample size used in the  empirical  study  is  small  and  should  be  expanded  in  future  works  for  better characterization of the Brazilian startup environment. Because it has an exploratory approach no  definitive  answers  regarding  the  adoption  of  risk  management  solutions  by  Brazilian startups  were  provided.  Further  research  is  paramount  in  order  to  further  test  the  first impressions uncovered in this paper. Similarly additional research may focus on testing the proposed  model  adaptation  for  risk  management  regarding  its  adequacy  to  startups operational and strategic routines. In particular an aspect of special interest is the assessment of how    hands on    such proposed model is that is to what  extent founders and initial team members  would  be  able  to  apply  it  by  themselves  even  if  lacking  formal  risk  management training.  This  assessment  is  particularly  important  for  startups  with  typical  limitations  in terms  of  financial  and  human  resources  and  also  for  business  accelerators  and  incubators providing  support  to  nascent  enterprises.  Finally  the  need  for  studies  related  to  risk management in innovation environments is emphasized as a way of supporting the practice of this subject in startups.   51   European Journal of Applied Business Management 3 (3) 2017 pp. 4054.
