Of course the major sources of financing for SMEs differ depending  on  their  current  stage  of  growth  and  development.    However  it  is  agreed that most SMEs heavily depend upon bank loans and generally experience a \\xe2\\x80\\x98financing gap\\xe2\\x80\\x99 even in developed countries. This  financing  gap  often  defined  as  the  difference  between  the  demand  for funds  by  SMEs  and  the  supply  of  funds  occurs  because  of  various  reasons.    Some argue that the fundamental reasons behind SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lack of access to funds can be found in  their  peculiar  characteristics  while  others  argue  that  SMEs  suffer  from  financing gaps  because  of  market  imperfections  on  the  supply  side.    In  reality  SMEs  face financing gaps probably because of a combination of reasons originating from both the supply and demand sides.    This financing gap for SMEs is most prominent in capital market financing and most countries including developed ones have problems in SME financing through capital markets.  SME Financing through Capital Markets Obstacles   With regard to SME financing a move away from bank intermediation towards funding in the capital markets has long been considered a longterm objective of many  1\\x0ccountries in the region.    If successful this approach would address the chronic lack of longterm credit available to SMEs.    This promising move however has many hurdles until its full implementation. The first hurdle to overcome is having an adequately developed capital market in terms of depth and liquidity. Second SMEs in essence have relatively high credit risk.    While SMEs have high growth potential they are also more vulnerable to sudden changes  in  the  economic  and  competitive  environment.    Third  there  exists  severe information asymmetry in this segment of enterprises.    SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 corporate information is often  nonexistent  or  comes  with  very  high  access  costs  in  many  economies  in  the region.    Fourth SME financing is inherently associated with a higher unit cost when compared  with  that  of  large  corporations.    The  relatively  smaller  size  of  funding  as well as higher information and monitoring costs leads to higher implementation costs per deal when processing finance in capital markets.  SME Financing in Capital Markets The Korean Experience  1) Issuance of PCBOs The Korean government introduced the primary collateralized bond obligation (PCBO)  program  in  order  to  smooth  out  liquidity  constraints  and  support  SMEs. Started in 1999 the PCBO program was expanded to include venture firms in 2001. A PCBO is a type of assetbacked security (ABS) with newlyissued corporate bonds   as the underlying asset.    SMEs issue new corporate bonds and sell them to a special purpose vehicle (SPV) as an underlying asset.    The SPV then issues the CBO based on the pool of SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 newlyissued corporate bonds and sells the CBO to investors in the  2\\x0cmarket.    Credit  enhancement  is  provided  through  various  channels  including  banks and credit guarantee funds.    The SPV issues both senior and junior tranche bonds with senior tranche usually at AAA grade. PCBOs  offer  more  fundraising  opportunities  to  SMEs  that  have  low  credit ratings.    In fact the distinguishing feature of the PCBO program lies in facilitating the issuance of corporate bonds to help finance SMEs.    Because PCBOs pool bonds with different  levels  of  risk  the  overall  risk  of  default  decreases.    Because  PCBOs  are issued through strict surveillance by credit rating agencies they are a relatively safe and fairly attractive investment.    Furthermore PCBOs can offer higher yields than general corporate  bonds  to  mezzanine  tranche  investors.    In  short  PCBOs  can  be  a  useful instrument that can resolve the credit mismatch problem that exists between investors and SMEs thus filling the financing gap of SMEs.    2) Venture Capital The  venture  investment  consists  of  three  stages  fundraising  investment  and exit.    Most  investors  may  invest  in  SMEs  directly  or  indirectly  through  investment funds made by venture capital companies.    IPOs in the stock market and M&As are the most widely used exit methods.  The central and local governments in Korea are the largest investors in venture capital companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fundraising comprising 24.4% of the total fundraising while other business entities come in second with 20% of the total fundraising.    Compared to the U.S. and Europe where pension funds and institutional investors take the largest share of  total  investment  in  venture  companies  the  government  plays  a  larger  role  in  the Korean venture capital market.    As  for  the  exit  strategy  of  venture  investment  the  3\\x0cKOSDAQ has been a key factor in the success of venture capital companies as it is the main exit channel for investment.    M&As are common in the U.S. where almost 70% of  venture  investment  chooses  M&A  as  its  exit  method  while  the  remaining  30% chooses  to  pursue  an  IPO.    In  Korea  90%  of  venture  capital  investment  depends  on IPOs on the KOSDAQ and M&As take only 10%. The  Korean  government  used  to  directly  invest  in  venture  investment  funds before the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFostering Venture Companies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d drive was announced in 2004.   In  addition  the  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  investment  resources  were  quite  decentralized  with various  government  bodies  administering  different  parts  of  the  process.    The government needed a stable and unified source of venture investment.    As a result the Korea Fund of Funds (KFoF) was established in 2005.    In contrast with the previous system  where  the  government  directly  chose  the  recipient  companies  as  well  as determined the amount of funds the fund of funds (FoF) system allows a fund manager to evaluate select and distribute capital to a number of funds.    KFF is expected to play a significant role in making the venture capital market more transparent and efficient.  Policy Recommendations  SMEs with high growth potential especially in hightechnology sectors have played  an  important  role  in  raising  productivity  and  maintaining  competitiveness  in recent  years.    If  SMEs  especially  innovative  earlystage  SMEs  cannot  find  the financing they need their brilliant ideas will never be developed to products no matter how great their potential.    Therefore government and policymakers not only have to focus on the development and growth of the capital market itself but also search for a  4\\x0cmeans  to  overcome  the  obstacles  inherent  in  SMEs  in  order  to  facilitate  active  SME financing through capital markets.  1) Building a Credible SME Information Sharing System  For  both  bond  and  equity  markets  providing  access  to  credible  corporate information on SMEs is an important task that will ease information asymmetry.    To start  policymakers  should  search  for  a  way  to  utilize  the  information  about  SMEs currently  scattered  around  the  banking  sector  in  credit  guarantee  schemes  and  other existing  government  programs  as  well  as  in  common  commercial  credit  programs.   Once aggregated this collective data base will have a higher chance of providing more credible  information  and  easier  access  to  potential  investors.    The  government  must take  the  initiative  and  play  a  major  role  in  this  data  collection  process.    In  addition credit information on individual consumers already available through the public credit registry  and/or  private  credit  bureaus  will  also  play  a  significant  role  in  easing information  asymmetry  in  the  SME  sector.    The  credit  assessment  of  SMEs  often heavily depends on an individual namely the owner and/or manager of the company.   This is especially common for smaller companies.  2) Facilitating SME Financing through Bond Market In the case of corporate bond issuance pooling a group of SMEs may provide a plausible  solution  to  the  inherently  higher  credit  risk  and  transaction  costs  associated with SME financing.    As an individual company a SME is exposed to high credit risk.   However once enough SMEs with various degrees of risk exposures to economic cycle are pooled together the basket of SMEs as a whole may have credit risk low enough to  5\\x0cbe attractive to debt market investors.    The problem of higher transaction costs will be resolved with the sufficient size of the deal.    If the deal is structured with the number of tranches with credit enhancement in the lower tranche the base of potential investors will be broadened with different levels of risk preferences.  Another indirect way of tapping into SME financing via the debt capital market is to liquidate bank loan assets in the market.    The securitization of banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 SME loans in  the  capital  market  will  in  turn  provide  a  larger  buffer  for  banks  to  increase  the amount of loans thus raising the total volume of funds supplied to SMEs.    This assetbacked  securitization  often  called  collateralized  loan  obligation  (CLO)  has  merit  to investors  because  they  can  share  the  monitoring  cost  with  banks.    From  the  banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 point of view they can share the credit risk exposure with debt market investors.  3) Fostering a Venture Capital Market  As for the equity market fostering venture capital and providing an incentivecompatible environment throughout the whole activity cycle of venture capitalists are the first priorities.    During the search phase a credible information sharing system and networks in the technology and business assessment industries will play critical roles.   Once an equity investment is put into place the next step for the venture capitalist is to take an active role in raising corporate value through cooperation with the management team  of  the  company.    Thus  an  appropriate  route  must  be  provided  for  the  venture capitalist to participate in the management of the portfolio firm be it through the legal framework or the customary practices in the market.    Lastly there should be a viable number  of  exit  strategies  for  the  venture  capitalist.    The  more  diverse  exit  strategies there are the higher the probability of a venture capitalist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success.    In sum creating  6\\x0cand providing a favorable environment throughout the entire investment process for a venture capitalist from entry to exit are the key factors to support stable growth of the venture capital market.  4) Cooperation and Coordination between Public and Private Sectors The  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  role  is  crucial  in  alleviating  SME  financing  gaps  in  the capital market.    However it should be noted that the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s role is a necessary but  not  sufficient  condition  for  building  a  stable  source  of  funding  through  capital markets for SMEs.    Without active participation from the private sector and investors the  whole  endeavor  cannot  be  a  success.    In  this  sense  the  government  should  put more focus on identifying specific sectors of SMEs that are faced with the most severe financing  gaps  and  then  construct  an  investorfriendly  incentivecompatible  and efficient  market  infrastructure  in  order  to  promote  more  active  participation  from  the private sector. The  Korean  experience  in  venture  capital  market  is  a  good  example  of  joint efforts between public and private sectors.    Although the Korean government still plays a large role in the venture capital market it has put forth a continuous effort to promote more  participation  from  the  private  sector.    Due  to  deregulation  more  financial institutions are expected to participate in the market.    Considering the establishment of the  KFoF  and  the  removal  of  constraints  on  investment  from  banks  and  insurance companies  the  government  is  trying  to  construct  an  investorfriendly  and  incentivecompatible market infrastructure rather than directly intervene in the market.    The use of private expertise by hiring private fund managers for the management of the KFoF and its subfunds will also improve fund performance and raise market standards.  7\\x0cI. Introduction  Firms  draw  their  financing  from  a  variety  of  sources.    In  general  firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financing sources can be divided into two groups namely the \\xe2\\x80\\x98informal sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and the \\xe2\\x80\\x98formal sector.\\xe2\\x80\\x99    The informal sector includes internal savings retained earnings and borrowing  from  family  friends  and  individual  money  lenders.    On  the  other  hand formal  sector  finance  consists  of  loans  from  institutional  lenders  (such  as  banks financing companies and savings banks) and financing from capital markets (through issuance  of  securities  such  as  bonds  and  equity).    Most  startup  companies  depend heavily on financing from the informal sector.    As a firm grows into a stable stage of development  access  to  financing  from  the  formal  sector  widens  starting  with  loans from  institutional  lenders.    From  the  perspective  of  all  firms  in  an  economy  only  a small portion of firms have access to financing from capital markets. Small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  (hereafter  SMEs)  which  are  the  main focus of this study consist of firms varying widely in size and characteristics  namely from very small startup firms in an infant stage of development to established SMEs already listed on the stock market.    Of course the major sources of financing for SMEs differ  depending  on  their  current  stage  of  growth  and  development.    However  it  is agreed  that  most  SMEs  generally  experience  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x98financing  gap\\xe2\\x80\\x99  even  in  developed countries.    This financing gap often defined as the difference between the demand for funds  by  SMEs  and  the  supply  of  funds  occurs  because  of  various  reasons.    Some argue that the fundamental reasons behind SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 lack of access to funds can be found in  their  peculiar  characteristics  such  as  information  asymmetry  and  economic uncertainty.    Others  argue  that  SMEs  suffer  from  financing  gaps  because  of  market  8\\x0cimperfections on the supply side; either the channel of financing is nonexistent or there is  a  severe  shortage  of  funds  in  that  segment  of  the  market.    In  reality  SMEs  face financing gaps probably because of a combination of reasons originating from both the supply and demand sides.    No matter the true underlining causes the fact remains that there is a significant gap in SME financing that gives firm ground for the government and public sectors to fill this financing gap. Most  countries  including  developed  ones  have  problems  in  SME  financing through capital markets which is the main focus of this study.    One of the fundamental reasons behind this lack of financing is the fact that SMEs in general have relatively higher  risk  in  their  businesses  compared  to  large  corporations.    Moreover  financial instruments related to SMEs in the capital market are often illiquid partly because the total amount of the instrument itself is relatively small and because the investor base with matching risk profiles in the market is shallow.    In this sense it is important to construct  an  efficient  capital  market  and  the  government  can  play  a  large  role  in constructing the infrastructure necessary for efficient capital markets. This  study  introduces  the  Korean  experience  of  utilizing  capital  markets  in SME  financing.    Chapter  II  contains  a  general  description  of  SME  financing  tools.   Chapter III introduces the Korean experience of SME financing through capital markets.   Chapter IV discusses the implications of the Korean experience in SME financing and concludes  the  study  with  policy  recommendations  for  SME  financing  through  capital markets.   9\\x0c(cid31). SME Financing and Measures to Fill the Financing Gap  The overall SME financing gap is particularly prevalent in developing countries. An  OECD  (2006)  survey  reports  that  many  nonOECD  countries  have  a  widespread shortage of financing for all categories of SMEs.    Although SMEs play an important role in economic growth and employment most of them are denied any access to formal financial markets.    On the other hand OECD countries do not report any generalized SME financing gap.    They reported a financing gap primarily in equity financing and even then the gap may be concentrated in certain sectors such as startups and hightech firms.    Since  OECD  countries  have  competitive  financial  markets  it  is  not  hard  for SMEs to get loans from banks because banks regard SME finance as an attractive line of business. In fact many banks have developed tools such as credit scoring models and  other  sophisticated  techniques  to  discriminate  between  highrisk  and  lowrisk borrowers thus reducing the risk of lending to SMEs.     10\\x0c<Figure II1> Is There a Financing Gap?

In  most  countries  commercial  banks  are  the  main  source  of  SME  financing.   However  heavy  reliance  on  bank  loans  as  a  means  of  longterm  financing  is  not desirable for SMEs.    If bank loans are provided on a rollover basis with short maturity SMEs may face a failure of rollover for the maturing loans when banks have liquidity problems.    Hence  the  funding  sources  of  SMEs  need  to  be  diversified  to  a  capital market where SME longterm financing is available if the market is welldeveloped.   11\\x0c<Figure II2> Sources of Financing for EUBased SMEs BanksLeasing/renting companies2479Public institutionssupporting investment11Private investors7Private financingcompanies(other than banks)4Venture capital companiesOtherDK/NA221201020304050607080%  Source    EOS  Gallup  Europe  (2005)  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSME  Access  to  Finance\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Flash  Eurobarometer  174 October  upon  the  request  of  the  European  Commission  (DirectorateGeneral \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEnterprise and Industry\\xe2\\x80\\x9d).  SMEs can issue bonds or equities in the capital market. But it is hard for SMEs to issue bonds because they cannot find investors interested in bonds with low credit ratings.    In order to alleviate this problem a structured financing method can be used.   SMEs also have problems with equity financing.    Their equities are neither liquid nor attractive to investors because they are usually not listed on exchanges.    The venture capital industry is important to SME equity financing because it is specialized in this area and has techniques to deal with the risks. Although most OECD countries do not have a widespread SME financing gap the OECD report says that they have problems in innovative SME financing as they  12\\x0crepresent a higher risk than traditional SMEs or large firms.    Market failure is likely in innovative  SME  financing  when  compared  to  other  sectors  hence  why  government programs  for  equity  capital  are  likely  to  be  directed  toward  innovative  SME  equity financing.  <Figure II3> OECD Countries Government SME Financing Programs as % of Total Source  OECD (2006) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe SME Financing Gap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d     13\\x0c<Figure II4> NonOECD Economies  Government SME Financing Programs as % of Total  Source  OECD (2006) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe SME Financing Gap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  1.  SME  Financing  through  Government  Programs  and  the  Banking Sector    Direct intervention efforts by the government to remedy the financing gap take the  form  of  grants  tax  breaks  and  the  establishment  of  governmentfunded intermediaries  specializing  in  SMEs.    The  most  common  commercial  credit  program initiated by the government and public sectors in many countries for SMEs includes among others interest subsidies credit guarantees insurance schemes loan quotas and export financing.  Currently  for  most  developing  and  developed  economies  the  banking  sector arguably represents the most important source of external financing for SMEs.    Banks offer a wide range of short medium and (to a lesser extent) long term loans as well as  14\\x0cvarious  supplementary  financing  instruments  such  as  trade  credit  export  financing factoring and discounting. Since  advanced  countries  have  competitive  financial  markets  banks  have developed  effective  techniques  to  deal  with  SME  finance.    Banks  in  those  countries find SME finance an attractive business because they increase their revenue from fees for  services  rather  than  from  interest  on  loans.    However  many  banks  in  emerging markets  are  stateowned  and  a  significant  share  of  total  credit  is  often  allocated  to targeted sectors under a government program.    There may also be interest rate ceilings that make it difficult to price credit to SMEs based on the risk of lending to SMEs.    In addition the banking system is under a government guarantee because governments are reluctant  to  have  their  banks  fail.    Under  these  circumstances  it  is  likely  that  banks operate their loans to SMEs inefficiently.   Although bank financing is the most widespread funding source for SMEs bank financing has problems during periods of high liquidity and credit risk.    If a country does not have enough tools to mitigate these risks banks are reluctant to lend to SMEs.   It is likely that banks will avoid additional lending or rollover of existing loans to SMEs when these risks are prevalent.    Since they do not have financial instruments such as credit derivatives to alleviate these risks banks have no choice but to reduce lending to high risk borrowers i.e. SMEs without enough collateral or guarantees.    Hence SMEs may not utilize bank financing in a recession which ironically is when they need the funds the most.   In addition prospective innovative SMEs (ISMEs) may not draw funding from banks on a regular basis if their potential is not properly evaluated.    Because ISMEs usually  have  negative  cash  flows  untried  business  models  and  high  risk  traditional  15\\x0cbank  financing  is  of  limited  relevance  to  those  companies.    In  this  case  risk  capital through  equity  and  quasiequity  products  such  as  mezzanine  finance  and  hybrid products are more useful.    Investors in these products can assume high risk but also seek large rewards.    Hence there are limitations to ISME financing through banks and market failure is likely in ISME financing if government intervention and deep capital markets are absent.  2. SME Financing through Capital Markets   With regard to SME financing a move away from bank intermediation towards funding  in  the  capital  markets  has  long  been  considered  a  longterm  objective  and various  efforts  have  been  made  by  many  countries  in  the  region.    If  successful  this approach would address the chronic lack of longterm credit available to SMEs.    This promising move however has many hurdles to overcome until it is implemented.    The first  hurdle  is  having  an  adequately  developed  capital  market  in  terms  of  depth  and liquidity.    Only a small group of countries in the region has met this prerequisite but their current stages of development and relative sizes vary widely even within the group itself.  Even with a sufficient number of investors and liquidity in the capital markets readily  available  there  still  exists  a  series  of  hurdles  to  be  overcome  in  order  to facilitate  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  financing  through  capital  markets.    First  SMEs  in  essence  have relatively high credit risk.    On one hand they have high growth potential but also are more  vulnerable  to  sudden  changes  in  the  economic  and  competitive  environment.   Second there exists severe information asymmetry in this segment of enterprises.    In  16\\x0cgeneral  some  degree  of  information  asymmetry  is  inevitable  and  always  exists  with respect  to  financial  industries  and  markets.    The  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  case  however  is  extreme.   SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 corporate information is often nonexistent or comes with very high access costs in many economies in the region.    Third SME financing is inherently associated with a higher unit cost when compared with that of large corporations.    The relatively smaller size of funding as well as higher information costs lead to higher implementation costs per  deal  when  processing  finance  in  capital  markets.    A  higher  monitoring  cost  also puts an additional burden on investors once funding is closed in the market.  Therefore  government  and  policymakers  not  only  have  to  focus  on  the development  and  growth  of  the  capital  market  itself  but  also  search  for  a  means  to overcome  the  obstacles  inherent  in  SMEs  in  order  to  facilitate  active  SME  financing through capital markets.    However the OECD reports that lending programs currently take the largest part of all government programs for SME financing in most countries.   For both bond and equity markets providing access to credible corporate information on  SMEs  is  an  important  task  that  will  ease  information  asymmetry.    To  start policymakers should search for a way to utilize the information about SMEs currently scattered  around  the  banking  sector  in  credit  guarantee  schemes  and  other  existing government  programs  as  well  as  in  common  commercial  credit  programs.    Once aggregated  this  collective  data  base  will  have  a  higher  chance  of  providing  more credible  information  and  easier  access  to  potential  investors.    The  government  must take the initiative and play a major role in this data collection process since building a SME information sharing system may not be commercially viable in the private sector.   In  addition  credit  information  on  individual  consumers  which  is  already  available through  the  public  credit  registry  and/or  private  credit  bureaus  will  also  play  a  17\\x0csignificant  role  in  easing  information  asymmetry  in  the  SME  sector.    The  credit assessment of SMEs often heavily depends on an individual namely the owner and/or manager of the company.    This is especially common for smaller companies.    In this respect  the  challenge  of  establishing  a  consumer  information  sharing  system  must become a priority if such a system is not already available in the economy.  With respect to the inherently higher credit risk and transaction costs there are several  means  or  combinations  of  means  to  alleviate  the  problem.    In  the  case  of corporate  bond  issuance  pooling  a  group  of  SMEs  may  be  a  plausible  solution  by lowering  credit  risk  and  transaction  costs.    As  an  individual  company  a  SME  is exposed  to  high  credit  risk.    However  once  enough  SMEs  with  various  degrees  of credit risk exposures to economic cycle are pooled together the basket of SMEs as a whole may have a low enough credit risk to be attractive to debt market investors.    The problem of higher transaction costs will be resolved with the sufficient size of the deal. If  the  deal  is  structured  with  the  number  of  tranches  with  credit  enhancement  in  the lower tranche the base of potential investors will be broadened with different levels of risk preferences.    There are many ways of providing credit enhancement to structured debt instrument deals banks insurance companies other private financial institutions and public credit guarantee companies can offer a credit line or guarantee to the lower tranche of the deal; thus the SMEs themselves can retain the equity tranche in order to enhance the credit ratings of the higher tranches.    In such structured deals generally known  as  collateralized  bond  obligations  (CBOs)  the  composition  of  portfolio companies is one of the key success factors.  Another indirect way of tapping into SME financing via the debt capital market is to liquidate bank loan assets in the market.    The securitization of banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 SME loans  18\\x0cin  the  capital  market  will  in  turn  provide  a  larger  buffer  for  banks  to  increase  the amount of their loans thus raising the total volume of funds supplied to SMEs.    This assetbacked securitization often called collateralized loan obligation (CLO) has merit to investors because they can share the monitoring cost with banks.    From the banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99 point of view they can share the credit risk exposure with debt market investors.  As for the equity market fostering venture capital and providing an incentivecompatible environment throughout the whole activity cycle of venture capitalists are the first priorities.    From the perspective of a venture capitalist identifying a company with  growth  potential  is  an  important  first  step.    During  this  phase  a  credible information sharing system a smoothly functioning infrastructure and networks in the technology and business assessment industries will play critical roles.    Once an equity investment is put into place the next step for the venture capitalist is to take an active role in raising corporate value through cooperation with the management team of the company.    This  process  of  realizing  corporate  potential  and  upgrading  firm  value  is crucial for the success of an investment.    Thus an appropriate route must be provided for the venture capitalist to participate in the management of the portfolio firm be it through the legal and regulatory framework or the customary practices in the market.   Lastly  there  should  be  a  viable  number  of  exit  strategies  for  the  venture  capitalist.   Whether through an initial public offering on the stock market acquisition by a strategic investor or a merger among venture firms a proven track record must be shown in the market.    The  more  diverse  exit  strategies  there  are  the  higher  the  probability  of  a venture capitalist\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success.    As the evidence of success accumulates more funds will flow  into  the  market.    In  sum  creating  and  providing  a  favorable  environment throughout the entire investment process for a venture capitalist from entry to exit are  19\\x0cthe key factors to support stable growth of the venture capital market. OECD  countries  have  more  refined  or  customized  government  programs  in equity capital financing.    They are more likely to target programs by region industry or stage of firm development than nonOECD countries.  <Figure II5> Targeting Government Programs for Equity Capital Programmes targeted atexpansion capitalProgrammes targeted atearly stagecommercializationProgrammes specificallyfor fast growth or hightechnology SMEsIndustry basedprogrammesRegionally basedprogrammes50%50%50%50%78%67%20%20%39%NonOECD economiesOECD economies78%0%10% 20% 30% 40% 50% 60% 70% 80% 90%Source  OECD (2006) \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThe SME Financing Gap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    20\\x0c(cid31).

SMEs in the Korean Economy  SMEs are an economic sector whose activities have major effects on the Korean economy in terms of total number of enterprises employment rates and export statistics.   At the end of 2005 SMEs in Korea numbered more than 30 million and accounted for 99.9%  of  all  enterprises.    With  hiring  by  SMEs  increasing  with  each  year  they accounted  for  88.1%  of  total  employment  in  Korea.    Exports  have  also  steadily increased with SMEs holding over 30% of total Korean exports a percentage valued at $104.2 billion at the end of 2006.  <Table III1>    SMEs as a Ratio of Total Number Employment and Exports Year Number of Enterprises Employment Export 2000 99.2 80.9 36.9 (29.5) 2001 2002 99.7 84.9 42.9 (1.7) 99.8 86.7 42.0 (5.7) 2003 99.8 87.0 42.2 (19.6) 2004 99.8 86.5 35.6 (10.6) 2005 99.9 88.1 32.4 (1.9) Note ( ) indicates a rate of increase yearoveryear.

In addition SMEs have created  relatively  stable  employment  despite  large  companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99  conservative  stance  in employment after the crisis.    As global competition becomes more fierce the SME is playing a more prominent role in driving further economic growth by producing new technology.  2. Overview of SME Financing in Korea  Though SMEs play an important role in the Korean economy they often have difficulty securing financing.    Reasons for this lack of funding include high transaction costs  and  credit  risk  as  well  as  information  asymmetry  and  a  shortage  of  collateral.   Most  Korean  SMEs  heavily  depend  on  bank  loans  for  more  than  70%  of  their  total funding.    While bank loans have steadily increased financing from the capital market has  decreased  because  SMEs  can  hardly  acquire  investmentgrade  credit  ratings  that satisfy investors' demands.    SMEs use policy funding and credit guarantee programs as their  major  financing  sources  usually  with  the  share  of  credit  guarantee  programs  at around 20% of total funding.       22\\x0c<Figure III1>    Sources of Financing for Korean SMEs in the Manufacturing Sector   (unit  %) equities 0.3corporate bondsforeign borrowing0.40.2Private debts 0.9nonbank financialinstitutions 1.5policy loans 24.8banks 71.9Source Korea Federation of Small and Medium Business  21. Public Support for SME Financing  There are two representative government programs that support SME financing credit guarantee schemes and policy loans.    Credit guarantee schemes have been used to alleviate credit risk imposed on loans to SMEs.    The credit guarantee program in Korea  began  with  the  establishment  of  the  Korea  Credit  Guarantee  Fund  (KODIT hereafter) in 1976 in order to reduce the possibility of market failure in SME financing due  to  information  asymmetry  high  transaction  costs  and  lack  of  collateral.   Currently  there  are  three  credit  guarantee  agencies  in  Korea  KODIT  the  Korea  23\\x0cTechnology Credit Guarantee Fund (KIBO hereafter) and the Local Credit Guarantee Foundations  (LCGF).    Prospective  SMEs  can  get  payment  guarantees  from  these agencies  which  provide  them  with  access  to  bank  loans.    Credit  guarantees  had increased significantly in late 1990s and early 2000s to overcome the credit squeeze and  economic  recession  due  to  the  Asian  Financial  Crisis.    The  total  outstanding balance of credit guarantees amounted to 45 trillion won in 2006 up from 17 trillion won in 1997.    In this respect it seems that credit guarantees were used to stimulate SME financing during an economic downturn.   However  some  credit  guarantees  overlapped  between  KODIT  and  KIBO which  accounted  for  most  (about  91%)  of  the  total  outstanding  balance  of  credit guarantees in Korea.    In addition although they are supposed to be efficiently allocated to SMEs with highgrowth potential but no collateral there may be an excessive supply of credit guarantees to SMEs with relatively high credit ratings.    For these reasons the Korean government does not tend to increase the size of credit guarantees indefinitely.  After  a  technology  assessment  by  KIBO  credit  guarantees  are  channeled  into  earlystage venture companies and Innobiz since SMEs with high credit ratings can easily draw loans from banks.    Due to the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s emphasis on the efficient allocation rather than the size of credit guarantees the amount of recent outstanding balance of credit guarantees is decreasing.       24\\x0c<Figure III2>    Outstanding Balances of Credit Guarantees (unit trillion KRW)60.050.040.030.020.010.00.0(unit %)9.08.07.06.05.04.03.02.01.00.01997199819992000200120022003200420052006outstanding balance(left)outstanding balance/GDP(right) Source National Assembly Budget Office  Another government program to help SME financing is policy loans. Funded by the central and local governments these loans are provided to SMEs at interest rates lower than the market rate through banks or Small Business Corporations (SBCs).    The objectives of this program are twofold.    The first is to promote equipment investment restructuring and commercialization of new technologies.    The second is to assist startup activities most of which are hardly financed through private market arrangements because  the  anticipated  returns  do  not  meet  market  expectations.    Although  the anticipated returns are low the program is justified by the social and economic benefits from the loans.    There are various government sectors that raise funds for SME policy loans.    The Small and Medium Business Administration (SMBA) among others is the largest funding source for these loans. Policy loans are allocated to SMEs if they meet  25\\x0cthe requirements for the loans.    For example loans from the Ministry of Information and Communication are only allowed to fund R&D for technology commercialization purposes in the multimedia communication semiconductor and other IT industries.  <Table III2>    Government Sectors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Assistance to SME Funding  Small and Medium Business Administration Other Ministries 2003 2004 (unit billion won    %) 2005 2006 amountshareamountshareamountshare amountshare3715 57.3 3589 58.9 3785  57.3  3617  59.92767 42.7 2503 41.1 2823  42.7  2425  40.1Note  Other  Ministries  include  the  Ministry  of  Information  and  Communication  Ministry  of Commerce Industry and Energy Ministry of Labor etc. Source Special Committee of SMEs.  The banks that are able to provide policy loans are chosen by fair competition.   However  there  may  be  several  banks  that  can  manage  policy  loans  with  the  same purpose.    In  this  case  SMEs  choose  to  get  their  policy  loans  from  a  bank  whose requirements they meet.    Currently the Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) a governmentowned  bank  is  the  largest  channel  for  providing  policy  loans.    IBK  is  a  bank specializing in SME financing whose ratio of SME loans to total loans is higher than 80%.    Since the interest margin of policy loans is low and all the costs imposed on the policy  loans  are  taken  on  by  banks  commercial  banks  do  not  actively  participate  in policy  loan  markets.    However  IBK  actively  participates  in  the  market  due  to  their large customer base their many years of expertise in dealing with policy loans and the benefits from crossselling even with the low margins and high costs of policy loans.  22. SME Financing through Banks  26\\x0c Banks  significantly  extended  their  lending  to  SMEs  after  the  Asian  Financial Crisis such that the total amount of SME lending was 357 trillion won in September 2007 more than double that of 145 trillion won in 2001.    Due to the decrease of large companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 demand for bank loans banks competitively extended their lending to SMEs.   The ratio of SME lending to total business lending was 87.9% as of September of 2007 up from 69.6% in 2001.   The total sales revenue of SMEs has a positive relationship with the total loans to SMEs.    The  ratio  of  SME  loans  to  SME  sales  revenues  has  increased  from  70%  in 2000 to 91% in 2006.    Notably total loans to SMEs have grown faster than total sales revenues of SMEs.    The recent growth of SME lending is mainly due to the lowered delinquency  ratio  in  SME  lending  enhanced  risk  management  techniques  and  the spillover effect from decreased household loans.           <Figure III3>    SME Financing through Banks  27\\x0c%100.090.080.070.060.050.040.030.020.010.00.0SME lending/Total business lending [Left]85.586.285.676.169.6Total  lending[Right]373.8Total business lending [Right]208.2145.0SME lending [Right]614.2299.6256.588.3699.787.9778.6405.8356.8341.5301.7Trillion won9008007006005004003002001000 20012002200320042005200607.09Source Financial Supervisory Service  With  the  increase  of  SME  lending  by  banks  SMEs  especially  Small  Office Home Offices (SOHOs) can get bank loans easier than before.    This is because banks have  developed  techniques  to  choose  SMEs  with  low  risk.    However  as  risk management for SME loans is stressed ISMEs especially those in the early stages may not benefit from the increase of SME lending.    This is because there is still uncertainty associated with these companies and banks often cannot diversify the risks associated with them.  23. SME Financing through Stock and Bond Markets  Generally speaking SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 funding from capital markets in Korea is currently not  active.    Since  2001  the  total  amount  of  large  companies  and  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  funding  28\\x0carkets in Korea (unit 2005 lion 2006 bilthrough stock and bond markets has decreased.    Large firms especially did not actively issue stocks or bonds over this same period.    Despite of the downward trend of large companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 funding through capital markets SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 funding size takes only 12.7% of the total size.    The share of SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 funding through capital markets rises to 13.7% from January to November 2007 but this is still small in terms of size.  <Table III3>    SME Funding through Stock and Bond M  2000 2001 2002 2003 2004 Equity Large CompanSMEs ies Total Corporate Bond Large Companies SMEs Total 6885 (74.3) 2379 (25.7) 9264 (100.0) 23447 (98.2) 418 (1.8) 3714 9074 8006 (57.1) (74.5) (55.8) 2785 3098 6343 (42.9) (25.5) (44.2) 6499 14349  12172 (100.0) (100.0) (100.0) 16963 317268 9699 (98.9) (9(97.7) 9.1) 197 354 400 (1.1) (2.3) (0.9) 7668  40052  23866  18340  26207  22155  17160 1(100.0) 00.0) 8642 (77.7) 2475 (22.3) 11117 (100.0) 8251 1(99.5) 89 (0.5) 6508 (78.6) 1771 (21.4) 8279 (100.0) 6109 2(99.6) 98 (0.4) 3775 (55.8) 2988 (44.2) 6763 (100.0) 21930 (99.0) 225 (1.0) (100.0) (100.0) (100.0) (100.0) (100.0) (1Note ( ) indicates share out of the total fundraising through stock or bond market Source Financial Supervisory Service won    %) 2007 1~11 10806 (72.1) 4184 (27.9) 14990 (100.0) 19670 (96.7) 669 (3.3) 20339 (100.0)  The share of SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 funding in the stock market increased significantly in 2005 reaching 44.2% from 21.4% in 2004.    However this increase is mainly accounted for by  the  significant  decrease  of  large  companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99  funding  through  the  stock  market.   Hence  there  has  been  no  significant  increase  in  the  absolute  size  of  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  funding through the stock market.    Interestingly the reverse situation occurred in 2007.    The  29\\x0cshare of SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 funding out of total funding through the stock market decreased from 42.9% at the end of 2006 to 27.9% over the period from January to November 2007.   Although the share of SME financing through the stock market has recently decreased the absolute size increased significantly from 2.785 trillion won in 2006 to 4.184 trillion won in 2007.    SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financing through the stock market peaked in 2000 recording at 6.343 trillion won but SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 stock issues have decreased due to the increased credit risk from the venture bubble bursting at the end of 2000. SMEs have a negligible role in the Korean corporate bond market.    The size of total  corporate  bond  issues  has  decreased  57%  from  2001  and  the  share  of  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financing  in  the  bond  market  was  only  1.1%  at  the  end  of  2006.    Although  the proportion has increased to 3.3% from January to November of 2007 the size is still negligible.    Another reason behind the decrease in SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financing in the bond market is  the  inefficiency  in  trading  from  the  total  size  of  bond  issues.    In  2006  the  usual trading unit in the bond market was 10 billion won but the total size of a SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bond issue  is  about  10  billion  won.    A  trader  must  perform  a  relatively  large  number  of trades in order to have certain amount of SME bonds because they are issued in smaller units.    Hence there is no incentive to hold SME bonds ceteris paribus.    On the supply side investmentgrade SMEs have not had difficulty recently in drawing money from banks.    Since there has been competition for lending between banks they can finance at  low  interest  rates  from  banks.    Another  reason  why  SMEs  have  difficulties  in  the corporate bond market is the inactive highyield bond market.    Most SME bonds are highyield bonds with high credit risk; hence SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financing from the bond market is not expected to be active in the future unless there is an active highyield bond market.   24.    Active Utilization of the PCBO Program  30\\x0c 1) Background  Corporate bonds were issued heavily before and right after the financial crisis in Korea in 1997 and these bonds started to mature from the second half of 2000.    But only  a  small  number  of  large  corporations  were  able  to  raise  funds  through  issuing corporate bonds and commercial paper.    The postcrisis capital market was paralyzed because any trust between investors in a volatile corporate bond market was virtually eliminated.    Banks undergoing governmentled restructuring processes at the time were also  hesitant  to  make  new  loans  to  the  corporate  sector.    As  a  result  concerns  were raised over the possibility of companies who were rolling over their debt going bankrupt and  creating  another  financial  crisis.    In  accordance  with  the  tightening  money  and capital  markets  the  Korean  government  introduced  the  primary  collateralized  bond obligation  (PCBO)  program  in  order  to  smooth  out  liquidity  constraints  and  support SMEs.    Started in 1999 the PCBO program was expanded to include venture firms in 2001.  2) Basic Scheme of PCBO  A PCBO is a type of assetbacked security (ABS) with newlyissued corporate bonds  as  the  underlying  asset.    SMEs  issue  new  corporate  bonds  and  sell  them  to  a special  purpose  vehicle  (SPV)  (or  special  purpose  company  (SPC))  as  an  underlying asset.    The  SPV  then  issues  the  CBO  based  on  the  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  newlyissued  corporate bonds and sells the CBO to investors in the market.    The SPV has a contract with the  31\\x0coriginator to manage its own assets.    Credit enhancement is provided through various channels including banks and credit guarantee funds.    The SPV issues both senior and junior tranche bonds with senior tranche usually at AAA grade.  <Figure III4>    Basic Structure of PCBO Issuance   The process of a PCBO program is as follows 1) Selection of company and underlying assets; 2) Credit rating and enhancement; 3) Selection of SPV's trustee and reinforcement of liquidity; 4) Bond redemption. The first stage selection of a company is very important because of its relation to credit rating.    The credit risk of the entire portfolio depends on the underlying assets that comprise the portfolio.    Second the credit rating is based on risk of default and cash flow of the portfolio.    Credit enhancement is provided mainly by SBC banks or credit guarantee funds such as KODIT and KIBO.    Without such credit enhancement the amount of senior bonds that can be issued with AAA ratings would be limited to only  small  portion  of  the  total  value  of  the  underlying  assets  usually  4070%  of  the  32\\x0ctotal value depending on the average credit quality of the pool.    However with credit enhancement  this  proportion  jumps  substantially  to  include  a  major  part  (e.g.  over 90%)  of  the  total  value  of  the  underlying  assets.    Third  a  trustee  of  the  SPV  will reinforce liquidity and supervise cash flow to protect the investors.    Finally the process of the PCBO scheme is over when the issued bonds are redeemed. PCBOs  offer  more  fundraising  opportunities  to  SMEs  that  have  low  credit ratings.    In fact the distinguishing feature of the PCBO program lies in facilitating the issuance of corporate bonds to help finance SMEs.    Because PCBOs pool bonds with different  levels  of  risk  the  overall  risk  of  default  decreases.    Because  PCBOs  are issued through strict surveillance by credit rating agencies they are a relatively safe and fairly attractive investment.    Furthermore PCBOs can offer higher yields than general corporate  bonds  to  mezzanine  tranche  investors.    In  short  PCBOs  can  be  a  useful instrument  that  can  resolve  the  credit  mismatch  problem  that  exist  between  investors and SMEs thus filling the financing gap of SMEs.          3)  ariations of PCBO V The  first  PCBO  program  was  launched  by  SBC  in  1999.    SBC  pooled  72 billion  won  worth  of  new  corporate  bonds  issued  by  23  SMEs.    Credit  enhancement was  provided  by  the  Korea  Housing  Bank  in  the  form  of  liquidity  facilities.    SBC provided additional enhancement by repurchasing the subordinate junior tranche in the amount of 27.5 billion won.    The senior tranche worth 44.5 billion won was sold to investors in the market. <Figure III5>    Basic Scheme o  First PCBO Program by SBC f 33\\x0c   In July 2000 the Korean government introduced a special guarantee program applicable to PCBO issuance and started to use credit guarantee funds namely KODIT and  KIBO.    With  credit  enhancement  in  the  form  of  credit  guarantees  provided  by KODIT or KIBO the percentage of total value in the senior tranche of the PCBO deal went up to 9397% thus maximizing funding efficiency of the program.    Institutional investors  prefer  PCBOs  with  a  credit  guarantee  from  KODIT  or  KIBO  because  the credit ratings of guaranteed bonds are more stable than those without guarantees.   34\\x0c<Figure III6>    PCBO Program with Credit Guarantee    In 2004 SBC in cooperation with a domestic security company led an issuance of crossborder PCBO.    46 Korean SMEs participated in the PCBO issuance in Japan in  the  amount  of  10  billion  yen.    Credit  guarantees  were  provided  by  the  Industrial Bank of Korea (IBK) and the Japan Bank for International Cooperation (JBIC).    A dual SPC structure was used and the subordinate tranche of the CBO issued by the domestic SPC  was  purchased  by  SBC  providing  additional  credit  enhancement.    The  senior tranche  of  the  CBO  was  acquired  by  the  foreign  SPC  established  in  Japan  and  then distributed to investors in the Japanese market.   35\\x0c<Figure III7>    CrossBorder PCBO Issuance with Dual SPCs Structure  4) Current Status of PCBO in Korea   In August 2000 the first KODIT guaranteed PCBO was issued amounting to 1.55 trillion won.    Pooling 54 SMEs credit ratings of these companies ranged from BBB+ to BB.    Senior bonds of higher than AA grade accounted for 97% of the total amount of issuances or 1.5 trillion won.    In order to stabilize the widening financing gap in 2000 and 2001 PCBOs were issued in the amounts of 7.22 and 7.16 trillion won  respectively.    But  as  the  corporate  bond  market  stabilizes  the  amount  of  PCBO  issuances  has  been  decreasing.    Also  the  ratio  of  PCBO  to  total  corporate bonds and to ABS has fallen.    In the early stages people insisted that government intervention could distort the market but the PCBO program has contributed to the economic rebound of many companies.  36\\x0c<Figure III8>    Total Amount of PCBO Issuances (billion won)8000722471617000600050004000300020001000021067459077132000200120022003200420052082006 Source Financial Supervisory Service.  <Figure III9>    Ratio of PCBO Issuances to Corporate Bonds and to ABS (% )2018161412108642017.618.112.38.27.6P C BO /A BSP C BO / corporate bonds2.61.03.43.41.82.51.50.90.52000200120022003200420052006 Source Financial Supervisory Service.

After  the  introduction  of  the  PCBO  program  companies  with  poor  credit ratings (below BBB grade) can issue corporate bonds through capital markets.    As a result companies are able to cut down on expenditures for financing and temporarily smooth  out  liquidity  constraints.

Venture Capital in Korea  1) Historical Overview of Venture Capital Industry in Korea  Established  in  1974  the  KIBO  Technology  Advancing  Capital  Corporation (KTAC) is Korea\\xe2\\x80\\x99s first venture capital company.    While not actively involved in the venture capital market the KTAC had its start commercializing the research products of the  Korea  Institute  of  Science  and  Technology  (KIST).    However  as  the  role  of technology  became  more  prominent  in  economies  worldwide  in  the  early  1980s  the Korean  venture  capital  industry  became  much  more  active.    As  a  result  the  Korean government  established  the  Korea  Technology  Development  Corporation  (KTDC)  in 1981 to meet this growing need.    This move was then followed by cooperation between the  Korean  government the  International  Financing  Corporation the  Asian Development  Bank  and  various  Korean  investment  companies  to  coestablish  the Korea  Development  Investment  Corporation  (KDIC)  in  1982.    Two  years  later  the Korea Development Bank created the Korea Technology and Finance Company (KTFC) which was renamed Korea Technology and Banking (KTB) in 1992 later merging into the Korea Industry Leasing Company in 1993.    39\\x0cAfter this initial stage of growth in the early 1980s the Korean venture capital industry grew more quickly in the mid1980s when the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall and Medium Enterprise StartUp Supporting Law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNewtechnology Business Financing Supporting Law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d were put into effect in May and December 1986 respectively.    From these two pieces of legislation a dichotomy in Korean venture capital companies was born small and medium enterprise startup financing companies (SMESFCs) established by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmall and  Medium  Enterprise  StartUp  Supporting  Law\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and  newtechnology  business financing  companies  (NBFCs)  based  on  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cNewTechnology  Business  Financing Supporting Law.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d    Venture capital companies usually invest in companies by making an investment fund and then assuming a partnership role over the funds.    Currently the main  resources  for  venture  investment  funds  are  the  government  pension  funds financial companies and private companies. The second stage of the venture capital industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s development began with the aforementioned laws and the birth of an easily accessible market for unlisted stocks in April  1987.    This  market  became  the  Korea  Association  of  Securities  Dealers Automated  Quotation  (KOSDAQ)  in  1996  which  has  provided  venture  firms  with liquidity for their stocks.    It has also provided venture capital companies with an exit strategy from their equity investments.  The Korean government in need of a recovery after the Asian Financial Crisis realized  the  importance  of  information  technology  and  thus  introduced  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpecial Measures  Law  for  Fostering  Venture  Businesses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  acknowledging  the  importance  of venture  firms  in  driving  economic  growth.    The  law  provides  certified  venture  firms with  various  benefits  such  as  tax  exemptions  credit  guarantees  and  policy  loans.   Fortunately  the  Korean  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  effort  to  vitalize  this  sector  coincided  with  the  40\\x0cworldwide IT boom.    Investment by venture capital firms increased dramatically until the  venture  bubble  burst  in  2000.    New  investment  in  venture  companies  through venture  capital  firms  and  investment  funds  amounted  to  more  than  2  trillion  won  in 2000.    The  venture  capital  industry  then  saw  a  decline  in  investment  until  the government  announced  its  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFostering  Venture  Companies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  policy  in  December  2004.   The policy abolished the ceiling on performance fees to general partners (previously at 20%)  and  established  the  Korea  Fund  of  Funds  (KFoF).    When  the  policy  was announced new investment totaled 777 billion won. Since the policy\\xe2\\x80\\x99s announcement new investment in venture capital companies and venture investment funds has steadily increased reaching more than 1 trillion won in 2006 (for the first time since the venture bubble had burst).  2) Current Status of Venture Investment by Venture Capital Companies and Their Funds  Venture investment consists of three stages fundraising investment and exit. Most investors invest in SMEs directly or indirectly through investment funds made by venture  capital  companies.    In  the  case  of  indirect  investment  a  venture  capital company  makes  a  venture  investment  fund  and  then  operates  the  fund  as  a  general partner (GP).    Other investors can participate in the venture investment fund as limited partners  (LPs).    With  the  funds  raised  the  GP  manages  the  fund  and  performs  the investment.    When  a  venture  investment  accomplishes  its  purpose  an  initial  public offering (IPO) in the stock market and mergers and acquisitions (M&A) are most widely used exit methods.    41\\x0c<Figure III10> Structure of Equity Investment to SMEs VC Company (cid130) SMESFC (cid130) NBFC Angel Investment (cid130) Individuals (cid130) Angel Fund Investors (cid130) Banks (cid130) KCGF (cid130) PEF      (GP) (LP)  (LP)    (1) Fundraising Stage   Investment Fund (LP)Other Investors (cid130) Government including Korea FoF (cid130) Pension Fund (cid130) Financial Institutions       SME   As mentioned earlier the central and local governments in Korea provide the capital for SMESFCs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 funds.    They are the largest investors in SMESFCs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 fundraising contributing 24.4% of the total fundraising while other business entities come in second with 20% of the total fundraising.    Compared to the U.S. and Europe where pension funds  and  institutional  investors  take  the  largest  share  of  total  investment  in  venture companies  the  government  plays  a  larger  role  in  the  Korean  venture  capital  market.   The lack of institutional investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is partly due to legal restrictions on banks insurance companies  and  mutual  savings  banks  providing  capital  to  venture  investment  funds.   Banks and insurance companies could not provide more than 15% of the capital for a  42\\x0cventure  investment  fund  without  the  Financial  Supervisory  Service\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  permission.   Additionally mutual savings banks were prohibited from investing in these funds.  <Table III6>    Composition of Investors to SMESFCs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Investment Funds in 2006 Central & Local Governments Business 24.4% 20.0% Institutional Investors 17.1% SMESFCs Pension Funds 12.1% 14.9% Individuals  Foreigners 6.8% 4.7% Source The Korea Venture Capital Associations.   In  theory  if  institutional  investors  such  as  banks  and  insurance  companies were  able  to  actively  provide  capital  to  venture  funds  then  soundness  in  the  venture capital  market  would  be  enhanced  because  institutional  investors  will  also  be monitoring  the  fund\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  management.    This  provides  an  extra  layer  of  supervision  and protection  to  the  market.    The  situation  is  mutually  beneficial;  the  venture  capital market  gains  another  reliable  source  of  investment  and  institutional  investors  have  a highrisk  highreturn  investment  instrument.    Fortunately  the  Korean  government recently  announced  the  removal  of  the  aforementioned  restrictions  thus  opening  the market to increased investment from banks and insurance companies.    Mutual savings banks are also now allowed to invest to a limited extent.    (2) Investment Stage  Since the venture bubble burst the number of SMESFCs has fallen from 147 in 2000  to  99  in  September  2007.    When  the  government  announced  its  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFostering Venture Companies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d drive in 2004 there were 105 SMESFCs.    Although the number  43\\x0cof companies has declined their volume and new investment in 2006 increased 31.7% when  compared  to  2004.    Many  venture  capital  companies  simply  expanded  without serious  direction  until  the  bubble  burst  leaving  many  venture  companies  in  trouble.   Even into 2004 the number of SMESFCs continued to decline recording losses of 205 billion  won.    However  the  market  recovery  in  2005  turned  the  SMESFCs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  record losses into a net surplus of 80.2 billion won.    <Table III7>    New Investment of Venture Capital Companies and Their Venture Investment Funds                                                                                                                     (billion won)  SMESFC and their funds NBFC and their funds Total 2002 617.7 222.4 840.1 2003 630.6 156.4 787.0 2004 604.4 172.6 777.0 Source Korean Small and Medium Business Administration. 2005 757.3 200.4 957.7 2006 733.3 289.8 1023.1   The average size of SMESFC funds is relatively small 12.8 billion won versus $82.5 million in the U.S.    Recently the average size of these funds has been growing.   The efficiency of a fund\\xe2\\x80\\x99s operation is directly proportional to its size.    Furthermore conflicts of interest can be avoided when the size of the fund is larger.    When size of the funds is small a fund manager may have a conflict of interest in decision making because he or she may manage several funds at the same time.      44\\x0c<Table III8>    Comparison of Average Size of SMESFC Funds and U.S. Funds  Korea(bil. won) U.S. ($ mil) 2002 10.48 22.6 2003 15.37 75.0 2004 10.8 89.0 Note $1 = 929.6 won as of November 30 2007.

The increase in funding to these nascent companies further propels the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s effort to support those companies that are the most likely to fail without government intervention.    Because the venture capital market is in recovery in Korea investment in earlystage companies is not likely to be large due to the high credit risk associated with these companies.    In addition the exit channel of venture capital companies in Korea is limited to IPOs on the KOSDAQ.   Since  it  takes  long  time  until  an  early  stage  venture  company  has  a  successful  IPO venture  capital  companies  hesitate  to  invest  in  these  companies  choosing  instead  to invest in expanding or laterstage companies that are closer to an IPO (and also have a clearer  picture  of  their  technology  and  profitability).    For  this  reason  investment  in expanding and laterstage companies is doing well without government intervention.       45\\x0c<Table III9>    Share of Investment in Early Expansion and Later Stage Venture  Companies 2005 Volume (bil. won) 197.2 416.2 143.9 757.3 Early Stage (< 3 years) Expansion Stage (37 years) Later Stage ( > 7 years) Total Source The Korea Venture Capital Associations.

M&As are common in the U.S. where almost 70% of venture investment chooses M&A as its exit method while the remaining 30% chooses to pursue an IPO.    In Korea 90% of venture capital investment depends on IPOs on the KOSDAQ and M&As take only 10%.    The number of IPOs significantly  decreased  when  the  KOSDAQ  itself  started  to  decline.    With  the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  effort  to  revitalize  venture  companies  and  replenish  liquidity  investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 market  expectations  were  positive  and  the  KOSDAQ  rebounded  in  2005.    Although the number of IPOs increased in 2005 because of this recovery it is still far below that of the early 2000s.    IPOs of venture firms with venture capital investment make up the majority of all  IPOs  on  the  KOSDAQ.    The  ratio  of  venture  firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99  IPOs  with  venture  capital investment  to  total  venture  firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99  IPOs  has  continuously  increased  to  about  81%  in 2007  from  50.5%  in  2002.    This  means  that  venture  capital  companies  are  able  to  46\\x0cchoose promising venture firms and are becoming instrumental in venture companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 success  as  fund  providers.    As  the  ratio  increases  the  venture  capital  market  has become more vital to the growth of venture firms.  <Table III10>    KOSDAQ Market and Venture Capital  Average KOSDAQ Index (points) # of listed companies in KOSDAQ # of IPOs in KOSDAQ #  of  venture KOSDAQ (A) # of venture firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 IPOs with venture capital investment (B) Ratio (B/A) (%) Source The Korea Exchange. firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 IPOs in 2002 2006 2005 2004 2003 2001 2007.9 711.3  634.6  452.9  392.0  537.5  624.1  712.2 721 171 134 843 153 105 879 71 58 890 52 37 918 70 61 963 56 43 998 41 32 73 53 36 28 49 35 26 54.5 50.5 62.1 75.7 80.3 81.4 81.3   From  startup  to  IPO  the  average  timespan  for  a  venture  firm  with  venture capital  investment  is  7.9  years.    Firms  without  venture  capital  investment  take approximately 11.5 years until their IPOs.    This means that venture capital companies deliberately  sought  out  fastgrowing  venture  firms  as  a  target  for  investment.    Their ability  to  select  companies  with  high  growth  potential  had  often  been  brought  into question  before  2002  because  they  had  experienced  huge  losses  during  the  deep recession of the venture capital market.      47\\x0c<Table III11>    Average Years Spent until IPO 2004  7.2 Venture Firms with Venture Capital Investment 13.8 Venture Firms without Venture Capital Investment All IPO firms 9.3 Source Korean Small and Medium Business Administration.  2005 7.6 12.4 9.0 2006 7.9 11.5 9.0  The venture capital market is becoming more transparent as it recovers from its deep  recession.  Furthermore  this  alternative  market  will  attract  more  attention  as  a highrisk highreturn investment instrument as overall market conditions improve.  3) Korea Fund of Funds   The  Korean  government  used  to  directly  invest  in  venture  investment  funds before the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFostering Venture Companies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d drive was announced in 2004.   The government was worried about diminishing venture capital investment and realized that  many  venture  funds  were  dissolved  from  2004  to  2005.    In  addition  the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s investment resources were quite decentralized with various government bodies  administering  different  parts  of  the  process.    The  government  needed  a  stable and  unified  source  of  venture  investment.    As  a  result  the  Korea  Fund  of  Funds (KFoF)  was  established  in  2005.    In  contrast  with  the  previous  system  where  the government directly chose the recipient companies as well as determined the amount of funds the fund of funds (FoF) system allows a fund manager to evaluate select and distribute capital to a number of funds.   48\\x0c<Figure III11>    Structure of Fund of Funds Investor 1 Investor 2 Investor N Fund of Funds SubFund 1 SubFund 2 SubFund N Venture Company Venture Company Venture Company Venture Company  Venture Company Venture Company   The  FoF  structure  has  four  advantages  over  the  previous  system.    First  the scheme meets public interest and operates more efficiently.    Since the resources of each government sector are combined and managed by an experienced manager investment tends to be more profitable and better managed than when under government control.   However  the  KFoF  is  not  completely  independent  from  government  influence;  since the  KFoF  was  created  under  a  revised  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSpecial  Measures  Law  for  Fostering  Venture Businesses\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it is a public fund whose capital is raised mainly by the government.    As an organization with some government ties the KFoF should allocate a portion of its assets to subfunds for public purposes.    For example it can allocate a large portion of its assets to subfunds that focus on investment in earlystage venture firms that have not attracted private venture capital companies.   Second the fund may protect the venture capital market when the economy is in recession.    By nature venture capital companies search for highrisk but highreturn  49\\x0cinvestment opportunities.    When risks are prevalent in the market venture capital firms like  most  investors  will  pursue  more  relatively  stable  investments.    In  this  case  if there  is  herding  behavior  in  certain  sectors  with  good  profit  expectations  or  other benefits  this  fund  can  instead  support  other  growing  sectors  important  for  future economic  growth.    Therefore  the  KFoF  can  play  a  role  in  revitalizing  the  market during times of economic contraction.   Third the venture capital market will become more transparent because there are high standards for the selection and management of subfunds.    Since the fund will select  subfunds  with  good  track  records  subfunds  have  an  incentive  to  efficiently manage their assets.    Fourth the KFoF will be a stable investment source to venture firms by raising 1 trillion won over five years.    It is expected that the KFoF will create new venture capital ranging from 500 to 600 billion won each year.    <Figure III12> Government SME Financing through the Capital Market Government Government Direct investment Direct investment decision makingdecision makingLack of specialty moral Lack of specialty moral hazard corruption\\xe2\\x80\\xa6hazard corruption\\xe2\\x80\\xa6SMESMEFinance/Credit Finance/Credit GuaranteeGuaranteeGovernment Government Investment Investment decision making decision making and management and management follow upfollow upCapital Capital MarketMarketSMESMEEffective Risk Sharing and Effective Risk Sharing and Screening Mechanism need to be Screening Mechanism need to be developeddevelopedSource Park (2005)  50\\x0cThe KFoF will benefit from government resources and its experienced manager will redirect these resources into a number of funds.    Since private venture investment funds do not actively invest in earlystage venture firms that have relatively higher risks the KFoF will then allocate more resources to funds whose investment mainly focuses on firms less than three years old.    As of March 2007 the KFoF has already invested a total of 313.7 billion won and plans to increase its investment by 200 billion won in 2007.  <Table III12>    Investment in Korea Fund of Funds Year #  of  venture  investment funds in which the KFoF invested Volume  of  venture  investment in  which funds the  KFoF invested (bil. won) 271.7 406.4 519.9 1198.0 Investment of KFoF (bil. won) 58.6 124.5 130.6 313.7 2004 2005 2006 Total Source Korean Small and Medium Business Administration.     7 17 21 45   It is expected that the Korea Fund of Funds will continue to play an important role in the venture capital market.    The KFoF will consistently provide funds in times of  economic  expansion  or  contraction.    In  fact  the  KFoF  may  even  encourage institutional investors to participate in the venture capital market during a recession if it actively  invests  and  gives  off  positive  signals  to  investors.    To  do  this  the  KFoF (currently  in  its  early  stages)  should  become  reputable  in  selecting  subfunds  and venture  capital  companies  thereby  accumulating  a  good  track  record.    Later  their movements  may  influence  other  investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99  decision  making  process  when  deciding whether or not to invest during a recession.    Since the government already has plans to  51\\x0cprovide funding for the KFoF it will become a stable source of funds in the venture capital market.                        52\\x0c(cid31).  Implications  from  the  Korean  Experience  and  Policy Recommendations  1. Implications from the Korean Experience   SME  financing  in  Korea  is  heavily  dependent  on  bank  loans  as  in  other countries.  The  Korean  government  has  used  government  programs  to  provide  bank loans to SMEs via credit guarantee schemes and policy loans.    Both programs facilitate SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 acquiring bank loans which they cannot otherwise get due to a lack of collateral and  low  credit  ratings.    From  the  Korean  experience  it  is  important  to  set  targets within  the  SME  sector  such  as  earlystage  companies  with  technology  which  will benefit  from  the  aforementioned  programs.    Otherwise  SMEs  that  do  not  need government support may benefit from the programs. Much effort has been put into making SME financing through capital market easy in Korea.    Except in the U.S. where the junk bond market developed companies with  poor  credit  ratings  have  difficulty  issuing  corporate  bonds  in  most  countries.   Unless the highyield bond market is welldeveloped it is hard to find investors in highyield bonds.    However companies with poor credit ratings were able to issue corporate bonds  after  the  introduction  of  the  PCBO  program  in  Korea.    PCBOs  made  these instruments attractive to investors because the overall risk of default decreases when PCBOs pool bonds with different levels of risk.  The  Korean  venture  capital  industry  experienced  many  challenges  after  the venture bubble burst.    However the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continued rehabilitation efforts have  53\\x0ckept this market steadily growing since 2005.    Before the bubble burst venture capital companies  invested  in  venture  companies  without  strict  technology  assessment  and monitoring  standards.    After  experiencing  hard  times  they  are  currently  investing  in venture  companies  through  a  careful  inspection  monitoring  and  evaluation  process.   Since  venture  investment  is  highrisk  highreturn  investments  should  be  made carefully with expertise.    When the government tries to strengthen financial support to a certain venture industry sector such as earlystage innovative SMEs public funds i.e. the  Korea  Fund  of  Funds  can  be  used  effectively.    Also  public  funds  can  act  as  a safeguard  for  the  venture  capital  market  during  a  recession.    If  the  fund  is  wellmanaged it can contribute to the development of venture capital market. Although the Korean government still plays a large role in the venture capital market it has put forth a continuous effort to promote its growth.    Due to deregulation more  financial  institutions  are  expected  to  participate  in  the  venture  capital  market.   Considering  the  establishment  of  the  KFoF  and  the  removal  of  constraints  on investment from banks and insurance companies it seems that the government is trying to construct an investorfriendly and incentive compatible market infrastructure rather than directly intervene in the market.    SMEs with high growth potential especially those in hightechnology sectors have played an important role in raising productivity and maintaining competitiveness in  recent  years.    If  SMEs  especially  innovative  earlystage  SMEs  cannot  find  the financing  they  need  their  brilliant  ideas  will  never  be  developed  into  products  no matter  how  great  their  potential.    Hence  the  economy  will  lose  potential  growth.   Since  SMEs  are  not  knowledgeable  about  the  various  financing  tools  available  it  is important  to  build  an  environment  where  they  can  easily  access  capital  markets.    54\\x0cBuilding an infrastructure for SME financing through capital markets such as a public fund and other financial instruments seems to be more efficient than directly financing SMEs.    2. Policy Recommendations   The  main  difficulty  in  removing  the  financing  gap  in  SME  financing  is information  asymmetry.    If  there  were  an  information  sharing  system  financial institutions  could  provide  funds  to  SMEs  more  efficiently.    More  prospective  SMEs will get funds from financial institutions.    Hence it would be more helpful in the long run for a government to help build information sharing mechanism rather than assisting SMEs directly.    Policymakers should search for a way to use information about SMEs currently  scattered  around  the  banking  sector  in  credit  guarantee  schemes  in  other existing  government  programs  and  in  common  commercial  credit  programs.    The collective  data  base  would  provide  potential  investors  with  easilyaccessible  and credible information about various SMEs. Nevertheless there exist SMEs such as ISMEs that still cannot get funds from financial  institutions  because  they  have  uncertainties  naturally  associated  with  their businesses.    In this case funding is supposed to be supplied through capital markets.   A  government  can  help  SMEs  secure  capital  market  financing  in  several  ways.   Although an individual company is exposed to high credit risk once SMEs with various degrees of risk exposures are pooled together the basket of SMEs as a whole may have credit risk low enough to be attractive to debt market investors.    A government may provide  credit  guarantee  programs  on  the  pooled  products  and  to  sell  the  products  to  55\\x0cinvestors more efficiently.    A government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit guarantee programs can be used to efficiently  direct  bank  loans  to  SMEs  as  well  as  broaden  the  range  of  investors  in capital  markets.    However  the  program  should  be  focused  on  SMEs  that  have  high growth potential but cannot find an appropriate source of funding.  A government should also try to construct a favorable environment from entry to  exit  for  venture  capital  investment.    The  venture  capital  industry  is  vulnerable  to unfavorable  economic  situations;  hence  there  should  be  enough  investors  to  raise sufficient funds.    In addition if there are various exit channels for venture capitalists they will have more incentives to invest in early stage venture companies with high risk.   Therefore  the  government  should  try  to  build  a  constructive  environment  where  the venture  capital  industry  can  invest  in  SMEs  with  high  potential  but  high  risk.    A government may consider legal coordination to stimulate venture capital investment to SME sectors with high potential.  A  government  should  use  private  resources  efficiently.    One  example  is  the public  fund  of  funds  such  as  Korea  Fund  of  Funds  and  European  Investment  Fund (EIF).    If a government invests in SMEs directly there may be moral hazards because SMEs know the government cannot withdraw their support for political reasons.    Also professionals in the private sector have more expertise in the financial sector because financial  products  are  constantly  changing  and  always  developing.    Therefore  it  is more efficient to use the private sector to allocate public funds.    There  should  be  coordination  between  government  programs  and  private funding.    Although  the  government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  role  is  important  in  building  a  stable  source  of SME  funding  its  efforts  to  mitigate  the  SME  financing  gap  cannot  be  successful without  active  participation  of  the  private  sector  and  investors.    For  this  reason  a  56\\x0cgovernment\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continuous effort to facilitate more participation from the private sector is needed.    In addition the government should focus on identifying the specific sectors of SMEs  that  are  faced  with  the  most  severe  financing  gaps  in  the  capital  market.    For example SMEs with high credit ratings can easily get funding from the private sector but they can also use government programs that have benefits such as low interest rates.   If  this  is  the  case  the  resources  are  not  distributed  efficiently  as  they  can  easily  get public  funds  as  a  result  of  their  high  credit  ratings.    In  this  sense  the  government should  focus  on  assisting  prospective  SMEs  that  cannot  easily  access  funds  normally available in private financial markets.                 57\\x0c References Kang  D.
