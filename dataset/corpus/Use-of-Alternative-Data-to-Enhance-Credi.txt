Despite the insufficient credit data MSMEs and individuals generate vast amounts  of  noncredit  digitized  data  daily.  MSMEs  and  individuals  are  leaving  vast  digital footprints and data trails on mobile and online payments platforms social networks and other nonbanking platforms such as online record keeping and trade transactions.   Financial institutions are starting to mine these vast amounts of digitized alternative data to aid in  their  decisionmaking  processes  and  to  promote  financial  inclusion.  Traditional  and  nontraditional  lenders  are  now  leveraging  on  alternative  data  including  transactional  (payments) data  behavioral  data  and  social  media  data  to  determine  capacity  and  willingness  to  repay loans. Alternative data is also being used to provide granularity on customer preferences and behaviors which can help in designing new financial products and services.   Credit  reporting  service  providers  have  also  begun  adopting  alternative  data  for  credit worthiness  evaluation.  The  use  of  alternative  data  in  credit  reporting  can  promote  access  to credit  for  borrowers  with     no  credit  files     while  it  can  also  complement  traditional  data  for borrowers with    thin credit files   .   Notwithstanding the benefits of alternative data there are various challenges that impede the adoption of alternative data for credit reporting. The challenges include  lack of enabling legal and  regulatory  environment  difficulties  in  verifying  identity  of  data  subjects  multiplicity  and fragmentation of data sources which often result in inaccurate or incomplete information and the opaqueness of alternative scoring methodologies. Absence of supportive legal environment has  the  potential  of  constraining  the  use  of  alternative  data  for  credit  scoring  as  the  use  of certain data attributes might be prohibited. Some of the alternative data sources such as social media are susceptible to inaccuracies as it might be difficult to authenticate the identity of the account owner. In emerging markets the use of alternative data is also hampered by the low levels  of  digitization.  Government  and  private  sector  services  such  as  company  registries  and tax  filing  are  not  digitized  resulting  in  vast  amounts  of  potential  alternative  data  being  not captured.      The  adoption  of  alternative  data  for  financial  and  other  sensitive  decisions  also  brings  to  the fore  additional  risks  that  should  be  mitigated  in  a  manner  that  ensures  the  expanded  and sustained  use  of  alternative  data  responsibly.  Key  risks  include  data  inaccuracies;  the  use  of data  that  is  based  on  uninformed  consumer  consent;  potential  for  discrimination;  and heightened  exposure  to  cyber  risks.  Some  categories  of  alternative  data  such  as  social  media       data end up being used by CRSPs without the data subject   s consent thus exposing the firms to potential  legal  risks.  Social  media  data  is  usually  not  originally  collected  and  consented  to  be used  for  credit  reporting  purposes.  The  use  of  alternative  data  is  also  susceptible  to  risk  of discrimination  as  some of the data  attributes  that  are  collected  including  race  color  sex  and marital  can  result  in  discriminatory  scoring  practices  if  unmonitored.  Finally  as  the  credit reporting ecosystem expands to include the new players such as alternative lenders and other data providers the risk of cyber threats increases.  Against this  background  this  Policy  Guide  provides  practical  policy  recommendations  on how countries  can  adopt  and  leverage  the  use  of  alternative  data  for  credit  reporting  while mitigating  the  risk  inherent  in  the  use  of  such  data.  The  matrix  below  provides  a  list  of impediments and the ICCR policy recommendations.  Policy topic Impediments for financial inclusion Main recommended actions for policymakers  1.

INTRODUCTION AND BACKGROUND    1. 2. 3. 4. 5. Background  The G20 recognizes that Micro Small and Medium Enterprises (MSMEs) play a major role in economic development particularly in emerging countries. Studies indicate that formal SMEs contribute  up  to  45  percent  of  employment  and  up  to  33  percent  of  GDP  in  developing economies2.  These  numbers  are  significantly  higher  when  taking  into  account  the  estimated contributions of MSMEs operating in the informal sector. The informal sector presents one of the greatest challenges in the MSME space with issues that go well beyond finance.   Promoting  MSMEs  development  is  an  important  priority  in  the  context  of  the  international development  agenda  and  given  the  critical  importance  of  job  creation  following  the  latest financial crisis. Of the estimated 365445 million MSMEs in emerging markets only 162 million are formal enterprises3.  Access to finance remains a key constraint to MSMEs development in emerging economies. According to the MSME Finance Gap (2017) there are 20.75 million formal SMEs in developing countries of which an estimated 44 percent do not have access to formal institutional loans or overdrafts despite a need for one. The estimated financing gap for formal SMEs is $4.52 trillion annually. The finance gap is far bigger when considering the SMEs in the informal sector. The estimated potential demand for SMEs in the informal sector stands at $2.52 trillion annually4. The proportional size of the finance gap (as a percentage of GDP) varies widely across regions and is particularly daunting in SubSaharan Africa and South Asia.  Lack  of  credit  data  is  often  cited  as  one  of  the  major  obstacles  to  MSMEs  financing  in developing  countries5.  This  problem  is heightened  for  economic  agents operating  in  informal sectors since most of their business is cash transactions which in most instances go unrecorded due to lack of financial awareness. In most developing countries the entrepreneurs behind the MSMEs  especially  those  operating  in  informal  markets  tend  to  have  no  or  thin  credit  files which affects their ability to access personal credit from formal financial institutions.    The  lack  of  sufficient  and/or  of  high  quality  data  and  other  creditrelated  information  for decisionmaking  also  limits  access  to  finance  for  micro  small  and  mediumsize  enterprises (MSMEs)       and  especially  for  those  operating  in  some  level  of  informality.  Most  MSMEs  do not  have  accounting  packages  to  record  their  transactions  and  generate  credible  financial statements  and  projections.  Very  often  the  only  standard  information  that  is  available  to assess  their  creditworthiness  is  the  personal  credit  file  or  paperbased  records  of  the entrepreneur which is expensive to access and process and limited in scale.       6. 7. 8. 9. In a digital age businesses are getting access to large volumes of structured and unstructured data which can be used for decision making on a daily basis. It is estimated that the world   s stock  of  digital  data  will  double  every  two  years  through  2020  fueled  by  the  phenomenal intersection of and growth in mobile big data and electronic payments.6   The financial system already  generates digitized data that  is considered as alternative data. Such  information  includes  mobile  and  online  banking  transactions  digital  payments  and automated utility payments.  In many instances alternative data is being created outside the financial system. Every time MSMEs  and  their  customers  use  cloudbased  services  browse  the  internet  use  their  mobile phones  engage  in  social  media  use  ecommerce  platforms  ship  packages  or  manage  their receivables  payables  and  recordkeeping  online  they  create  digital  footprints.  Data  collected through  mobile  phones  and  telecommunications  (e.g.  call  records  airtime  top  ups  P2P  G2P and  P2G  payment  transactions)  are  also  exponentially  increasing  data  trails  including  for  low income consumers in developing and emerging markets.  Traditional  and nontraditional lenders  have  an  option to  mine  this realtime  and  use  it  for credit  granting  decision  making.  Lenders  can  use  the  alternative  data  to  determine  capacity and willingness to repay loans.   10.  Using  alternative  data  to  enhance  credit  reporting7  thus  represents  a  large  opportunity  to expand  access  to  finance  to  individuals  and  MSMEs.  Lenders  may  leverage  alternative  data such as information from utilities or retail lending behavioral data online platform and mobile applications  to  reach  new  customer  segments  including  micro  and  small  enterprises.  Beyond being  used  to  provide  access  to  credit  alternative  data  may  offer  valuable  granularity  on customer  preferences  and  behaviors  that  can  help  to  design  new  financial  products  and services encourage positive financial behaviors and support the real sector by linking financing to energy commerce health or other sectors.  11.  Notwithstanding the benefits the use of new types of alternative data for financial and other sensitive decisions brings to the fore additional risks. Resultantly authorities should balance promoting  the  benefits  of  the  expanded  use  of  alternative  data  while  ensuring  that  inherent risks are managed. While beneficial alternative data might come from unreliable sources and might  not  be  of  the  desired  quality  (inconsistency  incompleteness)  resulting  in  financial exclusion of data subjects.        12.  The G20 High Level Principles on Digital Financial Inclusion recognize the role that  the use of alternative data for credit reporting can play in promoting access to credit for individuals and MSMEs  in  the  informal  sector.  Against  this  background  the  objective  of  this  paper  is  not  to direct  adoption  of  prescriptive  legislative  provisions  but  to  provide  guidance  for  countries  to use in considering adoption and use of alternative data to enhance credit reporting.   Selection criteria of topics and policies  13.  This Policy Guide brings together evidence and consensusbased policy recommendations and guidance that can be used to support four policy areas that are deemed important to promote the use of alternative data to enhance credit reporting. The policy areas are  14. IMPROVING AVAILABILITY AND ACCURACY OF INFORMATION; i. ii.  EXPANDING CREDIT INFORMATION SHARING; iii.  ENABLING CROSS BORDER DATA EXCHANGES; AND iv.  BALANCING INTEGRITY INNOVATION AND COMPETITION.  In order to ensure completeness of the guide this report also  considered policies related  to Data Privacy  Consumer  Protection  and  Cyber  security  in  so  far  as  they  relate  to  the  use  of alternative data for credit reporting issues. The policy areas were defined as v.  PRESERVING DATA PRIVACY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION; vi.  BALANCING OPTIN AND OPT OUT MODELS;  vii.  SAFEGUARDING CYBER SECURITY AND DATA INTEGRITY; AND  viii.  MAINTAINING PRICING TRANSPARENCY.   15.  For policies (v) to (vii); this report adopted the policy proposals advanced in the GPFI Financial Consumer  Protection  Law  (FCPL)  SubGroup  Discussion  Paper  on  Data  Protection  and  Privacy for Alternative Data.  Organization of the Policy Guide  16.  The  rest  of  the  document  is  organized  as  follows;  Section  2  includes  a  discussion  on  the definition  categories  and  sources  of  alternative  data  and  Section  3  covers  the  challenges impediments  and  policy  opportunities  to  using  alternative  data  and  the  policy  proposals. Finally  section  4  provides  some  conclusions  and  recommendations.  In  this  Policy  Guide policies are organized into the eight policy areas highlighted above. The Policy Guide contains key content and guidelines for relevant policies within each topic area.          II.  DEFINITIONS CATEGORIES AND DATA SOURCES OF ALTERNATIVE DATA  Definition  17.  Although  it  is  generally  agreed  that  the  term        alternative  data        can  be  used  interchangeably with  "nontraditional  data"8  there  has  been  no  consensus  on  the  single  definition  of alternative  data.  Most  definitions  take  a  descriptive  rather  than  normative  approach  to defining alternative data.  The CFPB on the other hand define alternative data as    any data that are not traditional   9.   18.  Lexis delineates alternative data to include information that is not found on traditional credit reports and this includes public records business associations professional licenses education and address history 10.   19.  Oliver  Wyman  definition  of  alternative  data  introduces  two  dimensions  that  is  financial information  and  predictive  power.  They  defined  alternative  data  as  providing     ...  additional financial payment information on consumers or otherwise information with predictive power.    Such information includes utility telecommunication rentals asset records alternative lending payments and demand deposit account information.11  20.  The GPFI Priorities Paper 2018 defines alternative data as    A generic term that designates the massive volume of data that is generated by the increasing use of digital tools and information systems.       21.  For  the  purposes  of  credit  reporting  the  ICCR  views  alternative  data  as  merely  serving  to describe  ways  to  collect  and  analyze  data  on  creditworthiness  which  are     alternative     to conventional methods such as documented credit history12. Alternative data is also considered to  be through technological/electronic platforms.   readily  available is  collected in  digitized information form that 22.  The definition of alternative data is expected to continue to evolve as more work on the area comes  to  the  fore.  Notwithstanding  it  is  important  to  highlight  that  the  definition  of alternative data will remain country specific and dependent on the kind of credit information that CRSPs in these jurisdictions are currently collecting. As a result what is alternative in one market can be traditional in another.   Categories of alternative data       23.  The  GPFI  identified  two  main  categories  of  alternative  data;  namely  structured  and unstructured data.  Structured Data 24.  Structured  data  is  defined  as     information  with  a  high  degree  of  organization  such  that inclusion in a relational database is seamless and readily searchable by simple straightforward searchengine  algorithms  or  other  search  operations.       Structured  alternative  data13  could include for example      Reporting  of  data  on  payments  (e.g. utilities  mobile  phone  and  certain  other  obligations like rental information taxes etc.).       Data on crowdfunding transactions factoring leasing and credit insurance.       Data on transactions from P2P lending platforms invoice accounts payable sales volume merchant  transactional  data  mobile/emoney  transactions  procurement  data  historical business  cash  flows  shipping  history  bills  of  lading  and  data  from  online  accounting platforms.       Reporting of relevant data associated to assets (movables and fixed).       Reporting of data on other payment flows received by disadvantaged individuals (e.g. subsidies pensions domestic and crossborder remittances etc.) when appropriate.  Unstructured data 25.  Unstructured  data  is  defined  as     information  that  either  does  not  have  a  predefined  data model and/or  is  not organized  in  a predefined manner.   14 Unstructured data  include but  not limited to      Social media and internet usage      Emails      Text and messaging files      Audio files      Digital pictures and images      GPS data      Mobile usage (how many calls to the same number peak usage etc.)      Other meta data       Psychographic psychometric and other nonfinancial behavioral data   26.  Alternative  data  that  is  structured  and  focuses  on  transactional  and  other  information  that demonstrate  the     ability  to  repay     debt  is  usually  the  most  useful.  Notwithstanding unstructured  data  can  be  more  useful  in  cases  of  first  time  borrowers  with  no  or  thin  credit histories and to complement credit histories of more established MSMEs.  Sources of alternative data       27.  The  adoption  of  digital  platforms  and  technologies  by  individuals  and  businesses  alike  have increased  the  sources  of  nontraditional  data.  Every  time  individuals  MSMEs  and  their customers  use  cloudbased  services  conduct  banking  transactions  make  or  accept  digital payments  browse  the  internet  use  their  mobile  phones  engage  in  social  media  buy  or  sell electronically ship packages or manage their receivables payables and recordkeeping online they create digital footprints.   28.  This  realtime  and  verified  data  can  be  mined  to  determine  both  capacity  and  willingness  to repay loans. A rapidly growing crop of fintech lenders are putting the use of MSMEs digital data customer  needs  and  advanced  analytics  at  the  center  of  their  business  models  adding  an additional source of alternative data.   29.  Alternative data sources should provide credible information if it is to be relied upon. There are generally accepted characteristics15 of good sources of alternative data      Coverage the data source must cover a broad proportion of the population and must be consistent to enable comparability      Regulatory compliance data sources should comply with existing regulations for credit data sharing       Predictive power the data must be able to predict repayment behavior       Orthogonality  the  sources  should  provide  information  that  enriches  already  existing traditional data      Accuracy  and  timeliness  the  source  should  provide  data  whose  accuracy  can  be validated and the data should be frequently updated      Depth  of  information  a  data  source  should  provide  detailed  data  elements  about  an individual                 III.  CHALLENGES IMPEDIMENTS AND POLICY OPPORTUNITIES  30.  The  adoption  of  alternative  data  can  help  promote  the  inclusion  of  individuals  and  MSMEs with no or thin credit files into the mainstream credit markets    31.  Notwithstanding  the  potential  benefits  there  is  need  to  address  the  impediments  that  can curtail the use of alternative data for credit reporting. It is important to ensure that the use of alternative data will preserve the accuracy quality and completeness of credit reporting data.   32. In  line  with  globalization  there  is  need  to  ensure  mobility  of  data  across  borders  balance innovation and stability and protect the right of consumers. In addition the use of alternative data  should  ensure  that  the  credit  reporting  ecosystem  is  not  exposed  to  additional vulnerabilities.  3.1  ADOPTION OF ALTERNATIVE DATA FOR CREDIT REPORTING  33.  The use of alternative data presents new sets of risks and challenges that should be mitigated for  the  world  to  fully  benefit.  The  risks  and  challenges  associated  with  the  use  of  alternative data include business practice data privacy and consumer protection issues.16 The explanation box below captures some of risks associated with the use of alternative data. Box 1 Challenges associated with alternative data  1. Noncompliance with credit laws and regulations 2. Difficulties in verifying identification 3. Multiple fragmented data sources which are difficult to collect and aggregate 4.5. Minimum thresholds are set  at levels to lower collection  and submission costs which  tend to leave out Inaccurate or incomplete information MSMEs and individuals in the informal sector. 6. Unintended side effects such as potential for discrimination 7. Opaqueness of scoring methodologies   34.  The  adoption  of  digital  solutions  such  as  distributed  ledger  (blockchain)  technology  can contribute  to  addressing  some  of  the  inefficiencies  associated  with  ID  verification  data ownership and security.        35. In  order  to  ensure  effective  and  responsible  use  of  alternative  data  and  standardization  of approaches within countries there is need for policy makers to provide guidance and in certain case reform their laws and regulations.  POLICY RECOMMENDATION 1 GUIDANCE ON THE USE OF ALTERNATIVE DATA Regulators  and  policy  makers  should  introduce/  amend  laws  and  regulations  to  clarify how alternative  data  may  be  sourced  and  processed  taking  into  consideration  privacy  and  data protection international standards.  Some examples that can be useful alternative data sources include      Reporting of data on payments made by individuals and MSMEs (e.g. utilities mobile phone and certain other obligations like rental information taxes tuition etc.).       Data  on  crowdfunding  transactions  factoring  franchise  history leasing  and  credit insurance.      Data on transactions from P2P lending platforms ecommerce providers invoice accounts receivable  and  payable  and  procurement  data  historical  business  cash  flows  shipping history bills of lading economic indicators taxes paid.17       Reporting  of  relevant  data  associated  to  assets  (movables  and  fixed)  that  belong  to disadvantaged individuals and MSMEs.       Reporting  of  data  on  other  payment  flows  received  by  disadvantaged  individuals  (e.g. subsidies pensions domestic and crossborder remittances etc.) when appropriate.  3.2 36. IMPROVING AVAILABILITY AND ACCURACY OF INFORMATION   In the era of Big Data policy makers should ensure the accuracy of data remains sacrosanct if CRSPs are to effectively leverage alternative data to promote access to credit for MSMEs and individuals.    General  Principle  1  of  the  General  Principles  for  Credit  Reporting18  (herein  the    General  Principles   )  highlights  that  credit  reporting  systems  should  have  relevant  accurate timely and sufficient data. Implementing such a principle is however more complex when data is  obtained  from  a  wide  variety  of  sources  as  data  accuracy  and  reliability  may  be  harder  to check.  One  way  of  increasing  data  accuracy  is  by  ensuring  that  data  subjects     access rectification correction and opposition (ARCO) rights are safeguarded.   37.  According to the World Bank19 new types of data coming from multiple sources are generally used to assess creditworthiness when financial information about the borrower is absent either because the individual or MSME is borrowing for the first time or when the credit information system is not developed.           3.1.1 Aggregation and Accuracy of Data 38.  One of the inherent challenges that arises from  having multiple data sources is the need to link and aggregate data collected from various sources to a particular individual or MSMEs. To be able to link and aggregate data of MSMEs and individuals from various sources  there is a need for unique identifiers that unequivocally identify individuals and MSMEs at reasonable cost. Some countries do not have National ID systems that can uniquely identify an individual. Failure  to  uniquely  identify  data  subjects  can  result  in  inaccurate  unreliable  and  incomplete information.  39.  The inherent risk with using inaccurate unreliable and incomplete data is that the score/ credit worthiness  assessment  may  be  erroneous  leading  to  potential  risks  of  exclusion  if  the  error results  in the  underestimation  of  the  ability of the borrower  to  repay or  of  potential risks  of over indebtedness if the error is in overestimating the capacity of the borrower to repay.   POLICY RECOMMENDATION 2 UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS To  ensure  accuracy  of  alternative  data  policy  makers  and  regulators  should  implement  a unique identifier that unequivocally identify data subjects. Policy makers should consider the following options as unique identifiers      For  jurisdictions  with  efficient  and  consistent  National  Identification  (ID)  systems  policy     makers should make use of the IDs to identify smaller MSMEs (as well as individuals)  In  instances  where  the  National  IDs  do  not  exist  policy  makers  should  consider  the  use  of alternatives such as social security agencies tax numbers or consider working with financial regulators/  credit  registries/  banking  institution  to  establish  Financial  (Bank)  Identification Numbers. jurisdictions  should  consider implementation of a consistent identification framework like the G20 Legal Entity Identifier (LEI). long  run  policy  makers in  these In  the      For larger and established MSMEs policy makers and regulators can examine the potential for establishing a Company Registration framework or make use of the LEI provided by the G20  Global  Legal  Entity  Identifier  System  (GLEIS)  in  order  to  connect  data  from  different sources (e.g. credit reporting financial statements payment systems) to improve  accuracy of linked data.20         POLICY RECOMMENDATION 3 VALIDATION OF UNIQUE IDENTIFIERS Relevant publicsector agencies in their role as other data sources specifically to the extent they  provide  identification  services  should  provide  access  to  national  ID  databases  for validation purposes.  3.1.2 Availability and Quality of Data 40.  Across the globe Governments store and manage data that can be used by CRSPs to enrich the  information  available  for  credit  worthiness  assessment  yet  in  some  developing  and emerging countries that data or most of it is not shared. Most government agencies in these economies  keep  the  data  within  their  systems  while  releasing  a  controlled  amount  of information  to  individuals  and  other  stakeholders  for  research  or  other  purposes.  This  has resulted in CRSPs duplicating the collection of that data through inefficient and costly methods. More often than not the costs are passed on to consumers and translate to high cost of credit.  In  developed  economies  most  Governments  have  implemented  the  policy  of  making  data available publicly to the community as part of Open Government Partnerships initiatives based on  the  realization  of  the  economic  value  of  sharing  this  data.  Other  initiatives  such  as  the PSD221 can be used to indirectly create an open data environment for financial services.   41. Box 2 Open Data System and PSD2 Open data systems are platforms where some data is freely available to everyone to use and republish as they wish  without  restrictions  from  copyright  patents  or  other  mechanisms  of  control.  Open  data  systems  can either  be  private  or  government  initiated.  Some  examples  of  opendata  initiatives  include  Data.gov Data.gov.uk and Data.gov.in and open banking.  Open banking is when banking data is shared between two or more unaffiliated parties through APIs to deliver enhanced capabilities to the marketplace.  Open banking is one of the drivers behind the EU   s Revised Payment Service Directive (PSD2) which requires financial institutions in the E.U. to release customer data to authorized third parties using open and standardized applied programming interfaces (APIs). This approach to open APIs will allow banks and nonbank lenders to obtain transactional data and liquidity information in order to provide a  very  dynamic  view  of  creditworthiness.    Some  providers  such  as  bonify.de in  Germany  are  using transactional data (debit and credit movements on accounts liquidity levels and historical changes) to create a creditworthiness score which is quite different from the static approach of the past. Instead of looking at long term  statistical  means  they  maintain  an  always  uptodate  score  based  on  both  historical  and  current transactional data.   Notwithstanding  its  benefits  open  data  system  introduces  new  challenges  in  the  form  of  cybersecurity potential  for  fraud  and  data  privacy  and  protection  issues.  There  is  therefore  a  need  to  consider  various prerequisites.    To  address  these  issues  PSD2  also  includes  rules  to  improve  security  measures  through  twofactor  authentication  as  well  as  data  protection  and  privacy  including  provisions  ensuring  informed  consent requirements for consumers.   The reliability of open data platforms is dependent on the quality and timeliness of the data that is collected and stored on these platforms. There is thus a need to ensure that the process of collecting and processing data enhances the quality of the data that is stored.           POLICY RECOMMENDATION 4 DIGITIZING GOVERNMENT DATA MANAGEMENT SERVICES  Policy makers should ensure that data managed by governmental agencies is digitized and where appropriate shared in an efficient and costeffective manner with CRSPs. This includes but  is  not  limited  to  ID  datasets  corporate  registries  court  of  law  data  and  collateral registries.  POLICY RECOMMENDATION 5 OPEN DATA SYSTEMS AND STANDARDS Policy  makers  should  explore  the  option  of  developing  an  Open  Data  System  and  Data Standards  for  MSME  data  (including  corporate  financial  banking  and  other  relevant alternative data).   POLICY RECOMMENDATION 6 AUTOMATION Policy  makers/  regulators  should  promote  automation  in  data  collection  processing  and ensuring data is properly updated and able to be accessed.   3.1.3 Comprehensive and Granular Coverage of Alternative Data  42.  Most  of  the  individuals  and  MSMEs  operating  in  the  informal  sector  do  not  have  sufficient credit  related  information  as  the  bulk  of  their  financial  and  economic  transactions  are  not recorded digitally. In instances where that information is recorded the cost of CRSPs to extract and process it is expensive and  often end up being passed to consumers in form of high fees thus impact on access to credit.  43.  The  lack  of  sufficient  quality  data  and  other  creditrelated  information  for  decisionmaking also  limits  access  to  finance  for  micro  small  and  mediumsize  enterprises  (MSMEs)       and especially for those operating in some level of informality. Most MSMEs    operations such as sales  purchases  and  accounting  processes  are  not  automated  which  affects  their  ability  to generate  credible  financial  statements  and  projections.  Very  often  the  only  standard information that is available to assess their creditworthiness is the personal credit file or history of owners or operators of business.   44.  By  adopting  digital  platforms  individuals  and  MSMEs  in  the  informal  sector  will  leave  a digital footprint. The digital footprint will promote access to more comprehensive and granular digitized  transactional  data  which  can  be  processed  by  CRSPs  as  well  as  other  service  to improve access to credit.         POLICY RECOMMENDATION 7 PROMOTE DIGITAL FOOTPRINT Policy  makers  and  regulators  should  promote  MSMEs  to  use  as  much  as  possible  digital services22  to  run  their  businesses  since  these  services  leave  a  digital  record  that  can  be accessed and combined with other information to be analyzed for creditworthiness.        Policy makers/regulators should consider offering financial and nonfinancial incentives23 to  credit  providers  MSMEs  and  consumers  as  a  way  of  promoting  use  of  digital platforms.  It  is  important  to  note  that  research  is  still  building  on  the  effectiveness  of incentives.       Policy  makers/regulators  should  consider  digital  financial literacy  and  consumer awareness campaigns educating individuals and MSMEs on the benefits challenges and safeguards associated with using digital platforms Box 3 Incentivizing Digital Payments Experiences in Colombia India South Korea  There  are  several  examples  of  countries  that  have  utilized  financial  and  nonfinancial  incentives  to  promote digital payments. Three cases are discussed hereunder.  South Korea In  the  1990s  South  Korean  government  introduced  tax  incentive  schemes  to  promote  digital  payments.  Tax rebates were offered if more than 25% of an individual or entity   s annual income was spent through credit or debit cards. Resultantly credit card transactions grew from 4.9% in 1999 of the country   s GDP to 34.3% in 2002.   Colombia The government led the way by transacting primarily through electronic payments. Approximately 69 percent of the  value  of  money  changing  hands  in  Colombia  each  month  is  paid  electronically  of  which  94%  is  by  the government. The country is now a    cashlite    economy with government and business bulk payers in Colombia shifting to electronic means of payment. To support this shift Colombia passed a law in 2017 that provides a tax benefit to small merchants earning less than USD $38000 per year for all revenue captured by a POS terminal.   India In a move that will encourage small shops to accept electronic payments the government of India has decided to bear the charges merchants pay to banks on purchases of up to Rs 2000 using a debit card Bhim or Aadhaar. The subsidy will be available for a period of two years starting from January 1 2018.   These examples offer several insights and lessons learned for other countries including 1)The important role of government to lead the way in providing the right enabling environment as well as incentives The important role that the private sector should play in creating digital payment infrastructure 2)3) Government  and  private  sector  need  to  work  together  to  have  a  coherent  publicprivate  strategy  to shift toward inclusive digital finance          POLICY RECOMMENDATION 8 DIGITIZE GOVERNMENT SERVICES Policy  makers  should  also  encourage  government  agencies  to  digitize  government  services such as tax filing company registration and other government services to encourage a digital footprint  for  MSMEs  and  individuals.  Once  digitized  that  information  should  be  made available as much as is possible for public use.  3.2  EXPANDING CREDIT INFORMATION SHARING   3.2.1 Comprehensive Data Coverage 45. In  the  digital  age  a  significant  amount  of  data  that  is  relevant  for  evaluating  the creditworthiness  of  borrowers  is  not  collected  by  CRSPs.  In  some  jurisdictions  alternative lenders or other nonfinancial entities that generate digital credit data are not required to share their data. As a result there are vast amounts of data that would promote access to credit for MSMEs  and  individuals  that  are  currently  not  being  captured  by  CRSPs.  There  is  a  need  to expand credit information sharing if economies are to benefit from a broader set of digital data which is now available and is relevant.  46.  The  role  of  the  CRSPs  may  change  going  forward  starting  by  the  way  the  information  is collected  by  them.    Traditionally  the  CRSPs  especially  credit  bureaus  have  relied  on  data providers  to  put  together  the  information  in  specific  formats  applying  validation  rules  to minimize errors and using predefined    scripts    to upload the data into their databases. More recently bureaus are developing new credit scoring models based on applications that extract the information directly from its source including digitized data that was not available before. With this opportunity comes more responsibilities as well as challenges.   47.  The amount of data collected has also been limited by minimum thresholds that has been set for reporting credits/debtors. In certain instances the minimum thresholds are set at the levels which  might  be  too  high  for  individuals  and  MSMEs.  This  results  in  these  data  subject  being unable to build credit history thus impacting on their ability to access credit.  In  markets  with  inefficiencies  there  is  inadequate  credit  information  sharing  with  and between  CRSPs.  In  certain  jurisdictions  the  absence  of  regulations  that  compels  credit providers to share information has resulted in some data providers not sharing information and in  the  cases  when  they  do  the  information  is  not  frequently  updated.  In  those  markets  the failure to share credit data has resulted in incomplete data that may lead to erroneous credit decisions and impact negatively the performance of credit portfolio. 48.        POLICY RECOMMENDATION 9 LEGISLATIVE REFORMS Policy  makers/  regulators  should  consider  reviewing  their  legal  frameworks  to  require  all financial service and credit providers; including nonbank financial institutions and payment firm  that  are  not  regulated  by  a  financial  authority  and  utility  companies  to  report  credit data and other relevant information to CRSPs in their jurisdictions.   POLICY RECOMMENDATION 10 PROMOTING INFORMATION SHARING Regulators  should  promote  open  fair  and  competitive  credit  information  sharing  between and with CRSPs.  POLICY RECOMMENDATION 11 ESTABLISHMENT OF CREDIT REGISTRIES In countries with credit market inefficiencies policy makers should consider the feasibility of establishing a credit registry/databank to play the role of credit information aggregator and share this information with CRSPs.  POLICY  RECOMMENDATION  12  REGULATORY  OVERSIGHT  ON  NEW  CREDIT  REPORTING SERVICE PROVIDERS In  certain  instances  the  regulatory  oversight  role  of  financial  authorities  over  new  credit reporting service providers such as fintech lenders and payment systems could be elaborated further  to  accommodate  for  the  use  of  alternative  data  for  assessing  the  capability  of  the MSMEs to get a loan. POLICY RECOMMENDATION 13 MINIMUM THRESHOLDS       Policy  makers/  regulators  should  explore  the  possibility  to  reduce  or  eliminate  minimum thresholds24  for  reporting  financial  commitments  to  CRSPs  to  promote  the  capturing  of  as much data as possible. The submission requirements and processes should be streamlined as Box 4 Lowering or Eliminating Minimum Thresholds  Where thresholds for the loans included in a credit bureau   s database are high retail and small business loans are more likely to be excluded. This can hurt those that benefit the most from credit reporting systems   such as female entrepreneurs and small enterprises whose loans are typically smaller. Therefore credit bureaus and  credit  registries  that  collect  and  distribute  microfinance  data  are  more  likely  to  benefit  female entrepreneurship by building credit histories for women. Credit registries usually set relatively high thresholds for  loans  since  their  primary  purpose  is  to  support  bank  supervision  and  the  monitoring  of  systemic  risks. Credit bureaus tend to have lower minimum loan thresholds.  Indonesia Tunisia and West Bank and Gaza eliminated their loan thresholds in 2008. Azerbaijan eliminated 3 thresholds  in  2009  1000  manat  ($1314)  for  individuals  5000  manat  ($6572)  for  firms  and  10000  manat ($13144)  for  credit  cards.  This  action  was  spurred  by  the  rapid  growth  in  consumer  loans  which  had  led banks to request more detailed information on a larger group of borrowers. In 2010 Mongolia   s credit registry eliminated  the  minimum  threshold  for  loans  included  in  its  database.  As  a  result  the  registry   s  coverage doubled  after  just  1  year.  In  Brazil  the  threshold  of  the  central  bank   s  credit  registry  has  been  reduced starting  with  BRL50000  (1997)  and  decreasing  to  BRL5000  (2002)  and  BRL1000  (2012).  More  recently  in 2016 the threshold was reduced to BRL200 (USD50). These reductions increased the level of identification of debtors and loans from 60%  to 99% of the total credit volume granted by the financial system.  The Central Bank  of  Cyprus  adopted  a  directive  in  December  2013  eliminating  the  minimum  threshold  for  loans  to  be included in credit bureaus    databases. As a result loans of all sizes are now included in the database of the credit bureau Artemis Bank Information Systems.  much as possible to to reduce costs 3.3  ENABLING RESPONSIBLE CROSS BORDER DATA EXCHANGES  49.  The  GPFI  Alternative  Data  for  MSME  Finance  document  talks  about  several  examples  where crossborder  takes  place  through  partnerships.  Like  any  crossborder  activity  international cooperation  is  essential  to  ensure  effective  implementation  and  equal  treatment.  Some national  regulators  have  put  in  place  cooperative  arrangements  to  promote  innovation  and share  information  about  financial  services.  At  the  multilateral  level  international  standard setters such as the International Organization of Securities Commissions Basel Committee on Banking  Supervision  and  Committee  on  Payments  and  Market  Infrastructures  as  well  as  the Financial Stability Board are monitoring and studying the implications of technological change for financial stability market integrity efficiency and consumer protection.  In  addition  to  general  challenges  associated  with  cross  border  flow  identified  in  General Principle  5  of  the  General  Principles  movement  of  alternative  data  across  borders  is complicated  by  differences  in  various  national  laws  and  regulation25.  The  regulatory treatment of some data categories such as personal data is not consistent across countries. In 50.       some  countries  there  are  regulations  relating  to  handling  personal  data  and  in  certain instances these rules prohibit the sharing of information across borders.  51.  Given  the  international  flow  of  data  it  is  likely  that  enforcement  regimes  and  customerrecourse  systems  will  not  be  clear  particularly  in  developing  countries  and  in  cases  where alternative data is held in the cloud and/or is based on unstructured data.26  Further  consideration  could  be  given  to  this  aspect  as  it  involves  the  need  for  a  harmonized international approach to consumers    rights disputeresolution mechanisms accountability for data errors and datasecurity measures.  52.  Another challenge associated with sharing MSMEs information across border is the absence of unique identifier that can link the credit information of the MSMEs across borders. Failure to  identify  businesses  across  borders  will  affect  the  ability  of  CRSPs  to  accurately  aggregate MSMEs  global  exposures.  In  addition  it  will  affect  the  ability  of  MSMEs  to  access  offshore funding and trade credit from their global suppliers. The use of the globally unique Legal Entity Identifier (LEI) would support to unambiguously identifying MSMEs also crossborder.  53.  There  are  differences  in  the  specific  data  that  CRSPs  in  different  countries  collect  on  both individual  and  MSMEs  borrowers  thus  making it  difficult to  aggregate  or  draw  comparisons on applicant   s data across borders.   The data variables that CRSPs collect across border are not standardized and this will become worse with the adoption of alternative data. In the absence of  a  defined  core  set  of  variables  comparing  and  aggregating  credit  information  of  applicants using information from across borders might be difficult.   POLICY RECOMMENDATION 14 COLLABORATION There  is  a  need  for  further  collaboration  at  the  international  level  (with  standard  setting bodies like the BIS Task Force on Data Sharing) to improve the comparability and consistency of MSMEs credit data that is shared across borders. Box 5 APEC CROSSBORDER CREDIT INFORMATION SHARING The IFC and BIIA were invited by APEC Business Advisory Council to conduct a pilot on the crossborder access of  SME/MSME  credit  information  involving  some  CRSPs  from  five  jurisdictions  Thailand  Cambodia  Lao Vietnam  and  China  as  part  of  the  implementation  of  the  credit  information  system  elements  of  the  APEC Financial Infrastructure Development Network (FIND). Efforts are currently underway to create a regional data dictionary  to  enable  easier  interpretation  of  cross  border  credit  reports.  These  efforts  will  also  include identification  of  any  data  element  (such  as  gender)  that  might  be  prohibited  from  being  reported  within  a particular jurisdiction but which are commonly reported in other jurisdictions.         POLICY RECOMMENDATION 15 HARMONIZATION OF DATA LAWS Policy  makers  and  regulators  should  work  towards  harmonization  of  data  protection  and privacy laws in relation to alternative data.   POLICY RECOMMENDATION 16 HARMONIZATION OF DATA ATTRIBUTES There is need to encourage at the domestic and international level on a harmonized core set of  data  attributes  to  be  shared  domestically  and  across  borders  on  MSMEs  covering  both financial data and credit performance aspects.    POLICY RECOMMENDATION 17 GLOBAL LEGAL IDENTIFIERS Policy makers should assess the feasibility of implementing the Global Legal Entity Identifier27 or its variant such as Identification for Development (ID4D) for individuals to address crossborder usage and sharing of data.   Box 7 Global Legal Entity Identifier (LEI)  The  Legal  Entity  Identifier  (LEI)  is  a  20digit  alphanumeric  code  based  on  the  ISO  17442  standard  to  uniquely  identify distinct  entities  that  engage  in  financial  transactions  in  the  broadest  definition.  It  connects  to  key  reference information that enables clear and unique identification of legal entities participating in financial transactions. Simply put the publicly available LEI data pool can be regarded as a global directory which greatly enhances transparency in the global marketplace.   The Financial Stability Board (FSB) has reiterated that global LEI adoption underpins    multiple financial stability objectives    such as improved risk management in firms as well as better assessment of micro and macro prudential risks. As a result it promotes market integrity while containing market abuse and financial fraud. Last but not least LEI rollout    supports higher quality and accuracy of financial data overall   .   The  publicly  available  LEI  data  pool  is  a  unique  key  to  standardized  information  on  legal  entities  globally.  The  data  is registered  and  regularly  verified  according  to  protocols  and  procedures  established  by  the LEI  Regulatory  Oversight Committee.  In  cooperation  with  its  partners  in  the Global  LEI  System  the Global  Legal  Entity  Identifier  Foundation (GLEIF) continues  to  focus  on  further optimizing  the  quality  reliability  and  usability  of  LEI  data  empowering  market participants to benefit from the wealth of information available with the LEI population.   The drivers of the LEI initiative i.e. the Group of 20 the FSB and many regulators around the world have emphasized the need to make the LEI a broad public good. The Global LEI Index made available by GLEIF greatly contributes to meeting this objective. It puts the complete LEI data at the disposal of any interested party conveniently and free of charge.   The benefits for the wider business community to be generated with the Global LEI Index grow in line with the rate of LEI adoption.  To  maximize  the  benefits  of  entity  identification  across  financial  markets  and  beyond  firms  are  therefore encouraged  to  engage  in  the  process  and  get  their  own  LEI.  Obtaining  an  LEI  is  easy.  Registrants  simply  contact  their preferred business partner from the list of LEI issuing organizations available on the GLEIF website.           3.4  BALANCING INTEGRITY INNOVATION AND COMPETITION  54. In  their financial  stability  roles regulators  and public  authorities  often  face  the  challenge  of striking the right balance between promoting  innovations and ensuring stability of markets. As the use of alternative data expands regulatory authorities should ensure that they do not stifle  innovation  while  at  the  same  time  ensuring  adequate  data  protection  and  attention  to consumer privacy. This challenge is heightened by the fast pace of technological change and the limited knowledge of the actual risks and their consequences for consumers and markets.  Too lenient standards could result in overindebtedness and fraud while too strict standards might curtail access to credit  55.  The World Bank the Committee on Payments and Market Infrastructure on Payment Aspects of Financial  Inclusion  (PAFI)28  and  the  G20  High  Level  Principles  for  Digital  Financial  Inclusion highlights the need to balance innovation and competition in the financial services marketplace. Preserving integrity of the financial system while encouraging access to shared information is a challenge for regulators and policymakers.  56. In addition there is insufficient regional or global information about the status of commercial credit  reporting  providers  how  they  may  be  serving  MSME  credit  providers  and  the  credit market  more  broadly.  In  many  cases  this  information  is  not  available  even  at  the  domestic level. Statistics and detailed information on the various features of commercial credit reporting and current practices around the world could no doubt be useful to all CRS participants.   POLICY RECOMMENDATION 18 RESPONSIBLE INNOVATION Policy  makers  and  regulators  should  collaborate  on  the  development  of  principles  of responsible  innovation.  Such  collaborations  can  take  the  form  of  task  forces  which  are composed  of  both  public  and  private  sector  players.  At  a  global  level  authorities  should participate  in  global  surveys  or  similar  tools  to  be  performed  periodically  to  obtain  detailed comprehensive and systematic information about credit reporting activities.        POLICY RECOMMENDATION 19 REGULATORY INNOVATION TOOLS Policy  makers  and  regulators  should  consider  the  feasibility  of  implementing/  utilizing regulatory tools for enabling innovation such as hubs and sandboxes to promote alternative data  centric  innovations  including  alternative  scoring  techniques  in  their  markets.  The framework should consider country specific context and the market dynamics.  3.5  DATA PRIVACY CYBER SECURITY AND CONSUMER PROTECTION  58. 57.  Notwithstanding  the  many  benefits  of  alternative  data  its  use  raises  some  significant  data privacy and consumer protection issues around disclosure of confidential information to third parties  transparency  and  discrimination.  As  per  the  General  Principles  credit  reporting systems should be safe and efficient and supportive of data subject and consumer rights.   In addition the adoption of new technologies and incorporation of new players to the creditreporting  ecosystem  introduces  new  sources  of  vulnerability  to  system  security.  Some common  threats  to  data  security  include  cyberattacks  from  outsiders  improper  data  use  by employees of service providers and/or from the users accidental disclosure of data accidental loss of data and natural disasters among others.    Inadequate  data  protection  practices  standards  and  rules  can  result experiencing financial harm loss of privacy and loss of trust in the financial system.   in  consumers 59. 60.  Many  of  the  new  financial  service  providers  and/or  fintech  players  may  not  have  sufficient resources  to  invest  in  robust  system  security  standards  and  data  protection.  As  such  these institutions might find themselves at risk and might eventually become a source of vulnerability of  the  whole  ecosystem.      Some  regulatory  agencies  such  as  the  US  Financial  Industry Regulatory Authority (FINRA) have developed basic checklists for alternative lenders especially new  financial  players  and  thirdparty  providers  who  support  alternative  lending  approaches. These include     Identifying and assessing cybersecurity threats;      Protecting infrastructure and platforms from cyber intrusions;     Detecting a compromise or vulnerability;     Responding through a riskbased plan; and     Recovering and/or replacing lost data.  61.  Since most alternative lenders third party aggregators and data analytic providers also store use  or  electronically  transmit  personal  identification  information  (names  national  IDs  social security  numbers  dates  of  birth  addresses  and  other  key  personal  data)  or  sensitive       62. information (financial records account information tax filings) additional steps should also be taken to protect privacy.  In line with General Principle 2 there is an increasing need for rigorous standards of security to  ensure  that  data  are  protected.  All  participants  in  a  credit  reporting  system  should undertake  best  efforts  to  implement  commercially  reasonable  data  security  safeguards  to protect data against these and other potential threats.  63.  Specific  measures  and  safeguards  should  be  adopted  to  cope  with  the  logical  physical  and organizational  aspects  of  data  security  (i.e.  socalled     tridimensional  approach  to  data security   ).  The  objective  of  these  safeguards  should  be  to  contain  limit  and  respond  to  data security breaches.  Measures  and  safeguards  should  be  reviewed  on  a  regular  basis  to  ensure that they are up to date and effective against newly emerging threats.  64.  The  increase  in  the  use  of  alternative  data  for  credit  reporting  and  scoring  and  the  speed with  which  it  is  processed  create  new  concerns  around  data  privacy  and  consumer protection.    POLICY  RECOMMENDATION  20  DATA  PRIVACY  CONSUMER  PROTECTION  AND CYBERSECURITY 65.  To  address  the  impediments  of  data  privacy  consumer  protection  and  cyber  risks  associated with  alternative  data  this  report  adopts  the  policy  proposals  advanced  in  the  GPFI  Financial Consumer  Protection  Law  (FCPL)  SubGroup  Discussion  Paper  on  Data  Protection  and  Privacy for Alternative Data to the extent they relate to credit reporting issues.   66.  The policy areas adopted related to the following policy areas as defined in the scope  of this work i.  Preserving Data Privacy and Consumer Protection; ii.  Balancing OptIn and Opt Out Models; and iii.  Safeguarding Cyber Security and Data Integrity.          BOX 8 DATA PRIVACY CONSUMER PROTECTION AND CYBERSECURITY POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS  POLICY GUIDANCE LAWFUL COLLECTION OF INFORMATION Alternative data involving personal information used for the evaluation of creditworthiness of consumers and SMEs  should  be  collected  and  processed  lawfully.  The  legal  bases  could  involve  consumers     consent  for collection and processing that is necessary;  (i) for the performance of a contract to which the data subject is party (ii) for compliance with legal obligations (iii) to protect  vital interests of the data subject (iv) for the performance  of  a  task  carried  out  in  the  public  interest  or  in  the  exercise  of  official  authority  vested  in  the controller and (v) for the purposes of the legitimate interests pursued by the controller or by a third party.   POLICY GUIDANCE CONSENT Recognizing that there are other legal bases for data collection and further  processing when alternative data is being used for a different  purpose than the one specified for the data collection  consistent with domestic laws  consumers     consent  shall  be  necessary.  This  policy  guidance  is  also  applicable  for  crossborder  data flows. When data is provided by a third party cost efficient mechanisms should be in place to enable consent where required.   POLICY GUIDANCE ACCURACY AND RELIABILITY Regulators  policy  makers  and  industry  participants  should  adopt  measures  to  ensure  that  alternative  data collected is lawful matched to the correct person obtained from trustable sources upto date and relevant to the purpose for what is being used. Understanding that data will not be completely free of error accuracy of data  obtained  from  multiple  sources  to  make  risk  evaluation  decisions  could  be  achieved  by  establishing requirements relating to the collection data processing and further distribution of the information.   POLICY GUIDANCE CONSUMER   S RIGHTS Data  controllers  should  enable  mechanisms  that  allow  consumers  access  and  the  ability  to  correct  their information as well as request the deletion of data  when appropriate based on applicable laws or rules on retention periods. In addition consumers should also be able to object to the processing of their information for certain purposes (i.e. marketing).  Consumers should also be given the opportunity to transfer their data to any other service provider of their choice without affecting the usability of the data.  POLICY GUIDANCE SECURITY  industry  participants  should  conduct  periodic Consistent  with  existent  national  cybersecurity  plans cybersecurity  risk  assessments  develop  policies  and  procedures  to  effectively  respond  to  cyber  incidents communicate cyber incidents to all relevant parties including consumers as soon as practicably possible or as required by law and devote resources to assess monitor and mitigate consequences of cyberincidents. These measures are also applicable for any outsourced service that involves the  processing and storage of personal information.   POLICY GUIDANCE DISCRIMINATION  Policy  makers  and  industry  participants  should  adopt  measures  to  ensure  that  predictiveness  of  alternative data is tested and verified that scoring models developed using alternative data do not unfairly discriminate against  protected  groups.  The  use  of  alternative  data  that  carries  forward  historical  discrimination  is  either prohibited or restricted taking into account its ability to predict risk and the availability of alternative decisionmaking tools. POLICY GUIDANCE  TRANSPARENCY Industry participants should enable mechanisms that allow consumers to understand the key facts (e.g. name of the data controller purpose of the data collection potential users of the data consumers    rights details on dispute  handling  mechanism  and  lawful  bases  for  such  data  collection)  of  the  data  collection.  Informing consumers about  these facts contributes to enhanced transparency and trust.  This could  be achieved in  the form of a privacy policy or privacy notes which could be provided through electronic means or any other ways      3.6  MAINTAINING PRICING TRANSPARENCY    67.  Credit reporting systems should effectively support sound and fair extension of credit in an economy as the foundation for robust and competitive credit markets. Increased automation and digitization of the credit reporting ecosystem may result in additional reduction of the cost of acquiring and processing credit data by CRSPs.  68.  Credit scoring methodologies have increased in sophistication with the passage of time and as more and more data has become accessible and available. The new methodologies have made CRSPs to become more capable of differentiating customers based on their risk29.  69.  Robust  credit reporting  infrastructure  should  thus  result  in  reduction  of the  cost  of  credit for borrowers.  POLICY RECOMMENDATION 21 RISK BASED PRICING Policy  makers  should  encourage  lenders  to  adopt  risk  based  pricing  methodologies  for borrowers  to  benefit  from  lower  lending  costs.  Risk  based  pricing  methodologies  should become embedded in the credit granting policies and procedures of lenders. In addition there is need to ensure that there is need for financial literacy on the benefits of scoring in particular risk based pricing.                    IV.  CONCLUSIONS AND RECOMMENDATIONS  70.  Access  to  credit  for  MSMEs  and  individuals  can  be  expanded  by  promoting  the  use  of alternative data in credit reporting. This is especially relevant for those with    no or thin credit files    where complementing traditional data sources with alternative data sources can assist in the design of more tailormade financial products and services. The adoption of alternative data brings with it various challenges and/or risks which needs to address for alternative data to be effectively leveraged on.   71.  The  policy  guide  provides  proposals  on  countries  to  use  in  considering  adoption  and  use  of alternative data to enhance credit reporting.

At their core credit reporting systems consist of databases of information on debtors together with the institutional technological and legal framework supporting the efficient functioning of such databases. The information stored in these systems can relate to individuals and/or businesses 8 Giving underserved consumers better access to the credit system The promise of nontraditional data.

In addition Mexico is currently working on an open data model under the new FinTech Law (need  link  from  Banco  de  Mexico)  that  will  allow  the  use  of  alternative  data  through  various  means  including Application Programming Interface (API) to promote competition in the credit markets. One of the main proposals of the FinTech Law is that it recognizes that the customer has the legal right over his or her information including the right to authorize financial service providers to    pull    data from different sources. Likewise all financial service providers wishing to access the data should have the authorization of the client. Customers will also have the right to revoke at any time the authorizations they have given. Likewise it is planed that Banco de Mexico will issue regulation to improve the quality of information (e.g. by setting the standards) held by credit institutions and other law  of  Mexico financial  entities  as  well  as  the information  held  by  credit  bureaus.  See  the  FinTech                                                                                                                                                                                  http//www.senado.gob.mx/sgsp/gaceta/63/3/201710121/assets/documentos/Iniciativa_Ejecitvo_Federal.pdf Also see the EU GDPR and PSD2 regulations. 18 General Principles for Credit Reporting (https//openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/12792) 19 Ibid. 20 The challenges of ensuring proper business identification prompted governments around the world to convene the Financial Stability Board (FSB) to analyze the underlying problems and to create a global legal entity identifier (LEI) to uniquely identify entities that engage in financial transactions representing the public interest. Hence at the  Cannes  Summit  in  2011  the  G20  provided  a  mandate  to  the  FSB  to  lead  the  coordination  of  international regulatory work and to deliver concrete recommendations for the appropriate governance framework global legal entity identifier system (GLEIS) representing the public interest. The respective FSB report    A global Legal Entity Identifier  for  Financial  Markets     with  its  highlevel  principles  and  concrete  recommendations  describing  the governance framework as well as the operational infrastructure of the GLEIS has been approved by the G20 at its Los  Cabos  summit  in  2012  followed  by  the  implementation  of  the  GLEIS  by  the  LEI  Regulatory  Oversight Committee  so  that  the  issuance  of  LEIs  could  start  in  2013.  The  global  LEI  system  provides  a  valuable  building block  to  contribute  to  and  facilitate  many  financial  stability  objectives  including  improved  risk  management  in firms; better assessment of micro and macro prudential risks; facilitation of orderly resolution; containing market abuse and curbing financial fraud; and enabling higher quality and accuracy of financial data overall.  In addition the GLEIS is also to be used by the private sector for improved risk management increased operational efficiency more  accurate  calculation  of  exposures  and  other  needs.  The  LEI  Regulatory  Oversight  Committee  (ROC)  is  the ultimate authority for oversight of the Global LEI System. The ROC is currently a group of 72 public authorities with full membership and 18 observers from more than 50 countries. The  LEI ROC represents public authorities from around the globe that have come together to jointly drive forward transparency within the global financial markets by making use of the LEI. Established by the Financial Stability Board in June 2014 the GLEIF acts as the operational arm of the system and is tasked to support the implementation and use of the LEI  on a notforprofit basis. The foundation is backed and overseen by the LEI ROC and has currently accredited 30 Local Operating Units (LOU) to issue  LEIs  (with  more  applicants  on  the  waiting  list).  The  LEI  itself  has  become  an  ISO  Standard  (ISO  17442)  to globally uniquely identify distinct entities that engage in financial transactions in the broadest definition. The total number of issued LEIs exceeds 1.15 million at the end of Q1/2018. 21 https//www.mckinsey.com/industries/financialservices/ourinsights/datasharingandopenbanking 22 Coordination with the Committee of Payments and Market Infrastructures (CPMI) of the Bank for International Settlements and the World Bank Group (WBG) Task force on the Payments Aspects of Financial Inclusion (PAFI) would be useful for this policy exercise 23 Lessons from Colombia   s shift to electronic payments.  https//btcaprod.s3.amazonaws.com/documents/34/english_attachments/ColombiaDiagnosticHighlightsENGJan2015.pdf?1438939559  24 http//www.doingbusiness.org/data/exploretopics/gettingcredit/goodpractices 25  Key Considerations Financial Consumer Protection and New Forms of Data Processing Beyond Credit Reporting World Bank Group (December 2017) 26 Ibid. 27 https//www.gleif.org/en/aboutlei/mckinseycompanyandgleifcreatingbusinessvaluewiththelei 28  World  Bank  and  the  Committee  on  Payments  and  Market  Infrastructure  on  Payment  Aspects  of  Financial Inclusion (PAFI) September 2015 https//www.bis.org/cpmi/publ/d133.pdf  29 The Role of Credit Reporting in Supporting Financial Sector Regulation and Supervision International Committee on credit Reporting January 2016    '
