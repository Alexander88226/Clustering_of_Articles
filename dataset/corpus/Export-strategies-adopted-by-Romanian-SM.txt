Introduction  The most important objectives of the National Export Strategy in the period 20052009 were the focus on high value added products like ecological agriculture rural tourism  IT  niches  the  use  of  field  branding  strategies  the  increase  of  export promotion activities and more transparency in selecting companies benefiting from support for participation at fairs and exhibitions. Analyzing  the  structure  of  Romanian  exports    in  2013  (table  1)  it  can  be noticed that the products of the machine building industry and transport equipment have the highest share in total exports followed by metallurgy and wood processing. This result is also linked to the objective of the National Export Strategy 20142020 of stimulating high value added investments in strategic fields as machine building agriculture electronics IT food industry and renewable energies.

The evolution of the balance of other services         Adapted from www.minind.ro/strategia_export/SNE_2014_2020.pdf   In 2011 foreign direct investments had a share of 71.4%  of the total exports  and have developed a lot of small and medium sized enterprises as suppliers with a positive  effect  on  the  economy  through  technological  transfer  and  employees training.(Tescasiu2012p.174). Companies continue to search the advantages of cost reductions being more involved  in  outsourcing  activities.  Romania  has  important  advantages  in  terms  of low labor costs and has attracted a lot of multinationals which produce in Romania and export in other markets. 50% of the export is made by companies with foreign capital  or  joint  ventures  like  Renault  Draxlmaier  Cargill  Schaeffler.  MNEs  in Romania  have  predominantly  chosen  to  invest  in  the  recently  liberalized  service industries  as  telecommunications  gas  energy  and  trade  and  in  manufacturing industries where technology transfer is important  automotive electrical appliances shipbuilding electronics and chemicals. (HaarMarinescu2014).  Another  important  objective  of  the  National  Export  Strategy  for  the  period 20142020  is  the  development  of  rural  tourism  organic  agriculture  furniture textiles  wine  industry  and  handicrafts.  This  objective  could  be  achieved  by supporting  small  and  medium  sized  enterprises  having  business  in  those  fields. SMEs  are  well  suited  to  tourism.  They  provide  the  interface  and  contact  between local  culture  and  tourists  and  thereby  contribute  in  communicating  the  particular characteristics of their destination. In our country the small and mediumsized firms account for 99.8% of the total units acting on this market (B  ltescu 2009 576577).    229  Export strategies adopted by Romanian SME   2. Objectives materials and methods  The  objective  of  the  research  is  the  identification  of  export  strategies  adopted  by Romanian SME companies facing tough global competitors. The creation of business alliances and marketing associations will help SME to  better  approach  the  foreign  markets  and  to  reduce  costs  of  promoting  products overseas. Romanian exporters will have to develop quality management and to align at  advanced  certification  standards  required  by  international  markets.  Particular attention  is  given  at  present  to  the  strategy  of  continuous  improvement.  It  is considered an integrating strategy across functional strategy of the enterprise and it envisages gradual continuous improvement of products and services quality as well as  productivity  and  competitiveness  with  the  participation  of  all  staff.  (Madar. Neacsu 2014) Being an iterative process quality improvement becomes in fact a continuous  improvement  of  quality.  The  target  of  the  continuous  improvement  of quality  is  the  development  of  the  company  simultaneously  with  satisfying  and attracting loyal customers. That is why taking into account the objectives and the existing resources it is essential that each company should plan in advance a certain quality strategy. (Madar Neacsu 2013) Another strategy adopted by Romanian SME could be to focus on the markets with  large  Romanian  communities  like  Italy  Spain  Canada  Israel  Greece  where Romanian products and brands can be promoted. Companies in the field of tourism handicrafts  and  wine  should  also  collaborate  for  creating  a  better  image  based  on tradition. According to the National Export Strategy for 20142020 the consumers will have  more  decision  power  by  gathering  information  about  products  and  services. The  social  responsibility  of  companies  market  reputation  relationships  between companies  and  individuals  and  quality  management  will  become  key  assets  of companies  and  sources  of  competitive  advantages.  (www.minind.ro/strategia  de export). The most important advantages of SME are innovation capacity flexibility capacity to adjust in a short time at new market conditions. Barriers encountered by companies in the process of globalization are lack of capital  required  for  direct  foreign  investments  low  expenditures  for  marketing salaries  and  product  adaptation  difficulties  in  finding  funds  from  different institutions difficulties in finding the best specialists.(Horn Faulkner2010 p.118) Factors that can help small and medium sized enterprises to overcome barriers in global expansion are offering differentiated products difficult to copy or replace attracting  capital  for  development  developing  partnerships  with  local  companies from the host market.   Dana BOSCOR     230 3. Results and discussions  Romania does not have at the moment enough resources for the promotion of exports for consultancy and support offered to exporters. (Chitu Tecau 2012). That is why the partnerships between exporting companies could be a solution to this problem as it happened in Chile where wine producers made an association to promote exports of wine. In New Zeeland all wine producers are members of the wine institute and are developing promotional activities on different foreign markets like Germany USA Canada and Australia. In order to promote wine exports a government agency was offering 1/3 of financing the difference of 2/3 being covered by producers from a tax imposed on sales. Through these efforts the image of the country was promoted and the promotional message was    the treasures of a clean and green land   . The export strategies of the companies from New Zeeland was a combination of individual and collaborative efforts. In the wine field Romanian companies should improve quality and  focus  on  a  better  promotion  in  order  to  create  well  known  brands.  The development  of  a  country  brand  for  wines  the  participation  at  different  fairs  and exhibitions and a better access at financing through European funds could help SME to  increase  their  exports  of  high  quality  wine.  Some  market  niches  could  also  be approached. An example is the segment of older black women living in the southern part of the US who prefer the Romanian sweet wine. In order to enter in foreign markets like China and USA the Romanian wine companies  must  develop  cooperative  strategies  for  promoting  Romanian  wines. (academyofwinebusiness.com)Wine  food  and  culture  should  be  combined  and Romanian wine producers should organize visits at vineyards and create an interest for tourists to know its cultural heritage.  Similar to the wine industry in the field of furniture the Romanian companies realized that the association between furniture producers can help them to divide the expenditures linked to market research new models design and access at financing. An  example  of  this  strategy  is  the  Simex  group  including  five  companies  in  the furniture field and having more than 1000 employees. Having experience and skilled labor  the  company  has  approached  the  segment  of  classic  art  furniture  in  the markets  of  Russia  and  Ukraine  but  at  the  moment  the  company  is  targeting  the markets  of  Germany  and  Holland  because  of  the  difficulties  faced  by  eastern markets.  The  furniture  produced  by  Simex  has  a  high  value  added  because  it involves  a  lot  of  manual  operations  performed  by  experienced  employees. Therefore experience high quality raw materials qualified staff can help Romanian companies  to  use  a  successful  export  strategy  targeting  even  the  most  developed countries in the world with sophisticated consumers and high expectations.  In  the  IT  field  Romanian  companies  have  already  built  well  known  brands and  have  adopted  differentiation  strategies  based  not  only  on  innovative  products but  also  on  ease  of  use  installation  upgrading  and  postimplementation  services. Romanian software companies have focused on innovation and creativity and now  in 231  Export strategies adopted by Romanian SME   they are focusing on the way the user is interacting with the technology. Companies like Softwin Total Soft and Siveco have developed global strategies targeting the most  developed  markets the  world.  They  have  understood  customers    expectations  have  conducted  market  researches  and  have  adopted  different strategies for each market. For example for the antivirus programmes the American market is focused on price while the german  customers are looking for efficiency and the acquisition process is very long.  (Rosca C.2014 P.18) The sale of software products takes into account the feedback of consumers from different markets and the professional groups and social media can promote the brand better than the producer by using classic advertising strategies. The customers are more and more part of the development process for new products so that social consumers  can  influence  the  development  of  new  functions  of  the  product.  The customers become consultants designers developers and innovators being involved in  customer  communities  or  operating  on  their  own.  Customers  can  support  and promote  the  brand  and  they  share  their  opinions  with  media  and  social  markets giving  credibility  to  what  the  company  is  trying  to  portray  from  the  brand. (Vandermerwe 2014 p.51) Technology allows the producer to have a close relationship with the buyer and to use personalization strategies for a large number of customers. In this respect Romanian  companies  can  develop  applications  that  support  a  better  relationship between the producer and the customer. The Romanian company Siveco has developed its own ERP solutions based on eLearning eHealth eAgriculture and eCustoms and at the moment is exporting in  27  foreign  markets.  The  target  markets  for  the  IT  field  are  Germany  Great Britain France USA Japan.  In  the  field  of  cosmetic  products  Romanian  companies  adopt  also  a differentiation  strategy  taking  into  account  the  differences  in  cultures  consumer behavior and climate. For example for the Asian markets products must be adapted to  the  customers  requirements  of  a  whiter  skin  while  in  Europe  there  is  an increasing demand for innovative products. For example the cosmetic line Gerovital is sold in more than 30 countries from Europe North America and Africa being an antiaging product well known for its quality.  Ivatherm  another  Romanian  cosmetics  producer  has  started  with  the Romanian  market  and  expanded  later  in  foreign  markets  like  China  Egypt  and Ukraine.  Its  products  are  sold  in  drugstores  and  have  the  advantage  of  using  the thermal water from Herculane with a lot of benefits for health. The company has participated at several fairs and exhibitions in China Japan Turkey and Abu Dhabi and  has  used  Romanian  resources  and  French  technologies  to  create  high  quality products and to fight with the multinationals in this market segment. Ivatherm has used a niche strategy by focusing on the market of antiallergic products  taking into account that in the future the number of persons suffering from different allergies will increase significantly.

Conclusions  Romanians SME should try to export high value added innovative products based on new  technologies  should  develop  export  brands  and  create  associations  between exporters  for  increasing  power  and  should  involve  in  promising  fields  like  rural tourism handicrafts and renewable energies. New markets like China India USA  and  United  Arab  Emirates  should  be  approached  with  IT  products  cosmetics tourism and food products.   5. References  B  ltescu  Codru  a  A.  2009.
