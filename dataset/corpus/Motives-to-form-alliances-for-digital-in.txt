Digital innovation leads to challenges for incumbent firms in adapting to changing rules set by new competitors and higher customer expectations. However young firms providing technical solutions for the financial services industry (fintechs)  also  face  difficulties;  for  instance  in  meeting  high  regulatory requirements. Increasing alliances in the financial services industry can be observed  due  to  shortcom  ings  on  the  side  of  banks  and  fintechs.  We conducted interviews to examine the motives of these alliance partners. The resulting  motives  are  categorized  as  matching  comple  mentary  and neutral. We derive practical implications in the form of recommendations for alliances and deliver theoretical insights regarding criteria for digitalinnovation based alliances.

Moormann Motives to Form Alliances for Digital Innovation The Case of Banks and Fintechs Introduction  1  The rise of fintechs has drawn significant attention to the financial services industry. Once believed to be a disruptor this rise has developed towards coexistence and bankfintech alli ances. The advantages offered by fintechs have been identified in the area of customer experi ence whereas those of banks are mainly in the area of backoffice processing and meeting regulatory standards (Jenkins 2016). Consequently fintechs have established an image repre senting innovation and exploration whereas banks represent continuity and seniority (Bussmann 2017).  These  aspects  have  been  believed  to  be  mutually  exclusive  and  leading  to  fierce competition (Nienaber 2016). However the coexistence of incumbents and startups can be beneficial. For example in the beer industry the increasing number of microbreweries has broadened the beer market and created new markets and customer groups. Thus many big  players  have  re  considered  their  product  portfolio  or  actively  approached microbreweries.  Similar  developments  are  unfolding  in  the  financial  services  industry  where  ongoing digitali zation requires extensive innovation (Brandl & Hornuf 2017). Digital innovation incorporates  processes  services/products  and  business  models  enabled  by  digital technologies (Fichman Dos Santos & Zheng 2014).  The rise of fintechs has gained speed in light of these developments (Puschmann 2017). Typ  ically fintechs are small nimble startups that use digital technologies to deliver certain forms of financial services. The emergence of digital technologies has provided new opportunities for services that are being exploited by fintechs. Fintechs have partly taken over functions previously reserved for incumbents; e.g. in payments lending and investing (Eickhoff Muntermann & Weinrich 2017).  While  this  development  has  previously  been  seen  as  a  disruption  to  the  traditional financial  service  industry  it  is  now  increasingly  leading  to  the  formation  of  alliances (Bocks  2017).  Now  fintechs  may  target  their  digitally  augmented  services/products toward the large cus tomer base of banks (Puschmann 2017). Banks can help fintechs address regulatory require ments and gain access to new customer groups. Consequently alliances between banks and fintechs are emerging though the phenomenon remains novel and the motivation for such part nerships is not yet well understood.  Extant literature has treated the    selection of partners [   ] as exogenous    (Li Eden Hitt & Ireland 2008 p. 315) and thus has not focused on this area. Hence the topic of partner selec  tion  has  received  little  attention  despite  longstanding  research  emphasizing  its crucial  role  during  alliance  formation  (Hitt  Tyler  Hardee  &  Park  1995).  Moreover motivations to part ner and the subsequent selection of partners for alliances to develop digital innovation has received even less attention. Hence we must first understand this motivation before analyzing the selection of partners and the nature of alliances (Bresnen & Marshall 2000). We formulate the following research question  31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F. Holotiuk M. F. Klus T. S. Lohwasser & J. Moormann Motives to Form Alliances for Digital Innovation The Case of Banks and Fintechs 303 Background Digital Innovation  What are the motives of banks and fintechs to form alliances for digital innovation?  This  paper  explores  motivations  for  bankfintech  alliances  and  categorizes  these  in  a frame  work.  The  paper  is  structured  as  follows  Section  two  outlines  the  recent development  of  banks  and  fintechs  existing  research  on  digital  innovation  and motivation to partner. Section three explains our methodology. The identified motives are presented in section four. Section five discusses the motives and their systemization and concludes the paper.   2  2.1  In order compete in a business environment strongly disrupted by digitalization digital inno  vation  is  becoming  increasingly  important  (Nambisan  Lyytinen  Majchrzak  & Song 2017). Yoo et al. (2010 p. 725) define digital innovation as    the carrying out of new combinations of digital and physical components to produce novel products.    Digital innovation  augments  tra  ditional  physical  products  with  digital  components  (Yoo Boland Lyytinen & Majchrzak 2012) and enhances the usage and customer experience (Porter  &  Heppelmann  2015).  Thus  new processes  products  services  and  business models are designed using digital technologies (Fichman et al. 2014).  Digital  innovation  impacts  the  formation  of  business  model  innovation  and  firm performance  due  to  the  oftenmissing  internal  knowledge  on  digital  technologies  and hence the need to acquire and integrate complementary external knowledge (Hildebrandt Hanelt Firk & Kolbe 2015). In the financial services industry the integration of external knowledge led to digital innovations around new processes (e.g. account opening process based on    videoident   ) ser vices (e.g. online social investment strategies and remote consulting services) and business models (e.g. online banks and peertopeer transfers). Although integration  of  heterogeneous knowledge [   ] the convergence of pervasive digital technology intensifies the degree of  heterogeneity  and  the  need  for  dynamic  balancing  and  integration  of  knowledge resources.  For  example  convergent  products  may  derive  from  com  pletely  different industries and unrelated bodies of knowledge    (Yoo et al. 2012 p. 1401). Consequently the quest for new knowledge to develop digital innovation triggers various mo tives for partners to form alliances and seek access to external knowledge.  2.2  Alongside  digital  innovation  other  factors  trigger  motivations  to  form  alliances.  The increase  of  international  interorganizational  collaboration  has  been  attributed  to disrupting  changes  in  the  market  and  ongoing  globalization  (Robson  2002).  In  the management  literature  several  theoretical  perspectives  including  transaction  costs resource  dependency  organizational  learning  strategic  positioning  and  institutional theory have been applied to explain alliance formation (Nielsen 2003). innovations  always     require  successful Motivations of Alliance Partners  304 31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F. Holotiuk M. F. Klus T. S. Lohwasser & J. Moormann Motives to Form Alliances for Digital Innovation The Case of Banks and Fintechs  Thus it is widely assumed that motivation to form alliances is based on a rationale that the  perceived  value  or  benefit  from the  alliance  outweighs  the  costs (Geringer  1991). Benefits one alliance partner can offer the other include    skills competencies capabilities and  knowledge     (Nielsen  2003  p.  302)  but  these  can  only  be  fully  captured  when partners are carefully se lected and both sides motives    are understood.  Based  on  these  insights  the  motives  of  partners  have  been  identified.  For  instance Glaister  (1996)  identifies  16  motives  in  a  sample  of  UK  joint  ventures  with  Western European  partners  Gain  presences  in  a  new  market  obtain  faster  entry  to  market facilitate internal expansion compete against common competitor obtain economies of scale maintain market position exchange complementary technology diversify products concentrate on highermargin busi ness obtain faster payback on investment spread risk of large projects share R&D costs re duce competition produce at lowest cost location exchange  patents/territories  and  conform  to  foreign  government  policy.  The  wide spectrum  of  motives  shows  that  alliances     are  becom  ing  an  essential  feature  of companies     overall  organizational  structure  and  competitive  ad  vantage  increasingly depends not only on a company   s internal capabilities but also on the types of alliances and the  scope of its  relationships with  other  companies    (Parkhe  1991 pp.  579   580). Ever  since  these  first  findings  on  alliances  the  importance  of  alliances  has  increased. Consequently  there  is  ongoing  interest  in  academia  in  alliances  and  their  underlying motives.  2.3  The growing importance of alliances is also influencing the financial services industry. One  contributing  factor  therein  is  digital  innovation  leading  to  increased  customer expectations.  Customers  are  demanding  financial  services  24/7  and  at  the  greatest convenience. Moreover digital technologies enable the provision of financial services at any given location. Further more digital technologies create huge cost savings potential for banks by reducing the tradi tional brickandmortar infrastructure and streamlining the workforce. New technologies also facilitate the creation of new services and accessing new sources of revenue (Brynjolfsson & McAfee 2014). However banks often lack the necessary  knowledge  for  digital  innovation  while  fintechs  are  tapping  into  these  new opportunities.  Consequently due to differences in skills and knowledge (which have been identified as    in  gredients     for  alliances  (Hagedoorn  &  Schakenraad  1994))  banks  and  fintechs appear to be interesting alliance partners for each other. Prior to forming such alliances is some motivation to do so yet the specific motives for each side have not been studied to date  and  can  currently  only  be  inferred.  Due  to  high  regulation  very  specific  service offerings  and  the  novelty  of  digital  innovation  general  assumptions  and  findings regarding  joint  ventures  (Glaister  1996)  or  classical  R&D  alliances  (Bai  &  O   Brien 2008)  are  not  applicable.  Our  research  explores  the  motivation  for  digitalinnovationbased bankfintech alliances.  Alliances in the Financial Services Industry  31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F. Holotiuk M. F. Klus T. S. Lohwasser & J. Moormann Motives to Form Alliances for Digital Innovation The Case of Banks and Fintechs 305 Methodology  3  We  collected  data  in  15  cases  based  on  identification  of  digital  innovations  emerging from alliances between banks and fintechs as well as industry reports on alliances within the finan cial services industry in Germany. We conducted 18 interviews to understand what motivates the individual partners of bankfintech alliances. Currently such alliances are  a  multilayered  phenomenon;  hence  we  took  an  explorative  case  study  approach (Eisenhardt 1989).  The  case  alliances  in  our  research  were  identified  by  analyzing  press  releases  and searching online for news sources and databases such as Crunchbase. Within each case the interviewees from the respective sides were selected according to set criteria First they had  to be actively involved in the alliance (in either its formation or managing the modus operandi). Second they had to be in touch with the alliance partner on a regular basis to substantiate their active par ticipation in the alliance. Third they had to hold a managerial position at the bank or a high position in the fintech (typically we interviewed founders). Lastly they had to have a profound understanding of the innovation developed within  or  the  innovation  that  initiated  the  alliance.  Additionally  we  identified  two independent consultants who were not involved in any alliance of our set but have been involved in bankfintech alliances before     either on the bank   s or the fintech   s side. In total  we  conducted  nine interviews  with banks seven with  fintechs and  two  with  the independent  consultants  (Table  1).  We  aimed  for  equal  representation  of  fintechs and banks while the consultants were used to triangulate the findings.      306 31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F.

This guaranteed  we  could  analyze  all  perspectives  and  assessments  expressed  by  the interviewees. All interviews were audiorecorded and transcribed for further analysis. The interviews  took place  in  Q3  and  Q4  of  2017.  Transcript  coding  was  performed  using MaxQDA v.12.2.  Data  analysis  started  with  descriptive  codes  based  on  motives  mentioned  by  the interviewees.  This  led  to  the  identification  of  266  coded  segments  across  the  18 interviews.  Here  our  focus  was  to     organize  and  make  sense  of  the  qualitative  data    (Basit 2003 p. 152) and understand how the motives were perceived and understood by the interviewees. Subsequently the mo tives were analyzed for duplicates and similar content.  We  assigned  categories  to  each  coded  segment  based  on  the  motivation encapsulated  in  the  segment  following  an  open  coding  ap  proach (Strauss & Corbin 2008).  This  process  was  highly  iterative  and  involved  studying  each  interview  31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F. Holotiuk M. F. Klus T. S. Lohwasser & J. Moormann Motives to Form Alliances for Digital Innovation The Case of Banks and Fintechs 307 Findings Motives of Banks   individually and in contrast to interviews from the other (bank or fintech) group. Each category  represents  one  motivation  of  either  banks  or  fintechs.  Finally  we  condensed similar  categories  (describing  similar  motives)  to  a  common  category.  This  nuanced analysis  of  the  motives  enabled  us  to  derive  nine  categories  of  motives  from  our interviews.   4  This section presents the five motives for banks and the four for fintechs and outlines a sys tematization thereof. The motives are backed by quotations from our interviewees (in italic with interviewee ID given in brackets).  4.1  (Rapid) Innovation In all nine cases analyzed banks were keen to partner with fintechs to speed up innovation processes that would otherwise consume too much time and financial and managerial re sources.  Since  this  applied  to  the  whole  sample  it  reveals  that  banks  are  not  only interested  in  advanced ideas but also value wellthoughtout turnkey solutions for their business. Our inter  viewees  stated  that  banks  could  innovate  by  themselves  but  have become    too large and too ponderous to promote internal change processes    (I12). The interviewees were aware that this is the result of old  traditional structures  and     the  IT implementation of an idea would take 10 times longer as these changes are tested more extensively until everything e.g. all regulatory requirements fits    (I13). Since regulators demand  the  implementation  or  alteration of various  processes  multiple  times  per  year companies outside banks are able to screen these new de mands and become    better and more efficient or safer in these topics    (I7). Thus from the viewpoint of banks fintechs are  specialists  who  mainly  focus  on  problems  that  impact  most  banks.  Furthermore implementation for fintechs is easy as they have a    smaller setup and are faster    (I16). Banks    only have to dock [the innovations] on [their] structure and then [they] can work with them    (I16).  Competitive Advantage As a second motivation in five of the nine cases banks were motivated to partner with fintechs  to  achieve  competitive  advantage  and  increase  customer  value.  Interestingly banks acknowl edged that fintechs might provide    something different better higher more advanced or [something that] just goes down well with a customer    (I11). As for instance  the  German  financial  services  industry  becomes  increasingly  competitive between  traditional  banks  every  bank   s  revenues  based  on  the  classic  interestbearing business  model  decreases.     Every  bank  searches  for  additional  potential  for  revenuecreation. We can perhaps also offer real added value to meet our customers    demands by using the data we have anyway    (I7). However fintechs usually offer their services to a variety  of  banks  which  diminishes  the  unique  selling  proposition  as  banks  prefer exclusive partnerships (I7).   308 31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F. Holotiuk M. F. Klus T. S. Lohwasser & J. Moormann Motives to Form Alliances for Digital Innovation The Case of Banks and Fintechs  Outsourcing Third banks try to avoid using  their own resources on new and risky innovations with unknown results and attempt to save costs as    smaller firms with only a few employees can simply pro duce considerably cheaper and achieve [   ] more attractive prices for the  market     (I11).  Banks  use  fintechs  to  reduce  their  own  workload  so  that  their employees can focus on core activities. Thus banks    do not need to tie [up] additional manpower as we  already  have  enough other  issues     (I7).  As  the  development  of new business areas uses up already scarce internal resources one bank interviewee mentioned that    we do not need to set up these inter nal resources anyway. We can acquire them [from] the market just as well    (I12) as    fintechs are  even  with  the  API  [Application Programming  Interface]  development  faster  and  better  than  when  we  would  use  our own internal resources we currently have in stock    (I12). Banks also consider the extent to which and for what purpose they outsource certain activities. Some  banks  consider outsourcing a huge part of their value chain such as digital payment services while others aim to establish a wholly new business field (I13). In banking services of fintechs often remain unrecognized for customers in the background as socalled    white labels    that are    easier and faster to implement [   ] and use [   ] than to build the whole system up by our  selves     (I14).  Further  these  partnerships  allow  banks  to     broadly  diversify  their R&D activi ties as there is a very active fintech scene    (I13). In  conclusion  banks  prefer  to  focus  on  their  core  activities  as  they  are     no[t  a]  techcompany nor an ITfirm. We are a bank   we are good [at] financial consulting we are good [at] ad dressing behavioral finance topics [   ] We are not good at writing computer programs    (I12).  Learning The banks    motivations to partner with fintechs not only relate to outsourcing of noncore ac tivities; it is also important to them to learn from the fintechs    way of thinking and to    break up and adjust existing processes which becomes harder the longer the process exists. It is of course easier for other companies which can start from scratch and build up a blueprint of how to newly arrange a whole process    (I7). Their    different approach causes  pinpricks  to  reconsider our traditional thinking    (I1). Thus fintechs are seen as sparring partners that allow    indepth discussions from a different point of view [   ] and start processes in our bank which we probably would never have seen nor pursued    (I11). Hence fintechs    use a very stringent approach in the processing of information    (I7) and provide an    impulse which is a very very exciting driver [   ] and always leads to crossfertilization    (I11).  Business Model Evolution As information about banks becomes increasingly ubiquitous and barriers to switching finan cial institutions fall banks fear the increasing speed of change (I11). They are also afraid that    fintechs [will advance] to a point of digital transformation where they are able  to  replace  current business models by providing  scalable digital and  intelligent solutions    (I13). Hence banks are    searching for new business    (I13) as they are feeling    very high pressure   on the one side high regulatory pressure and on the other side lowinterest margins    (I13). The in terviews stated that banks see opportunities within digital  31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F. Holotiuk M. F. Klus T. S. Lohwasser & J. Moormann Motives to Form Alliances for Digital Innovation The Case of Banks and Fintechs 309 Motives of Fintechs  financial services as an    extremely interesting and exciting business area but we know that our technical possibilities are by far not as advanced as the fintechs   . That   s why we entered this strategic partnership    (I2). These partnerships help to    identify and launch new business models and consider all the different possible approaches    (I13). However the interviewees mentioned that some banks do not fol low any clear strategy (I14). It can also be assumed that banks fear missing opportunities to establish sustainable business models for the future as    it is incredibly difficult to know what happens where and since we also want to follow a digital strategy everyone in the management is anxious to follow this opportunity    (I1). They also try to    convince the workforce to catch up speed and acknowledge the urgency for an organizational change   or even more   to truly achieve a  mindset  change     (I11).  Hence  banks  see  investments  in  fintechs  as  M&A  activities (I17).   4.2  Trust and Credibility Surprisingly the  motivations of the interviewed fintechs to partner  with banks are less diverse. Six out of seven respondents considered alliances as valuable assets for obtaining trust  and  credibility (I9). On the one hand gaining trust and credibility through alliances with established banks is central to attract end customers as    trust is very very important and  helps  the  inves  tors  to  gain  confidence  in  the  product     (I4).  Particularly  in  the    payment sector the brand or better said the trust is very very important   especially in Germany    (I3). On the other hand fintechs wish to partner with more banks and get access to their customer base. Since failures in alliances with fintechs might harm banks    reputations  banks  become  cautious  as  they     are  always  a  bit  afraid  of  how  long  the fintech will still exist or if the processes are [as] reliable as they are in old traditional institutions    (I3). To overcome this burden fintechs wish to win partners for their product or service  in order  to establish a     trust  element     (I3) and  run a     flag  ship  project  to overcome reputational risk issues    (I3). Furthermore they use feedback dis cussions to ask the banks to    assess out of their own experience how the acceptance of the product or service among customers will be    (I9). Thus fintechs use banks for    entrance to the market    (I9).  Resources and Synergies Four out of seven fintechs mentioned that they see their partner as a    customer that also has the financial endowment to break new ground which in turn helps us    (I3). Fintechs further benefit from the higher marketing budgets of banks and from other synergies in marketing (I3). Besides a productrelated partnership    there are banks which also invest in startups    which means that in some partnerships the bank only wants to get to know [the fintech] and vice versa to investigate [whether] the partnership might be expanded to an investment    (IPW3). As soon as fintechs provide services where there is any type of payment involved they need deep knowledge as well as assets to ensure proper handling alongside a license to con form to regulations (I4 I8). As these requirements can be a financial burden for fintechs or sometimes    impossible    according to European policies (I3) three out of eight fintechs men tioned sharing costs of conforming to regulation as  310 31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F. Holotiuk M. F. Klus T. S. Lohwasser & J. Moormann Motives to Form Alliances for Digital Innovation The Case of Banks and Fintechs Systematization of the Motives  an alliance motivation. However alongside superior financial endowment fintechs often wish to access banks    data and infrastructure to apply and test their product or service in realistic cases (I8).  Customer Acquisition As  incumbent  banks  can  provide  large  customer  bases  which  might  be  an  even  more interest  ing  asset  for  fintechs  than financial  support  three  interviewees  from fintechs described    higher prominence [   ] which means more customers and transactions    (I3) as a key motivation for alliances as a database of    around one million existing customers is incredibly tempting    (I18).  Learning Two  fintechs  mentioned  intending  to  acquire  knowledge  about  the  market  and  the industry (I3) as banks    already have a long tradition    (I8). Alongside learning how banks think  in  terms  of  partnership  and  investment  fintechs  want  to     understand  more  and more  how  the  customer  thinks  and  how  industry  structures  work     (I3)  or  how  banks provide    services for independent financial service providers    (I8).   4.3  Most motives within the bank and fintech group are unique and distinct with only one overlap between both groups. However the picture becomes more complex when looking at the sides    different motives. Figure 1 compares the motives of banks and fintechs. The circles  represent  the  motives  while  their  size  indicates  comparatively  how  frequently they were mentioned. The horizontal categories show whether the motives can be seen as matching complementary or neutral. This categorization reflects the manifestation of the motives    relationships in our cases.  Firstly neutral motives are predominantly beneficial to only one side of an alliance. To im prove their own competitive advantage some banks use fintechs for innovative (often also highly customized) application programming or specialized tasks. Other banks use alliances  with  fintechs  as  an  opportunity  to  evolve  their  own  business  model.  Some fintechs pursue the formation of an alliance primarily to promote their products based on the banks    trust and cred ibility.  Secondly  complementary  motives  are  considered  as  beneficial  for  both  sides  of  an alliance  and  supportive  for  furthering  digital  innovation.  For  example  the  motive  of banks to rapid innovation through fintechs can well harmonize with providing them with needed resources (e.g. banking licenses). Banks aim to outsource certain activities such as  developing  digital  standard  applications  (e.g.  peertopeer  money  transfer  apps) implementation of new regula  tory rules  and servicing niche  customer  groups.  These activities  can  be  covered  by  fintechs  and at the same time fintechs can acquire more customers for themselves with the bank   s help. This may lead to    coopetition    as banks and fintechs cooperate and compete simultaneously (Bengtsson & Kock 2000).  31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F. Holotiuk M. F. Klus T. S. Lohwasser & J. Moormann Motives to Form Alliances for Digital Innovation The Case of Banks and Fintechs 311  Lastly matching motives are identical among the alliance partners and offer a good fit to form new alliances. Learning can improve both partner   s positioning through making up for certain shortcomings such as missing knowledge about digital technologies on the banks    side or missing knowledge on regulatory and legal specifications on the fintechs    side. However learning requires time and trust to create deep business knowledge (I3).   Figure 1 Overview of the motives to form alliances   Discussion and Concluding Remarks 5  As the financial services industry is considered relatively conservative and alliances with start ups are a relatively new phenomenon in this field the topic of bank   fintech alliances is highly relevant for both practice and academic research. Recent studies have examined fintechs  as  such  (Puschmann  2017)  and  the  emergence  of  a  global  fintech  market (Haddad & Hornuf 2016); however the motivations of banks and fintechs to partner has not been analyzed in depth. Building on the literature of fintechs digital innovation and alliancepartner selection this paper identifies several motives of partners to form bankfintech alliances.  The results show a variety of motives which are often heterogeneous both within the two groups and across the comparison. The clustering proposed in Figure 1 is a first approach to systemizing motivation in this field. The categories within the framework are based on the frequency with which similar motives were mentioned which we take to indicate their rele vance.  The findings show that banks tend to pursue rapid innovation and competitive advantage while fintechs seek to benefit from the banks    reputation and expand their customer base. Trust seems to be key for fintechs as finance is a sensitive issue for customers who do  312 31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F. Holotiuk M. F. Klus T. S. Lohwasser & J. Moormann Motives to Form Alliances for Digital Innovation The Case of Banks and Fintechs  not  want  to  entrust  their  money  to  unknown  providers  and  regulatory  authorities. However trust also plays a role for banks as potential partners. Thus established banks have  to  protect  their  own  reputation  which  could  be  damaged  by  alliance  partners    misconduct.  The  heterogeneity  of  motives  is  not  necessarily  negative  as  the  motives  are  not contradictory in all cases and thus not mutually exclusive. For example banks    strategic motivation  to  be  come  more  digital  aligns  with  fintechs     motivation  to  expand  their customer base. For example  the  alliance  partner   s  expanded  customer  base  increases visibility of the bank   s new orienta tion yielding a common benefit.  A  comparison  of  the  motives  shows  that  only  learning  applies  to  both.  Fintechs  are especially interested in building functioning and stable companies while banks want to learn more about the dynamics and agility of fintechs. Organizational learning or more precisely interorgani zational learning is an oftendiscussed topic in both academia and practice  which  is  also  rel  evant  for  bankfintech  alliances.  Banks  can  either  develop innovative products themselves or outsource to fintechs for more rapid outcomes; if they want  to  become  more  innovative  them  selves  fintechs  can  serve  as  a  companion throughout the learning process. Theoretically banks can then develop    fintech products    inhouse and no longer depend on alliances. Fintechs could also benefit from temporary alliances by developing stable organizational structures expand ing their customer base and building their reputation. They may also be able to eventually break away from the partnership to establish themselves as competitors.  However if banks do not strive for learning but rather want to save costs and resources through  outsourcing their  partners. Consequently fintechs    bargaining power may increase over time and the conditions for further collaboration could be renegotiated. Our findings show that banks value achieving competitive advantage slightly more than learning. This poses a question regarding the actual design of the alliances and the associated objectives of banks and fintechs.  Knight (2000) states that trust teamwork and commitment are prerequisites for learning in interorganizational relationships. Corresponding factors require time and interfaces in daily collaboration. Furthermore Sobrero and Roberts (2001 p. 493) identify    the type of problem solving activities being partitioned and their level of interdependency with the rest of the pro ject    as relevant regarding performance outcomes of a partnership. This stimulates a tradeoff between a shortterm efficiency increase and a longterm learning process (Sobrero & Roberts 2001). If a wellfunctioning learning process is of interest which  seems  to  be  the  case  for  both  banks  and  fintechs  a  customerserviceprovider relationship which is limited to sharing the fintech product is insufficient. A closer form of alliance with tight collaboration efficient knowledge management wellcoordinated interfaces  and  appropriate  organization  is  also  re  quired.  Since  knowledge  is  a fundamental resource for gaining competitive advantage (Cegarra   Navarro 2005) and learning promotes process and product coinnovation (Westerlund & Rajala 2010) we suggest that future research investigate interorganizational learning in the context of bankincreasingly  dependent  on they  become  31ST BLED ECONFERENCE DIGITAL TRANSFORMATION MEETING THE CHALLENGES JUNE 17  20 2018 BLED SLOVENIA CONFERENCE PROCEEDINGS F.

In  this  setting  special  attention  should  be  paid  to  existing  forms  of interaction to identify opportunities for interorganizational learning.  This paper focuses on the motivation to partner but not the design of the alliance itself. Our study is also limited by the small number of companies interviewed which restricts the validity of the results. Additionally only the German market was considered; thus larger  studies  are  necessary  to  confirm  the  robustness  of  the  results.  Furthermore  the assessment  of  whether  certain motives are contradictory or complementary depends on context making general state ments difficult.  Despite  these  limitations  the  study  outlines  an  approach  to  systematizing  the  various motives for bankfintech alliances. We believe that our results are generalizable due to no country  specific  arguments  in  our  reasoning  and  transferable  to  other  contexts  (e.g. countries or mar kets with similar characteristics). Still this should be tested by further research.  In  addition  to  the  abovementioned  implications  for  future  research  practical implications include the sug gestion that both banks and fintechs clearly identify their respective motivations before form ing alliances. Their own motives should be compared with those of the potential partner to identify synergies as well as potential conflicts of interest at an early stage.   References  Bai  Y.  &  O   Brien  G.
