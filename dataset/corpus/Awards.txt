While supply chains typically refer tothe connected thread of suppliers andwholesalers that create a company   sproducts and services and the distributorsagents and retailers that sell them thisconcept has arguably become outdated asnetworks of commercial counterpartieshave extended and become more complexand intertwined. Instead the concept ofthe    ecosystem    better reflects thecomplexity and mutual dependencies thatexist from individuals and small familyproducers through to the world   s largestmultinationals.

(cid0)The end of innovation? Not so!Commentators have been predicting a decline in innovation in the treasury and bankingsector in recent years as organisations direct their investment dollars towardsregulatory compliance and tackling and preempting security vulnerabilities andthreats. This year   s awards demonstrate that innovation is taking place alongside theseessential investments with a clear focus on enhancing the customer experience. Manypeople ask at this time of year how their organisation can win a TMI award. So here areour handy tips1.  You need to enter or clients need to nominate you. This may sound obvious butevery year we receive calls from banks or suppliers asking why they haven   t receivedan award in a category that they have not entered.2.  Produce a concise submission that outlines specifically why your organisation shouldbe considered for a particular award     bullet points are fine. This can refer to casestudies and editorial elsewhere in the publication but you cannot assume thatjudges will have time to trawl through everything you   ve produced to construct apicture of your organisation   s strengths in the award category.3.  Encourage clients to nominate you or provide case studies or testimonials you canlink to your entry. This was a characteristic of many of this year   s award winners ofwhich Commerzbank is a particular case in point not only did the bank provide avery strong clear submission but clients in all regions submitted very short butpowerful nominations.4.  Be selective. It   s better to enter for award categories in which you have a compellingvalue proposition rather than every category.With thanks for the very many entrants to this year   s awards and congratulations to ourwinners.TMI  |  ISSUE 249                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       31 '
