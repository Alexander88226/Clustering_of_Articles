The  emergence  of  influencer  marketing  has  coincided  with technology triggering the development of social media marketing. Influencer marketing focuses on using influential people to target a market rather than directly focusing on the target market. The idea is to identify people that are able to influence buyers through social media (based on the number of followers they have and their activities on social media) orient them to your products and develop marketing activities around those influencers. In the MENA (Middle East and North Africa  region)  influencer  marketing  has  not  yet  been  fully  embraced.  Most  companies  or organizations are still using more conventional methods of marketing.   Different managers and business leaders in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s were asked about their opinion and use of  influencer  marketing  in  this  dissertation.  They  have  diverse  opinions  regarding  the  use  of influencer marketing in their organizations. Given the changing consumer trends it is important to note that acknowledge that social media are likely to be an effective mode of marketing. This is especially due to the fact that the internet has penetrated in nearly every part of the world and most people have access to social media sites. In other words it is possible to reach a lot of people through  the  various  sites.  The  present  research  was  aimed  at  finding  out  the  effectiveness  of influencer  marketing  as  an  innovative  tool  to  increase  customer  acquisition  for  SMEs  by companies  in  MENA.  Seven  Marketing  employees  of  five  SMEs  in  the  MENA  region  were interviewed. A qualitative method of data collecting was used in the study.  It was found out that despite the fact that influencer marketing is to be fully embraced in MENA  a  good  number  (5)  of  our  interviewees  believe  it  can  effectively  be  used  to  increase customer acquisition. However about 2 of the interviewees either do not believe in influencer marketing or are not sure of its effectiveness. In general an indirect effect on sales is believed to exist when influencer marketing is used by our respondents. Influencer marketing is seen as a complementary  marketing  tool  which  should  fit  a  complete  marketing  and  communication strategy and be used in a targeted way. Influencer marketing moreover faces a number of barriers such as finding the right credible influencers and managing the process as an SME.  Use of multiple    P a g e |  VIII  \\x0csocial media platforms is one way of improving the effectiveness. Help by agencies could be also be a solution to better select influencers but this might be much too expensive for SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.        This thesis was too limited to draw more conclusions on the type of influencer best suited to make  influencer  marketing  more  effective  in  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  and  to  depict  how  its  results  could quantitatively be measured in dollar volume and return on investment and whether it is as expected a cheaper way of communicating with the target audience.                      P a g e |  IX  \\x0c      P a g e |  X  \\x0cChapter One Introduction  1. Introduction          Since  the  emergence  of  the  worldwide  web  and  the  evergrowing  popularity  of  social networking sites marketing strategies have been transformed drastically. The number of digital consumers who encounter hundreds of commercial stimuli every day has increased dramatically. Thus brands face the challenge to stand out much more than before.  With millions of active internet and social network users the advertising industry has been compelled to realign brand awareness strategies with digital platforms to ensure economic success. One such strategy is influencer marketing.  This practice has been around for a long time but the process has evolved with the advancement of digital technology. Influencer marketing has fast become one of the most popular and effective marketing methods of reaching more consumers. Prior to the existence of an online world influencer marketing was only aimed at target market customers  who  were  influenced  by  people  considered  to  be  offline  opinion  leaders  such  as journalists  and film  stars.  Currently  this  practice focuses  on  online  opinion  leaders. These  are individuals on social media sites with large volumes of followers. Influencer marketing has become one of the trendiest and most efficient ways to reach more customers and targeted communities.  Big brands use influencers to reach new customers to achieve  higher  brand  awareness  through  various  innovative  tools  and  techniques.  Influencer marketing plays a positive role in customer acquisition for SMEs.  The purpose of this study is to investigate the impact of influencer marketing on customer acquisition in SMEs. Influencer marketing is indeed not confined to usage by large corporations. SMEs may also use this approach to improve business relations and increase profits in a highlycompetitive environment and they might benefit more because the technique is relatively cheap compared to the previously used opinion leader marketing. 1.1.Background   Biadet (2017 11) defined influence as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe power to significantly affect an individual thing or a course of events\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Influencer marketing uses this \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinfluence\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on a platform of social    P a g e |  1  \\x0cmedia. Halim et al (2017 184) described social media as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca global advanced marketing platform\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpopular  choice  for  modern  business  promotion\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Hajli  (2014)  describes  social  media influence as social interaction via social networking sites online communities and effective Web 2.0 technologies for information and knowledge sharing in a social context. Chae (2017 246) defined social media influencers as \\xe2\\x80\\x9conline celebrities who exhibit aspects of their personal lives to followers using social media\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Freberg et al. (2010) describe a social media influencer as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca new form of independent thirdparty endorsement in which the individual shapes the attitudes of the audience with tweets blogs and other social media implementations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.    Ranga & Sharma (2014 16) define social media influencer marketing as a modern form of marketing \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhich centers upon key individuals or types of key individuals as opposed to a focus upon the target market in its entirety\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Dahnil et al (2014) found that social media marketing tools create new opportunities for SMEs and also drive positive changes in the nature and shape of the business through a global platform. The social media influencer represents the subliminal message that the consumer must subscribe to particular products and services in order to achieve a lifestyle that is comparative to that of the influencer (Chae 2017; Li et al 2013). The persuasive power of the social media influencer is so intense that web technologies have been published to identify and track social media influencers who are relevant to a particular brand based upon daily blog hits posts and the number of followers (Freberg et al 2011).    The objective of social media marketing strategies is to create and cultivate business and consumer relationships. Biadet (2017 11) defined influencer marketing as \\xe2\\x80\\x9can important approach to  new  age  marketing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  that  is  used  as  a  guide  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cby  professionals  at  the  edge  of  significant purchasing decisions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Finally Ranga & Sharma (2014) argue that influencer marketing schemes must identify the individual with the most influence over the prospective buyer and build the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marketing activity around the individual.  1.2. Significance of the study   Social media influencers are becoming a strong players in marketing. The major reason is that companies have to care about their online reputation if they want to attract and keep consumers    P a g e |  2  \\x0cand  build  a  longterm  relationship  with  them.  Marketing  through  hiring  these  influencers  is helping companies in persuading consumers to purchase their products and/or services.  The purpose of this study is to determine whether influencer marketing really has a positive impact on customer acquisition and the attraction of new customers specifically for SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s.  This leads to the following research questions. The main research question is   Do influencermarketing strategies have a positive effect on customer acquisition in SMEs? In order to find the right ideas to answer this question have addressed the following three sub questions      Why do SMEs choose social media influencers instead of other marketing tools?    Which position does influencer marketing take in the overall marketing strategy of SMEs?   What are the challenges associated with influencer marketing strategies in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s?                 P a g e |  3  \\x0c  \\x0cChapter Two Literature Review  2.  Introduction  This chapter will provide a literature review of influencer marketing. To fully understand the  broad  construct  of  influencer  marketing  and its  benefits I  will  discuss  its  importance  the various definitions associated with this approach the different types of influencer marketing and the value using influencer marketing proposes to companies. Then I will indicate some challenges of using this as an innovative tool in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Finally I will discuss the potential for increased customer acquisition through influencer marketing and highlight the importance of social media influencers with respect to SMEs. 2.1 The importance of influencer marketing in content marketing perspective  An increasing population of consumers is now relying on online reviews before buying a product or a service. This increasing trend compels brand managers to use social media platforms to  promote  their  products  and  interact  with  their  audience  either  directly  or  through  popular influencers on social media. These influencers are very useful because of their popularity and ability to quickly make an online brand message viral (Edwards 2015).   Today it is common to find companies using social media marketing as their marketing strategy. One of the ways to communicate online and have a big impact on potential customers is through audiovideo messaging by influencers on social media. A consistent and integrated content marketing strategy is beneficial to the development of a strong relationship between a brand or company and its targeted audience.  Content marketing is often defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca marketing strategy where brands create interest relevance  and  relationships  with  customers  by  producing  curating  and  sharing  content  that addresses specific customer needs and delivers visible value\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Gerard 2015).  Content creation on various social media platforms enables brands to promote visibility audience interaction and brand reputation.  Content creators are the promotors of brand advocacy messages as they guide their audience to develop opinions about these brands. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCompanies that use the services of influential reviewers  get  access  to  instant  feedback  and  recommendations  from  their  audience  (Trimble 2014)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and develop the most vital and effective form of content marketing.    P a g e |  5  \\x0c 2.2. Influencer marketing and wordofmouth  Influencer marketing is a further development of what marketing theory calls wordofmouth communication.  Word of mouth has always been a powerful marketing tool as it is both inexpensive and yields great results. It is a phenomenon that stands in a league of its own when comparing marketing techniques (Ranga & Sharma 2014 p. 16).  This is because we tend to trust the recommendations of those closest to us and are more likely to act on these recommendations. Many people would rather trust the experiences of friends or family members than advertising (MarketingSchools.org 2017).    Influencer  marketing  in  turn  involves  marketing  products  and  services  using  the recommendation of people who have a sway over other people\\xe2\\x80\\x99s opinions. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTheir market influence typically comes from their popularity reputation or expertise. It is similar to recommendations made by friends and peers through word of mouth marketing (MarketingSchools.org 2017)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Strong companies tend to hire agencies with influencers who have a good reputation to promote their own products to reach their markets. \\xe2\\x80\\x9cThese influencers originate in various places and forms and  could  be  an  influential  group  person  celebrity  brand  or  place  (Marketingschools.org 2017)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Ultimately an influencer is a good persuader and can encourage others to make a purchase which is precisely what an organization wants to accomplish.   However in the era of digital technology this has changed drastically.  According to Ranga and Sharma (2014 p. 16) communication between consumers has shifted from taking place in person between close friends and peers to digital platforms that reach a much larger audience.  Hence  the  importance  of  using  influencers  on  these  platforms  in  marketing  communication strategies. Influencer marketing strategies have thus become an integral and prominent marketing tool for many businesses. The strategy has become a vital element of many marketing campaigns today. Influencers are not always called as such. They are also referred to as social media opinion leaders mavens or sometimes even hubs (Watts and Dodds 2007). We will stick in our dissertation to \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinfluencers\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Brown and Hayes state that "an \\xe2\\x80\\x98influencer\\xe2\\x80\\x99 can be defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca third party who    P a g e |  6  \\x0csignificantly  shapes  the  customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  purchasing  decision  but  may  never  be  accountable  for  it\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (2008 p. 37). An influencer can thus be understood as an individual who has the ability and power to guide the buying choices of other customers and the public at large due to their position expert knowledge or status. According to Biaudet (2017 p. 12) influencer marketing can be defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9ca marketing form that identifies and targets individuals with influence over potential buyers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  However Isosuo (2016 p. 13) stated that influence goes beyond having a lot of social media followers. Rather it is about the relationship which exists between the influencer his/her expert knowledge and his/her followers which allows this marketing tool to be a successful one. Thus a broader characterisation is needed. Goldenberg et al. (2011 p.2) indicate that influential people are thought to have three important traits (1) they are convincing (maybe even charismatic); (2) they know a lot (i.e. are experts) and (3) they have large number of social ties which means that they know a lot of people. 2.3. Influencer marketing communication tools  Influencer marketing uses a variety of communication tools such as blog and vlog posts pictures and videos posted on social media sites. (Safko & Brake 2009 p. 11). An influencer marketer mostly acts as a brand ambassador. Brown and Fiorella (2013 p. 37) highlighted that the term \\xe2\\x80\\x98influencer\\xe2\\x80\\x99 can often be confused with the term \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadvocate\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  However they are not the same. Influencers are usually noncustomers who are paid to recommend a product while advocates are customers who have a strong liking for a product and recommend it voluntarily.  Influencer marketing uses a variety of communication tools such as blog posts pictures and videos posted on social media sites. (Safko & Brake 2009 p. 11). There are as many different tools  as  there  are  social  media  platforms  that  can  be  used  to  promote  products  and  services. Instagram is one such platform where some members are regarded as influencers because they have a substantial number of followers. Because they are considered to be likeable or popular such individuals may be seen to be influential (De Veirman Cauberghe and Hudders 2017 p.  798).  Instagram  allows  users  to  post  photos  video  recordings  and  live  videos  as  well  as  to communicate with other users through comments on posts and private messages. Facebook as well has  rolled  out  new  controls  and  capabilities  to  help  marketers  handle  influencer  marketing campaigns (Kirkpatrick 2017). An increasing numbers of PR and marketing professionals also favor YouTube as a channel for their campaigns using social media influencers (James 2016).     P a g e |  7  \\x0cAll these tools can be considered as innovative. Yet innovative is an elusive word. What do  we  understand  by  it?  Innovation  has  always  been  an  important  research  in  a  number  of disciplines  and  this  is  equally  applicable  to  strategies  encompassing  influencer  marketing. According  to  O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Sullivan  and  Dooley  (2008  p.  4)  the  term  is  unfortunately  only  poorly understood. For this study innovation is defined as \\xe2\\x80\\x9can idea or a process which results in a new product or service which consumers will purchase\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. To be called an innovation "an idea must be replicable at an economical cost and must satisfy a specific need\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (BusinessDictionary.com 2017).  As Hana (2013 p. 83) describes innovation also means that new and creative ideas can be applied to existing products or processes to develop other products or services frequently inspired by new technology. Since the tools used by influencer marketers offer the possibility to target audiences in  a  relatively  personal  way  at  an  economical  cost  and  for  specific  needs  they  do  have most characteristics of being considered as innovative according to the Business Directory definition of innovative. Marketing has always been one of the fields able to harness and leverage new technologies in an innovative manner. This advantage has also come in the form of digital technologies and software  through  which  marketers  have  engaged  in  effective  strategies  to  reach  their  target markets.  As  confirmed  by  Hana  (2013)  innovation  and  technology  are  typically  linked  and marketers who are experts in the field of digital marketing create new strategies to enhance brands. Marketing strategies often incorporate technologically based virtual reality platforms to extend the reach and influence of their advertising initiatives. Influencer marketing is one of the forms this has taken.   2.4 Types of influencers Within the marketing world an \\xe2\\x80\\x98influencer\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is a broad term encompassing different groups of marketing influencers based on both the role they play and the amount of people they can reach and their power of influence.  Neha (2015 p. 1617) distinguishes between \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinnovator\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfollower\\xe2\\x80\\x9d influencers. The former group of influencers mainly influences the speed of the adoption in a network while the latter group influences mainly the number of people that eventually adopt the innovation. The reason for the difference is consistent with the idea that innovative influencers adopt sooner and    P a g e |  8  \\x0cturn on the adoption process as classical product life cycle theory indicates. If they would adopt products and services later the entire process would be slower. However \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinnovators\\xe2\\x80\\x9d are not trusted by the majority of followers so they have less influence on the market size. Follower influencers however are more reliable to the group of influenced followers and their adoption can influence people to consider adoption as well. Hence they have a small influence on the speed of growth but a strong one on the market size. The distinction is however quite difficult to measure so we will not refer to it any more. According to Ummenhofer (2014 p. 19) there are five main types of marketing influencers based on the amount of people they can influence. These are macroand microinfluencers bad influencers onlineinfluencers and topical influencers. We explain each of these types underneath.  Macroinfluencers and microinfluencers. Macro influencers are widely recognized and are able to draw brand awareness quickly as they have the largest following (Ummenhofer 2014 p. 19). An example of a macroinfluencer would be a celebrity. Due to their large fan base macroinfluencers are considered trendsetters as they are able to reach a wide audience in a short space of time. However according to Haapasalmi (2017  p.  16)  macroinfluencers  are  often  only  successful  in  influencing  many  individuals  in impulse purchases as they lack a real personal connection with all their followers. In contrast to this microinfluencers have a significantly lower number of followers. They however maintain the same manner of communication as macroinfluencers (Kohler 2017 p. 9). Microinfluencers  have  a  much  narrower  focus  on  topics  and  interests  and  therefore  attract followers  with  the  similar  interests  thereby  influencing  them  often  more  deeply  than  macroinfluencers and creating a real brand audience (Ummenhofer 2014 p. 19).   Both  macro  and  micro  influencers  play  a  significant  role  in  influencer  marketing  and cannot be perceived or researched into as separate entities.          P a g e |  9  \\x0cOnline influencers. Since the emergence of social media the perception of influencers has changed. Given the numerous social media platforms which exist today anyone can become an influential figure with a large enough following. There are various types of online influencers. Ummenhofer (2014 p. 22) highlights the most common categories of online influencers. These are networkers opinion leaders trendsetters reporters and customers.  Networkers are individuals whose primary concern is to connect with as many different people as possible through any channel available. Networkers do not limit themselves to a specific topic of interest but rather cover several categories to appeal to a wider audience (Lacanska 2016 p. 24). Opinion leaders are contrary to networker\\xe2\\x80\\x99s real specialists in their field of interest. These influencers have large amounts of followers but are constantly in demand making it difficult for companies to recruit them (Lacanska 2016 p. 24). The third type of online influencers are trendsetters. According to Ummenhofer (2014 p.  22) these are influencers who are always eager to try new tools to attract more followers with the most  prominent  and  popular  social  media  channels  being  blogs  Instagram  and  YouTube (Lucanska 2016 p. 11). Reporters are bloggers who specialize in certain fields. Many of them write their blog for earning a living. Kotler and Armstrong (2012 p. 511) state that blogs are \\xe2\\x80\\x9conline journals where people post their thoughts usually on a narrowly defined topic.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Their articles provide a source of information to other influencers and followers alike and have gained massive following. The last type of online influencers are the customers. Whilst this type of influencer doesn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t hold much value to companies they are considered microinfluencers as they still hold the trust of their circle of friends and peers (Kohler 2017 p. 9).   Topicalinfluencers.   Topicalinfluencers refer to individuals who have large followings in social media based on their credibility in a specific field of interest or the position they hold within that industry (Ummenhofer 2014 p. 23). According to Gillian (2009 p. 5) these influencers play an integral    P a g e |  10  \\x0crole  as  their  impact  can  determine  the  success  or  failure  of  a  brand.  Topicalinfluencers  are considered thought leaders within their area of expertise. Customers today prefer to read authentic information  from  writers  who  are  experts  in  their  chosen  fields  rather  than  reading  \\xe2\\x80\\x98normal\\xe2\\x80\\x99 information on websites (Gillian 2009 p. 5).   Bad influencers. Companies reach out to influencers to draw positive attention to their product or service to increase sales. However influencers can draw negative attention to the product as well and in some instances the company is not even aware of this. According to Haapasalmi (2017 p. 15) this can be seen in instances where influencers have a bad experience with a product or service and then share this negative experience with their followers.  This  research  study  will  focus  on  onlineinfluencer  marketing  and  focus  on  the  third category of influencers indicated by Ummenhofer. According to Haapasalmi (2017 p. 8) online influencers provide remarkable added value to companies as they reach a wider target audience in an effective way. Online influencers can reach their followers in a personal and meaningful way as they humanize and personalize the brand to their followers (Isosuo 2016 p. 23). Influencer marketers provide consumers with insight into their private life creating a unique \\xe2\\x80\\x98behind the scenes\\xe2\\x80\\x99 experience which enhances the relationship with consumers (Biaudet 2017 p. 17). Gillin and Schwartzman (2011 p. 28) have explained the position of influencers because they publish content about products to be observed by the target audience and further highlighted the distinctive manner in which influencers can express this in a trustworthy manner. The major element is that although influencers are also paid they are not seen to touch this money in the same way people know that celebrity endorsements are paid for. Thus they are considered as being more genuine and authentic in their recommendations.  2.5 Challenges of influencer marketing in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s   There are significant differences between the marketing practices of large organizations and small firms (Hill 2001 p. 174; Reijonen 2010 p. 279). Marketing often takes a back seat as sales are the primary focus of SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Stokes (2000 p. 48) argued that in small firms little attention is paid    P a g e |  11  \\x0cto marketing strategies and longterm plans. Although marketing has become a prevalent issue for most small businesses there is often a lack of funds to employ a fulltime marketer to carry out marketing  related  activities.    Thus  a  number  of  challenges  exist  in  small  and  mediumsized enterprises  for  influencer  marketing.  They  include  difficulties  in  understanding  the  power  of influencer marketing lack of time to execute the strategy lack of funds for covering the cost of influencer marketers and not knowing how to work with influencers (Stokes 2000 p. 48).   Influencer Marketing and customer acquisition  2.6 2.6.1. Customer acquisition   According to Filip and Voinea (2012 p. 62) customer acquisition can be defined as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe  sales  and  marketing  process  of  obtaining  new  customers  and  includes  the  process  of converting  existing  prospects  into  new  customers.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d   The  modernday  business  environment  is categorized by extreme competition irrespective of the industry. As a result businesses are forced to  continuously  work  towards  attracting  new  customers  as  customer  migration  is  inevitable (Novikov 2016 p. 14). Customer migration occurs for various reasons and therefore customer acquisition becomes a continuous process.  Customer acquisition is important as it is the fastest way to grow a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s client base and reach shortterm income goals (Filip & Voinea 2012 p. 63).               P a g e |  12  \\x0cIt is very important for companies to acknowledge the process of acquiring high base of customers.  Scholars  defined  four  main  steps for customer  acquisition  adding  to  each  step  the proper practices. The figure below illustrates these steps   Figure 1 Key Steps for Customer Acquisition  1. Bringing people to the company website (Creating Traffic)    Many companies have a lot of potential customers that are not aware in the products or services they offer. These potential customers have to be first found and then contacted. Actual customers are very often the contact point by which companies are made aware of who those potentials are. When the data about potential customers are transferred to the company marketers call them \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleads\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  So in this stage it is the first time that leads hear about the company or get in contact with it.  This would make it the perfect place to raise their awareness and education about topics that matter the most to them or their businesses. It is the ideal time for the company to start building trust by responding to the customers inquires.    P a g e |  13  \\x0cGreat  tools  to  drive  this  traffic  are  online  marketing  tools  such  as  SEO  paid advertisements social media Emails PR and many other ways. Online marketing is considered as a must nowadays for all industries.   2. Persuade them to signup register and download (Conversion)   At this stage leads have come into contact with the company through one or more of the online marketing tools. The message has picked the customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interest and made a great first impression. The best way to take advantage of those increased attention spans is to get them to start asking themselves whether they\\xe2\\x80\\x99re interested in what you have to offer. At this point they\\xe2\\x80\\x99ll want to find out everything about your company and what you have to offer. An effective way would be taking advantage of their attention span so the customer can decide whether they are interested in what a company offers. The best usage of landing pages followup services homepage design social media content lead capture to engage them even further which can help them to realize the value proposition from buying the company product or service (GMIT 2015). 3. Persuade them to buy services (Purchase) Creating commitment from customers to make a purchase is often the most critical stage for any company. The way of convincing customers to buy the company products requires indeed a lot of work and trust. In fact this step needs to provide more information that reassures customers to choose the company product among competitors. (GMIT 2015) More specification such as process defining demonstrating value increasing usefulness clarifying the ease of use and guidance is allimportant and should be took into account.     P a g e |  14  \\x0c4. Convincing customers to renew each year (Retention) Customer retention programs is one of the challenges that many companies deal with the benefits that superior customer retention can offer a company. Increased growth profits etc. A wellknown saying in the business industry is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cKeeping a current customer is much easier (and cheaper) than attracting new ones.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d So the overall cost of acquiring customers exceeds by several times the cost of serving existing customers. Therefore the longer an SME can retain existing customers the more cost friendly this is for the company. A variety of strategies is available to business owners seeking to improve their customer retention rates. It can be achieved through regular reminders of the product value proposition defining the renewal process contacting them and many other tools according to (GMIT 2015)   There is more than one way to approach customer acquisition however. Since different ways can lead to the same place choosing the right tool might depend on the audience or on the customer acquisition funnel. In this thesis we will spot the light on influencer marketing as an innovative tool to increase customer acquisition.    2.6.2. Influencer marketing and customer acquisition in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s status   Previous research points out that influencer marketing is a technique mainly employed by big brands with large budgets (Brown & Hayes 2008 p. 37; Gillian 2009 p. 89; Klaassen 2016 p. 7).  Small and mediumsized enterprises do not have the resources to adopt such techniques.  An adequate  supply  of  resources  allows  the  firm  to  compete  with  other  firms.  Limited  access  to resources  is  a  primary  issue  faced  by  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  when  attempting  to  increase  their  acquisition  of customers.    P a g e |  15  \\x0cAccording to Klaassen (2016 p. 8) microinfluencers (as indicated above) may be a viable solution  to  the  problem  of  customer  acquisition.  Microinfluencers  usually  have  a  smaller following and their interests are a lot more focused than macroinfluencers. Microinfluencers are thus a lot more affordable also to SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. This may be an important research finding for us as we want to provide empirical evidence of whether influencer marketing techniques can be employed by SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to enhance customer acquisition. When it comes to finding influencers for SMEs with limited budgets the business should moreover be selective in appointing an influencer who specializes in small business branding. This person may be a local sportsman or woman the local mayor or a local hero who can help to promote sales in a niche market because they are respected within a community. Approaching a small agency may prove beneficial in finding a micro influencer and appointing them to promote the SME. It  has  become  more  difficult  for  SMEs  to  attract  new  customers  because  of  constant changes in marketing channels but customers can be reached through various platforms such as social media word of mouth personal selling and intermediaries. According to Cox (2012 p. 7) social media enables companies to network with customers to build relationships and achieve a better understanding of their needs but most SMEs struggle to manage social media effectively to reach their markets. Having a marketing influencer could really help SMEs to grow their brands especially on social media. Leaver (p. 8 2017) states that bloggers and Vloggers (= video bloggers) gain followers through trust as these outlets have been seen to improve sales and increase brand awareness  which  can  lead  to  customer  acquisition.  Most  social  media  platforms  are  free  and influencers  are  often  paid  in free  products  and  services  which  makes  micro  influencers more accessible to small businesses which do not have large budgets. Once a relationship is cultivated with the right influencer customer acquisition is bound to follow for the SME. 2.6.3. Social media influencers and SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s    Sledzik  (2014)  presented  that  the  majority  of  SMEs  typically  invest  in  marketing strategies that have been researched implemented and proven; they are more open to local events (79%) emailing (72%) billboards (45%) and issuing coupons (83%) as marketing tools. A 2014 Brand muscle ( An agency that helps brands in empowering their local business partners with marketing automation software and platforms ) study on local marketing strategies showed that    P a g e |  16  \\x0c28% of the local firms do not own a company website; 57% do not use Twitter 37% do not use Facebook and 40% do not use online advertising or keyword searches. However the adoption rate for social media marketing strategies was high at 72% (Sledzik 2014).  Yet Klassen (2016) argues that the SME must attract new customers in order to realize sustainable growth.    However  resource  constraints  drive  SME  marketing  campaigns  towards  low  cost approaches. Leaver (2016) conjected that SME as a consequence of their budget restraints can use social  media  influencers  very  well  to  reach  out  to  millennials  as  an  alternative  to  expensive traditional marketing schemes. Becoming more involved in online communities can realize greater returns on investment and enable SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to reach out to relevant consumers with a more authentic approach to storytelling about their brand. Cant & Wild (2015) support that the marketing strategy as a business tool must reflect an alignment with the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s objectives budget organizational dynamic; and modes of collaboration and consequently also with its size.  Ranga & Sharma (2014) assert that the social media influencer may have a strong positive impact the  enterprise  performance  and returns  by  1)  writing  a  blog  or  article;  2)  information  sharing through personal social media accounts; 3) submit guest posts on the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s site; or a combination of the aforementioned strategies.  Dahnil et al (2014) examined the limitations for SMEs in the context  of  new  technology  and  social  media  marketing  adoptions  and  acceptance  as  credible ventures. The outcomes of their research indicated that SMEs use technology as competitive tools. Adoption of new technology is influenced by a number of factors including government regulation.   Benefits of influencer marketing  2.7  As stated above the rise of the internet technology and social media has changed the way in which wordofmouth works and has opened up a lot of potential. When used correctly social influencer  marketing  can  hold  a  lot  of  benefits  for  businesses.  According  to  Cox  (2012  p.  7) businesses want their messages to reach as many people as possible and social media presents many different opportunities to do so in effective ways. The fantastic thing is that when a social    P a g e |  17  \\x0cinfluencer is used effectively it can bring in a lot of money without the company having to spend anything on marketing (Hamilton 2017).   According to Hamilton there are five specific benefits of influencer marketing which are discussed below (Hamilton 2017)  1. Credibility \\xe2\\x80\\x93 With so many products out there consumers are hesitant to trust startups. If a startup is backed by the right person who is credible and trusted by the public the brand\\xe2\\x80\\x99s integrity can increase and people will be more likely to give the new business a try. 2. Awareness \\xe2\\x80\\x93 People who are used as social influencers like celebrities normally already have a wide audience. A company can therefore reach audiences it never would have been able to without being directly involved in the promotion of a product. 3. Recommendations \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Influencers are generally people who inspire others. Other people want to be like them and are thus likely to purchase the products that they use to make them who they are. 4. Cost  effective  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  Depending  on  how  popular  the  influencer  is  it  can  sometimes  be  very expensive  to  get  them  to  endorse  products.  However  it  is  still  more  cost  effective  than traditional forms of advertising. 5. Efficiency \\xe2\\x80\\x93 It is easier to measure return on investment on social media analytics and if the right company can partner with the right person and get their energy behind their brand influencers can be hugely successful.   2.8. Examples of popular social media influencers   Persuading the most popular celebrities to represent a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s brand is not necessarily a successful tool that guarantees success. . It is important to match the right person with the right company and to ensure that the person is passionate about and believes in the product or service. This is good for smaller companies as they can still use micro influencers such as a local blogger or a person with a particularly wide knowledge of a niche market (Hall 2017). This research is specialized in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interesting to use examples of big companies and their successful experiences with influencer marketing campaigns.    P a g e |  18  \\x0c  Some examples include \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Daniel Wellington \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This watch brand chose to use celebrities as well as lesserknown microinfluencers for its campaign. They would gift watches to these people and in exchange the influencers would post pictures of the watch on social media with #danielwellington. At the time of print the brand\\xe2\\x80\\x99s main account had over 3.2 million followers (Gilliland 2017) \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Lagavulin \\xe2\\x80\\x93 This scotch whisky brand decided to only use a single name to target their niche audience  Parks and Recreation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Nick Offerman. The company made a 45minute video of Nick sitting at a fire only moving occasionally and sipping whiskey. The aim of the video was to reposition the brand as appealing to a younger audience by using YouTube to reach a different demographic.  The  video  was  viewed  two  million  times  in  just  one  week  and  the  company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s YouTube channel subscription increased from 5500 thousand viewers to a full 23000 visitors (Gilliland 2017).   In  summary influencer  marketing  has  fast  become  one  of  the  trendiest  and  effective means of reaching a wider audience and acquiring new customers. Although influencer marketing is not a new concept the concept has evolved from previously using highly paid stars as opinion leaders to using people with a large following on social media who are often cheaper to be involved in marketing strategies and more trustworthy.  Different categories of influencers exist with their own characteristics. The value of influencer marketing is undoubted but it is difficult for SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to capture it in order to have a better customer acquisition as their budgets are small and they do not  always  understand  the  importance  and  working  of  the  different  social  media.  It  is  thus  a challenge for them to use influencer marketing effectively. We further discussed the value of and challenges associated with influencer marketing in general and for SMEs.            P a g e |  19  \\x0c  \\x0cChapter Three Methodology and data  3. Introduction   In this chapter I will first describe the type of research we want to execute and how this is best done and the ethics involved. This covers the question of the research methodology I have selected. Then I will explain our research design and research sample. The interview guideline and the relationship of the questions with the research questions will be treated in the next chapter.  3.1 Research methodology   In  this  study  w  want  to  use  case  study  research  and  the  methodology  employed  is qualitative in nature.  Yin (2015 3) has described qualitative research as a method of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cattendance to the contextual richness of realworld settings and how individuals perceive such settings under a  diversity  of  circumstances\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.    Yin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  (2015)  stepwise  framework  for  the  design  of  qualitative research has been followed meticulously. It entails an approach using interviews for the collection of fieldbased data  recording the data; analysis and interpretation of the collected nonnumerical data and analysis of data by numerical coding  As I still indicate in the section on research design  rather than collecting data by interviews using onsite visits our data collection was conducted using interviews via Skype.   For this study the research methodology to be used is as indicated above qualitative. This choice is arguably the best method that can effectively be used for case study research (Yin 2015). Case study research using a qualitative methodology has gained popularity over the years since Robert Yin an American social scientist released a book explaining its best research design and focusing on its specific difficulties and aspects.    Yin has been involved in book and articles publishing since he was at graduate school. His first article was on face recognition as carried out an experiment on psychology and neuroscience. It is after this that he got interested in research and his preferences shifted to public policy.  Yin was specifically interested in establishing how case study research can be used in the study of public policy. He founded the COSMOS Corporation in 1980 a research corporation with the    P a g e |  21  \\x0cprimary objective of developing research methods conducting applied research and evaluate the validity  of  the  techniques  as  well  as  giving  technical  support  and  management  advice  based research data with the aim of improving public policy and the results of collaborative ventures as well as private enterprises. His organization (COSMOS Corporation) has successfully carried out research projects for federal state and local agencies as well as private foundations across the country.  Yin  has  also  assisted  many  research  groups  whereby  he  offers  training  in  regard  to research  designs  and  case  study  research.  His  work  regarding  the  use  of  qualitative  research methodology in case study research gained prominence and has become one of the most cited and used  methodology  in  various  researches  over  the  years.  Yin  who  is  also  the  president  of  the COSMOS Corporation located in the United States of America has been cited for many years by scolars studies and academicians using case study research. As a matter of fact his work ranks top among the best methodological works.  3.1.1 Qualitative research methodology   This type of research methodology is applicable in a wide range of academic disciplines and particularly focuses in the social aspects of human beings as well as on natural sciences. Yin (2015 ix) presented that qualitative research methods stem from practical adaptive and inductive perspectives. The practical approach provides for \\xe2\\x80\\x9cexplicit attention\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to a diversity of methods for research fieldwork data collection and the presentation of the research outcomes. The adaptive approach provides for a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdissection of critical research designs and instruments\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Yin 2015 ix). The inductive approach finally provides for various forms of information published in books and peerreviewed journals. It is important to note that as a field of study qualitative methodology incorporates  concepts  as  well  as  methods  acquired  from  a  wide  range  of  academic  fields.  In addition the core objectives of the qualitative research study vary broadly based in the disciplinary backgrounds. For instance in the event that the disciplinary background is psychology the primary objective of the study would be the understanding of human behavior as well as the reasons and factors that influence the behavior.  In addition it is also applicable in areas such as market research and business in general as they study human behavior as well.  As such it essential for our current research about \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinfluencer marketing as an innovative tool to increase customer acquisition for SMEs in the MENA region\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.     P a g e |  22  \\x0cBasically the questions that the research aims at answering are why and how in cases of human behavior study. If the study is on marketing research the questions that the methodology seeks to answer might also be what where when and/or who.  Another type of research where this is true is in the field of sociology where the objective is usually to understand social behavior and/or government programs. It can also be used in political science as well as in marketing education and social work.    Opdenakker (2006) presents that a qualitative interview may be conducted facetoface  utilizing  synchronous  communications  of  time  and  space    via  telephone  interviews  utilizing synchronous communication of time and asynchronous communication of space via messenger interviews  utilizing  synchronous  communication  of  time  and  asynchronous  communication  of space or by electronic interviews through email utilizing asynchronous communication of both time and space (Opedenakker 2006). Alshenqeeti (2014) conducted a critical review of qualitative research interviews as an approach to data collection in social science investigations and found the interview questions should be formulated in a manner that addresses the research questions best which is quite logical indeed.  Researchers agree that site visit approaches to conduct interviews are the best method but  can be time consuming (Yin 2015). Jamshed (2014) presented that the optimization of time during qualitative research interviews can be achieved by the utilization of interview guides to explore a number of participants comprehensively and systematically. Moreover a digital interview may provide more opportunities to interview high level professionals who may not be readily available for facetoface interviews on site during the time line for the research.   Jamshed (2014) moreover pretends that qualitative research is \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe most common approach  to data collection\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and that most qualitative interviews are indepth lightly structured or semistructured.  Edwards  &  Holland  (2013)  conject  that  a  structured  interview  generally  becomes qualitative and kind of rigid; however qualitative research with semi or unstructured interviews enhances  the  flexibility  of  the  interview.  The  analysis  was  based  on  Yin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  preferred  research methodology  which  is  cross  case  analysis.  This  is  a  research  method  that  is  able  to  mobilize knowledge by comparison of data from several individual case studies.    P a g e |  23    \\x0c3.1.2. Research Ethics in qualitative research   High ethical standards are required when interviewing the participants by network video applications (Alshenqeeti 2014). Klaassen (2016) presented that semistructured interviews with the  participant  should  not  be  recorded  due  to  the  expectation  that  recording  would  place unnecessary pressure on the respondent and impede the relevance of the responses. However since we  needed  to  interview  SME  representatives  in  different  countries  the  use  of  digital  and information  communication  technology  to  conduct  the  research  was  required.  We  solved  the objections by Klaassen by asking the respondents the permission to skype and tape the interviews.   Moreover the level of sensitivity and quality of the interview questions is also a critical aspect of conducting a rich and transparent qualitative study that is reliable verifiable relevant and in support of future studies (Yin 2015; Alshenqeeti 2014). The interview questions for the qualitative analysis of this study were compiled from the main points we covered in the literature review in chapter 1 and went along with prefabricated research questions from similar studies. We also explained that to participants so that they knew we only wanted to be part of the current research stream in our field of research and were not interested in specific company secrets.   3.2. Research design   The  research  design  that  was  applied  in  this  case  study  research  is  based  on  Yin\\xe2\\x80\\x99s qualitative research methodology and is generally known as cross case analysis. This is a research methodology that is effective in helping researchers mobilize knowledge by comparing the results from several individual studies.   A  qualitative  research  approach  was  used  to  collect  Skype  interview responses  from  a sample of participants from SMEs in the MENA region. Klassen (2016) investigated the marketing budget dilemmas of startups and SMEs; and supported that the SME marketing approaches should be unique to those of large firms as opposed to mirroring the marketing schemes of large firms and that most activities are only carried out by a few key people. The interviews of this research were  as  a  consequence  conducted  with  entrylevel  customer  service  representatives  sales managers  and  some  employees  with  more  executive  functions.  The  choice  was  based  on    P a g e |  24  \\x0cinformation about who was best placed in these SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s to be able to provide us with relevant information on the research questions.   All of the participants were asked the same closed fixed response interview questions. The interviews were recorded and transcribed to form data that could be coded and evaluated using general statistics. In order to answer the research questions.    Creswell & Clark (2011 8) support that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunderstanding data extracted from qualitative research of a few individuals should include indepth explorations of the individual perceptions\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of  the  research  phenomenon  and  is  beneficial  to  the  researcher.  SME  managers  marketing executives  social  media  influencers  and  customer  service  representatives  were  solicited  to participate in our interviews. A primary motivation for selecting the qualitative interview process is also visible here as it was necessary to have the capacity to generate data that might be used to compare SME employee point of views in the context of social media influencers as marketing tools; to mark and analyze any inconsistencies across responses; to integrate them with secondary data; and to develop viable metrics for online influencer marketing to be used in future studies.  3.3. Sample Population   Skype interviews were finally conducted with 7 employees from a total of 5 SME firms in the MENA region. The firms were selected from the International Finance Corporation (IFC) and World Economic Forum (2017) \\xe2\\x80\\x9c100 Arab Startups Shaping the Fourth Industrial Revolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d list of entrepreneurled firms across the MENA region. How did we come to this result? A total of 30 MENA SME employees and CEOs in the marketing department were invited to participate  in  the  Skype  interviews  for  the  study.  Of  the  30  contacted  people  23  individuals responded. The final sample consisted of a mixed male and female respondents sample from 5 selected firms in which 7 respondents who where employees from SME companies conducted the Skype interview.   The sample population consisted of a diversity of educational backgrounds and current positions within the MENA SME firms.  The 5 MENA SMEs finally selected for this study were  Eda3ly    P a g e |  25  \\x0cEgypt;  Skiplino;  Bahrain; Floose  Lybia;  Liwwa and  Real  cosmetics  Jordan.

Reliability and Validity   Reliability  and  validity  of  a  study  are  used  to  test  the  instrumentation.  They  are  very important for any research (Kuada 2012).  They show the consistency of the instrumentation which  will  indicate  how much  the results  can  be  trusted. The  instrumentation  used  should  be reliable and valid.   This research is to be carried out in such a manner that all the data collected were reliable and could be validated. Data are to be collected from reliable sources (CEOs of selected SMEs from MENA region) that have the right credentials. As a result outcome of the research will be reliable  with regards to the making of decisions on whether the use of influencers as a marketing tool by SMEs in the MENA region and on whether this is effective or not as a marketing tool and whether it should be embraced by other business organizations. Decisions regarding any possible improvements on the same may also be reliably made.   It is important to note that when making policies the findings of researches similar to this have to be taken into consideration. In this case the results or outcome can be used in making    P a g e |  26  \\x0cdecisions as well as in establishing policies that can enhance the use of influencers as a marketing tool. Taking this in mind it can be noted that reliability and validity of a research is an essential factor that should not be ignored.      P a g e |  27  \\x0c  \\x0cChapter Four Interview result and presentation of Data   4.  Introduction           In this chapter we will present the questions used in the skype interviews and relate them to our research questions. Moreover we will indicate the answers we received in a structured way. The end of the chapter summarizes the answers in a table format. Comparing the answers with what literature thought us will be done in the next chapter.  4.1. The questionnaire or survey    The  social  media  influencer  marketing  survey  was  divided  into  2  parts.    The  sample demographics  were  situated  in  section  I  and  the  survey  questions  in  section  II.  The  sample demographics provided for the personal profile information for each of the participants while Section  II  was  designed  to  obtain  the  participants\\xe2\\x80\\x99  perspectives  on  social  media  influencer marketing strategies and whether their firm benefits from these marketing strategies .  The interviews consisted of 4 closeended questions in the Demographics section and 9 closeended questions in the second section for SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Employees Perspectives (Marketers). These 4 questions were followed by a list of open ended questions to probe the answers of the respondents more deeply. The responses of the interview were analyzed based on the cross case analysis which was developed by Yin in his qualitative methodology. The design is important since it will help to draw specialized knowledge from the case. The outcomes of the interviews are presented in the next sections of this chapter.  The questions in part II of the survey are related to the research questions proposed in section 1.2. Of the first chapter as follows.  Whereas Questions 1 and 2 in part II are purely an informative probing the reflections of the employees on their company and the different media used in influencer marketing the other questions are related to one or more of the relevant research questions.  So are Questions 3 4 5 and 6  related to the first research question  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo influencermarketing strategies have a positive effect on customer acquisition in SMEs?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d;  Questions 3 and 9 are related to the second research question \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhy do SMEs choose social media influencers instead    P a g e |  29  \\x0cof other marketing tools? \\xe2\\x80\\x9c; Questions 3 and 9 are related  to the relationship between influencer marketing and the marketing strategy of the SME in general and how they relate to one another and thus to research question 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich position does influencer marketing take in the overall marketing strategy of SMEs?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.

Employees Perspectives on influencer marketing for MENA SMEs  Section II of the survey solicited the participant perspectives of the social media influence strategies in the context of customer acquisition in the MENA states. We enumerate the answers in the order of the different questions one by one. The analysis of the answers will be done in the next chapter.   Question 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you rate your company in the area of cost effectiveness credibility awareness and effectiveness in its current marketing strategies? (Excellent Great Good poor fair)\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Some of the respondents in the sample ranked the credibility of employer as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFair\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; while others ranked the credibility as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The majority of the sample rated the awareness of their MENA SME employer as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the lowest rating being \\xe2\\x80\\x9cFair\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  More than half of the sample ranked the approach to giving recommendations as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while a few rated it as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Around half of the sample ranked the cost effectiveness as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGood\\xe2\\x80\\x9d while a few rated the employer as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPoor\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. A less than half of the sample ranked the efficiency of their MENA SME employer as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cExcellent\\xe2\\x80\\x9d; while the others rated the employer as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGreat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. In general on all aspects apart from cost effectiveness and giving recommendations the employers were considered as relatively good.  Question  2  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich  of  the  following  online  social  media  sites  are  utilized  most  by  your company  for  the  purposes  of  influencer  marketing?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Twitter  (Twelebs)  Facebook (Lifestyles)  Instagram  (IG  models)  Youtube  (Youtubers)  Blogs  (Lifestyles)  or  None  of these?  The majority of the sample asserted that either Twitter (Twelebs) or Facebook (Lifestyles) was utilized most by their company. Regarding to RESP1 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdue to the widespread user base across our region. I mean nowadays almost everyone no matter what age has a Facebook account.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Some asserted that Instagram was the only social media platform used by their Company. Others asserted that their company only used Youtube (Youtuber). None of the sample indicated Blogs (Lifestyles) as a key channel for marketing in their firm.     P a g e |  31  \\x0cQuestion 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHow do you perceive online social media influencer?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d And had several potential answers   \\xe2\\x96\\xa1  Peerreviews are more reliable than firmcontrolled views; \\xe2\\x96\\xa1  Social media influencers are in agreement with my best interests; \\xe2\\x96\\xa1  Social media influencers do not endorse harmful products or services;  \\xe2\\x96\\xa1  And whether the social influencer is being paid to endorse or is truly an endorser of the product makes no difference.    The majority of the sample agreed that peerreviews are more reliable than firmcontrolled views  with  regards  to  marketing  and  firm  appraisals.  RESP2  stated  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cHowever  as  we  have experienced several times lot of people still prefer peerreviews as more reliable source when it comes to feedback of a certain product or brand.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d These individuals in our sample also agreed that social media influencers are generally in agreement with the best interests of the consumer. According to RESP1 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cTo be honest social media influencers and our company are interests align with each other\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. They also agreed with the fact that social media influencers do not endorse harmful  products  or  services.  Approximately  half  of  the  sample  (3)  asserted  that  it  made  no difference to them whether the social influencer is being paid to endorse a product or service or is truly a personal endorser of the product.   At the other end of the scale only RESP3 asserted that peerreviews are not more reliable than firmcontrolled views with regards to marketing and firm appraisals. None of the interviewees in our sample believed that the social media influencers are generally not in agreement with the best interests of the consumer. None of the participants believed that social media influencers endorse harmful products or services.   Questions 4 to 6 are intricately related.  They consist of a group of several sub questions \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you  believe  influencer  marketing  will  have  any  effect  on  the  customer  acquisition  rates among the SMEs in MENA countries? Is it more effective than other tools add if yes?  How much the effectiveness and the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s have a small budget so how about the return is it high return of low return?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d     P a g e |  32  \\x0c         The majority of the sample expressed that they believed online influencer marketing can and will have an indirect effect on the customer acquisition rates among the SMEs in the MENA countries .some of them totally agree with the impact of influencer marketing on the awareness and ROI .RESP 2 mentioned \\xe2\\x80\\x9csocial media platforms are growing rapidly which makes influencer marketing a very effective method for SMEs.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d However one respondent did not believe that online influencer marketing could have any effect on those customer acquisition rates. RESP3 stated \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI do not believe this tool could be of any benefit to the company. The conventional marketing tools are more effective.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d One respondent indicated that they were not sure of or did not know how the potential of online influencer marketing will impact the customer acquisition rates.   Question 7 How effective is influencer marketing in customer acquisition rates among the SMEs in MENA countries?             Expansion  of  private  sector  customer  bases  increased  awareness  of  existing  private sector customer bases and fostering of innovation and entrepreneurship as well as improved firm performance  were  indicated  as  influences  of  this  marketing  technique  however  mainly  in  an indirect way as the majority expressed that they believed influencer marketing would surely have such an indirect effect on customer acquisition rates. Some believed influencer marketing would also have a direct effect according to RESP 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cYes influencer marketing has a direct effect on customer acquisition I can say absolutely direct regarding to our experience with many influencers it was really effective especially in our field\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Finally others expressed that they believed influencer marketing would have no effect on the customer acquisition rates due to a fostering of innovation and. Others expressed that they believed influencer  marketing  will  have  an  indirect  effect  on  the  customer  acquisition  rates  among the SMEs in MENA countries due to improved firm performance.   Question  8  reads  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhat  are  some  of  the  problems  you  have  faced  when  dealing  with influencers and have you been able to find suitable influencers and how did you find them?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d     P a g e |  33  \\x0cThe  majority  of  the  sample  expressed  the  opinion  that  the  main  problem  that  the organization was likely to face when dealing with influencer marketers is the difficulty of finding a  reliable  and  credible  influencer.  This  is  a  great  challenge  due  to  the  fact  that  without  the influencers it will be impossible to introduce an influencer marketing campaign. Also choosing the wrong influencers might lead the company to incurring very serious losses .As RESP1 said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWe are  always  afraid  to  get  wrong  influencers  that\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  why  we  have  conducted  some  research  about  a  few influencers to decide who was more suitable for us as a company\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Some said that it is difficult to measure the return on investment for an influencer marketing campaign.  It is however a challenge that is also experienced with other marketing channels as well. It therefore becomes difficult to ascertain the amount of money that should be allocated for influencer marketing. According  to  RESP3  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdetermining  the  amount  to  be  allocated  for  each  influencer  is  very difficult since the company cannot ascertain the amount of sales they generate.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Others finally believed that it is a challenge to attract and engage influencers. In most cases influencers are very busy and rarely available partially due to the size of their crowd and the complexity of their activities.  The last question \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDo you think it is sufficient to combine two marketing tools? Do you need to combine it with other tools to be effective or it is effective on its own to have customer acquisition? Is the tool complementary to other tools?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d   The majority of our sample thinks that it will be more effective to combine two or more marketing tools. This will in their eyes enable the company to reach more customers and will also increase the level of marketing efficiency. A few think that influencer marketing will be effective on its own to acquire new customers.  They believe that if the company gets the right influencer the tool will deliver good results and will reduce marketing costs substantially. RESP2 stated \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwith the right influencers I believe the tool can be effective on its own.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  . Others believe that the tool is complementary to other tools. RESP 1 said \\xe2\\x80\\x9cI see this combination as a necessity\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Ideally influencer marketing actually complements other tools of marketing as it might not be able to attain the desired results when fully relied upon as a standalone strategy. According to RESP 6 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cthe tool can easily complement other marketing tools its maybe better because for me I\\xe2\\x80\\x99m not sure it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s enough.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  This is due to the fact that there are some potential customers who are not active on social media sites and therefore influencer marketing might not be able to be reached by influencer marketing.   P a g e |  34    \\x0c 4.2.3 Major finding in one blink of an eye.       In this section we present the major results in a table format. This is also a partial cross case analysis as  the  different  respondents  are  if  necessary  indicated.

RESP 3 stated that social media influencers are not likely to make any difference in terms of sales. One RESP (5) stated that he was not sure whether influencer marketing would have any effect on the sales or not. 3 of the participants stated that they believe in online influencer marketing stating that it would have an indirect effect on the customer acquisition rates for the SMEs in MENA countries.  Two RESP 1 and 4 indicated that they believe that influencer marketing can have a direct effect on customer acquisition. RESP 3 that he did not believe in the effectiveness of influencer marketing. RESP 5 stated said he was not sure. Majority of the respondents (4) stated that the most challenging issue faced by companies in influence marketing is the ability to get a reliable influencer. RESP 3 said it would be challenging for the company to determine the ROI and hence it is difficult to decide the amount of budget to allocate. RESP 7 and RESP 5 stated that it will be difficult for the organization to attract and engage influencers due to the fact that they are usually very busy and hence it is hard to reach them. 5 of the respondents believe that influencer marketing can be more effective if combined with other marketing tools. RESP 2 believe that influencer marketing can be more effective on its own. RESP 6   said that he was not sure whether influencer marketing will be more effective \\x0cwhen combined with other tools or when on its own. Table 3 Cross Case Analysis       P a g e |  37  \\x0c  \\x0cChapter five Discussion of the results  5. Discussion of the results   Influencer marketing is an emerging form of marketing whereby the business organization uses influential people to advertise its goods and services instead of focusing on the entire target market. The organization picks selected people who are perceived to have a significant level of influence over  potential  customers.  It  introduces  them  to  its  marketing  activities  which  are  from  then partially centered on the influencers communicating with customers and potential customers via social  media  about  the  companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99  products  and  services.  This  thesis  wanted  to  look  at  the effectiveness of such a marketing approach and which benefits it offered to SMEs in the MENA region and which challenges it faces. In this chapter we want to discuss the results obtained from qualitative case research from the angle of the research questions put forward in the first chapter.   5.1. Can we expect good results from the sample?  Determining whether the sample can give a good response can amongst others be done by looking at the demographic composition of it. It is indeed important to note that the composition of the sample population plays an important role in determining the accuracy of the results.  First  our  respondents  were  selected  from  a  representative  list  of  well  recognized  and performing SMEs in the Arab world.  The age of most of our respondents is between 36 and 50 years. Only two were younger. This might indicate that their level of experience and thus ability to take decisions is high enough. According to the positions they executed at their companies. Most said they had been working at various other positions before taking their marketing responsibility. Men and women were about equally represented in the sample. We can assume they were all capable  of  taking  the  decisions  they  were  asked  about  and  were  knowledgeable  about  how companies function given their diverse experience before assuming a marketing position.   All respondents also had a higher education degree although mostly at Bachelor level only (only two had obtained a master\\xe2\\x80\\x99s degree). This is in the MENA region quite normal for marketing    P a g e |  39  \\x0cpositions in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. It does not prove their absolute proficiency at marketing. However a majority of  the  sample  population  stated  that  they  held  a  marketing  accreditation  and  some  type  of marketing  or  consultation  position  with  the  SME.  This  means  that  they  had  some  level  of knowledge and skills in matters of marketing and therefore a good understanding of marketing issues. The number of executives entry level/customer service representative and manager was also equally represented across the sample. One participant asserted that their position within the SME was outside the scope of the choices in the interview but able to answer completely and with full understanding.  From these demographic data it can be ascertained that this was probably the right sample population and hence a positive research outcome could be expected. The only negative element is that we only covered a sample of 7 respondents.          It is also important to note that our respondents mostly have a positive view of their employers as marketers. Three of them ranked their employer as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgreat\\xe2\\x80\\x9d on credibility while four ranked the credibility the employer as \\xe2\\x80\\x98Fair\\xe2\\x80\\x99.  On the awareness level most of the participants rated their employers as \\xe2\\x80\\x98Great\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with only a few (2) giving them a \\xe2\\x80\\x98Fair\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rating. The approach to giving recommendations  was  ranked  as  good  by  five  of  the  participants  while  two  rated  these recommendations as \\xe2\\x80\\x98Poor.\\xe2\\x80\\x99 On the effectiveness level finally four of the participants ranked their employers as \\xe2\\x80\\x98Good\\xe2\\x80\\x99 with three giving them an \\xe2\\x80\\x98Excellent\\xe2\\x80\\x99 rating.  These rankings indicate that the current marketing strategies used by the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in our sample are not fully efficient. It also indicates the necessity to look at new avenues for better marketing such as influencer marketing  5.2. Which social media were used by our SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in their influencer marketing efforts?  The most commonly used social media site in our sample is Twitter. Four of the organizations indeed use Twitter as the main social media for their advertising. Facebook is used by two SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s only  and  only  one  of  the  sample  companies  uses  Instagram  for  marketing  purposes.  Twitter marketing can in our eyes be utilized more intensely in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s but it would be more effective if the company extends its social media use to other social media sites. This might explain our results though only obtained for a small sample.    P a g e |  40  \\x0c  Extension to other social media sites can also be done to Facebook. In spite of the high use of Facebook by people in general and in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in particular it is underused for marketing purposes although it would enable companies to reach people who are not active on Twitter and thus would increase the efficiency of the marketing process.  It is quite naturally more used for private social media contact. Given the recent privacy problems Facebook experienced we do however believe that it is wise for companies to be extremely careful in using it as a marketing tool and certainly control privacy settings carefully.   5.3. Research question 1 Do influencer marketing strategies have a positive effects on customer acquisition in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s?    The positive effect of influencer marketing on customer acquisition is a very specific aspect of the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s marketing strategy. Actually looking at whether using influencer marketing would be an effective marketing tool in general should be a question that is previously addressed.  With regard to perception of online social media influencers most (4) of the respondents agreed that influencers as marketers are likely to have the best interests of the consumers in mind and that they will not endorse harmful products or services. This means that it would be beneficial to the organization using them as communication agents. The fact that influencer marketers have the best interest of the organization in mind indeed means that they will work for the improved or increased sales of the company.   Nevertheless 2 of our respondents stated that social media influencers are in their eyes not likely to make any difference in terms of sales at all making it imperative for management to carry out  a  good  cost  benefit  analysis  before  making  a  decision  on  whether  to  engage  on  a  social influencer marketing strategy or not. To engage. One participant acknowledged not to be sure of the effectiveness of influencer marketing. We believe this hesitation is mostly based on the major challenge influencer marketing faces before being adopted namely finding the right influencers who  are  credible  and  reliable.  Once  this  problem  is  overcome  belief  in  the  effectiveness  of influencer marketing grows within the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. We will come back to that aspect when discussing our results with respect to research question 4 (section 5.6.).    P a g e |  41  \\x0c While  two  of  our  participants  believed  influencer  marketing  would  have  the  ability  to directly affect the acquisition of new customers three of the participants stated they believe online influencer marketing to have only an indirect effect on the customer acquisition rates in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s. Two respondents believe there is no effect at all or are unsure of it.    Given that influencer marketers are not considered to have negative interests and would not  publicize  anything  that  would  put  the  organization  in  bad  light  this  is  quite  surprising.  Influencers  are  indeed  chosen  because  of  their  huge  following  on  social  media  and  thus  their potential  to  influence  new  customers  to  try  products  and  services  they  promote.  Influencer marketing is also expected to have an effect on the expansion of the private sector customer base. Yet their influence apparently is supposed not to reach that far although our respondents do think it is advantageous to use influencer marketing.  A possible explanation might be situated in the fact that SME managers think too much in terms of increased sales as the major effect of influencer marketing and even marketing in general although  we  clearly  asked  about  customer  acquisition.    Influencer  marketing  is  only  a communication tool. The followers of influencers are exposed to the messages of their influencers and might try the products out (acquisition) but not necessarily stay as customers; In that case the increase in sales would over a somewhat longer period (eventually over a year as the term in which managers mostly think) not increase at all or only slightly. This reasoning also explains why our respondents  clearly  opted  for  an  indirect  effect  of  influencer  marketing  as  an  answer  to  this research question. Moreover this asks for an analysis of results in both the short the medium and the long term.    5.4. Research question 2 Why do SMEs choose social media influencers instead of other marketing tools?  Literature indicates that the use of influencer marketing is often inspired by the fact that these \\xe2\\x80\\x9cpromoters\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of products and services are a lot less expensive than real media stars previously    P a g e |  42  \\x0cused the so called opinion leaders. Moreover given the huge following social media influencers have their effectiveness as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cleaders\\xe2\\x80\\x9d might be less in numbers but more in terms of results per dollar spent.   Given however that the influence of these social media leaders is mostly considered as indirect (see previous section) our research does not directly point at this type of effect. Furthermore our research did not go deep enough to ask the participants about the several types of influencers as we  presumed  they  would  not  necessarily  know  about  this  scientific  subdivision  presented  in section 2.4. Thus we did not verify whether the use of microinfluencers as suggested by previous research could improve the perception of social media influencer marketing in SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and increase its use as a marketing tool.  5.5. Research question 3 Which position does influencer marketing take in the overall marketing strategy of SMEs?  It could be deduced from our interviews that most of our respondents believe in influencer marketing as an effective marketing tool. Yet the belief is based on the way they perceive the role of influencer marketing in a complete marketing program for the products and services of the company. They clearly stated that a combination with other marketing tools and a combination of more than one influencer marketing tool would be more effective as it would be able to cover a wider range of customers. Five of our respondents believed that combining two or more tools would indeed be more effective. The two others felt that influencer marketing could eventually be effective  on  its  own  but  are  not  sure.    These  results  may  not  surprise  us.  After  all  any communication effort in marketing is part of a vaster marketing mix and cannot on its own create the marketing results a full marketing plan is able to achieve.  Thus influencer marketing has to be seen as a complementary marketing tool within a broad marketing action plan. In that case its effectiveness is believed to increase exponentially. And as literature mentioned in chapter 2 indicates in that case it would become more common in use as probably people who do not believe in influencer marketing otherwise would become convinced    P a g e |  43  \\x0cas well. Then and only then it would also increase the awareness of the existing private sector and foster innovation and entrepreneurship skills.   5.6. Research question 4 What are the challenges associated with influencer marketing strategies in SMEs?  According  to  most  of  the  participants  the  major  challenge  with  regard  to  influencer marketing  is  finding  a  reliable  and  credible  influencer.  In  order  to  find  a  reliable  influencer therefore  the  organization  should  carry  out  proper  research  before  settling  on  a  marketing influencer  for  their  products  or  services.    Four  of  the  respondents  felt  that  this  is  the  most challenging issue associated with influencer marketing. Moreover the fact that having a successful influencer marketing campaign is dependent on who the influencers are means that this is a very significant and even critical challenge.   A solution might be to ask for help from marketing agencies that are experts in influencer marketing and normally have a base of good and reliable influencers to propose. These agencies could also guide the company in developing good influencer marketing programs in general using the most appropriate tools at the right moment.  Looking at the credentials a number of influencers have  in  marketing  campaigns  for  other  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  might  be  a  way  of  doing  it  yourself.  Using marketing agencies will also increase the cost. This is certainly a problem as our respondents also mentioned a second challenge to good influencer marketing.  Difficulty in measuring the return on investment is according to one of the respondents also an important challenge in influencer marketing.  This makes it difficult for the organization to determine the amount of money to be allocated for the campaign. A suggestion would be that the  organization  determines  the  volume  of  sales  before  the  use  of  influencer  marketing  and compares it with the volume of sales after an influencer marketer campaign has been employed. Two of our respondents believe that by attracting the right influencers this problem would also be partially solved thus linking the two challenges mentioned in the interviews.       P a g e |  44  \\x0c5.7. Corroboration of these results.  It is important to note here that we conducted two more interviews with the influencers confronting  them  with  these  results.    Most  of  the  responses  that  were  obtained  from  these interviews confirmed the information received from the interviews with the respondents in the SMEs. We will only indicate a few important points here as these interviews were extremely short.  In general we can conclude that our research indicated that influencer marketing can be effective and is relatively cheap as compared to conventional methods of marketing. However there are some challenges that are experienced and which should be addressed in order to increase the efficiency of the marketing of which the selection of the right influencer the use of several social media tools together and a more performant way of calculating the cost benefit are the most important ones.       P a g e |  45  \\x0c  \\x0cChapter Six Conclusion and Recommendation  6. Conclusion and recommendations 6.1.Conclusion  Marketing is one of the most important activities in an organization as it has a direct and indirect influence on the level of sales. Business organizations are continually looking for better ways of marketing that can attract more customers and consequently generate more revenue. With the advancing technology different new ways of doing marketing have emerged that will aid in increasing its efficiency. One of these strategies in the marketing field is influencer marketing.   This  involves  a  situation  where  a  company  uses  an  influential  person  to  endorse  their products  or  services. Influencer  marketing  is  especially  used  by  businesses  that  rely  on  social media  sites  for  their  marketing.  We  looked  at  the  opportunities  and  challenges  influencer marketing poses for SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more specifically in the MENA region. Although our sample was small some important conclusions can be drawn.  First this research confirmed that the use of influencer marketing as a marketing tool by SMEs helps to increase acquisition of customers but only in combination with other marketing techniques as our respondents uttered doubts about the direct effect of influencer marketing on the acquisition of customers. The data indicated that most respondents feel that influencer marketing can only be more effective if employed in combination with other tools. They believe that despite the  challenges  this  strategy  can  complement  other  marketing  strategies  and  in  the  end  aid  in increasing the level of efficiency and effectiveness of the marketing in the organization.  Influencer marketing is a complementary marketing tool.  Second it promises to be a less costly way of  marketing taking into account that it is extremely  difficult  to  ascertain  its  return  on  investment.  A  suggestion  would  be  that  the organization determines the volume of sales before the use of influencer marketing and compares it with the volume of sales after an influencer marketer campaign has been employed.      P a g e |  47  \\x0cThird finding a reliable and credible influencer is the major challenge SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s face when starting  with  influencer  marketing.  Using  influencer  marketing  consultants  in  doing  so  is  one solution but a SME could also itself try to find some information regarding their past engagements and  marketing  activities  and  make  the  decision  itself.  This  will  determine  how  influential  the influencer has been in the past and how they have increased the customer acquisition of the other products. In addition finding out about how they have portrayed the products and organizations they represented in the past will also provide the SME with important information that can help in selecting the right influencer. Basically choosing a good influencer is the starting point for the success of social influencer marketing and it can only be done by due diligence research on several influencers. 6.2. Recommendation for marketers in SMEs  Our research indicates a number of important factors that SME marketing managers have to take into account when engaging in influencer marketing such as  1.  Use influencer marketing only as a complementary marketing tool within your marketing plans. 2.  Try to use several social media platforms together. 3.  Select the influencers carefully either on the basis of references or previous marketing activities or with the help of an agency. 4.  Calculate the cost benefit carefully.  Although influencer marketing is considered a cheaper and more modern format of marketing communication one should try to figure out the difference in number of contacted customers or sales before and after the campaign. Since influencer marketing is a communication tool the first one is in our eyes more correct communication tools should be evaluated on communication results.  Calculate the acquisition of new customers as one of the major results.    P a g e |  48  \\x0c6.3. Recommendation for further studies   This thesis was clearly small and qualitative in nature. Future research should try to find more accurate answers on a number of contradictory results we obtained and problems we observed. They are 1.  Are the results of influencer marketing in terms of acquisition of new customers different in the short run from the medium term or long term? 2.  Can influencer marketing also be used in different stages of the buying process?  3.  Is influencer marketing different for different types of products and services? Which are those differences? 4.  How can SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s best determine who are reliable and credible influencers? Should they do it themselves or with the help of influencer consulting agencies? 5.  Which type of influencer is best suited for SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s? Are it the mentioned microinfluencers or others? 6.  Since  influencer  marketing  is  a  complementary marketing  technique  it  is  important  to know with which other marketing techniques the best results in terms of synergy can be produced.  7.  The same question can be asked about the types of social media that can be combined best in influencer marketing? Are they different for different types of products and services? 8.  Is the MENA region different form other regions of the world with regards to influencer marketing?  Further research should in our eyes collect much more data from a lot of different case studies. Not all of these questions can be solved in one research venture. Several ones will be needed. We also suggest that next to marketing experts also communication experts and social media experts should be involved in this research. It should become a multiexpertise team effort. In the end we also feel that more quantitative research will be needed to answer some of the above mentioned questions.
