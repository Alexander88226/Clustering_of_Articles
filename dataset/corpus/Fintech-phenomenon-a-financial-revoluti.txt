However  in  the  last  decade  it  is  facing  a  new  disruption  wave  caused  by  the introduction of new technologies and significant shifts in customers    needs.  Moreover the banking industry had to cope with the strengthening of the financial regulation as  a  result  of  the  2008  financial  crisis.  The  financial  crisis  highlighted  banking  sector   s weaknesses  related  to  excessive  leverage  and  inadequate  capital.  The  greater  rigidity  of  the financial  regulation  increased  compliance  costs  and  obligations  for  financial  institutions. Therefore banks were induced to focus more on compliance instead of innovation. The  combination  of  these  factors  favoured  the  emergence  of  new  players  in  the  financial ecosystem the FinTech companies (henceforth    FinTechs   ).  FinTech  includes  a  wide  range  of  new  technologies  and  digital  innovations  applied  to  the financial sector and financial activities. FinTechs provide financial services and solutions using new  technologies  such  as  distributed  ledger  technology  (DLT)  machine  learning  artificial intelligence (AI) roboadvisory and application programming interfaces (APIs). After  the  2008  financial  crisis  the  global  investment  in  FinTechs  increased  significantly.  In 2014 investments tripled in one year to reach the amount of $12.2 billion (Accenture 2015). The  global  investment  activity  in  FinTechs  attained  a  second  peak  in  2015  ($25billion) followed by a reduction in 2016 ($14.2 billion) and in 2017 ($12.4 billion) (KPMG 2018). A third peak is expected in 2018 since the global investment in H2   18 is already equal to $31.7 billion.  FinTechs rely on new technologies to offer innovative financial services that better meet new customers     needs  and  habits.  Moreover  they  are  based  on  innovative  business  models  that enable  them  to  increase  access  to  financial  services.  The  features  and  the  rapid  growth  of FinTechs destabilized the financial ecosystem and especially the banking industry. Traditional player  (the  incumbents)  are  facing  a  fierce  competition  from  FinTechs.  They  are  feeling threatened by FinTechs and they need to change their strategy to survive in the financial sector. The new solutions offered by FinTechs aimed at providing the customers with ease of use high transaction  speed  and  transparency  and  a  wider  choice  of  financial  services  and  providers. Financial incumbents are facing new competitors not only digitizing their processes but also investing  in  FinTechs  or  collaborating  with  them.  In  this  way  they  gain  access  to  the  latest technologies and to new customers without radically changing their infrastructures.   7  The present work will focus on the relationship between the banking industry and FinTech to analyse  the  impact  of  FinTechs  on  the  performance  of  the  traditional  banking  sector.  The dissertation  is  divided  in  three  chapters.  Chapter  1  focuses  on  the  emergence  and  the development of the FinTech phenomenon. Firstly we provide a general definition of FinTech and we examine its expansion in the financial industry after the 2008 financial crisis. Secondly we analyse drivers benefits and challenges of FinTech for the financial industry. Finally we conclude with the difficulties in regulating FinTech and with the rise of RegTech. In  Chapter  2  we  analyse  the  main  implications  of  FinTech  and  FinTechs  for  the  banking industry in terms of performance. In the first section we focus on the FinTech innovations that mostly threaten the traditional banks while in the second section we describe the main financial ratios used in the academic literature to measure banks    performance in terms of profitability and efficiency. In  the  first  section  of  Chapter  3  we  examine  the  potential  relationships  between  banks  and FinTechs in order to understand the strategy of the incumbents to face the fierce competition from new entrants. In the second part we present a case study to analyse the impact of FinTechs acquisitions on the postacquisition performance (in terms of profitability and efficiency) of the acquiring  company.  To  investigate  this  issue  we  analyse  the  acquisitions  of  FinTechs performed by BBVA a Spanish banking Group in 2014 and 2016. We hypothesize that FinTech acquisitions have no impact on the postacquisition performance of BBVA. To test this assumption we compare preacquisition and postacquisition financial ratios (ROE ROA CIR) of the Spanish Group using a paired ttest. Finally we comment and discuss the results obtained to assess whether FinTechs acquisition have a significant impact on the postacquisition performance of the acquiring firm.              8    1.The FinTech phenomenon  To understand the main features and dynamics of the Fintech phenomenon it is first necessary to  define  it.  The  term  FinTech  is  a  neologism  that  comes  from  the  words     financial     and    technology    and it indicates the connection of new technologies with traditional activities of the financial industry (Gomber et al. 2017). We can find a great variety of definitions and interpretations in the academic literature (Varga 2017) but in this paper we will provide a summary.  Following the perspective of the Financial Stability Board (FSB) FinTech is    technologically enabled financial innovation that could result in new business models applications processes products or services with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provisions of financial services   .   FinTech includes digital innovations and technologyenabled business models in the financial industry and such innovations can transform the traditional industry structure improve strategic intermediation increase access to financial services but also generate privacy regulatory and lawenforcement changes (Philippon 2017). FinTech includes a wide range of digital innovations such as online marketplace lending (also known  as  online  peertopeer  lending)  equity  crowdfunding  roboadvice  distributed  ledger technology (DLT) cryptocurrencies and machine learning (Schindler 2017). Ozaee and Sohrabi (2017) described FinTech as a system of software and digital platforms to deliver financial services to final consumers. In this sense FinTech is an industry that refers to companies  that  try  to  make  financial  solutions  more  flexible  and  efficient  through  a  greater support  of  new  technologies.  Fintech  companies  are  generally  technological  startups  which provide clients with an array of services and strive to consolidate their position in the financial market by competing with traditional banks and financial players (Darolles 2016). In Gomber et al. (2017) FinTech contains innovators and disruptors in the financial sector that offer more flexibility efficiency and opportunities than the traditional financial intermediaries. FinTech is considered as    sustaining FinTech    when it refers to existing financial firms that use innovation  to  strengthen  their  business  or  as     disruptive  FinTech     where  startups  and  new companies adopt IT to compete with traditional financial firms by supplying new products and services. (Lee 2015).  9  Despite the different perspectives authors agree to define Fintech as the marriage of financial services  and  information  technology  (Arner  et  al.  2016)  whose  aim  is  to  promise  more flexibility efficiency and security to customers than incumbent financial institutions.  In the first part of our work we will follow the definition of FinTech provided by the Financial Stability  Board  since  our  principal  aim  is  to  study  the  dynamics  and  the  effects  of  the phenomenon and not of FinTech firms.  Summing up FinTech activities can be organized into five categories of financial services (i) payments clearing and settlement; (ii) deposits lending and capital raising; (iii) insurance; (iv) investment  management;  and  (v)  market  support  (FSB  2017).  For  example  the  category  of payment involves new and innovative payment solutions such as mobile payment systems. P2P transfers  and  cryptocurrencies;  deposits  and  lending  activities  include  crowdfunding crowdlending and microcredit solutions. (Haddad and Hornuf 2018).   1.1 The development of FinTech in the financial industry In a broader sense FinTech is the application of technology to finance but this is not a novelty for the financial industry (Arner et al. 2016). Technology and innovation have always had a key role in the evolution of the financial sector. Indeed the last 60 years represent an important step forward in terms of innovation in the 1950s the credit cards revolutionized the payment system in  the late 1960s the introduction of the Automatic Teller Machine (ATM) replaced branches and tellers the 1970s promoted the first electronic stock trading on exchange trading floors during the 1980s financial institutions implemented new ITs while the 1990s brought Internet and ecommerce business models (Ozaee and Sohrabi 2017).  Even though financial players have always looked for and adopted new solutions to best satisfy their  clients  the  waves  of  financial  and  technological  innovation  of  the  last  decades  caused important  changes in  the financial landscape concerning not  only products and services but also regulatory issues (EBA 2017).  To  understand  how  and  why  FinTech  today  influences  financial  players  and  markets  it   s fundamental to summarize the evolution of this phenomenon.   1.1.1 The process of FinTech evolution Arner et al. (2016) tried to understand how FinTech established itself in the financial market and  what  factors  drove  its  development.  The  authors  distinguished  three  phases  of  FinTech evolution specifying that the term Fintech does not refer only to specific sectors or business  10  models but it entails all services and products offered by incumbent financial institutions. The first stage (18661987) is FinTech 1.0 and it allowed the transition from an analogue industry to a digital one; new technologies developed during the 19th century facilitated the transmission of  financial  information  transactions  and  payments  across  borders.  The  technological innovation  of  this  period  favoured  the  establishment  of  a  modern  infrastructure  which increased the global interconnection of financial institutions (Varga 2017).  1987 marked the beginning of a new era characterized by the globalization and digitalisation of financial  processes  based  on  electronic  transactions  between  financial  players  and  their customers  around  the  world.    Financial  institutions  began  to  adopt  computerized  trading systems banks developed IT infrastructures for internal operations and relationships with their retail  clients  and  new  regulatory  standards  were  drawn  up  to  face  new  risks  in  the  financial industry. With the emergence of Internet most of banks fully digitized internal processes and relations with outsiders and retail customers. Even though the innovation occurred during this era was initially regarded as disruptive it represented the    birth of modern banking    (Varga 2017) based on IT infrastructures branchfocused business models and advanced technological systems.  With the internet evolution in the 1990s technological advances transformed the nature of the financial services industry and led to the development of electronic finance (efinance) which refers  to  many  financial  services  such  as  banking  and  stock  trading  performed  through electronic  means  (Lee  and  Shin  2017).  The  mobile  finance  asserted  itself  during  the  2000s thanks to important innovations in the smartphone user base and this facilitated the emergence of new services such as mobile payment and mobile banking that are an extension of efinance.  The innovations introduced in the two last decades favoured the success of FinTech especially after  the  worldwide  crisis  of  2008  by  combining  efinance  internet  technologies  artificial intelligence and big data analytics.  Until  2008  FinTech  included  traditional  regulated  financial  players  that  provided  financial services and products using new technologies; after the global financial crisis new startups and established  technology  companies  emerged  in  the  financial  industry  which  began  to  offer financial solutions and services directly to businesses and final customers.  Since the 2008 global financial crisis represented the turning point for the growth of FinTech 3.0 we decide to briefly discuss the consequences of the crisis that accelerated the development and the success of FinTech in the financial industry.   11  1.1.2 The role of the 2008 financial crisis in the development of FinTech The  financial  crisis  in  2008  is  only  one  of  the  factors  that  caused  significant  changes  in  the banking and financial sectors (Nicoletti 2017). As underlined by Darolles (2016) the financial crisis had a strong influence both on the regulation of the traditional financial institutions and on the trust of clients in their banks.  Since the crisis of 2008 revealed systemic risk in the activities of traditional players postcrisis reforms reinforced the regulatory framework mainly for banks.  The  consequences  of  the  crisis  were  amplified  by  the  failings  of  the  banking  sector  such  as excessive  leverage  lowquality  and  inadequate  capital  and  insufficient  liquidity  buffers (BCBS 2010a). Therefore the banking system was not able to absorb the resulting losses and the financial crisis was transferred to the rest of the financial industry and the real economy causing a significant reduction in credit and liquidity availability.  The Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS) decided to intervene after the financial crisis  to  increase  the  banks     ability  to  absorb  shocks  and  reduce  risk  of  spillover  from  the financial sector to the real economy. The postcrisis reforms have been referred to as    Basel III     whose  main  aim  concerns  a  stronger  capital  and  liquidity  regulation  mixed  with improvements  in  banks     supervision  risk  management  greater  transparency  and  disclosure. For BCBS it was fundamental to restore the health of the banking system as it is the centre of the credit intermediation process between savers and investors and it provides a wide range of financial services to customers SMEs large companies and governments. (BCBS 2010b). The effects  of the  financial crisis  were so strong  since the  global banking system  faced the crisis  with  an  insufficient  level  of  highquality  capital.  For  this  reason  the  new  regulation redefines the bank capital focusing on common equity which is considered the highest quality component of a bank   s capital.  The regulatory capital comprises Tier 1 Capital made up by Common  Equity  Tier  1  (CET1)  and  Additional  Tier  1  and  Tier  2  Capital.  The  new  rules introduced  new  restrictions  for  these  categories  a  minimum  CET1  ratio  of  4.5%  of  riskweighted assets at all times with a conservation buffer of 2.5% to all forms of capital;  Tier 1 Capital must be at least 6.0% of riskweighted assets at all times and the Total Capital (Tier 1+ Tier 2) must be at least at 8.0% of riskweighted assets at all times (BCBS 2010b Cosimano and Hakura 2011). Since the BCBS considered the inadequate liquidity in the financial system as one of the main culprits of the 2008 crisis it decided to implement the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) a shortterm measure to verify whether banks have enough liquidity to meet expected future outflows within  a  30day  period  (McNamara  et  al.  2014).  In  particular  the  aim  of  the  LCR  is  to guarantee that banks own sufficient highquality liquidity assets (HQLA) to survive a 30day  12  stress scenario and the timeline established by the BCBS imposed on banks to achieve a LCR of 60% by January 12015 and a LCR of 100% by January 1 2019. During the financial crisis banks were forced to reduce their excessive balance sheet leverage and  this  caused  additional  downward  pressure  on  asset  prices  and  contraction  in  credit availability.  Hence  the  Basel  Committee  decided  to  introduce  a  simple  and  nonrisk  based leverage ratio to constrain the increase of leverage in the banking sector     avoiding deleveraging processes that can damage the financial system and the economy and reinforce the risk based requirements (BCBS2010b) Consequences of Basel III on the banking sector are the subject of many debates in the literature (Cosimano and Hakura 2011).  Some  authors  (Admati  et  al.  2011)  argued  that  higher  capital  requirements  can  generate significant  benefits  by  reducing  leverage  and  the  risk  of  bankruptcies  in  the  banking  sector. Increasing bank equity allows to limit systemic risk events because banks are required to fund themselves with more equity than they did before the financial crisis. In addition the authors demonstrate that the social costs of rising capital requirements are very small for large financial institutions. On the other side Arner et al. (2016) asserted that the greater rigidity of the new regulation has increased the compliance obligations of banks and modified their incentives and business structures.  Basel  III  has  also  reduced  the  capacity  of  banks  to  provide  lowvalue  loans  with  damages especially to SMEs or private individuals who usually choose new players or innovations to fund themselves.  Spinassou (2013) showed that the capital requirements imposed by Basel III reduce the credit supply  without  guaranteeing  an  improvement  in  the  financial  stability  and  that  the  higher leverage  ratio  introduced  since  2010  induces  banks  to  prefer  risky  projects  to  safe  ones. Cosimano and Hakura (2011) focused their analysis on the impact of new capital requirements of  Basel  III  on  the  behaviour  of  banks  in  developed  countries  from  20012009.  The  results suggested that the new standards determine higher loan rates and slower loan growth even if banks    reaction vary from one economy to another one considering the crosscountry variations in banks    net cost of raising equity and the elasticity of loan demand with respect to changes in loan rates.  Even though the main goal of Basel III was to defeat the weaknesses of the banking and the financial sectors banks reduced their activities since they were obliged to keep greater reserves and they are still considered by the public opinion as the real responsible for the financial crisis (Darolles 2016).  13  Financial  crisis  has  also  changed  the  public  perception  of  the  banking  system  (Arner  et  al. 2015). The authors underlined the effect of the financial crisis on the labour market focusing on two sets of individuals. Firstly many financial professionals either lost their jobs or were less  well  remunerated  after  the  financial  crisis  and  consequently  most  of  this  underutilized educated workforce has been admitted to the new industry of FinTech 3.0. On the other hand the  financial  crisis  has  indirectly  damaged  the  newer  generations  that  are  facing  many difficulties in the labour market even though their education and skills are in line with FinTech innovations.   Especially younger generation have lost their faith in banks since the financial players were not able  to  manage  their  risks  during  the  financial  crisis  and  they  avoided  the  bankruptcy  only thanks to significant injection of public money (Darolles 2016).  Finally several studies pointed out that the loss of confidence in financial institutions mainly on the part of European and American consumers is accompanied by a substantial increase in confidence  in  financial  services  provided  by  technological  institutions  (Fujitsu  2016).  This attitude  bolsters  the  acceptance  of  FinTech  innovations  especially  among  the  young  at  the expense of traditional providers of financial services.  1.2 The drivers of FinTech demand and supply factors After  analysing  the  historical  evolution  of  FinTech  we  focus  on  the  main  drivers  and determinants of this phenomenon to understand why it is exploding right now in the financial sector. Schindler (2017) adopted a demand and supply framework of financial innovation that is then applied to the definition of FinTech.   1.2.1 The supply side factors Starting  on  the  supply  side  supply  drivers  represent  what  leads  someone  to  provide  new products  or  services  to  the  financial  market;  in  this  category  we  can  find  continuous technological  progress regulatory  environment revolutionary innovations  and the macroeconomic landscape (Kerenyi and Molnar 2017).  As analysed above technology has always played a key role in the evolution of the financial sector ATMs Internet efinance online banking and mobile payments have been important technology advances representing a great breakthrough in the financial innovation. Technological innovations could have material impacts on the structure of the financial system in  terms  of  concentration  contestability  and  composition  (FSB  2017).  A  decrease  in concentrations is generally associated with greater competition lower market power of players  14  and  lower  prices;  technology  reduces  concentration  when  it  allows  new  or  nontraditional service providers to compete with incumbents and to offer goods or services that overcome the existing regulation. Considering contestability technology may reduce costs for new entrants  and facilitate their access  to  technology. However the consequence is the reduction of the incumbents    pricing power. Finally technology may favour the unbundling of financial services leading to a change in the composition of service providers and to a great amount of activities that are not subject to the regulatory framework. Financial innovation is often driven also by regulation which comprises changes in regulatory and supervisory requirements.  As  underlined  above  the  causes  and  consequences  of  the  2008  financial  crisis  induced regulators to improve the previous set of rules with a great impact on the business incentives of incumbents and new players (FBS 2017). By increasing the rigidity of the requirements for the banking sector banks reduced lowvalue loans and were forced to move away from shortterm funding (Schindler 2017).  Now banks must comply with  stricter  standards whose aim is  to protect the financial intermediary system and the consumers from another financial meltdown (Kerenyi and Molnar 2017). Since the new regulation damaged the ability of banks to meet the needs of all types of customers this favoured the emergence of new financial players that took the place of incumbents in providing financial products and services to clients and businesses.  In many cases an innovation creates in turn another innovation which trigger an    innovation spiral    leading to a natural sequence of innovations (Schindler 2017). In this sense innovation can be interpreted as a supply factor because it allows the emergence of another innovation.  Innovation  can  be  revolutionary  when  it  transforms  the  market  conditions  and  features  in  a radical way (Kerenyi and Molnar 2017). Considering the FinTech sector the distributed ledger technology  (DLT)  is  an  example  of  disruptive  innovation  that  deeply  modifies  payment clearing and settlement (PCS) processes (Mills et al. 2016). DTLs allow their users to collect and access information relating to a given set of assets and their holders in a shared database which can be used to settle the transfers of securities and cash without the need of a central ledger or authority (Pinna and Ruttenberg 2016). This technology executes a large number of realtime transactions rapidly reducing the operating costs of payments and especially crossborder money transfers (Kerenyi and Molnar 2017). Financial  innovation  is  usually  driven  by  changes  in  the  financial  and  macroeconomic landscape  (Schindler  2017).  The  author  stated  that  the  collapse  of  the  American  housing market on the eve of the crisis caused a significant rise in the quantity of real estate owned by  15  banks and financial institutions; this situation encouraged many financial players to securitize the rental income from the real estate they owned. This led to an important innovation in the financial  sector  since  it  would  be  more  difficult  for  financial  institutions  to  create  such  a product without the collapse of the housing market which left them with lots of real estate.  Considering the macroeconomic landscape the increase in the number of FinTech players has been favoured also by the low interest rate environment caused by the international financial crisis  (Kerenyi  and  Molnar  2017).  After  the  financial  meltdown  the  result  was  the implementation of an active monetary police with a cut in interest rates and the introduction of quantitative easing measures. Although the stricter and riskaverse regulation introduced after the 2008 crisis reduced the instability of the financial system in several countries especially in Europe it has become more difficult to fund and support innovations and initiatives; therefore the  innovations  that  characterize  FinTech  often  come  from  new  market  players  (startups technology companies) which are not subject to that regulation (Zilgalvis 2014).  1.2.2 The demand side factors Considering  the  demand  side  financial  players  can  create  and  offer  lots  of  products  and services but there is a necessary condition for their success there should be a sufficient market demand for these products.  Consumer  habits  and  preferences  are  the  first  demand  driver  for  financial  innovation. Consumers     and  companies     habits  have  changed  with  the  evolution  of  technology  and  the penetration  of  Internet  not  only  in  their  everyday  life  but  also  in  how  banks  conduct  their activities  (Kerenyi  and  Molnar  2016).  Customers  are  now  looking  for  more  convenient tailored and faster financial solutions than in the past and they expect an immediate access to financial services that are in line with the rest of their online activities (Wilkins 2016).  The customer base of FinTech services is composed mainly by younger generations that have developed  different  habits  from  their  elders.  Younger  people  require  personalised  solutions that are in strong contrast with the traditional approach of banks and other financial institutions which are prone to offer products for the mass market (Darolles 2016).  In addition younger generations are more comfortable in using latest technologies and for this reason they represent the targeted customers of FinTech companies. Despite the success of FinTech solutions among youngers  financial  incumbents  are  aware  that  they  should  satisfy  their  demand  with  more innovative and interactive products and services (Schindler2017).  Besides demographics Schindler recognized that regulation acts both as supply factor and as demand driver since it can contribute to demand for new products and services. To prove this hypothesis the author focused on the liquidity coverage ratio (LCR) which requires banks to  16  hold an adequate stock of highquality liquidity assets (HQLA) to meet  their liquidity needs within a 30day period (BCBS 2013). So if a bank has issued a bond or another instrument that is coming due within 30 days the bank must hold HQLAs to cover the impending outflow. From  the  author   s  perspective  this  creates  demand  for  products  that  do  not  lead  to  the implementation of the LCR; one of these products is the callable commercial paper.  A commercial paper typically includes shortterm promissory notes issued by corporations or other issuers to fund future operations. In case of commercial papers banks provide backup liquidity  facilities  to  the  issuers  which  can  drown  upon  them  to  repay  a  maturing  issue  of commercial paper if the issuers are not able to sell a new issue of commercial paper to do so (a process called    rolling over   ). If the issuer draws upon the backup facility during the 30day period of LCR the new regulation introduced by Basel III imposes on the facility provider to maintain corresponding HQLA. The consequence of LCR is an increase in the cost to banks of providing backup liquidity facilities for commercial papers that mature in 30 days or less. To avoid  such  draws  occurring  within  the  30day  LCR  window  banks  developed  commercial papers that include a call provision allowing issuers to redeem the commercial paper before the start of the 30day period. Therefore if a commercial paper is redeemed before it reaches its maturity (30 days) then the issuer of the commercial paper cannot draw upon the liquidity facilities within 30 days and consequently banks do not need to maintain any HQLA in support of the facility (McNamara et al. 2014). In  this  case  the  regulation  (Basel  III)  that  introduced  the  LCR  created  demand  for  a  new product (on the part of issuers of commercial paper) and induced someone (banks) to supply the new product.   1.2.3 The emergence of fintech companies In the first part of this paragraph we analysed the main drivers of the FinTech phenomenon considering demand and supply side even if many studies also focus on factors which favoured the emergence of fintech companies.  Haddad and Hornuf (2018) examined the main economic and technological determinants that explain  the  formation  and  the  success  of  fintech  startups  which  are  categorized  into  nine different  types  those  that  operate  in  financing  payment  asset  management  insurance (insurtechs) loyalty programs risk management exchanges regulatory technology (regtech) and other business activities. The study focuses on fintech startups formation in 55 countries between 2006 and 2014 and it is based on four main hypotheses. First the authors supposed that welldeveloped economies and capital markets facilitate the formation of fintech startups. Indeed these startups need enough financing to start and carry on their business models and  17  so if the traditional capital markets are welldeveloped entrepreneurs have better access to the necessary resources to fund their businesses. In addition in more advanced economies it   s more likely  that  individuals  require  innovative  services  and  new  financial  tools  especially  within large  financial  markets  which  offer  greater  possibilities  of  changes  through  innovation  and digitalization. A second driver is the availability of the latest technology in the economy. As already analysed for  the  FinTech  phenomenon  technological  advances  are  a  fundamental  prerequisite  to introduce new solutions and to disrupt the traditional financial sector. Fintech companies need technological  innovations  to  satisfy  new  customers     needs  by  implementing  faster  payment systems and offering easier operations to improve the sharing of information and to reduce the costs of banking transactions. To encourage the supply of fintech solutions latest technologies need to be accompanied by a supporting infrastructure that should be already available in the economy of the country. The third factor of Fintechs formation  relates to  the nature of the financial sector. The 2008 financial crisis played a key role in the sudden upsurge of fintech startups for several reasons.  The lack of trust  in  banks after the crisis  benefitted  FinTechs  which interrupted the vicious circle of distrust and reduced financial soundness.  The  financial  meltdown  also  increased  the  cost  of  debt  for  many  SMEs  and  in  many  cases banks  stopped  lending  money  to  businesses  while  many  FinTech  startups  in  the  area  of crowdlending and crowdfunding were able to fill this gap. Therefore the demand for FinTech services should be higher in countries which were more strongly hit by the financial crisis and where the banking sector is less sound.  Lastly  the  authors  considered  the  role  of  credit  labour  market  and  regulation  in  FinTechs formation. The authors observed that economies should adopt a supportive regulatory regime to attract entrepreneurs and to promote the emergence of startups. Furthermore individuals are more prone to establish a new business if there are no significant restrictions on how the credit is supplied to the private sector and no controls on interest rates that interfere with the credit market.  The authors also tried to understand how the features of the labour market can affect FinTech startups. First an economy should allow market forces to determine wages and conditions so that startups can find talented individual and to easily hire and fire employees. Indeed large bureaucratic  costs  and  complicated  administrative  requirements  might  prevent  any  new business activity.  Following  the  report  by  Ernst&Young  (2016)  the  Fintech  ecosystem  is  based  on  many attributes among which there are talent and entrepreneurial availability. A country with a large  18  workforce  of  skilled  talent  has  a  more  positive  influence  on  the  emergence  of  FinTech companies.  Analysing all these aspects the authors concluded that FinTech startups are more frequent in countries and regions with a more supportive regulation and a larger labour market. Despite the great success of FinTech startups they are not the only ones that operate in the FinTech sector. (Kerenyi and Molnar 2017). Indeed in the recent years many large nonbank companies have started offering financial services that once were a prerogative of traditional financial  institutions.  Technology  companies  have  become  the  most  successful  FinTech companies  since  they  can  overcome  entry  barriers  to  the  banking  market  thanks  to  their features they have a large customer base the adequate IT infrastructure and a solid reputation. Although  most  of  technology  companies  provide  their  existing  customers  with  online  and mobile payment systems (for example Google Wallet Apple Pay and Amazon Payment) some of them takes part also in lending activities.   1.3 Opportunities and challenges of FinTech FinTech is a very complex movement that includes both technological innovations applied to financial services and fintech companies that provide innovative financial services. Considering the  double  nature  of  FinTech  we  will  examine  benefits  and  challenges  of  both  the  general phenomenon and companies operating in the FinTech sector since both have the potential to reshape and at the same to disrupt the existing financial sector.   1.3.1 Benefits of FinTech in the financial industry Financial  innovations  arise  as  solutions  to  market  inefficiencies  or  imperfections  and  they provide benefits by improving at least one inefficiency (Henderson and Pearson 2009). Starting from the upsides FinTech seeks to globalize simple financial services by improving financial  inclusion  especially  in  developing  and  emerging  countries  where  the  financial services are not yet widespread. To increase financial inclusion FinTech offers simple financial products and services thanks to new instruments and technologies.  With respect to traditional incumbents which generally adopt a mass market approach FinTech may entail benefits for customers through improved quality and user experience more tailored products easier access to financial services and cheaper financial solutions (EBA 2017). By utilizing  big  data  FinTech  analyses  individual  customers  preferences  and  so  it  offers personalised  tools  and  solutions  (Nakaso  2016).  Indeed  FinTech  companies  pay  more attention to customers    specific needs and attitudes because the final decision is up to clients  19  that  are  looking  for  interactive  and  flexible  services  according  to  their  wants  (Ozaee  and Sohrabi 2017). FinTech can generate efficiencies also for credit and other financial institutions cost reduction faster provision of services increases in customers number thank to greater financial inclusion and lower regulatory compliance costs (EBA2017). FinTech companies decrease banking costs due to bricks and mortar branches complex procedures and severe industry regulations since FinTech  disrupters  are  not  constrained  by  rigid  regulations  legacy  IT  systems  or  branch networks like traditional financial players are. (Ozaee and Sohrabi 2017).  Moreover  FinTech companies  can meet  mainly  SMEs loan applications that in many  cases banks are obliged to refuse because of stricter standards imposed after the 2008 financial crisis. This  is  possible  as  most  of  FinTech  lending  companies  use  alternative  data  and  ways  of assessing  credit  risk  by  increasing  credit  availability  for  consumers  (smaller  younger  less profitable  and  minorityowned  businesses)  that  previously  were  underserved  (Jagtiani  and Lemieux  2017).  Some  FinTech  lenders  have  developed  their  own  algorithms  and  online lending platforms which include nonconventional information (sales data shipping data cash flow  analysis  from  business  checking  accounts)  to  evaluate  the  credit  risk  of  the  borrowers. FinTech lenders have access to nontraditional information which are not used or not available to  traditional  bank  lenders  such  as  FICO  scores  (which  estimates  the  credit  worthiness considering payment history current level of indebtedness types of credit used length of credit history and new credit accounts) and DTI (debttoincome) ratios.   All these innovations favour a more stable credit landscape and allow FinTech firms to avoid two basic risks of banking activities mismatched maturities and leverage (Ozaee and Sohrabi 2017).  Indeed  banks  act  as  financial  intermediaries  they  take  deposits  provide  loans  to borrowers and liquidity to depositors (fractionalreserve banking) even if these functions may cause  bank  run  which  sometimes  triggered  crisis  in  the  past  (Nakaso  2016).  FinTech companies  do  not  accept  deposits  in  case  of  online  lending  platforms  they  simply  match borrowers and savers directly. In  a  broader  sense  FinTech  can  benefit  the  financial  industry  through  the  provision  of  new services  and  business  models  the  rise  in  market  transparency  and  improvements  in  the efficiency of information exchange (EBA 2017).  In  conclusion  FinTech  revolution  has  significantly  modified  the  financial  industry  and  the activities  of  traditional  financial  players  (i)  it    has  transformed  business  models  financial intermediation and customer access to new solutions; (ii) it provides new financial products and services with a higher level of personalization thanks to the application of big data analytics;  20  (iii)  FinTech  companies  substituted  some  of  traditional  banks     activities  and  deliver  their services through new and more attractive nonbanking channels (Gomber et al. 2018).  1.3.2 Risks and challenges of FinTech in the financial industry  Despite the benefits of FinTech innovations they also bring new issues regarding payment and settlement (Nakaso 2016).  Firstly FinTech may introduce significant changes in the structure of  settlement  and  other  financial  services.  As  already  mentioned  DLT  is  one  of  the  most revolutionary innovation introduced by FinTech and its emergence can significantly affect the traditional  settlement  structure  based  on  centralized  bookkeepers  since  DLT  promotes    decentralizationoriented     technologies.  Increasing  automation  could  guarantee  greater efficiency and certainty but at the same time it could increase financial volatility which may be only shortterm or create procyclical dynamics (Wilkins 2016). The digital transformation of finance has increased the potential for cyberattacks as most of innovations  are  founded  on  digitisation  interconnected  IT  systems  and  the  sharing  of  data across  a  wider  set  of  parties  (EBA2017).  FinTech  technologies  and  networks  are  becoming accessible  especially  through  open  gateways  such  as  internet  and  smartphones  and  this increases  the  need  to  strengthen  appropriate  measures  against  cyber  threats  (Nakaso  2016). Therefore  if  cybersecurity  systems  are  hacked  there  will  rise  operational  legal  and reputational issues and financial losses for institutions and this may weaken longterm trust in new solutions leading to lower adoption rates (EBA2017).  At worst there might be a wave of coordinated attacks causing a liquidity squeeze in the financial market and threatening the solvency  of  financial  players  (Darolles  2016).  The  FinTech  process  has  made  the  financial industry more vulnerable to attacks and cybersecurity is the clearest example of how FinTech needs a regulation (Arner et al. 2016). FinTech  initiatives  have  generated  important  challenges  regarding  regulation  and  traditional financial players    behaviour relative to technology adoption (Nicoletti 2017). Although we are going to discuss the relationship between FinTech and regulation in next pages we have already underlined  that  many  FinTech  activities  and  companies  emerge  and  operate  outside  the traditional regulatory framework. On the one side this favours more flexibility greater speed and lower compliance costs for FinTechs; on the other side it makes more difficult for regulators to monitor these activities and there is a lower level of coordination among financial services FinTech companies and regulatory officials (Nicoletti 2017).  The evolution of FinTech has created some challenges for traditional financial players. Relative to  the  digital  transformation  promoted  by  FinTech  evolution  incumbents  have  only  few possible strategic solutions to compete with newcomers (Darolles 2016). FinTech companies  21  have a competitive advantage thanks to the adoption of innovations while financial players try to  be  fast  adopters  (Merler  2017)  by  expanding  the  technical  skills  of  their  IT  teams  and encouraging their staff to adopt new working methods and procedures. This might also imply the purchase of financial products and services from FinTech firms or directly the acquisition of FinTech startups even if this last solution is rare. Traditional financial players seem to be hostile to merge a new entity with their existing infrastructures although the acquisition could bring important advantages to traditional incumbents. Another solution is the collaboration with FinTech companies to develop new services and to move traditional client relationships towards a more interactive and tailored system (Darolles 2016). The collaboration may benefit both FinTech companies and traditional financial players; indeed to sell their services FinTechs need partners who know how to operate in the financial industry and incumbents in turn can provide their products to third parties in unbranded forms. This solution is adopted by traditional financial players to create ties with FinTechs and exploit their distribution channels and customer base. In this new model incumbents operate as product design platforms selling unbranded solutions to FinTechs and so becoming more capable  of satisfying changes in users    needs. The only risk with this model is that FinTech companies which have a direct relationship with clients might bypass the platform supplying the financial products. Despite risks and challenges the lack of FinTech innovation would lead to a risk of technology complacency  and  obsolescence  relative  to  other  countries  (Nicoletti  2017).  Without technological  advances  financial  institutions  might  lose  their  competitive  advantage  and therefore  their  financial  environment  might  become  noncompetitive  in  the  global  financial market.   Some authors try to investigate the effects of FinTech also in relation to the real economy in terms of economic growth GDP per capita and industry volatility.  Beck et al. (2014) assessed the relationship between financial innovation and economic growth and volatility. Analysing a set of 32 countries over the last decade the authors found that (i) a higher financial innovation leads to stronger growth opportunities for a country and to a higher GDP per capita growth; (ii) a higher financial innovation is associated with higher growth of industries  that  rely  more  on  external  financing;  (iii)  a  higher  level  of  financial  innovation causes higher growth volatility among industries which rely more on external funding. In addition the authors underlined that the relationship between financial innovation and real economy also depends on the features of the market environment the financial structure and the regulatory framework. For example the positive effect might be stronger in marketbased  22  financial systems than in banksbased financial systems. Indeed the first ones are more prone to  stimulate  financial  innovation  completing  financial  markets  and  exacerbating  negative effects;  the  second  ones  are  more  focus  on  the  innovation  in  the  retail  sector  improving customers     experience  through  new  products  and  services.  Concerning  the  regulatory framework we have already discussed the consequences that the tightening of bank regulation after  2008  had  on  the  evolution  of  financial  innovation.  On  the  one  hand  more  restrictive requirements increased banks    difficulties and limited the possibilities to innovate; on the other hand  they  facilitated  the  success  of  FinTech  solutions  giving  banks  more  incentives  to innovate in their turn.  The results of this study confirmed that there are both    bright    and    dark    sides to financial innovation since it encourages a stronger economic development but at the same time it turns out into higher volatility in industries which benefit more from financial innovation. Since  finance  has  a  strong  connection  with  economy  the  positive  effects  of  FinTech  on  the financial industry also spread to the real economy sector (Nakaso 2016). FinTech innovations stimulate and improve financial inclusion which in its turn has a positive impact on economy; if people have access to new financial services they have the opportunity to expand innovative businesses such as ecommerce and elearning which in developing countries are hindered by the  limited  access  to  payment  services.  Therefore  FinTech  contributes  to  economic development with new financial services and opportunities even if in developed countries it is more difficult to quantitatively assess the impacts of FinTech on the economy because of the high level of technological innovation.  1.3.3 FinTech and financial stability FinTech  might  have  significant  implications  in  the  financial  industry  in  terms  of  financial stability.  As underlined by the Financial Stability Board (FSB) FinTech can either support or undermine financial stability; indeed innovations could guarantee a more efficient provision of financial services and a reduction in financial frictions but at the same time they could intensify existing difficulties or introduce new ones. The main benefits to financial stability first include decentralisation and diversification which can  curb  the  consequences  of  financial  meltdowns  in  some  circumstances.  Specially  in developing countries financial market diversity is a necessary condition for financial stability; indeed the failure of a single financial institution has a weaker influence on the market since there  would  be  other  providers  of  the  same  financial  services.  Efficiency  in  operations  also provides  support  to  financial  stability  since  it  favours  stable  business  models  of  financial  23  institutions and creates advantages in terms of overall efficiency in the financial system and the real economy. A  third  factor  that  contribute  to  a  greater  financial  stability  is  transparency  as  it  reduces information asymmetries and it allows to assess and price risks more accurately. Securitisations are an example of modern financial innovation; the opacity of securitisations was considered by many scholars as one of the main issues which led to the 2008 financial crisis by generating severe agency problems in loan underwriting screening and monitoring. To reduce the opacity both the EU and the US adopted new regulations that impose more assetlevel transparency for many  types  of  assetbacked  securities.  Ertan  et  al.  (2016)  demonstrated  that  new  standards especially  in  Europe  have  encouraged  securitized  loans  of  better  quality  in  terms  of  lower default probability lower delinquent amount and lower losses upon default.  Moreover  transparency  stimulates  the  creation  of  financial  instruments  with  exposure  to specific risks completing markets and increasing market participants    ability to manage risk. The  last  benefit  of  FinTech  to  financial  stability  is  represented  by  the  access  to  and  the convenience of financial services. We have already discussed that for example FinTech credit increases  the  availability  of  credit  mainly  for  households  and  SMEs  who  are  generally underserved by traditional financial players. Besides the access to financial services FinTech innovation also improves financial inclusion by providing new technologies and instruments. Therefore access to and convenience of financial services are two fundamental conditions for supporting  sustainable  economic  growth  and  providing  a  diversification  of  exposure  to investment risk. The FSB also analyses the factors that could undermine the financial stability separating microfinancial risks and macrofinancial risks. Microfinancial risks are those that make individual firms financial market institutions or sectors particularly vulnerable to shocks and they include both  financial  sources  and  operational  sources.  Examples  of  financial  sources  are  maturity mismatch  liquidity  mismatch  and  leverage  which  expose  the  counterpart  to  losses. Operational  sources  refer  to  (i)  governance  or  process  control  issues  which  can  lead  to  a disruption in the provision of financial services or critical infrastructures; (ii) cyber risks which can  damage  the  protection  of  data  and  the  integrity  of  systems  causing  financial  losses  for institutions; (iii)  legal and regulatory risks which can negatively affect the confidence in the system leading to reputational issues. Macrofinancial risks refer to weaknesses which could amplify shocks to the financial system and consequently impair the financial stability. Potential risks include (i) contagion which is the possibility that a distress suffered by a single financial institution or sector could influence other institutions or sectors in the financial market causing a decrease in confidence in those  24  institutions  or  sectors;  (ii)  procyclicality  which  refers  to  the  natural  tendency  of  financial variable to fluctuate around a trend during the economic cycle (Landau 2009) and which can threaten financial stability  when market participants    actions exacerbate the degree and impact of fluctuations in economic growth and market prices over longer terms; (iii) excess volatility arising when the financial system overreacts to news causing solvency or liquidity problems which can impair the functioning of asset and credit markets especially in case of homogeneity of  business  models;  (iv)  systemic  importance  entities  that  are  considered  too  important  and    too big to fail    may lead to moral hazard because they generally operate outside the current regulatory  perimeter  and  they  never  take  on  banklike  risks  (maturity  transformation  and leverage). In addition they may compromise the competition with other service providers since they are considered systemically important for the financial industry (Wilkins 2016).  1.3.4 Implications of FinTech credit on financial stability In this paper we define as FinTech credit all credit activities facilitated by electronic online platforms which match borrowers and savers directly and process a large amounts of customer information (BIS 2017).  Since FinTech credit activity plays an important role and has generated significant interest in financial markets the FSB also analyses the effects of FinTech credit on financial stability.  The FinTech credit activity has grown fast over the last years even if it follows different paths across different jurisdictions (Claessens et al. 2018). China is the largest market (considering data referred to 2016) followed by United States and United Kingdom at a distance. After the rapid growth in 20132016 the evolution of FinTech credit suffered a slowdown in many major jurisdictions; even though FinTech credit markets have experienced a rapid expansion in recent years their size remains small relative to credit provided by traditional financial intermediaries (BIS2017).  The actual small size of FinTech credit limits its direct influence on financial stability; however if this sector were supposed to increase it would bring both benefits and risks for the financial stability (Merler 2017). The most important advantage of FinTech credit is the improvement in financial inclusion which allows investors to obtain alternative products and borrowers with limited access to bankintermediated credit to receive the necessary funding. FinTech may also reduce transaction costs including search costs and costs incurred during loan origination and maintenance processes thanks to the digitalisation of lending process and the introduction of new lending technologies. The decrease in transaction costs could lead to lower lending costs and better riskadjusted returns for investors; however it is fundamental to assess whether FinTech lenders are able to transform lower lending costs in advantages for their borrowers in  25  terms of lower prices (Jagtiani and Lemieux 2017). Indeed Philippon (2017) found that the unit cost of financial intermediation has declined only marginally after the 2008 crisis despite the significant evolution of FinTech. The creation of innovative lending platforms may also encourage the diversification of credit sources in the economy as they provide alternative solutions that are more suitable for smaller firms and final consumers. The greater diversity in credit provision can benefit the traditional banking sector in specific circumstances where FinTech credit platforms act as    spare tyre    for lending in the economy. In fact FinTech offers new options and solutions through which credit can flow to other parts of the economy if traditional lending is not available. In this sense FinTech credit increases the efficiency of incumbents (Merler 2017) and in some jurisdictions governments use FinTech credit platforms to stimulate credit markets after a banking crisis (BIS 2017).  At the same time many advantages of FinTech are linked to potential risks. FinTech increases accessibility to credit for many categories of customers but with the threat of a deterioration in lending standards. Sahay et al. (2015) identified a bellshaped relationship between credit inclusion and banks    stability. In countries with weaker bank supervision the negative effect of greater credit access on bank buffers is more pronounced while in countries with high levels of supervisory quality credit inclusion is positively associated with higher bank buffers. So the authors concluded that the impact of a broadening credit access on bank stability depends on the quality of the supervision and they underlined the need for strong supervision to improve financial inclusion through credit. FinTech credit may also lead to more procyclical credit provision like a reduction in lending conditions during an economic upswing and a pullback in credit in case of financial distress. A significant pullback of FinTech credit generates a systemic risk concerning the availability of substitute forms of credit either through other online lending platforms or traditional financial intermediaries. Considering the small size of FinTech credit in most of countries it is difficult for borrowers to find alternative FinTech credit platforms quickly and for this reason barriers to existing platforms offering different types of lending are not high. Traditional financial intermediaries rarely supply credit to certain borrowers such as very small or selfemployed businesses. Therefore it is unlikely that FinTech lending will be promptly replaced from solutions outside the FinTech credit industry. Moreover FinTech lending companies are more prone to help investors with herd behaviour and more volatile credit risk appetite even if FinTech lending platforms may be more  26  exposed than banks to some microfinancial risks due to their greater use of untested and digital processes. Financial stability could also be undermined by the securitisation of FinTech credit obligations into large pools. This process allows borrowers to obtain funding from different classes of institutional investors and FinTech investments to be actively traded; however an increased use of securitisation may cause some financial stability risks. Firstly this process rises the connection between FinTech platforms traditional banks and capital markets. Therefore the continuous expansion of FinTech credit market can generate new channels through which risks in the FinTech credit sector are transmitted to the wider financial system and vice versa.  Secondly securitisations of FinTech credit obligations can bring to greater opacity in the overall market due to the bundling and tranching of loans obligations. Indeed many FinTech credit activities have emerged outside the regulatory perimeter with consequent difficulties for authorities in monitoring and managing.   1.4 Regulation of FinTech One  of  the  main  issues  concerning  FinTech  evolution  is  connected  to  the  regulation  of  this recent  phenomenon.  The  2008  global  financial  crisis  induced  regulators  to  strengthen  the existing rules and to introduce new requirements especially in the financial and banking sectors favouring the evolution of FinTech activities and companies.  FinTech  generally  emerges  and  operates  outside  the  regulatory  perimeter  and  the  nontraditional products and services offered by FinTech companies may not observe the traditional financial regulation (Arner et al. 2016). For this reason it becomes more difficult for regulators to monitor and evaluate FinTech activities.  1.4.1 Difficulties in regulating FinTech Regulators     objectives  about  financial  industry  are  financial  stability  prudential  regulation conduct  and  fairness  competition  and  market  development  (Arner  et  al.  2016).  Before elaborating a suitable regulation supervisors need to analyse the benefits and the applicability of a technology. The introduction of a new technology as FinTech does not always imply that it will be widely adopted and so that it will be subject to new rules. Since FinTech emerging players  are  growing  fast  and  they  are  threatening  traditional  incumbents  regulators  need  to intervene by adjusting their methods and rules to best support FinTech. Considering the significant changes in financial and banking sectors over the last decades there are  two  main  risks  that  regulators  need  to  avoid  (Darolles  2016).  First  regulators  should  27  prevent  overprotecting  incumbents  creating  high  entry  barriers  for  newcomers.  Indeed  an excessive regulation can stifle financial innovation and competition. Regulators also need to favour  new  FinTech  players  with  a  less  rigid  regulation  than  incumbents.  With  respect  to traditional financial players newcomers are generally not constrained by severe requirements and rules introduced after the 2008 global financial crisis even if this may cause the lack of information protection and so issues of security. Regulators    decisions have both a direct and an indirect influence on the competition between incumbents and new players in the financial market; the main goal of the regulatory framework is to guarantee parity for all financial agents and  at  the  same  time  to  promote  an  innovative  competitive  and  secure  financial  market. Regulation  should  guarantee  equal  treatment  and  competition  among  all  players  for  the soundness of the financial industry. Moreover rulesetters also need to focus on the incentives offered to market agents and how these can influence the behaviour and the decisions of players. Darolles (2016) suggested creating a harmonised set of rules and avoiding different regulations for different categories of players since this would break up the financial market and interfere with the emergence of new players and with the evolution of financial innovation. FinTech innovation brings both benefits and challenges for the financial market but its interests are  not  always  in  line  with  the  longterm  goals  of  regulators  (Philippon  2017).  FinTech companies generally enter the market where their activities can be profitable although there are many sectors where the incumbents    presence is deepseated and so entry is difficult. In these cases the aim of the regulation is to actively encourage entry and to guarantee level playing field among traditional and new financial players. Nevertheless in real markets the argument of level playing field elaborated by Darolles (2016) as a fundamental goal for regulators does not apply due to main biases of the financial sector. The principle of level playing field is not coherent when incumbents are    toobigto fail    and it applies only when newcomers carry out the  same  activities  of  traditional  players  but  with  more  efficiency  or  at  lower  costs (Philippon2017).  For regulators it is a challenge to find a right regulation framework for new FinTech activities as the financial industry includes both incumbents and newcomers and it should be dynamic fitting  to  continuous  changes  in  the  size  and  activity  of  businesses  (Arner  et  al.  2016).  For FinTech startups regulation may be too expensive (compliance costs licence applications) and incompatible with their lean business models. For emerging new players it would be better to apply a principlebased regulatory regime which includes more flexible compliance obligations with  respect  to  a  rulebased  regime.  Both  regimes  have  advantages  and  disadvantages  for FinTech companies. A principlebased regime guarantees more flexibility especially for earlystage firms but at the same time it creates uncertainty in terms of compliance and limitations  28  in terms of scalability for a more mature business. A rulebased regime clearly defines rules and processes giving right incentives to the supervised entity but it leads to higher compliance costs and greater complexity. A suitable option for FinTech startups might be a combination of  both  regimes  since  the  principlebased  system  allows  companies  to  be  more  flexible  and dynamic while the rulebased one makes FinTechs more attractive to investors and creates a barrier to entry for subsequent new competitors. Regulators face a difficult task in finding a balance between incumbents    interests and the need to control the emergence of new financial players (Darolles 2016). On the one hand authorities tend to impose stricter and tighter rules on existing players since they know their businesses and goals. On the other hand they tend to be more lenient with market entrants which conduct new  activities  and  provide  new  services  whose  risks  are  still  not  fully  understood.  A  right regulation  should  permit  incumbents  to  survive  favour  financial  innovation  and  promote  a healthy competition and to reach these goals some authors suggests principles and guidelines for rulessetters. Darolles (2016) argued that regulation should encourage healthy competition among  players  whether  they  implement  new  technologies  or  offer  traditional  solutions  and remove all obstacles to growth for new entrants. Moreover the regulation framework should not make any difference among players but cover all them simultaneously regardless of their characteristics or activities (principle of level playing field). Lastly the main aim of regulators should be the protection of users of the financial system which can continuously cause new and unexpected risks.  As FinTech involves risks and challenges regulators need to  focus on the downsides of this phenomenon defending users of financial services and the stability of the financial system. As discussed above one of the main risks of FinTech is the increase in cyberattacks due to the greater  use  of  online  services  online  platforms  and  technologies.    For  regulators  the  main obstacle is the lack of historical cases and data about cyberrisks and so they do not know how to  evaluate and regulate these risks. The only solution  for authorities is  to identify plausible attack scenarios and test their consequences on FinTech businesses; regulators need to become expertise  of  this  field  to  fulfil  their  role.  Another  risk  that  regulators  need  to  face  is  the outsourcing  of  some  tasks  within  financial  transactions.  If  traditional  players  decide  to collaborate with FinTech players they generally offload some traditional activities or tasks onto external service providers especially in the case of jobs with a high technological content. In this way traditional financial players reduce cost pressures and FinTech companies are more efficient since they are better able to use new technologies. The issue is that the transaction is split  between  traditional  regulated  financial  players  and  FinTech  companies  that  are  not necessarily subject to specific requirements and this causes a breach in the supervision system.  29  Lastly authorities need to focus and supervise the use of Big Data Analytics that might bring to  negative  consequence  for  users  of  financial  services  (Nicoletti  2017).  Regulators  should guarantee that data collection do not damage the privacy of users and that personal information about customers is not used as a discriminatory tool.  1.4.2 The rise of RegTech Since  the  FinTech  process  has  introduced  significant  changes  in  the  financial  industry authorities  were  induced  to  combine  the  traditional  objectives  of  financial  stability  and consumer protection with the goals of growth and financial innovation (Arner et al. 2017). The outcome  is  a  process  of  regulatory  innovation  which  includes  technology  (   RegTech   )  and changes to existing regulatory frameworks such as the introduction of regulatory sandboxes. RegTech  is  the  contraction  of     regulation  technology     and  it  indicates  a  system  of  new technological applications (e.g. artificial intelligence machine learning and distributed ledgers) used to comply with a stricter and more complex regulation of the financial industry (Allen and Berg  2018).  RegTech  offers  a  continuous  monitoring  capacity  providing  close  to  realtime insights and it seeks to identify problems in advance rather than take measures after the fact (Arner et al. 2016).  The emergence of RegTech is attributable to (i) the complex fragmented and everevolving postcrisis financial regulatory regime which cause higher compliance and supervision costs for the regulators and the supervised entities; (ii) technological advances which can improve data management  and  analysis  such  as  new  cryptographic  technology  blockchain  robotics  and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs) (IIF 2016); (iii) the need of financial institutions to  reduce  compliance  costs  and  (iv)  the  goal  of  supervisors  to  strengthen  competition  and guarantee financial stability and market integrity.  RegTech  covers  three  complementary  groups  of  participants.  Firstly  financial  players  who apply  new  technologies  to  meet  new  requirements  and  standards  arising  from  postcrisis regulations.  Secondly  regulators  who  face  the  rapid  emergence  of  FinTech  companies  and technologies  and  so  need  to  use  RegTech  to  conform  with  new  challenges  and  tasks.  As mentioned above regulators have a double goal they need to protect users of financial services and  the  financial  stability  without  hindering  financial  development  and  innovation.  Lastly policymakers and regulators who need to create the necessary infrastructure to meet changes in the financial system and to support their new regulation. This implies an increasing use of and  reliance  on  RegTech  which  allows  financial  institutions  to  comply  with  rules  and authorities to understand innovative products and complex transactions.   30  Like FinTech RegTech offers both opportunities and risks. The application of new technologies to regulatory frameworks allows to reduce compliance costs to shorten bureaucratic procedures and to provide more flexibility and dynamism to FinTech companies. However RegTech often requires significant investments due to the use of new instruments and procedures. Moreover although RegTech contributes to increasing the efficiency of regulatory compliance this does not necessarily imply a reduction in the overall burden of regulation since compliance is only a small part of the red tape burden (Allen and Berg 2018). Lastly there is still uncertainty in the  market  about  the  usefulness  and  success  of  these  new  technologies  that  can  be  used  to reduce the complexity of rules but whose future evolution and development might be impeded by regulations. Another  novelty  in  the  regulation  of  FinTech  is  represented  by  regulatory  sandboxes  that enable  innovative  financial  players  to  check  the  feasibility  of  their  new  financial  products services and business models within a    test environment    with the exemption from regulatory obligations (F  ykiss et al. 2018). Sandboxes allow startups and incumbents to conduct the test under  real  market  circumstances  for  a  specific  time  and  involving  a  limited  number  of  real customers.  Companies that are admitted to  regulatory sandboxes need to  follow a specific procedure to satisfy  certain  conditions  for  getting  into  the  test.  Firstly  the  innovative  product  or  service presented  by  the  entity  should  have  an  element  of  novelty  for  the  consumers  and  clients; secondly  the  entity  should  meet  the  requirements  of  market  entry.  If  the  test  has  a  positive result then the innovation can enter the market.  Regulatory sandboxes are set up by authorities to promote competition and efficiencies through innovation and to improve the relationship between supervisors and financial services providers (Jenik  and  Lauer  2017).  Arner  et  al.  (2016)  underlined  that  the  main  market  objectives  for sandboxes  are  to  reduce  timetomarket  at  a  potentially  lower  costs  (FinTech  startups  can operate  without  complete  licensing  obligations)  provide  better  access  to  finance  and  foster more innovative products. Until now (at the end of 2017) the framework of regulatory sandbox is not widely applied yet. The first country introducing this innovation was United Kingdom in 2015 followed by about ten countries in  Asia and Middle East.  In Europe only the Netherlands and Switzerland are adopting specific and dedicated regulatory sandboxes even if at the European Union level more initiatives are evolving and focusing on FinTech challenges.     31    2. Implications of FinTech for banks and banking systems  In the first chapter of this work we described the main activities benefits and risks of FinTech phenomenon and FinTech companies. Our analysis shows that traditional banks are particularly threatened by FinTech which may cause the disaggregation of banks    value chain (Boot 2017). FinTech startups mainly focus on retail banking lending and payment systems (McKinsey & Co. 2016) and they have developed new technologies and instruments such as peertopeer lending  platforms  online  crowdfunding  markets  roboadvisors  and  machine  learning  tools which allow to understand and satisfy customers    needs for tailored cheaper and easier to use financial  solutions.  P2P  lending  platforms  provide  credits  without  bank  intermediation matching borrowers and lenders directly when customers and firms invest in small businesses (SMEs or younger businesses). These platforms reduce intermediation costs and evaluate the credit risk of borrowers applying algorithms and big data analytics and using nonconventional information about customers (Vives 2017). Payments are an important area of FinTech characterized by significant development even if banks  still  maintain  their  leader  position  (Boot  2017).  Traditional  payment  systems  may  be disrupted by digital currencies such as Bitcoin (Vives 2017). Digital currencies are generated using blockchain technology where transactions can be verified with blocks of records without any intermediary or banks    intermediary function. These systems facilitate the introduction of many potential costsaving innovations and they allow to generate new currencies without the backing of government or a trustworthy gobetween. Blockchain technology is considered as one  of  the  biggest  disruptions  in  the  financial  industry  since  it  increases  transparency  in transactions and provides mechanisms which protect customers    privacy (Bussmann 2017). Lastly  traditional  functions  of  banks  may  also  be  hampered  by  roboadvisors  and  machine learning tools which provide investment advice and avoid some of the usual conflicts of interest between  customers  and  human  advisors.  Roboadvice  is  a  FinTech  innovation  which  is challenging the traditional financial advisory services (Kaya 2017). Roboadvice offers online investment  guidance  and  portfolio  management  services  based  on  algorithms  and  models  to find  optimal  investment  strategies  for  clients.  Roboadvisors  are  fully  automated  online platforms that provide customers with digital finance advice and portfolio allocation.  Furthermore FinTech companies represent the major competitors of traditional banks because they do not have to comply with severe regulations as opposed to traditional incumbents who  32  must deal with stricter requirements (Bussmann 2017). So FinTechs operate with more agility and they face lower compliance costs and this enables them to offer cheaper and faster financial products. With respect to newcomers traditional banks are still trapped in a lot of red tape even if they strive to invest heavily in technology and use it more than in the past to compete with new entrants and survive in the new financial industry. Technological  innovations  have  a  double  effect  on  traditional  banks  on  the  one  hand incumbents adopt new technologies to cut costs improve the quality of their products and be more attentive to customers    needs; on the other hand innovation reduces traditional barriers to entry in the credit and financial services markets increasing the competition with FinTech companies which offer technologyintensive and lowcost solutions (Panetta 2018). Although  FinTech  startups  are  growing  fast  and  they  undermine  traditional  financial institutions  they  also  represent  an  opportunity  for  incumbents  and  mainly  for  banks  to revolutionize their business models and to offer more specific value propositions.  Indeed FinTechs and banks can benefit from a collaboration or partnership because both have valuable assets and capabilities to share (Juengerkes 2016). FinTechs are techdriven apply innovative technologies are not bound to legacy systems and provide personalised financial solutions. Banks have a larger customer base offer regulated products and services and add their industry expertise and know how.  There  are several  motives that induce banks and  FinTechs to  create an  alliance  (Klus  et al. 2018). Collaborating with an incumbent financial player allows FinTech companies to enlarge their customer base increase their financial knowledge improve trust and credibility and obtain access to a banking license which in some cases would be too expensive for a startup alone. On  the  other  hand  bank  might  outsource  some  activities  to  their  partners  gain  a  rapid innovation  thanks  to  FinTechs     technological  advances  and  secure  a  competitive  advantage since FinTech firms develop innovative ways to provide financial services.  Although the 2008 financial crisis undermined consumers    confidence in the banking industry and FinTech companies threat the functions and activities of the banking system banks are still considered a safe place for people investment and money (Boot 2017). In  conclusion  traditional  banks  adopt  new  technologies  and  innovations  to  compete  with fintech newcomers and to preserve financial stability despite the limits imposed by the severe regulation. FinTech startups may be a threat to the banking system since (i) they offer tailored financial services that meet customers preferences and needs; (ii) they provide more flexible and dynamic financial solutions thanks to the lighter regulation; (iii) they operate in the same market of traditional banks also reaching customers and businesses underserved by incumbents and (iv) they have taken over functions and activities previously assigned only to banks.  33   2.1 New FinTech instruments for the banking sector Although  FinTech  exacerbates  competition  in  the  financial  market  it  can  also  provide instruments and methods to banks to manage high costs and regulatory and market pressures which came up after the 2008 financial crisis (Bussmann 2017). We first seek to understand which FinTech innovations are more adopted and known by users which  are  not  only  final  customers  but  also  banks  and  other  financial  institution.  For  this purpose we refer to a study which analyses the FinTech adoption in Australia Canada Hong Kong Singapore the U.K. and the U.S. in 2015 (Gulamhuseinwala et al. 2015). The FinTech adoption  is  measured  through  the  EY  FinTech  Adoption  Index  considering  four  main categories savings and investments money transfers and payments borrowing and insurance. Money transfer and payments (online foreign exchange nonbanks to transfer money) have the highest  adoption  rate  (17.6%)  followed  by  savings  and  investments  (peertopeer  platforms equity or rewards crowdfunding online investment advice) insurance and borrowing (fintech lending online marketplace). Focusing on the relationship between FinTech and the traditional banks the most disruptive innovations  for  the  banking  sector  have  emerged  in  payments  lending  and  crowdbased financing as reported by McKinsey & Co. (2016). Since the aim of this work is to analyse the implication of FinTech for the banking system we decide to examine the main innovations in these sectors and we analyse whether they bring concrete benefits to banks or weaken their longhand position.   2.1.1 Payment systems Traditional  payment  systems  involve  many  agents  instruments  institutions  and  processes which generally imply high costs and great complexity. Changes technological advances and innovations  have  always  characterized  payment  systems  aiming  at  improving  the  nature  of processes in the customers    interest (Gomber et al. 2018).  The  current  payments  landscape  is  threatened  by  the  entry  of  nonbank  digital  players  the modernization  of  payments infrastructures the  reduction in  crossborder  payments inefficiencies and the digitization of retail banking transactions (McKinsey & Co. 2015). Nonbank digital players are entering the payment system increasing competition for banks taking away important customer relationships and reducing margins on domestic transactions while favouring electronic payments instead of cash and checks. Banks also need to conform to new products  digital  channels  and  technologies  introduced  by  nonbank  players  to  compete effectively with them and meet evolving customer needs. The entry of nonbank players affects  34  not only the domestic payments system but also crossborder payments. Until now banks have done  little  to  solve  the  inefficiencies  of  crossborder  payments  which  remain  expensive  for customers. FinTech instruments and players try to solve the limits  of crossborder payments such as lack of transparency and tracking and slow processing time moving from C2C to B2B crossborder  payments  systems.  Another  solution  to  reduce  costs  and  speed  up  crossborder payments  is  the use of blockchainbased cryptocurrencies such as  Bitcoin even if the price volatility of DLTbased instruments and the lack of trust in them could weaken their positive influence on the payment system (Gomber et al. 2018).  Finally  the  digital  revolution  in  consumer  payments  and  retail  banking  is  expanding  with important  changes  in  transaction  banking;  as  customers  and  individuals  are  getting  used  to faster and cheaper payments on the retail side they will look for similar services in transaction banking for their companies.  FinTech  innovations  in  the  payments  sector  especially  concern  cashless  solutions  (mobile payments integrated billing and streamlined payments) and nontraditional payment schemes (cryptocurrencies peertopeer transfers and mobile money) (WEF 2015). Cashless solutions guarantee  simplicity  interoperability  and  valueadded  services.  Firstly  they  facilitate customers     transactions  allowing  them  to  make  payments  in  a  single  tap.  Secondly  most  of innovative solutions are not limited to a single payment method but they allow customers to manage and use a variety of credit cards debit cards and bank accounts for payment. Lastly many  innovative  solutions  also  offer  valueadded  services  and  functionalities  in  addition  to payments  enabling  financial  institutions  to  create  closer  customers  relationships  and  deliver additional value.  As the traditional payment  systems  are built  on automated clearing houses and intermediary banks they cannot enable rapid and inexpensive money transfers especially between countries. For  this  reason  decentralised  and  nontraditional  payments  systems  provide  alternatives  to streamline  the  intermediating  processes.  Decentralised  systems  allow  users  to  move  money between  them  and  they  typically  rely  on  cryptography  rather  than  a  central  authority  as  in traditional  systems  (Ali  et  al.  2014).  The  payments  take  place  through  a  distributed  ledger technology (DLT) or blockchain in the form of cryptocurrencies. So decentralised solutions are  capable  of  near  realtime  settlements  reduce  transaction  costs  and  ensure  superior transparency and traceability of transactions.  Nontraditional payments systems such as mobile money and P2P transfer are based on a trusted nonfinancial third party to transfer value across users and geographies even in underbanked regions  (WEF  2015).  Mobile  money  is  a  network  that  enables  payments  across  users  via  a mobile  device  without  requiring  a  bank  account  or  a  well  establish  financial  infrastructure;  35  thanks to its features mobile money leverages mobile communications to reach unbanked and underbanked  individuals  in  developing  and  emerging  countries  (Bussmann  2017).  The  P2P transfer directly links the local accounts of both sender and recipient satisfying users    needs for speed payer control security and universality (Bradford and Keeton 2012). In nonbank P2P payment methods both the payer and the payee need to have an account with the intermediary to  make  and  receive  the  payment.  Furthermore  both  parties  need  to  indicate  a  source  from which the intermediary  account  and payments  can be funded  generally  a bank  account  or a payment card. Most of the time the payment is cleared and settled through a book transfer from the  intermediary  account  of  the  payer  to  the  one  of  the  payee  as  on  Amazon  and  PayPal platforms.  Nontraditional payments schemes enable very rapid and highly transparency transactions to both senders and recipients and they favour financial inclusion since they do not impose specific financial requirements to users.  WEF (2015) concluded that most payment innovations do not completely disrupt the existing payment processes but they can act as real competitors of banks since they focus on frontend processes to improve customers    experience and better satisfy their needs. Furthermore one of the main targets of FinTech has always been to exceed two of the greatest limitations of the traditional payments payment speed and service availability (BIS 2016). Innovative payment methods seek to guarantee the transmission of the payment and the availability of funds to the payee  in  real  time  or  nearreal  time  reducing  the  delays  in  the  clearing  and  settlement  of payments.  Lastly FinTech innovations in the payments system ensure transparent and automatic processes for customers and thanks to the use of mobile devices and like they have more opportunities to gather data and information about customers    preferences and attitudes; innovations with these advantages  can  threaten  traditional  payment  schemes  especially  credit  cards  (Bussmann 2017).   2.1.2 Deposit and lending functions in the fintech world Deposit and lending are other fundamental services provided by traditional retail banks that are facing a strong competition from FinTech innovations and companies (Bussmann 2017). The primary functions of a commercial bank are accepting deposits and granting loans and advances to  individuals  and  businesses  at  a  higher  rate  of  interest  than  allowed  by  banks  on  deposit accounts. Retail banks receive savings from their account holders and provide an interest on the savings in return. Then they use the saved funds to originate loans to borrowers and they receive a different interest rate in return (WEF 2015). Banks determine the availability of loans and  36  the interest  rates analysing the borrowers    risk profiles using  credit scores and consequently they identify riskaverse or riskseeking savers and lowrisk or highrisk borrowers. Borrowers are served depending on each bank   s risk appetite which is generally related to the size and the scale of the bank even if banks are potentially more prone to serve lowrisk borrowers and to accept deposits from riskaverse savers.   Although  deposit  and  lending  are  two  traditional  functions  of  incumbent  banks  FinTech innovations have reached this sector and they are gaining in popularity over the last decade. Loans issued by FinTech players represent one third of unsecured consumer loans volume in the US in 2016 and they are expected to grow at a 20% yearly rate over the next five years. The rapid development and success of alternative lending solutions have important consequences on the consumer lending market and especially on retail banking (Vallee and Zeng 2018).  Therefore we first  try to understand what  is  FinTech lending how new  players operate and what implications they will have for the banking industry. The FinTech lending sector differs from traditional banking environment since it does not imply buildings tellers and branches but at the same time it enables money flows from savers to borrowers as traditional commercial banks do (Odinet 2017). In the traditional banking lending banks act as intermediaries between depositors and borrowers. Indeed they lend money deposited by savers at the bank to borrowers and then they pay interests to customers on their deposits in return. Fintech lenders instead match directly borrowers and savers and they do not lend money themselves rather funds are provided by investors o by partnerbanks.  After  the  prescreening  of  loan  applications  by  lending  platforms  investors  screen  listed borrowers directly to decide whether or not to finance the loans (Vallee and Zeng 2018). The role of investors in fintech lending represents a radical change in the lending market since they conduct  activities  and  functions  that  are  traditionally  performed  by  banks.  In  addition  the authors  argued  that  informationally  sophisticated  investors  improve  lending  outcomes  by screening  listed  loans  using  information  provided  by  the  platform  while  less  sophisticated investors do not screen investing in an average loan passively if they can break even or not investing  at  all.  As  a  result  sophisticated  investors  outperform  less  sophisticated  ones increasing the volume of loans financed on the lending platforms. However the active role of investors  in  lending  platforms  generally  leads  to  an  endogenous  adverse  selection  problem which can impair the loans volume through both  a price effect and a quantity effect. On the price  side  as  sophisticated  investors  are  better  able  to  identify  and  finance  good  loans  less sophisticated investors may face an average loan with a lower quality. Hence less sophisticated investors may need a lower loan price to break even causing a lower prevailing loan price on the platform and a lower amount of loan applications in the first place. On the quantity side in  37  case of a too severe adverse selection less sophisticated investors may not break even and exit the  market  leading  to  lower  loans  volume.  To  solve  the  adverse  selection  problem  and maximize loans volume FinTech lending platforms focus on the prescreening intensity and on the information provision to investors. If the platform prescreening cost is initially high the platform will choose a low prescreening intensity but provides more information to lenders. This strategy encourages the participation of sophisticated investors increasing the volume of loans financed by them even if less sophisticated investors do not take part. If instead the prescreening cost is low platforms choose a high prescreening intensity so that less sophisticated investors are willing to invest. Platforms simultaneously provide less information to mitigate the  adverse  selection  problem  caused  by  more  sophisticated  investors.  Summing  up  in  this theoretical  model a platform prescreens a pool  of loan applications lists some loans on the platform and provides some information to investors to facilitate their screening and investing decisions.  Since  unsophisticated  investors  do  not  screen  they  are  always  uninformed  about individual loans    quality while sophisticated investors paying a cost for information become informed and identify good loans. Therefore sophisticated investors finance only good loans and outperform uninformed and unsophisticated investors which suffer the adverse selection imposed on them.  Given the role of investors in FinTech lending platforms FinTech lenders do not bear any credit risk and therefore they do not need to hold any capital reserves like traditional banks (Odinet 2017). As a result FinTech lenders can establish lower interest rates on their products and this feature attracts borrowers to choose fintech lending platforms instead of traditional financial institutions.  New  lenders  also  differ  from  banks  in  terms  of  income  and  methods  of underwriting. Unlike retail banks the income of FinTech players comes from commissions and fees  that  receive  from  the  origination  of  loans  or  from  their  distribution.  Lastly  besides traditional  methods  of  underwriting  (for  example  FICO  scores)  FinTech  lenders  apply mathematical  and  machine  learning  processes  to  define  the  creditworthiness  of  potential borrowers. FinTech lenders generally act as    direct funding lenders    or as    intermediary lenders    (Odinet 2017).  In  the  first  case  FinTech  lenders  (also  called     balancesheet  lenders   )  are  online companies that originate loans internally and provide them directly to borrowers. These lenders keep the loans on their books until the debt is retired and they generally obtain financial funds to make the loans from outside investors or from their own borrowed capital. FinTech lenders are intermediary lenders when they create a collaboration with a thirdparty financial institution. In  this  business  model  the  financial  institution  makes  the  loans  to  the  borrowers  but  all underwriting and processing of the application is done by the fintech lender which generally  38  acquires the loan after its origination. With this strategy the FinTech lenders do not bear any credit risk because they purchase the loans directly from the partneroriginating banks and they do  so  with  investors     capital.  Therefore  it  is  the  investors  who  bear  the  risk  that  the  online borrowers could default given their participation in the fintech platforms. Another  important  aspect  in  the  analysis  of  FinTech  lending  is  understanding  why  this phenomenon  has  come  up  over  the  last  decade  and  what  factors  drove  its  successful development. When after the 2008 financial crisis traditional lenders pulled back on providing credit  access  especially  to  consumers  FinTech  lenders  began  to  successfully  operate  in  the financial industry filling the lending gap (Odinet 2017). As already discussed for the FinTech phenomenon the global financial crisis caused a reduction in customers    trust towards banks and an increase in safety measures around loans (e.g. higher capital requirements) decided by regulators  and  supervisory  authorities.  The  result  was  a  tightening  of  loan  requirements  by banks  while  the  loss  of  confidence  led  to  a  lending  gap  with  a  considerable  portion  of individuals  and  businesses  with  higher  risk  profiles  unserved  by  financial  institutions (WEF2015).  The  increase  in  regulatory  measures  caused  two  major  shifts  in  the  financial market (Odinet 2017). First new rules made    the cost of doing business    for many financial institutions  more  expensive.  Second  incumbents  were  forced  to     reprice     their  financial products and services against higher underwriting and compliance costs. As the cost of credit increased  many  consumers  and  small  businesses  decided  to  turn  to  new  players  to  access capital.  FinTech  lenders  were  able  to  fill  the  credit  gap  using  technological  advances  and machine learning to reduce costs speed up and automate loan processes and reach underserved consumers and SMEs. Additionally they can satisfy borrowers that traditional banks generally find too risky. Indeed commercial banks take risks themselves and they focus only on lowrisk consumers while alternative lenders provide an online marketplace where lenders can choose the desired portfolio. Most providers such as online and P2P lending platforms match directly funds  of  borrowers  and  savers;  further  fintech  lenders  rely  solely  on  investors  while commercial banks need to use their customers    deposits and funds from assetbacked securities to make loans (Odinet 2017). For these reasons fintech players can ensure flexible fast lowcost and customeroriented alternatives (WEF 2015).  The World Economic Forum (2015) also analysed the potential role of FinTech lenders with respect  to  traditional  banks.  The  first  potential  scenario  is  the  disintermediation  of  financial agents where alternative lending platforms successfully replace traditional banks in matching riskaverse savers and lowrisk borrowers. The consequence is a loss of incumbents    market share to alternative lending platforms since offering lower interest rates and more streamlined processes new entrants also attract and retain lowrisk borrowers. As traditional banks are still  39  trapped by legacy processes obsolete technologies and strict capital requirements they cannot adapt  quickly  enough  and  the  intensified  competition  of  alternative  lenders  will  generate pressure on the spread earned between interests paid to savers and received from borrowers leading to an erosion of banks    margins and deposits.   In  the  second  potential  scenario  alternative  lending  platforms  act  complementing  traditional intermediaries. As FinTech lenders are unable to build sufficient customer awareness and trust especially  in  lowrisk  lending  segment  they  create  partnerships  with  existing  banks  where alternative lenders and banks cater to different classes of investors and borrowers. Traditional financial institutions continue to  operate  with  lowrisk market  guiding highrisk individuals who do not meet minimum lending requirements to fintech lenders. Thanks to the collaboration between banks and FinTech players customers fulfil their financing needs and gain access to savings  and  lending  products  that  best  suit  their  preferences.  Furthermore  traditional incumbents also reach and serve highrisk customers without losing other business lines and taking high risks. However the profile of customers served by banks could become increasingly homogenised  given  the  possibility  of  savers  and  borrowers  to  switch  to  alternative  lending platforms. In the third potential scenario traditional banks react quickly to the competition of alternative lending players revolutionizing their technologies and processes or directly acquiring FinTech lenders. With these strategies traditional banks develop alternative adjudication methods and capabilities more streamlined lending processes and greater efficiency offering lower interest rates  and  catering  to  more  borrowers  who  traditionally  are  underserved.  The  results  are significant improvement in customer experience greater availability of loans and investment opportunities improved profitability and reduced leakage during lending application process. Nevertheless  banks  will  need  to  diversify  their  savings  and  lending  products  from  the traditional  onesizefitsall  approach  to  serve  various  customers     needs  and  to  face  the competition against diverse fintech lenders.  Summing up the authors (WEF 2015) identified two likely implications that are common to all potential scenarios. Firstly the choice of savers to turn to FinTech lending platforms as short and  mediumterm  investment  vehicles  could  cause  an  erosion  in  traditional  deposits  and investment products offered by banks and financial institutions leading to some balance sheet shrinkage and a negative impact on capital ratio. Secondly it could become more difficult for banks to measure customers    creditworthiness on a consistent basis since clients    savings and credit  portfolios  could  be  distributed  over  many  alternative  platforms  that  use  different reporting standards and methods.    40  2.1.3 Does PeertoPeer lending really threaten commercial banks?  Peertopeer (henceforth    P2P   ) lending is the most successful FinTech lending model in the consumer credit market (Balyuk 2018). The term P2P describes the relationship between two parties without the need for a central intermediary (Milne and Parboteeah 2016) and indeed the peculiarity of this innovation is the direct matching of borrowers and lenders through online lending platforms. In P2P lending borrowers access the online platform request loans online and they provide information about their current financial situation like income or open credit lines (Bachmann et al. 2011).  Individual  and  institutional  investors  can  choose  to  invest  independently  within  investment groups or algorithmically (Morse 2015). Lenders generally do not fund entire loans but rather they may diversify across borrowers who get financed only if investors    bids reach a threshold. If the bids reach the threshold the loan closes at an interest rate assigned to the borrower by the lending platforms according to his riskscoring.  P2P lending platforms are affected by information asymmetry which causes a principalagent problem between investors and borrowers. As in all FinTech lending models borrowers    loans are financed by platform    investors who need to assess borrowers    creditworthiness. Lenders want therefore to get as much valid information about the borrower as possible but on the other hand borrowers may hide some of their characteristics in order to get the loan and a low interest rate.  To  overcome  the  information  asymmetry  P2P  platforms  force  borrowers  to  provide information about their current financial situation. Investors receive an overview of borrowers    financial  characteristics  such  as  credit  ratings  detailed  information  on  income  and  monthly expenses  house  ownership  or  the  debt  to  income  ratio.  After  defining  borrowers    creditworthiness  P2P  lenders  go  on  with  the  screening  and  pricing  process  (Balyuk  2018). Investors  screen  borrowers  using  their  proprietary  algorithms  and  additional  local  and macroeconomic information that is not available to banks. Although P2P lending started with unsophisticated  investors  as  lenders  the  considerable  growth  of  this  innovation  attracted institutional investors who have insights into credit market conditions and characteristics thanks to their strategic position. Lastly P2P lending platforms use fully automated algorithms to price and underwrite loans significantly reducing screening costs for investors. The automation of the  entire  application  verification  and  funding  process  enables  P2P  lenders  to  screen  small loans that are generally rejected by banks because of their low profitability.  Milne and Parboteeah (2016) focused on the competitive advantages of P2P lending platforms over traditional commercial banks. P2P platforms offer better rates of return on deposits and lower fees for borrowers than traditional banks. The automation of the entire process the lack of any intermediary and the focused nature of their activities guarantee low administrative and  41  overhead costs for setting up P2P platforms. In addition since investors bear all the risks of the process (first the borrowers    default) they are compensated with much higher rates of return. Secondly P2P lending platforms provide greater access to credit especially to some categories of borrowers that are generally refused by traditional banks. Borrowers who do not meet the more stringent criteria that banks place on loans can find alternative lenders who are willing to take on a greater risk providing additional lending services.  Another reason for the growth of P2P lending is linked to the direct matching of borrowers and savers. Thanks to this feature P2P lending offers a form of finance that generates more social benefits  and  externalities.  Customers  in  this  case  borrowers  are  the  hearth  of  P2P  lending activities while banks and other financial intermediaries focus more on their market power and profits without an adequate regard to the interests of their clients. Lastly  an  important  advantage  of  P2P  lending  is  technological  innovation  which  allows  to improve the quality and speed of services to both borrowers and lenders. The authors argued that the majority of banks    budget goes towards maintaining existing system rather than creating innovative new ones. Furthermore retail banks tend to have large legacy systems that cannot be easily replaced because of the obsolete infrastructure built around them. Analysing how P2P lending impacts the credit provided by banks Balyuk (2018) argued that FinTech  lenders  influence  the  fundamentals  in  the  consumer  credit  market  by  improving information  between  borrowers  and  investors.  Furthermore  the  author  found  out  that  banks tend to increase access to credit for consumers who receive loans from P2P lending platforms since alternative lenders guarantee a greater accuracy in processing customers    information and screening loans applications. Therefore FinTech innovations  in  the lending sector can bring benefits reducing imperfections and frictions in the consumer credit market and consequently they generate information spillovers to banks which are more prone to enlarge their customer base also including underserved borrowers.  Although FinTech lenders take away part of banks    customers offering low interest rates and providing  more  tailored  financial  solutions  Milne  and  Parboteeah  (2016)  asserted  that  the development of P2P platforms will not lead to the end of the banking system. P2P platforms and  FinTech  lenders  in  general  conduct  activities  traditionally  assigned  exclusively  to commercial  banks  attract  both  lenders  and  borrowers  with  better  rates  and  ensure  faster automatic  and  transparent  processes  but  they  lack  one  core  banking  activity  liquidity provision.  According  to  the  authors  the  principal  activity  of  a  commercial  bank  is  liquidity provision  rather  than  intermediation.  Banks  ensure  their  deposit  customers  the  possibility  to draw deposits on demand either by withdrawing cash or by using bank payment instruments and their borrowers the flexibility in their use of loan facilities. Customers are willing to receive  42  lower interest rates of return on deposits or higher costs of borrowing in return for the liquidity services provided by retail banks. Milne and Parboteeah (2016) underlined that P2P lenders are at a disadvantage compared to banks in providing such liquidity services as they do not have access to money market funding or to central bank liquidity. For this reason P2P and FinTech lenders should be considered as complementary agents not in a direct competition with retail banks which are expected to set up their own P2P platforms or collaborate with existing ones. Thanks to FinTech innovations banks can improve the availability of credit to customers who generally do not meet the requirements for conventional bank lending increasing the stability and the efficiency of banks and of the banking system as a whole.   2.1.4 Crowdfunding a new source of funding Crowdfunding is considered by McKinsey & Co. (2016) as another FinTech innovation which may cause disruption in the traditional banking system albeit to a lesser extent with respect to innovative payments systems and fintech lending. Crowdfunding emerged as an alternative way for  entrepreneurial  ventures  to  secure  funds  without  the  need  for  venture  capital  or  other traditional forms of investment (Mollick 2013). Crowdfunding derives from the combination of  microfinance  and  crowdsourcing  even  if  it  represents  a  unique  category  of  fundraising facilitated  by  the  growth  of  Internet.    Crowdfunding  is  defined  as  an  open  call  essentially through the Internet which allows entrepreneurs to obtain necessary fundings either in the form of  donations  or  in  exchange  for  some  forms  of  reward  or  voting  rights  (Belleflamme  et  al. 2013). In other words crowdfunding is the collection of funds through a web platform from a large group of backers to fund a project or a startup (Wilson and Testoni 2014). Thanks to the use of web platforms and the consequent reduction in transaction costs it is possible to collect a small  amount from  a large pool  of funders and this can result in  considerable amounts of capital. Second the use of the Internet makes it possible to directly link funders with individuals or organizations looking for funding without the need for active intermediaries.  Crowdfunding differs from other funding methods because of the relationship between funders and founders which varies by context and the nature of the funding effort (Mollick 2013). In case of art or human projects funders act as philanthropists who do not receive any direct return for their donations. The second model is the lending model in which entrepreneurs obtain funds in the form of loans. In return for their contributions funders receive fixed periodic income and repayment of the original principal investment (Wilson and Testoni 2014). Entrepreneurs using lending model seek passive investors because they are simply interested in raising money and not  using  the  crowd  as  customers  (Onn  e  and  Renault  2016).  The  third  approach  is  called rewardbased  crowdfunding  in  which  funders  receive  a  nonfinancial  reward  for  backing  a  43  project. Funders get some privileges for example allowing them access to products realized by funded projects at an earlier date better price or with some other special benefits. Finally the equity crowdfunding treats funders as investors giving them stakes or other consideration in return for their fundings. In equity crowdfunding contributors receive securities which allow them to get a portion of the profits and vote at general meetings (Onn  e and Renault 2016). Using this model the crowdfunding platform gives investors the possibility to finance projects already listed by experts and become shareholders of the funded company.  Crowdfunding can be an alternative or a complement to traditional financial circuits (Onn  e and Renault 2016). Indeed through crowdfunding an individual or an organization can avoid having to turn to traditional banks which tend to be reluctant to grant loans to some categories of customers. In addition startups and small businesses may run into difficulties in attracting external  finance  during  their  initial  stage  through  both  bank  loans  and  equity  capital (Belleflamme et al. 2013). Therefore many projects and ventures remain unfunded due to a lack of sufficient value promised to financial investors or due to difficulties in convincing them. Crowdfunding has emerged as a new source of finance which helps firms raise funds from large audiences rather than from a small group of specialized lenders. The concept of crowdfunding is using the crowd to obtain ideas feedback and solutions to develop corporate activities. Many entrepreneurs just need small amounts of capital to start a onetime project which is generally financed  by  friends  and  family.  However  crowdfunding  is  also  a  useful  source  for entrepreneurial seed capital enabling entrepreneurs to obtain the initial money necessary for the establishment of their business (Mollick 2013).  Besides fundraising crowdfunding permits to test the good or service proposed by the project as a sort of preselling to potential clients (Onn  e and Renault 2016). The projects are presented on the crowdfunding platform and this is a way for the entrepreneur to promote his projects and to  benefit  from  the  platform   s  viral  potential.  In  addition  creators  are  invited  to  share  their projects via social networks directly involving the community which becomes a driving force of the project. Lastly project developers can improve their credibility to traditional financiers (traditional banks and venture capitalists) trough successful crowdfunding campaigns.  The four models of crowdfunding (donation model lending model rewardbased model and equity  crowdfunding)  differ  in  terms  of  complexity  and  level  of  uncertainty  (Wilson  and Testoni 2014). The donation model is the simplest one because the only risk is that the project does  not  achieve  its  goal  even  if  the  funder  of  the  project  does  not  expect  any  material  or financial return from his investment. Although equity crowdfunding is the smallest category of the entire crowdfunding in terms of volume it is the most complex.   44  We  focus  on  equity  crowdfunding  characteristics  and  risks  because  it  seems  to  be  the  most disruptive innovation for the financial and banking sectors.  In equity crowdfunding the investor buys a share in the company but he also needs to estimate its  value.  Further  the  level  of  uncertainty  is  very  high  since  this  model  is  based  on  the entrepreneur   s ability to create equity value in the company which is very difficult to assess. Equity crowdfunding is receiving greater attention from policymakers and academics since it is  a precious  source of funds especially  for startups which  generally  have limited access  to finance and often do not command assets to be used as guarantees for bank loans. Young and small  firms  can  obtain  equity  funding  from  three  traditional  sources  founders  family  and friends;  angel  investors;  and  venture  capitalists.  The  role  of  angel  investors  and  venture capitalists  has  increased  substantially  over  the  last  decade  because  after  the  financial  crisis banks have become more reluctant to finance startups due to their greater riskiness and lack of collateral.  Equity  crowdfunding  has  the  same  objectives  of  business  angels  and  venture capitalists but it departs from these models because transactions are intermediated by an online platform. Wilson and Testoni (2014) described the key characteristics of equity crowdfunding with  respect  to  angel  investors  and  venture  capitalists.  Firstly  equity  crowdfunding  mostly operates in the financing segment covered by angel investors although authorities introduced upper  limits  to  the  capital  that  can  be  raised  from  nonqualified  investors  as  the  crowd. Secondly as angel  investors the financial return is  not the only reason for an investment  in equity crowdfunding. In crowdfunding investors also finance startups for social and emotional benefits besides the will to help startups initiate a successful business exploit tax reliefs and achieve  meaningful  financial  returns.  In  addition  the  investment  spectrum  of  equity crowdfunding is typically broader than angel investors and venture capitalists since investment motives of the large public tend to be quite heterogenous. Although equity crowdfunding has become  a  valuable  alternative  source  of  funds  for  startups  and  it  is  increasing  in  terms  of volume it is not riskfree. Indeed the characteristics of crowdfunding can make investments in young  firms  even  riskier  and  they  can  exacerbate  the  information  asymmetry  problems common  to  seed  and  earlystage  financing.  While  business  angels  and  venture  capitalists perform due diligence to evaluate the firm  crowdinvestors have less  incentive to  perform it since this process ca be costly and crowdfunding investments are generally small. Moreover crowdfunders  likely  lack  the  expertise  and  skill  to  adequately  perform  due  diligence.  This happens because the large audience often includes nonprofessional investors who do not have the knowledge or capabilities to evaluate a company. Finally the company valuation conducted by crowdinvestors may be affected by biases and herding behaviour (Agrawal et al. 2013). The authors argued that the propensity of individual  funders to  invest in a project  increases with  45  accumulated capital potentially leading to herding because the investment decision of a funder may be affected by those of the other investors. Furthermore the authors asserted that funders and entrepreneurs are typically initially overoptimistic about potential outcomes.  Regarding investments equity crowdfunding is often based on standardised contracts provided by the platform. However investments into startups generally require customised contracts in order  to  align  the  interests  of  the  entrepreneurs  to  those  of  the  funder.  Business  angels  and venture capitalists tend to invest in a portfolio of companies to diversify their risk. This strategy might be replicated by equity crowdfunders considering that they are exposed to a variety of projects.  However  nonprofessional  investors  as  the  crowd  is  could  not  understand  the strategic importance of the diversification and therefore they could potentially concentrate all their investments in a single project or company.  Finally  equity  crowdfunding  tends  to  exacerbate  the  information  asymmetry  problems  that typically characterize earlystage firms. Indeed entrepreneurs always have more information than investors about their projects or ventures (Agrawal et al. 2013). In equity crowdfunding the informational asymmetry increases due to the geographical distance between funders and entrepreneurs.  So  it  is  particularly  difficult  for  funders  to  perform  due  diligence  in  person assess  the  true  ability  of  the  entrepreneur  or  the  underlying  quality  of  the  project.  The consequence is a market failure in the form of adverse selection. Indeed if funders discount the value of the projects on the platform as a result highquality venture will not raise funds on the platform because they cannot get a    fair    price for their equity in that platform. The risk is that adverse selection increases the cost of capital to the point where only lowquality venture will choose crowdfunding while highquality ventures will continue to turn to business angels and venture capitalists. Crowdfunding business model also has some limits in postinvestment support and monitoring. Business angels and venture capitalist provide not only fundings to startups but they are also directly  involved  in  increasing  the  value  of  the  company  while  the  support  provided  by crowdinvestors is generally less valuable. The crowd makes small investments and it has less incentive to provide active support to the company due to the lower return for their investment (Agrawal et al. 2013). Moreover the information asymmetry typical of earlystage financing also characterises the postinvestment phase limiting the monitoring activity of the crowd.  The monitoring activity is particularly important in investments that take 510 years or more to produce  a  return  (Wilson  and  Testoni  2014).  Equity  investments  may  succeed  or  fail  and therefore  it  is  necessary  to  elaborate  a  positive  exit  strategy  for  the  investors.  The  exit  of investors can be through an IPO or a M&A but in equity crowdfunding the path to a positive exit can be longer and even less likely.  46   In  conclusion  the  lack  of  preinvestment  screening  and  due  diligence  weaker  investment contracts and poorer postinvestment support and monitoring can make equity crowdfunding transaction significantly riskier than business angels and venture capitalists ones.  After describing the characteristics and the risks of equity crowdfunding we try to understand whether these innovations really affect the banking system. Crowdfunding as other FinTech innovations has the potential to replace significant parts of the banking system.  Blaseg and Koetter (2015) analysed the relationship between crowdfunding and banks to verify when  ventures  and  entrepreneurs  are  more  willing  to  turn  to  crowdfunding  rather  than  to traditional bank loans. The authors underlined that  the financial crisis  of  2008 increased the difficulties that young and small firms face in raising external finance. As a result the volume of equity financing from venture capitalists decreased significantly and credit supply tightened.  Early stage financing is typically characterised by greater riskiness information asymmetries and high relative transaction costs. Crowdfunding established itself as a valid alternative for younger ventures since it ensures lower transaction costs thanks to the use of web platforms. The  authors  analysed  whether  and  how  the  credit  shock  transmitted  by  banks  made  young ventures and entrepreneurs more inclined to seek crowdfunding as alternative source of external finance. Focusing on a large group of young venture in Germany Blaseg and Koetter (2015) found  out  that  the  relationship  of  a  young  venture  with  a  bailedout  bank  increases  the probability that the venture uses crowdfunding. Moreover after the financial crisis banks were forced to handle their lending more restrictively due to more sever rules. Therefore ventures that  cannot  demonstrate  their  creditworthiness  remain  unfinanced  and  they  decide  to  turn  to equity crowdfunding instead of bank financing. Young and small firms are more likely to use crowdfunding  also  when  they  have  few  tangible  assets.  Tangible  assets  allow  to  reduce  the financial  loss  for  investors  in  case  of  bankruptcy  and  the  information  asymmetries  costs  if ventures pledge their assets as collateral.  Summing  up  crowdfunding  is  a  valuable  alternative  source  of  funding  mainly  for  young ventures and small entrepreneurs  especially  when their banks are  affected by  credit crunch. Crowdfunding as  FinTech lending is  a potential threat to  commercial banks because it  can reach  some  categories  of  customers  who  are  generally  underserved  by  traditional  financial institutions. Banks are adapting crowdfunding platforms    business models to meet small loan applications with transparent and customised products. However crowdfunding innovation is not  riskfree  and  the  real  issue  is  whether  crowdfunding  will  be  able  to  overcome  its  main limits  lack  of  expertise  and  knowledge  to  perform  due  diligence  information  asymmetry problems  lack  of  adequate  monitoring  and  successful  exit  for  investors.  Despite  some successful equity crowdfunding cases the crowdfunding industry still lacks    a sufficient track  47  record to assess its ability to  create value for both investors and entrepreneurs    (Wilson and Testoni 2014).  For these reasons most of young ventures are still more prone to apply to traditional banks business  angels  or  venture  capitalists  who  provide  knowledge  of  the  market  expertise  and financial capabilities. Lastly there is a huge disparity in size between the crowdfunding and traditional banking industries and this means that crowdfunding is not currently considered as a realistic alternative to banks.   2.2 Banks    performance and profitability In the previous paragraph we focused on three FinTech innovations which McKinsey & Co. (2016) described as the most concrete threats to the banking system. We analysed innovative payment system FinTech lending agents and platforms and equity crowdfunding in relation to traditional  commercial  banks     activities  and  functions.  From  the  analysis  it  emerged  that FinTech  innovations  threaten  the  banking  system  since  they  have  the  potential  to  overcome some  limits  and  disadvantages  of  traditional  incumbents.  Innovative  payments  systems guarantee  faster  cheaper  and  more  transparent  processes  to  their  customers  improving  their experience and better satisfying their evolving needs. FinTech lending companies and platforms reach  categories  of  borrowers  (highrisk  borrowers  such  as  SMEs  and  individuals)  who  are generally  underserved  by  traditional  banks.  In  addition  alternative  lending  ensures  lower transaction and compliance costs thanks the direct matching between investors and borrowers and the lighter regulation. Lastly equity crowdfunding in particular emerges as a valid and valuable alternative source of external finance for young ventures and startups. With respect to innovative payments systems and FinTech lending crowdfunding is characterized by a small volume in the financial industry but it allows small projects and ventures to get funding. As FinTech lending crowdfunding satisfies customers    and firms    funding applications which are typically rejected by commercial banks due to their greater riskiness.  These FinTech innovations threaten the banking system because they better meet customers    evolving needs and preferences they take away clients to traditional commercial banks and they guarantee lower costs higher rates of return and less severe requirements. But do FinTech innovations  have  tangible  effects  on  commercial  banks  in  terms  of  performance  and profitability? Does the collaboration between traditional banks and fintech companies improve banks    efficiency? Before developing a model to analyse these issues we first need to define bank   s profitability and how to measure it.    48  2.2.1 Banks    performance In  this  work  we  refer  to  banks     performance  as  the  ability  of  banks  to  generate  sustainable profitability (ECB 2010). Profitability is essential for a bank to maintain its ongoing activity and  for  investors  to  obtain  fair  returns.  As  any  profitseeking  organization  banks  need  to generate  profits  against  unexpected  losses  and  depletion  of  capital  base.  So  the  ultimate purpose of a bank is to preserve and create value for its owners even if various stakeholders of a  bank  can  focus  on  different  aspects  of  profitability  depending  on  their  perspectives. Depositors for example worry about a bank   s longterm ability to look after their savings. Debt holders  instead  look  at  the  ability  of  the  bank  to  meet  its  obligations  while  equity  holders focus  on  profit  generation  to  secure  a  future  return  on  their  current  holding.  Despite  banks    greater  complexity  their  performance  is  still  driven  by  earnings  efficiency  risktaking  and leverage.  As  mentioned  above  the  ultimate  objective  of  a  bank  is  the  creation  of  profit  and earnings  but  it  is  also  important  to  account  their  composition  and  volatility.  Efficiency  is defined  by  the  ECB  as  the  ability  of  the  bank  to  generate  revenues  from  a  given  amount  of assets and to make profit from a given source of income. We will discuss bank   s efficiency later in  relation  to  a  potential  collaboration  with  FinTech  players.  Risktaking  refers  to  the adjustment  of  earnings  for  the  undertaken  risks  to  generate  them.  Lastly  leverage  might improve bank   s results in the upswing acting as a multiplier but at the same time it might also increase the probability of a bank    failure due to rare and unexpected losses. There is a great variety of measures to asses bank performance with differences among groups of  stakeholders.  The  ECB  (2010)  splits  performance  measurements  in  three  categories traditional economic and marketbased measures.  ROE  (return  on  equity)  along  with  ROA  (return  on  assets)  is  one  of  the  most  widely  used measures  of  corporate  financial  performance  adopted  by  analysts  consultants  financial managers and shareholders (De Wet and Du Toit 2006).  ROE is measured dividing the net income by the average total equity and it can be broken up into three separate ratios following the    Dupont analysis                  =                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         (Hess and Francis 2004). The three components measure respectively actual profitability utilization of assets and the gearing of the company. For banks it makes sense to combine the last two components into one equity capital utilization measure. In fact unlike in industrial firms a bank   s gearing is not a particularly  distinguishing  factor  and  it  is  generally  strongly  affected  by  regulatory  capital requirements.  The  two  remaining  subcomponents  of  ROE  could  then  be  interpreted  as operational and capital efficiency respectively. Therefore ROE can be improved by increasing  49  profitability by using assets more efficiently or by increasing financial leverage (De Wet and Du Toit 2006). ROE is the most popular measure of performance (i) it directly assesses the financial return of a shareholder   s investment; (ii) it is easily available for many categories of stakeholders; and (iii) it facilitates the comparison between different companies or sectors of the economy (ECB 2010). However this ratio has some flaws and limits as performance indicator (De Wet and Du Toit  2006).  The  authors  argued  that  the  earnings  of  a  company  can  be  manipulated  legally within  the  Generally  Accepted  Accounting  Principles  (GAAP)  changing  some  accounting policies. In addition ROE is calculated after the cost of debt but before considering the cost of own capital. As mentioned above ROE increases with a higher financial gearing but if this last goes beyond a certain level it may cause a fall in the company value and in the share price. In this  case  an  increase  in  ROE  may  lead  to  wealth  destruction  which  is  in  contrast  with  the principle of shareholder value creation. Higher gearing and higher asset turnover which are not necessarily beneficial can cause a dangerous increase in ROE.  The ECB (2010) underlined that during the 2008 financial crisis ROE failed to discriminate the best performing banks from bad ones in terms of longterm sustainability of their results. In some cases the banks with the highest ROE were those worst hit by the crisis. Indeed ROE is a  shortterm  indicator  which  provides  an  overview  of  the  banks     current  health  and  for  this reason it cannot take into account longterm strategies longterm damages caused by negative events  and  measures  with  longterm  impact.  So  ROE  is  not  a  good  indicator  of  banks    sustainable performance when changes derive from oneshot events which cannot be replicated in the future (e.g. extraordinary events during a crisis). ROE does not also consider longterm issues such as restructuring or improvement in capital ratios. For example during a crisis many banks  undertake  actions  such  as  restructuring  to  return  generating  value  in  the  longterm. However these strategies generally imply negative effects in terms of costs involving further pressures on ROE and the current performance.  Moreover ROE can be a misleading ratio since it is generally influenced by seasonal factors and it exposes banks to higher unexpected risk levels. The last criticism of ROE analysed by the ECB is that this ratio is not risksensitive and it completely ignores important risk elements such as the quality of assets the cost of risk the risk concentration and the solvency situation. So the ECB concluded that ROE is not a standalone performance measure and therefore it is necessary to develop alternative and additional performance indicators.  Other traditional indicators to measure performance are  (i) ROA calculated as ROA =                                                                                                                 ;   50  (ii)  cost  to  income  ratio  (CIR)  calculated  as               =                                                                                                                                              which  estimates  the ability of the financial institution to generate profits from a given revenue stream; (iii) net interest margin computed as net interest margin =                                                                                                 which indicates the capacity of banks    intermediation function to generate income.   Banks    performance can also be assessed through economic measures such as EVA (economic value added) and RAROC (riskadjusted return on capital) (ECB 2010). These indicators assess the  economic  results  generated  by  a  company  from  its  economic  assets mainly  focusing  on efficiency as a central element of performance. EVA is defined as the excess of adjusted earning over the opportunity cost of the capital involved  EVA= Adjusted earnings     c*K Where earnings are adjusted to better represent economic earnings in accordance with GAAP c  is  the  opportunity  cost  of  equity  and  K  is  the  amount  of  equity  used  by  the  unit  being measured (Kimball1998). From the ECB (2010) perspective EVA considers the opportunity cost for stockholders to hold equity in a bank measuring whether it generates an economic rate of return higher than the cost of invested capital to increase the market value of the company               =                                                                                             (                                                                                                                                                                                     )    (                                                                                                                                         ) The  value  of  the  EVA  can  be  improved  in  three  ways  by  increasing  adjust  earnings  either trough improved margins or additional sales; by reducing the equity capital used; or by reducing the cost of equity (Kimball 1998). However any change to improve EVA requires managers to face tradeoffs among the key variables. If managers decide to expand the activity to increase earnings such expansion will lead to greater investments and so higher equity capital. In this case  EVA  will  increase  only  if  the  additional  earnings  generated  by  expansion  exceed  the marginal cost of the additional equity capital involved. Otherwise a company may increase its use of debt and decrease the amount (K) of equity used. But if K decreases the riskiness of the equity investment will increase and so c the cost of equity will increase. In this situation EVA will improve only if the percentage decline in K is greater than the percentage increase in c.  Considering the flaws of ROE discussed above and the tradeoffs that managers need to face using  EVA  the  EVA  system  is  considered  superior  to  more  conventional  performance measures. Managers of banks and companies should use performance indicators to identify the best investment decisions in terms of earnings and use of equity capital. If managers only focus on  maximizing  earnings  and  adopt  ROE  to  value  a  project  they  will  not  consider  the opportunity cost of capital and therefore they will choose a project with positive and increasing  51  earnings  but  with  an  inefficient  use  of  equity.  A  firm  that  adopt  only  ROE  as  performance indicator will tend to underinvest grow more slowly than it should and generate lower returns for shareholders. More popular performance measures as ROE and ROA may suggest that the bank is performing well when in fact it may be reducing its value to its shareholders. Using EVA  firms  may  avoid  these  outcomes  because  managers  would  be  induced  to  manage  the internal tradeoff between growth and the return to additional equity. Maximizing EVA a firm would invest until  the last  project  generated a ROE just equal  to  the opportunity cost  of the equity  capital  employed.  Despite  the  advantages  of  EVA  in  terms  of  incentive  system  and shareholder  value  creation  it  is  not  the  best  measure  of  performance  because  projects  with negative EVA will not be chosen considering the current EVA figures even though the future annual EVA is enough to justify the investment (De Wet and Du Toit 2006). As discussed above one of the main limits of ROE as performance indicator is that ROE is not risksensitive and so it ignores any risk element in the banks    activity. The second economic performance  measure  analysed  by  the  ECB  (2010)  is  the  riskadjusted  return  on  capital (RAROC) which measures the expected result over economic capital. RAROC  is  one  of  the  riskadjusted  performance  measures  (RAPM)  used  in  the  banking industry  as  a  guide  for  an  efficient  asset  allocation  performance  evaluation  and  capital structure decisions in complex financial institutions (Geyfman 2005). After the strengthening of regulatory constraint on bank total capital one of the banks    main objective is to maximize riskadjusted profitability. One way to reach this goal is to minimize the risk of each activity undertaken by the bank.  RAPM  have been developed during the last decade to  compare the riskadjusted  return  against  an  appropriate  hurdle  rate  of  the  bank   s  cost  of  capital  or  the opportunity  cost  to  stockholders  in  holding  equity  in  the  bank.  RAROC  measures  the performance of a bank as the ratio between the riskadjusted return of a business activity and the capital employed to finance it.    To  identify  successful  operations  and  projects  performance  measures  need  to  consider  the underlying  level  of  risk  associated  with  banks     activity  and  they  need  to  face  the  tradeoff between  growth  return  and risk (Kimball 1998). To evaluate banks    performance RAROC approach assigns capital to business units as part of a process of assessing the riskadjusted rate of return and the economic value added of each business unit (Zaik et al.1996). This system allows to allocate capital to individual business units and activities of banks in accordance with their anticipated economic value added (EVA) (ECB 2010). With respect to ROE RAROC is a more reliable measure to evaluate the performance of business units given the focus on the underlying risk level (Zaik et al. 1996). If the RAROC of a business unit is greater than the cost  equity  which  is  the  shareholders     minimum  required  rate  of  return  it  means  that  the  52  business unit is creating value for shareholders. But if RAROC is below the cost of equity the business  unit is reducing  shareholder value. However the use of rates of  return in  RAROC ROE or ROA does not allow to quantify how much value is being created or destroyed by an operation. For this reason managers who use only RAROC or any rateofreturn to measure performance are induced to underinvest. To maximizing the shareholder value a bank should undertake all projects that exceed the cost of capital but if managers are rewarded exclusively on the basis of ROE or RAROC they are more likely to refuse value increasing projects that will reduce their average return. Therefore Zaik et al. (1996) suggested using the    economic profit    also called    residual income    of the activity to measure the performance and to create right investment incentives for managers.  About RAROC the ECB (2010) underlined a similarity with EVA because both approaches link a bank   s profit with its cost of capital even if RAROC goes further because it adjusts the valueadded in relation to the capital needed. RAROC is theoretically the most relevant measure of  performance  since  it  compares  economic  return  against  risk.  However  it   s  difficult  to calculate RAROC without having access to internal data and  making strong assumptions. In addition RAROC seems to be a more appropriate tool for activities with robust techniques for measuring  risk  such  as  credit  risk.  For  these  reasons  academics  are  reluctant  to  consider RAROC a valid alternative tool to analyse and measure performance of business activities.  The ECB (2010) concluded the analysis of performance measures focusing on marketbased indicators which characterise how capital markets value the activity of any company compared with its estimated accounting or economic value. The most commonly marketbased metrics include (i) the priceearnings ratio (P/E) which is the ratio of the company   s financial results over its share price; (ii) the pricetobook value (P/B) which relates the market value of equity to its book value; (iii) the total shareholder return (TSR) which is the ratio of dividends and increase of the stock value over the market stock price; and (iv) the credit default swap (CDS) which expresses the cost of insuring an unsecured bond of the institution for a given time period.  Summing up ROE and ROA are the most widely used among traditional performance measures in the banking sector and many other industries. ROE is an internal performance measure of shareholder value and it is by far the most popular indicator since it can be easily assessed and it provides a direct valuation of the financial return of a shareholder   s investment. However ROE has some limits and flaws (i) it ignores any risk assessment; (ii) it is a shortterm indicator which does not consider any longterm strategy or longterm issues of the company; and (iii) it can be subject to manipulation in case of lack of data.  Considering  these  limits  academics  analysed  alternative  tools  and  indicators  to  measure performance of banks in particular the socalled riskadjusted performance measures (RAPM).  53  Risk  has  become  a  fundamental  component  in  assessing  banks     performance  after  the  2008 financial crisis and the consequent strengthening of banks capital requirements. RAROC allows banks to assign capital to individual business units according to their underlying level of risk. RAROC is theoretically considered a more reliable performance measure than ROE in terms of risk assessment but this ratio is not out of limits and disadvantages. To assess bank performance using this ratio it is necessary to have access to internal data and to make strong assumptions about banks    activities. Some authors (De Wet and Du Toit 2006; EBA 2010; Kimball 1998) also consider EVA as performance measure which is based on the concept of opportunity cost. Applying EVA banks expect to obtain better decisionmaking by their managers since they are forced  to  include  the  opportunity  cost  of  equity  when  making  investment  and  operating decisions  (Kimball  1998).  In  addition  the  author  argues  that  EVA  is  superior  to  the  more conventional  ROE  since  it  requires  managers  to  face  tradeoff  among  its  key  variables earnings  cost  of  capital  and  amount  of  equity  employed.  However  as  any  other  incentive compensation  system  EVA  system  can  be  manipulated  by  managers  to  maximize  their compensation without necessarily increasing the profits of the company. In this case managers juggle the EVA based system to maximize the current incentive compensation at the expenses of future reported performance.   One of the main drivers of banks    performance is efficiency together with earnings risktaking and leverage (ECB 2010). Efficiency and effective utilization have always been key objectives of banks and financial institutions (Spong et al. 1995). In the last few years the emphasis to banking  efficiency  has  increased  due  to  several  recent  events  increasing  competition  for financial  services  technological  and  financial  innovation  banking  consolidation  and  the increasing competition from nonbank players. All these events induced banks to focus more attention  on  controlling  costs  and  providing  services  and  products  efficiently.  Innovation  in technology  especially  in  terms  of  improvements  in  communications  and  data  processing  is also  adding  emphasis  to  efficiency.  FinTech  innovations  give  banks  and  other  financial institutions  opportunities  and  solutions  to  raise  productivity  and  efficiency  using  new technological  instruments.  Banks  can  increase  their  efficiency  automating  processes  and operations introducing new financial products and services and competing more directly with each other. Much of the banking consolidation movement is motivated by the hope of increasing efficiency.  Companies  generally  perform  acquisitions  to  reduce  costs  of  internal  operations exploit potential synergies and eliminate overlapping offices personnel and other duplicative resources  and  services.  Banks  can  get  similar  advantages  in  case  of  collaborations  or acquisitions of nonbank players such as FinTech companies (Darolles 2016). FinTech players  54  have  a strong  competitive advantage thanks to  technological  innovation  but  incumbents  are trying  to  expand  their  skills  and  capabilities  (Merler  2017).  Banks  may  decide  to  purchase financial products or services directly from FinTech players when it is too costly for them to internalize their production. Thanks to the collaboration with FinTech companies banks can ensure cheaper and easier to use financial solutions faster and automated processes and they can  outsource  some  activities  to  partners  to  be  more  efficient.  All  these  trends  show  that efficiency needs to be a central objective of banks to operate successfully.   In the literature we can find several definitions of efficiency technical efficiency allocative efficiency economic efficiency cost efficiency and scale efficiency. For the purpose of our work we follow the definition provided by the ECB (2010). The ECB described efficiency as the ability of a bank to generate revenue from a given amount of assets and to make profit from a given source of income. Efficiency can be measured using the costtoincome ratio (henceforth    CIR   ) which expresses the capability of the institution to generate gross profits from a given revenue stream (Arnaboldi and Rossignoli 2015). CIR is traditionally computed as noninterest expenses excluding bad debt and tax expense divided by the sum of net interest income and noninterest income (Hess and Francis 2004). It measures the output of a bank in relation to its utilized input and it shows the amount of expenses that are needed in a given time period to generate a specific amount of revenues (Burger and Moormann 2008). CIR is recognized as the most popular ratio to measure cost efficiency since it can be easily computed it allows a fast and easily feasible comparison of banks it can be easily computed and the results seem to be intuitive.  In  the  literature  about  CIR  it  is  commonly  recognized  that  a  high  CIR  is  equivalent  to  low productivity  and  low  efficiency  and  viceversa  (Hussain  2014).  Hess  and  Francis  (2004) showed that there is an inverse relationship between the CIR and the bank profitability. Ghosh et al. (2003) found out that a negative relation between efficiency and the CIR exists and this means that more efficient banks (with lower CIRs) generate higher profits. Therefore it seems to exist a negative correlation between CIR and efficiency and a positive relationship between efficiency and profitability.  Although  banks  focus  on  the  reduction  of  CIR  as  proxy  for  cost  efficiency  CIR  has  some limitations  in  assessing  efficiency  (Beccalli  et  al.  2006).  Osborne  (1995)  found  no  clear correlation between the CIR and the ROE of a sample of banks. Bekier and Nickless (1998) found important differences regarding cost efficiencies among countries which adopt different payment  systems.  Countries  where  cheques  are  widely  used  for  noncash  payments  (USA  55  Canada  Australia  and  the  UK)  tend  to  have  more  costly  banking  systems  than  European countries which rely more on electronic transaction methods.  Moreover using financial ratios to measure efficiency has some disadvantages with respect to parametric  and  nonparametric  approaches  (Stochastic  Frontier  Approach  and  Data Envelopment Analysis) because financial ratios tend to ignore the input price and  the output mix  (Berger  and  Humphrey  1992).  A  closer  analysis  of  CIR  calculation  shows  that  price components (interest rates commission fees and factor costs) influence the determination of earnings and expenses and so they alter the ability of CIR to measure efficiency (Burger and Moormann  2008).  Earnings  are  based  on  sales  quantities  and  assessed  on  prices  while administrative costs are determined looking at the cost of production factors. The consideration of prices on the earning side can be problematic for the measurement of efficiency which detects the level of a bank   s production and settlement capability. Therefore prices elements should not be included in the measurement of productivity.  Lastly banks that operate in different countries may be characterised by different interest rates and commission fees. Since these elements are part of the CIR banks situated in countries with higher interest margins ceteris paribus appear to be more efficient and productive than others. Considering  the  limitations  of  the  CIR  academics  have  developed  parametric  and  nonparametric methods which estimates the operating efficiency (Beccalli et al. 2006). Operating efficiency occurs when a company is cost minimising (using less inputs for the same level of outputs) or profit maximising (producing more outputs for the same amount of inputs). This concept of efficiency is proxied by a frontier index knows as Xefficiency (defined as the ratio of the minimum costs that have been expended to produce a given output bundle to the actual expenses)  which  is  used  to  measure  bank  performance  and  is  considered  a  better  indicator compared to traditional accounting ratios (Berger and Humphrey 1992).  Summing up efficiency has become one of the main objectives of banks and bankers especially after the 2008 financial crisis and the consequent strengthening of bank capital requirements. A bank as any other organization should be able to generate profits with an efficient use of its inputs and resources. The focus on efficiency is also increased due to the greater competition from  nonbank  players  such  as  FinTech  companies  that  operate  in  the  banking  sector.  The competition from FinTech players induces banks to adopt new technologies to develop new automated processes and new financial services. We presented a simple but comprehensive definition of efficiency provided by ECB efficiency is the bank   s ability to generate revenue from a given amount of assets and to make profit from a  given  source  of  income.  Regarding  efficiency  measurement  we  described  different approaches from the traditional cost to income ratio to the more precise DEA and SFA methods.  56  Since  in  our  work  we  will  analyse  the  correlation  between  FinTech  innovations  and  banks    efficiency focusing on the cost dimension of FinTech instruments adopted by banks we believe it is opportune to apply the costtoincome approach.                                  57  3. Impact of FinTechs acquisitions on banks    performance  In the previous chapters we analysed the FinTech phenomenon and the emergence of FinTech startups (henceforth    FinTechs   ) which provide  innovative financial solutions and services.  FinTech is a complex phenomenon threatening the banking industry and the traditional financial institutions. It includes both technological innovations (distributed ledger technology artificial intelligence roboadvisory and Application Programming Interfaces or APIs) and FinTechs which provide new financial services based on FinTech innovations. Over the past 5 to 10 years customers  significantly  changed  their  view  of  financial  services  companies  and  their  needs (KMPG  2017).  Customers  expect  more  innovative  faster  and  efficient  financial  services. However traditional banks have failed to provide these services because of stringent regulatory requirements and inflexible slowtoadapt legacy core banking systems (Schwab and Guibaud 2016). In  the  current  era  of  digitalization  and  automation  financial  institutions  should  be  able  to quickly respond to their customers    needs with customized and easier to use financial products. Therefore  financial  institutions  and  banks  feel  the  pressure  to  both  modernize  their infrastructure  and  respond  to  changing  customers     demands  and  expectations.  The  banking industry is  facing a fierce competition from FinTechs from a variety of fronts. FinTechs are able  to  better  satisfy  customers     needs  adopting  a  variety  of  technologies  to  increase  the accessibility and speed of their services (Capgemini2018). The elaboration of advanced data analytics and the greater attention on customer data allow FinTechs to offer tailored services and products  adopting a  more customerfocused  approach in  contrast  with  traditional banks. FinTech  innovations  guarantee  their  clients  more  transparency  and  dependability  through digital automated and more efficient processes. Moreover the emergence of FinTechs led to the  introduction  of  new  business  models  such  as  P2P  lending  which  may  have  a  significant impact  on  lending  and  retailing  sectors.  With  respect  to  traditional  banks  FinTech  have  no legacy infrastructure and so they can keep costs down and offer lowerpriced solutions (such as roboadvisors). Finally through innovation and lowcost financial solutions FinTechs can reach  and  satisfy  customers  who  are  generally  unserved  or  underserved  by  the  traditional financial industry. All these elements represent FinTechs    strengths and sources of competitive advantage with respect to banks and other financial institutions which should invest more time and attention on evolving customers    needs and technological advances.    58  3.1 Collaboration between banks and FinTechs Collaborations and relationships between FinTechs and incumbents can be winwin situations for both entities considering the complementarity of their features and competitive advantages (Capgemini 2018). FinTechs offer agility focus on customer experience and lack of legacy systems while banks bring infrastructure brand name and customer trust and their ability to deal with regulation. Although FinTech are closer to customers    needs introducing innovative products they face challenges in scalingup and establishing financially viable business models. Despite  the  growth  and  the  great  number  of  FinTechs  only  few  FinTech  companies  and products  have  reached  a  significant  scale.  FinTechs     weaknesses  come  from  the  lack  of customer  trust  and  brand  name  since  it  takes  time  for  FinTechs  to  attract  customers  which reposed trust in traditional financial institutions. Unlike banks and other financial institutions FinTechs do not have wellestablished distribution infrastructures and this may prevent them from  reaching  a  broad  customer  base.  Even  though  FinTechs  have  a  leaner  and  lowcost structure thanks to the absence of legacy systems regulatory and supervisory bodies across the worlds are introducing protocols and regulations  for Fintechs. This decision comes from the continuous expansion of FinTechs in the financial industry even if many of them do not have the expertise in handling complex regulation and mandates. FinTechs need also to face issues about financing and capital. Indeed they heavily rely on venture capital funding based on the uniqueness  of  their  businesses.  If  FinTechs     new  ideas  do  not  generate  interest  this  can compromise the financing of firm   s operations and activities. Finally for FinTechs it is difficult to reach economies of scale without collaborating with incumbents. Although FinTechs offer lowcost  financial  solutions  they  can  profit  only  with  economies  of  scale  which  may  allow them to attract and gain new customers. As mentioned above collaboration can be a profitable solution for both FinTechs and traditional financial institutions since FinTechs challenges are often natural strengths of incumbents and vice versa.  Although FinTechs are real competitors for different players of the financial industry (banks insurances  financial  institutions)  they  especially  threat  traditional  banks.  Indeed  FinTechs have  partly  taken  over  functions  and  activities  previously  reserved  for  incumbents  e.g.  in payments  lending  and  investing  (Eickhoff  et  al.2017).  They  began  to  provide  financial services which are similar to those provided by traditional banks but are not subject to the same degree of regulatory pressure in terms of licences capital and rules. For this reason we will focus our analysis on the relationship between banks and FinTechs.  The emergence of new competitors as FinTechs altered the composition of the banking industry and it induced banks to elaborate FinTech strategies to maintain their role in the financial sector.  59  In addition the development of new technologies and the shifts in customers    needs increased the interest of banks in FinTech innovations and companies.  Banks can adopt different strategies to curb the potential threat from FinTechs (Ernst & Young 2017). Banks may decide to invest their own capital in FinTechs as inhouse venture capital independent venture capital funds or investments on their own balance sheet. Investments in FinTechs allow banks to gain early access to innovative solutions resolve the lack of inhouse talent and innovative culture and reduce the timetomarket. Banks can also enter in different types of arrangements with FinTechs utilizing products or platforms developed by FinTechs (for  example  in  the  case  of  roboadvice)  creating  partnerships  or  collaboration  as  a  whole network establishing joint ventures or cocreating new services (a bank partner with a FinTech to launch a new digital marketplace). Creating partnerships or collaborations with FinTechs is one of the most common strategy in the banking industry given its innumerable advantages in terms of speed cost and acquisition of new customers (KPMG2017). Through the creation of alliances FinTechs    products and services can reach the large customer base of banks and at the same time banks can help FinTechs address regulatory requirements and gain access to new customer segments (Klus et al. 2018).  Instead of investing in FinTechs banks could accelerate their inhouse development of FinTech products and services. When a bank decides to build FinTech innovations they can define the scope of their initiatives and design tailormade products or services (KPMG2017). However few  financial  institutions  adopt  this  strategy  because  they  do  not  have  time  resources capabilities and agility to develop FinTech innovations efficiently and effectively. Indeed to create  inhouse  innovations  internal  capabilities  technical  competencies  and  cultural disposition  to  embrace  change  are  required.  For  banks  the  building  strategy  represents  a challenge  also  because  the  strict  regulation  and  the  complexity  of  their  businesses  have historically slow down their innovation process (Ernst & Young 2017).  Another  model  of  engagement  with  FinTechs  is  represented  by  mergers  and  acquisitions (M&As). Banks may directly acquire FinTechs increasing their digital footprint and reducing costs for the development of new technologies. Acquiring FinTechs may be an effective way to  avoid  the  development  process  by  directly  gaining  access  to  FinTech  capabilities.  Even though M&A transactions between banks and FinTechs are a very recent phenomenon in the banking industry they can lead to important benefits for both players. Banks would have direct access to talent and innovative culture reach new markets and speed up processes and products delivery to final customers. Since FinTechs adopt new technologies offer alternative innovative financial solutions and reach underserved customers banks would also have the possibility to enlarge  their  product  and  market  differentiation.  With  respect  to  collaborations  M&As  60  operations are more complex because they imply a complete integration between two entities with different culture capabilities and knowledge.  Banks could also create a relationship of whitelabelling with FinTechs or other technologies companies. In this situation FinTechs develop and realize the financial products or services which are then brand and sell by banks. Applying this strategy banks have access to innovative products without bearing the cost for their realization and they can test value and fill potential product/service gaps. However banks have less control than developing the products internally they  need  to  integrate  this  innovative  structure  within  their  business  and  to  share  revenue (KPMG2017).  In  some  cases  FinTechs  sell  their  products  only  under  their  partner  bank   s brand (B  mer and Maxin 2018). Analysing a sample of FinTech in the German industry the authors  found  out  that  all  FinTech  that  apply  whitelabel  approach  cooperate  with  many different banks. Therefore FinTechs are only technology services providers and they distribute their technology to banks to increase profits and number of users. Whitelabelling is convenient for banks because they can offer innovative financial solutions to their customers without the need  to  build  or  develop  the  necessary  legacy  systems.  With  this  type  of  collaboration  it emerges a new hybrid model for banks so called BankTech (Schwab and Guibaud 2016). In this model banks would put at FinTech companies    disposal their core banking infrastructure and  sometimes  their  banking  licence  while  indirectly  reaching  new  customers  which  were unserved  in  the  past  (for  example  young  people  the  unbanked  SMEs  or  digital  natives). Although  FinTechs  provide  innovative  financial  solutions  through  a  more  customercentric experience  some  of  them  need  banks     support  knowledge  and  expertise  to  operate.  In  the relationship  bankFinTechs  banks  will  not  only  lend  FinTechs  with  their  backbone infrastructure to operate but also rely on them to serve their existing clients better. Finally banks are leading or participating in a number of accelerators incubators and training programmes to get access to technologies and talent without taking any significant stake in the FinTechs. On the other side FinTechs gain easy access to resources data funding space and networking opportunities to test their prototypes. This is the case of joint FinTech programs or lead FinTech programs.   To conclude the analysis the report of KPMG (2017) shows that collaboration is the preferred engagement strategy when banks need to interact with FinTechs to drive financial innovation.  However although banks still hesitate acquisitions of FinTechs are an emerging phenomenon in the banking industry. CB Insights (2018) identifies and analyses 20 Fintechs acquisitions by banks in the period 20142018. Most of these acquisitions occurred after September 2017 and this confirms that such type of deals is very recent and that banks are changing their behaviour towards FinTechs. Banks involved in these acquisitions are especially European (BBVA BNP  61  Paribas Credit Suisse) and US (Goldman Sachs JP Morgan Chase & Co. Capital One Ally First  Republic  Bank  Silicon  Valley  Bank  and  KeyCorp)  banks.  In  table  1  we  recap  the acquisitions of FinTechs performed during the period 20142018.

Although European and American banks reduced their investments in fintech in 2017 with respect to 2016 they are finally picking up FinTech acquisitions (CB Insights 2018).  As  mentioned  in  the  previous  chapter  the  aim  of  our  work  is  to  investigate  the  impacts  of FinTechs on banks    performance. To conduct this analysis we will consider the acquisition of  62  FinTech companies performed by a bank to analyse the strategy behind the deal and the impact of acquisitions on the performance of the acquiring bank.  3.2 BBVA and FinTechs acquisitions  From the analysis of FinTechs acquisitions by banks it emerged that Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria  (henceforth     BBVA)  is  the  most  active  bidder  within  the  European  banking industry. For this reason we decide to focus on FinTechs acquisitions performed by BBVA in order  to  understand  the  motives  and  the  strategy  behind  the  deals  and  to  investigate  the consequences  and effects  on the performance of  the bank.  Before analysing the acquisitions performed by BBVA we will briefly illustrate its history sources of competitive advantage and business strategies.  3.2.1 The BBVA Group BBVA is a customercentric global financial services group founded in 1857 as an issuance and discount bank by the Board of Commerce. During the economic development of the 1960s in Spain Banco de Bilbao expanded its business acquiring other banks and creating a financial group.  In  the  meanwhile  Banco  de  Vizcaya  continued  to  grow  and  established  itself  as  a modern bank within an important financial group. After increasing their size and presence in the Spanish banking industry during the 1980s Banco de Bilbao and Banco de Vizcaya agreed to a merger creating the new BBV. In the meanwhile Corporaci  n Bancaria de Espa  a created as a stateowned enterprise and credit institution with the status of a bank merged with other Spanish public banks under the brand of Argentaria.  In 1999 BBV announced its merger with Argentaria a brand born in 1988 representing a group of banks and official credit institutions. The deal between BBV and Argentaria allowed the two banks to reach a strong large financial structure an ample diversification of business and risks and  therefore  greater  potential  for  increasing  its  profits.  BBVA  offers  its  customers  an extensive  distribution  network  a  wider  range  of  products  new  channels  and  a  strong international presence. The integrations process between BBV and Argentaria received a major boost with the adoption of a single BBVA brand in January 2000 favouring the creation of an image base on its own unique identity. One of the main peculiarities of BBVA is its international presence.  Indeed the Group has a strong leadership  position in  the Spanish market  it is  the largest financial institution in Mexico and it has leading franchises in South America and in the South of the US.  The  2008  financial  crisis  posed  new  challenges  for  the  financial  industry  which  faced  an increase in regulatory pressure. Stricter regulatory requirements along with low interest rates  63  and  activities  slowdowns  caused  a  negative  impact  on  profitability  of  the  banking  industry around  the  world.  In  addition  the  financial  industry  is  facing  the  competition  from  new specialized  players  (FinTechs  Tech  giants)  which  base  their  business  models  on  better customer  experience  and  lower  operating  costs.  The  emergence  of  new  entrants  was  also favoured by the development of new technologies (AI Blockchain Big Data Biometrics Data processing  and  Cloud)  characterized  by  automated  data  analysis  algorithms  and  process automation.  BBVA  Group  was  able  to  transform  its  strategy  and  value  proposition  in accordance with the new challenges posed by the financial industry. Considering the customercentric  approach  adopted  by  new  players  and  the  shift  in  customers     needs  BBVA  Group elaborated a new value proposition based on its customers    real needs in order to strengthen the relationship  with  them.  Firstly  BBVA  wants  to  help  its  customers  make  the  best  financial decisions through a clear and transparent offering of financial products and services. Moreover the offering of financial services must be easy and convenient giving customers the possibility of  accessing  the  services  and  using  their  preferred  channels  (digital  or  traditional  channels). Finally the Group wants to provide relevant help and advice so that customers can make their best  financial  decisions.  With  this  aim  BBVA  offers  its  clients  daily  financial  support innovative and personalized products and services.  Customer experience is the first purpose and strategic priority for the Group even if digitization and  innovations  are  essential  to  guarantee  a  better  customer  experience  and  to  become  the leaders in customer satisfaction. Digitization has become the driver of BBVA   s transformation since it is an essential element for boosting digital channels and developing innovative products. To accomplish its transformation and maintain the competitive advantage the Group is actively participating in the disruption of the financial industry caused by the market entry of FinTechs and other Tech giants. For this purpose BBVA elaborated the New Digital Business (NDB) unit and strengthened its position in the FinTech ecosystem investing in FinTech innovations and startups. Besides a better customer experience and a greater digitization the Group aims at  reaching  an optimal capital  allocation to  improve business  profitability  and sustainability and  efficiency  leadership  considering  the  lowprofitability  environment  for  the  financial industry.   3.2.2 BBVA   s strategies in the FinTech sector Since our work focuses on FinTechs acquisitions performed by banks we will concentrate on BBVA   s digitization strategies and results. As  mentioned  above  BBVA  created  the  NDB  unit  in  2015  to  keep  abreast  of  the  digital disruption of the financial industry caused by the FinTech phenomenon. The unit operates as  64  an  independent  entity  between  the  bank  and  the  acquired  companies  and  it  handle  all transactions and deals elaborated by BBVA towards the FinTech ecosystem.  The mission of the new unit consists of four pillars Build Acquire Invest and Partner. The aim of    build    is to recruit experienced entrepreneurs and develop finance and incubate their FinTech ventures at one of the venture creation centres (Madrid San Francisco London) of the Group. With this purpose BBVA created internal ventures with Denizen CoVault Muno and Azlo. Incubated  out  of  BBVA   s  NDB  unit  in  San  Francisco  Denzen  allows  customers  to  receive money in  one country and pay it out  in  another  immediately  avoiding international  transfer fees and eliminating currency exchange fees. In this way Denzen significantly reduces time and  costs  of  international  banking.  CoVault  specialises  in  delivering  super  secure  digital identity and security solutions for both consumers and businesses. Supported by BBVA through NDB unit CoVault launches a new mobile app  aimed at  simplifying the process of storing sharing  and  verifying  online  identities.  This  solution  uses  key  encryption  linked  to  the biometric  signature  on  the  user   s  device  allowing  the  user  to  digitally  protect  his  sensitive information from being accessed without his authorization. Muno is a startup which launched a  new  health  insurance  for  freelancers  to  suit  their  needs  and  solve  their challenging  issues. Finally  Azlo  is  the  first  digital  banking  platforms  offering  free  business  accounts  with unlimited  payments  to  anyone  in  the  US  or  Mexico  and  including  bill  pay  mobile  check deposit and basic digital invoicing in the baseline product. The aim of Azlo is to increase the availability  of  both  domestic  and  crossborder  banking  services  for  both  customers  and businesses. Incubating and financing these FinTech ventures allow BBVA to gain competitive advantage in digital and open banking guaranteeing their customers process transparency faster and cheaper financial solutions and protection of personal data and information.  Another  mission  of  the  new  NDB  unit  is  to  invest  in  FinTech  ventures  and  companies  like Propel  Venture  Partners  and  Atom  bank.  Propel  Venture  Partners  is  an  independent  venture capital  firm  which  provides  opportunities  at  the  intersection  of  technology  and  finance.  As reported  on  the  website  of  BBVA  the  Group  invested  in  two  vehicles  focused  on  financial technology which Propel manages as a third party. Atom is the UK   s first bank exclusively built for smartphones and tablets without traditional physical branches. Through the mobile app customers can carry out all transactions and create their own personalised brand. In March 2018 BBVA announced an additional investment in the UK  digital  bank  to  increase  its  stake.  The  Group  invested  a  further    85.4m  (   96m  approx) increasing  its  ownership  in  the  challenger  bank  to  around  39%.  This  move  shows  BBVA   s confidence in the business strategy of Atom and brings the total invested so far including this  65  latest  tranche  to    167m  (   189m).  The  new  capital  invested  by  BBVA  in  Atom  allows  the digital bank to continue its impressive growth in the UK and offer new products and services.  After Atom Bank BBVA announced an investment in solarisBank a German banking platform following its participation in a Series B funding round. The deal is perfectly in line with the digital transformation process of the Group and it allows BBVA to reinforce its presence in the digital  banking  sector.  solarisBank  the  first  banking  platform  with  a  full  banking  license enables  companies  to  offer  their  own  financial  products  from  solarisBank  and  also  those  of thirdparty providers.  The  NDB  unit  also  aims  at  creating  partnerships  with  FinTechs  and  other  technological innovators.    BBVA  is  working  with  R3  the  consortium  for  financial  innovation  in  the development  of  a  blockchainbased  identity  management  system  for  the  digitization  of  the documentation process of trade finance.  In June 2017 BBVA signed an agreement with Ant Financial Services to allow Chinese tourists to  pay  in  Spanish  stores  using  Alipay  which  is  the  largest  online  and  mobile  payment  and marketing platform. The Group will integrate Alipay into the bank   s Smartpay services which turn smartphones into a payment method. BBVA also created collaborations with Prosper specialized in consumer lending and Ripple a blockchain network that allows the first reallife implementation of an international money transfer using its new DLT.  Finally a key point in BBVA   s FinTech strategy is represented by the acquisition of innovative FinTech  companies  and  technological  disrupters.  As  mentioned  above  BBVA  is  the  most active European bank in the acquisition of FinTechs. The first FinTech company acquired by the Group was Simple in February 2014 followed by Madiva in December 2014 Holvi and Openpay respectively in March and December 2016. Acquisitions of FinTechs play a key role in the digitalization and transformation strategy elaborated by the Group. The first BBVA   s acquisition involved Simple a USbased online banking startup. Founded in 2009 in Portland Simple organized its commercial launch only in 2012. The company offers customers traditional banking services but in an innovative and smarter way. Customers receive a white card (Simple Visa   card) that can be used as a debit card and they can take advantage of features like direct deposit and money transfers. At the moment of the deal Simple served about 100000 customers across the US a fivefold increase since the end of 2012.  The deal  was concluded by the USbased BBVA Compass Bancshares  Inc. (a subsidiary of BBVA)  for  a  value  of  $117m.  After  the  acquisition  Simple  continued  to  operate  separately under the same brand and with the same approach to customer experience. With the help of BBVA Simple developed new products and services and it was able to expand beyond the US  66  and enter new markets considering the international presence of BBVA. Moreover by joining with  the Spanish  bank it  could  jointly  gain  complete endtoend ownership  of the customer experience from the offer to the realization and the sell of financial solutions. In this way both companies increased their degree of flexibility and control on new innovations. The acquisition of Simple helped BBVA to operate a geographical expansion in the US where it operates even now through Compass subsidiary. Indeed at the time of the acquisition the Spanish group had a relatively small presence and influence in the USA. Moreover for BBVA purchasing Simple gave it access to about 100000 new customers in the US and to new technologies that will help BBVA attract more. The deal between BBVA and Simple was a sort of revolution within the banking industry since banks and FinTechs operate with different business models customer approaches and strategies. Indeed Simple as FinTech company was characterized by a very lowcost business model no physical branches and customercentric approach which enabled BBVA to improve its customers    experience and satisfaction.  In December 2014 BBVA acquired Madiva Soluciones a Spanish startup providing services based on big data and cloud computing. Its services simplify existing transactions and create new business opportunities by processing unstructured data and high volumes of information available on Internet. BBVA recognized a great potential in the big data sector and the purchase of Madiva  allowed the  Group to  strengthen its  capabilities in  this sector and to  improve the offering for its clients. After the acquisition Madiva continued to operate as an independent company serving not only its original customer but also BBVA   s clients. For this reason the acquisition was a successful deal for Madiva because it allowed the small Spanish startup to enlarge its customer base and to collaborate with an international banking group which is still now betting on the development of FinTechs. The acquisition turned out to be very successful for both BBVA and the Spanish startup itself. Indeed in August 2018 the Group and Madiva launched BBVA Valora which became BBVA   s flagship product with 150000 queries a month from users providing advice and guidance on home purchase. Madiva played a key role in the elaboration of  BBVA Valora since it developed  an algorithm that helped identify  customers with high purchasing power and limited relationship with BBVA. Madiva   s knowledge about bid data and cloud computing was essential to provide customers a personalised and efficient tool. In  line  with  the  transformation  strategy  BBVA  continued  the  process  of  acquisitions  in  the FinTech sector purchasing Holvi and Openpay in 2016. In March 2016 BBVA announced the strategic acquisition of the Finnish Holvi. Founded in 2011 Holvi provides entrepreneurs small and mediumsized businesses with a range of financial services as well as traditional banking through  its  online  platform.  The  Finnish  company  offers  tools  to  both  collect  money  and  to  67  manage personal finances. Moreover the online platform includes an online sales platform an invoicing facility and a cashflow tracker. Holvi was created with the view to meeting needs and requirements of small entrepreneurs and businesses. Through the latest innovations in FinTech it was able to realize an allinone banking service that streamlines the most complicated and timeconsuming  financial  processes.  Finally  Holvi  is  the  world   s  first  financial  service operating  with  its  own  Payment  Institution  License  regulated  by  the  Financial  Supervisory Authority  of  Finland  (FINFSA).  After  the  deal  Holvi  continued  to  operate  as  a  standalone entity  but  with  an  important  flow  of  knowledge  ideas  and  support  with  BBVA.  Both companies are united by the same vision about the benefit of technology and innovation for the customer. From BBVA   s perspective the acquisition enabled it to further develop a new digital approach to small business banking while for Holvi the purchase gave it the necessary room to grow and the scale and expertise to consolidate that growth.  At present (2019) BBVA   s last acquisition in the FinTech ecosystem is Openpay occurred in December  2016.Openpay  is  a  Mexican  payment  service  provider  (PSP)  which  facilitates  ecommerce for large businesses and SMEs a critical customer segment for traditional banks. It was founded in 2013 with the aim of building a    onestop shop    for ecommerce providing a real time online platform which allows users to make card cash and loyaltypoints payments and interbank transfers. Thanks to Openpay a business can start processing different types of payments and bank transfers through a single integration reducing its operating costs. Openpay operates  in  Mexico  through  Paynet  its  own  global  network  of  more  than  15000  (in  2018) associated  pointsofsale.  Through  Paynet  Openpay  enables  cash  payments  for  online purchases and it manages more than one million transactions a month. The online platform also uses advanced tools to prevent fraud and protect customers    accounts. Indeed it analysed each transaction in real time with its antifraud system to prevent fraudulent charges and it has the PCIDDS certification (an international security standard in the handling of payment data) for handling  and  storing  card  private  information.  The  acquisition  did  not  imply  any  operating changes  or  changes  in  fees  for  existing  Openpay  customers.  They  continued  operating  as usually but enjoying an additional level of reassurance since they are now backed by a more stable  and  stronger  company.  The  transaction  with  Openpay  was  conducted  by  BBVA Bancomer the business  unit of BBVA operating in Mexico. Through the acquisition BBVA Bancomer  increased  its  range  of  online  payments  solutions  while  Openpay  strengthened  its commercial role by collaborating with Mexico   s largest bank. The synergies between the bank and the startup improved the commercial capacities of both companies complemented their catalogue of products for retail clients and allowed them to strengthen their payment solutions. Since Openpay is even now one of the principal innovators in Latin America in payments its  68  acquisition  also  represented  an  important  step  forward  for  Mexican  banking.  In  this  way  it opened to the new financial players that are able to satisfy users    needs in a more agile fashion. Moreover ecommerce is on the rise around the world and in Mexico in particular driven by tremendous growth in digital payments. The acquisition of Openpay perfectly falls in BBVA   s strategy of digitalization and it reinforces one of the bank   s strategic priorities offering a better customer experience in line with new customers    needs. This transaction enabled the Group to remain at the cutting edge of payments systems bringing numerous benefits also for customers. Along with the acquisitions performed in the previous years the purchase of Openpay showed BBVA   s commitment to digital transformation in order to revolutionize the banking industry in accordance with FinTech innovations.  Analysing all the acquisitions performed by BBVA until now it emerges the attention of the Spanish Group towards technological innovations brought by FinTech in the financial industry. BBVA has always declared that digital transformation is one of the priorities of its strategy and it  seeks  to  achieve  this  goal  investing  incubating  and  acquiring  FinTech  ventures  and companies.  In  the  context  of  FinTechs  acquisitions  BBVA  can  be  considered  as  an  early adopter  of  these  innovations  following  the     diffusion  of  innovation     theory  elaborated  by Rogers. Indeed considering the sample of FinTechs transactions mentioned in Table 1 BBVA performed the first acquisition of a FinTech company in the history of the banking industry and it is also the most active European banks in the purchase of new players. All the acquisitions of FinTechs performed by the Group are united by its commitment to digital transformation  to  improve  customer  experience  and  offer  better  financial  solutions. Technological innovation has become an essential source of value and competitive advantage for companies. Indeed many authors (Uhlenbruck et al. 2006; King et al. 2008; Makri et al. 2012) argued that companies turn to acquisitions as  an alternative strategy  for obtaining  the knowledge  necessary  to  create  innovations.  This  is  the  strategy  adopted  by  BBVA  in  the acquisitions of FinTechs. Given technological advances and shifts in customers    needs BBVA understood the key role of digital innovation in the banking industry. Indeed the acquisitions of FinTechs allowed BBVA to obtain and integrate knowledge and capabilities from acquiring firms  to  better  meet  customers     requirements  and  to  face  the  fierce  competition  from  new technological players. Through these transactions BBVA also gained access to growing sectors of FinTech such as digital banking online payments solutions big data and cloud computing. BBVA  can  now  offer  its  clients  cheaper  (FinTechs  generally  apply  lower  charges  fees  and interest rates) and faster traditional banking services guaranteeing them more transparency of processes and more security of personal information.   69   Except  for  Madiva  Soluciones  the  other  three  acquisitions  performed  by  BBVA  are  crossborder transactions toward the US Finland and Mexico. In accordance with academic literature there are several reasons that can induce companies to perform crossborder acquisitions rather than domestic transactions (Datta 2018). Analysing the  crossborder  acquisitions  performed  by  BBVA  we  refer  only  to  some  motives  such  as growth  synergies  increase  in  market  power  and  market  entry  and  access  to  inputs  and technology.  Expansion  and  growth  through  M&As  are  less  time  consuming  and  more  cost effective than internally developing the necessary production capability and capacity. Indeed the realization of new facilities and infrastructures requires investments and so it may be more profitable  to  acquire  existing  facilities  of  another  company.  This  reason  is  in  line  with  the strategy  declared  by  BBVA  even  if  the  Spanish  Group  is  also  committed  to  incubating  and financing FinTech ventures. Another motive is linked to the realization of potential synergies between the bidder and the target company. Combining their efforts and resources firms can produce  better  results  with  lower  operating  costs.  In  the  case  of  BBVA  the  acquisitions  of FinTechs may allow the Spanish bank to realize operating synergies in terms of higher growth in new (the US Mexico Finland) or existing markets (Spain). Crossborder transactions can also allow acquired company to gain access to new markets. In this case a foreign company prefers to acquire a local firm which knows the market and has an established  customer  base.  In  the  case  of  BBVA  crossborder  acquisitions  allow  it  to geographically expand and strengthen its presence in markets such as the US and Mexico where it  had  a  relatively  small  impact.  At  the  time  of  Simple  acquisition  the  FinTech  financing activity in the US far exceeded that of every other country as reported by Accenture. The US market was characterized by the highest rate of Fintech investments (about $10000m) and deals (more than 500). The trends of the US market and its attention on FinTech innovations attracted BBVA which strengthened and differentiated its original strategy by directly acquiring FinTech companies. Focusing on the acquisition of Openpay BBVA performed the deal in a moment of tremendous  growth  for  the  Mexican  FinTech  sector.  BBVA  was  and  is  still  now  one  of  the largest banks that dominate Mexico. The strong position of the Group in Mexico gave it the opportunity  to  acquire  a  Mexican  startup  to  consolidate  its  presence  not  only  within  the traditional  banking  system  but  also  in  the  innovative  FinTech  ecosystem.  Moreover  crossborder transactions also enabled BBVA to enlarge its customer base gaining access to acquired firms    customers. Finally companies generally perform crossborder operations to gain access to technology and latest innovations. This perfectly reflects the commitment of BBVA to digital transformation and  innovation  of  its  business  model.  Indeed  BBVA  acquired  inputs  and  technologies  of  70  FinTechs in both domestic and crossborder transactions. As mentioned above BBVA gained access to innovations as digital banking online payments solutions big data and data analytics which are the most disruptive FinTech innovation for the retail banking sector.  Summing up the acquisitions of FinTechs performed so far are based on three objectives of BBVA   s  strategy  accelerate  the  digital  transformation  process  of  the  Group  integrate knowledge  and  capabilities  about  latest  technological  innovations  and  gain  access  to  new customers.  3.3 Effects of acquisitions on companies    performance Literature Review In the previous paragraph we analysed investments partnerships and acquisitions of FinTechs performed  by  BBVA  to  reach  a  new  objective  accelerate  its  digital  transformation.  We described the different initiatives of the Spanish banking group in the FinTech ecosystem. We mainly  concentrated  on  FinTech  acquisitions  to  understand  the  strategic  motives  of  BBVA behind  such  operations.  Now  we  will  try  to  investigate  the  effects  of  such  acquisitions  on BBVA   s performance. However before focusing on BBVA   s acquisitions we briefly describe the  main  findings  in  academic  literature  about  the  performance  of  companies  after  M&A operations.  Many  studies  in  the  academic  literature  compared  the  accounting  statements  of  companies before  and  after  acquisitions  to  investigate  whether  and  how  they  affect  the  firms     financial performance. There are two distinct methodologies that can be applied to study the financial effects of takeover (Rahman and Limmack 2004; Guest et al. 2012). On one side profitability studies  compare  the  postacquisition  performance  of  the  acquirer  with  the  preacquisition performance of the acquiring and acquired firm. On the other side share return event studies examine the share price impact of the transaction on the acquired and acquiring firms. Since in our work we will follow the approach of profitability studies we will describe the main findings of profitability studies in the academic literature. Considering academic studies about M&A operations in the US they show inconsistent result. Indeed  some  authors  found  no  or  negative  impacts  on  companies     postacquisition performance  while  others  identified  a  positive  effect  of  M&A  operations  on  firms    performance and profitability. The inconsistency of profitability studies may be due to different methodologies employed and different sample selection. Mueller (1980) reviewed a sample of studies across seven nations (Belgium Germany France the Netherlands Sweden the UK and the US) about the effects of M&A operations on corporate performance.  The  author  noticed  no  consistent  pattern  of  either  improved  or  deteriorated profitability after acquisitions.  71  Ravenscraft and Scherer (1989) compared premerger and postmerger profitability of 2732 lines  of  business  by  US  manufacturing  companies  during  the  period  19571977.  Acquired companies  were  found  to  be  extraordinary  profitable  before  the  acquisition  especially  the smallest firms. After the merger the profitability of acquired companies declined and so the authors  concluded  that  mergers  have  substantial  negative  impact  on  the  postacquisition profitability. Clark and Ofek (1994) Philippatos and Baird (1996) and Denis et al. (1997) also found that acquisitions do not  lead to an improvement in  firms    performance. Ghosh (2001) argued  that  operating  performance  does  not  improve  after  an  acquisition.  The  author investigated  the  performance  of  315  US  mergers  occurred  between  1981  and  1995  using control firms as benchmark. Considering firms matched on performance and size as benchmark the author found no evidence that operating performance improves following acquisitions. In addition the results of this study indicated that cash flows (used by many authors to measure financial  performance)  increase  significantly  only  in  case  of  cash  acquisitions  while  they decline for stock acquisitions. Healy et al. (1992) examined the postacquisition operating performance of merged firms using a sample of the 50 largest mergers in the US between 1979 and 1983. Unlike Ravenscarft and Scherer (1989) measuring companies    performance through operating cash flow returns the authors found that combined firms have significant improvements in cash flow. These increase in  cash  flow  result  from  improvements  in  asset  productivity  relative  to  firms     industries. However this study has been criticized for using industry median firms as benchmark.  Switzer (1996) continued the Healy et al. (1992) study to analyse performance changes of a larger sample of 324 takeovers in the US during the period 19671987. The results indicated that  the  performance  of  the  merged  companies  typically  improved  after  the  transaction considering a substantially larger sample and time period with respect to Healy et al. (1992).  Ramaswamy and Waegelein (2003) examined the financial performance of target and acquiring firms using a sample of US companies during the period 19751990. The study followed the methodology of Healy  et al.  (1992) adopting industryadjusted cash flow returns on market value of assets as performance criteria. Comparing the premerger and a fiveyear postmerger period  the  authors  observed  a  significant  improvement  in  postacquisition  performance.  In addition  the  results  indicated  that  postmerger  performance  is  negatively  associated  with relative target size and positively correlated with longterm incentive compensation plans.  Looking at the UK Dickerson et al. (1997) investigated the impact of acquisitions on company performance  using  a  sample  of  613  mergers  between  19481977.  The  results  indicated  that acquisitions  have  a  detrimental  impact  of  company  performance  comparing  the  ROA  of  72  acquiring  and  nonacquiring  firms.  Moreover  the  authors  underlined  that  company  growth through acquisitions yields a lower rate of return that growth through internal investment.  Manson et al. (2000) further investigated a sample of 44 acquisitions in the UK between 1985 and 1985 following the methodology adopted by Healy  et al.  (1992). The authors found out evidence  of  both  operating  and  nonoperating  gains  from  takeovers  in  UK.  However  these results are sensitive to how operating performance and associated gains are measured.  Powell and Stark (2005) analysed a sample of takeovers completed in the UK over the period 1985  to  1993  using  several  benchmarks  and  operating  performance  measures.  The  authors found that acquisition result in modest improvements in operating performance even if these results strongly depend on the methodology adopted for the analysis. Indeed using a procedure in which benchmark firms are selected on the basis of several pretakeover characteristics the authors found a slight increase in postacquisition performance for acquiring firm. Using the methodology  developed  by  Healy  et  al.  (1992)  in  which  posttakeover  performance  is regressed on a combined target and acquirer preacquisition performance the results indicated larger improvements in postacquisition operating performance.  Cosh et al. (2006) analysed the performance of 363 takeovers in the UK completed in the period 19851996.  Measuring  the  takeover  performance  as  changes  in  companies     operating performance  the  results  indicated  that  takeovers  have  a  positive  but  not  always  significant impact on profitability and negative impact on short and long run returns.  From the studies in the UK analysed before it emerged that most of them showed a positive correlation between M&A operations and companies    postmerger performance. We can also find inconsistent results in studies that consider other countries in Europe and in the rest of the world.   In a review paper Bruner (2002) analysed a sample of 15 studies from 1971 to 2001 analysing the  postacquisition  financial  performance  of  firms.  The  author  reported  that  four  studies evidenced a negative performance after the acquisition three studies indicated a positive impact of  the  acquisition  on  the  performance  and  eight  studies  showed  nonsignificant  changes between the premerger and the postmerger firms    performance.  The methodology of cash flow developed by Healy et al. (1992) was also adopted by Sharma and  Hao  (2002).  The  study  investigated  the  improvement  in  postacquisition  operating efficiency of a sample of manufacturing firms during 19861991 in Australia. Unlike Healy et al. (1992) the authors used matched sample based on assets size and industry to  control for industry and economic factors. However the results showed that corporate acquisitions do not lead to significant improvements in postacquisition operating performance.   73  Gugler  et  al.  (2003)  analysed  the  effects  of  mergers  around  the  world  (the  US  the  UK Continental Europe Australia Canada and New Zeland) by using a large panel of data over the past 15 years. The authors examined the effects of the mergers by comparing profitability and sales of the merging firms with control groups of nonmerging firms. They observed that takeovers produced no significant decline in companies    performance.  Rahman and Limmack (2004) examined the financial performance of a sample of Malaysian companies  involved  in  acquisitions  in  the  period  19881992.  The  aim  of  the  study  was  to investigate  whether  takeovers  in  Malaysia  lead  to  an  improvement  in  corporate  operating performance analysing companies    operating cash flow performance. The results suggested that acquisition performed by Malaysian companies led to improvements in the long run operating cash flow performance. Such improvements came from both increases in return on sales and in asset turnover.  Ooghe  et  al.  (2006)  analysed  the  impact  of  acquisitions  on  a  sample  of  143  privately  held companies in Belgium between 1992 and 1994. Specifically this study examined the financial performance of the acquiring firm after the acquisition using statistical analysis of industryadjusted variables. The results indicated that after the transaction the profitability the solvency and the liquidity of most of the combined companies decline.  Mantravadi and Reddi (2008) examined the postmerger performance of acquiring firms from different industries in India. The authors adopted a sample of mergers in India between 1991 and 2003 and they compared some premerger and postmerger financial ratios to investigate the impacts of M&A operations on the performance of acquiring firms. The authors found that mergers  have  a  slightly  positive  impact  on  firms     profitability  in  the  banking  and  financial industry while other sectors showed a marginal negative impact on operating performance. Kumar  (2009)  examined  the  postmerger  operating  performance  of  acquiring  companies involved in M&A operations between 1999 and 2002 in India. The author compared the premerger and postmerger performance of companies using accounting data to investigate merger related gains to the acquiring firms. He found that postmerger profitability asset turnover and solvency of the acquiring firms on average show no improvement when compared with premerger  values.  Therefore  he  concluded  that  mergers  usually  do  not  improve  the  acquirer   s financial performance. Finally  Rani  et  al.  (2013)  investigated  the  impact  of  M&A  transactions  on  corporate performance comparing the performance of companies before and after the transaction. The results  pertaining  to  operating  cash  flow  ratios  showed  that  there  is  an  improvement  in performance of the acquiring firms in the postacquisition period. The authors conducted the same  analysis  applying  the  Du  Pont  model  and  they  showed  that  M&A  operations  lead  to  74  improvements in the longterm operating profit margin of the acquiring firms. They concluded that  increases  in  cash  flows  after  the  transaction  are  generated  primarily  due  to  the  better operating  margins.  As  for  the  US  and  the  UK  studies  mentioned  above  findings  related  to Indian M&A operations show opposite conclusion by different authors. From  our  analysis  it  emerged  that  the  academic  literature  is  divided  about  the  relationship between  M&A  operations  and  their  impact  on  companies     postmerger  performance.  The findings of different authors have not converged to a conclusion whether M&A operations are creating  or  destroying  value  for  the  companies  involved.  We  found  inconsistent  results  in studies conducted in the US the UK and in other countries. Different findings may be due to different methodologies different samples of M&A operations and economic characteristics of different countries. The prevailing theory in the literature is that M&A operations have no or negative impact on the postmerger performance of both acquired and acquiring firms.  3.4 Methodology Objective In our work we analyse profitability and efficiency of the acquiring firm (BBVA) before and after  the  four  acquisitions  (Simple  Madiva  Soluciones  Holvi  and  Openpay)  to  investigate whether the transactions have an impact on the postacquisition performance of the acquirer. To investigate the effect of acquisitions on performance we analyse ROE ROA and CIR of the acquiring company before and after the transactions. Research methodology Most of the authors in the academic literature conducted empirical analysis to investigate the impacts  of  M&A  operations  on  companies     performance.  They  developed  statistical  models which compared the premerger and postmerger performance of both acquiring and acquired firms to assess whether the transaction creates benefits for both entities. In our dissertation we conduct  a  quantitative  analysis  focusing  only  on  the  financial  performance  of  the  acquiring company (BBVA). We do not examine acquired firms    performance since it is difficult to find financial statements and data of small FinTech startups. To  realize  our  analysis  we  use  secondary  data  from  the  financial  statements  of  BBVA  in relation to the years of the transactions (2014 and 2016).  Research Hypothesis to test the objective mentioned above we formulate the following general hypothesis H0 BBVA   s acquisitions have no impact on the posttransaction performance of the acquiring company.  75  H1  BBVA   s  acquisitions  have  impact  on  the  posttransaction  performance  of  the  acquiring company. We adopt the methodology of comparing premerger and postmerger performance (in terms of profitability and efficiency) of the acquiring firm using the following financial ratios Return on equity (ROE) Return on asset (ROA) CosttoIncome ratio (CIR) In chapter 2 we also mentioned Net Interest Margin (NIM) as a traditional indicator to measure the financial performance of banks. However in the financial statements of BBVA we found only annual data of NIM and not quarterly data as for the other financial ratios. Using annual data the two acquisitions performed in 2014 would present the same values of preacquisition and postacquisition NIM. The same issue would also occur for the two acquisitions in 2016. Reducing  the  number  of  observations  from  4  to  2  may  cause  a  further  decrease  in  the significance of the results. For this reason we exclude NIM from our analysis. The acquisitions of our sample occurred in February 2014 December 2014 March 2016 and December  2016.  Therefore  we  decide  to  examine  quarterly  financial  ratios  of  BBVA  to investigate  the  potential  effects  of  the  operations  on  the  postacquisition performance  of  the Spanish Group. Many authors (Healy et al.1992; Manson et al.2000; Ghosh 2001; Rahman and  Limmack  2004)  suggest  investigating  the  effects  of  M&As  on  corporate  performance considering  two  or  more  years  before  and  after  the  transactions.  A  sufficient  long  period  is needed to investigate and understand the impact of an acquisition since efficiency and operating performance  improve  over  a  longtime  horizon  and  not  within  short  periods.  However  we cannot adopt this time interval especially for the latest two acquisitions (occurred in 2016) due to the lack of financial data after 2017. So we examine financial ratios    changes in the shortterm i.e. one year before and one year after the acquisitions.  Since the acquisitions of Simple and Madiva Soluciones occurred in the same year (2014) but in different months (February and December) we consider the financial ratios of BBVA at the date of the acquisition. The same is valid for the two acquisitions occurred in 2016 (March and December). The quarter of each acquisition is denoted as t=0 while oneyear before and after are indicated as t=1 and t=+1 respectively.  Tables from 2 to 5 represent the financial ratios of BBVA for each transaction.  76   Table 2 BBVA   s financial ratios for the acquisition of Simple Financial 1 0 +1 ratios ROE 16.2 5.5 9 ROA 1.25 0.51 0.73 CIR 50.4 51.7 49.9  Table 3 BBVA   s financial for the acquisition of Madiva Soluciones Financial 1 0 +1 ratios ROE 5 ROA 0.48 5.6 0.5 5.3 0.46 CIR 52.3 51.3 52  Table 4 BBVA   s financial ratios for the acquisition of Holvi Financial 1 0 +1 ratios ROE 9 5.6 9.1 ROA 0.73 0.52 0.84 CIR 49.3 54.8 49.1  Table 5 BBVA   s financial ratios for the acquisition of Openpay Financial 1 0 +1 ratios ROE 5.3 6.7 6.4 ROA 0.46 0.64 0.68 CIR 52 51.9 49.5  Paired ttest Preacquisition  and  postacquisition  data  are  tested  for  normality  assumption  to  establish whether the paired ttest can be applied. Using ShapiroWilk normality test we found that data of ROE ROA and CIR both before and after the acquisition follow a normality distribution. Indeed the pvalue is greater than the significance level (  =5%) for ROE ROA and CIR pre 77  acquisition and postacquisition values. Since the normality assumption is satisfied by all the three samples we can apply a paired ttest to verify our hypothesis. Following the approach adopted by Ramakrishnan (2008) and Singh (2013) we compare preacquisition and postacquisition financial ratios of BBVA using paired ttest to examine if there is any statistically significant change in operating performance.  We apply the paired ttest for our analysis since each financial ratio in each transaction is tested twice (before and after the transaction). This  means that the observations are paired data. A paired ttest is a parametric test which is used to compare the means of two variables from the same group (Ramakrishnan 2008). It determines whether the difference between the means of the  two  variables  is  significantly  different  from  zero.  In  our  case  the  two  variables  are  the financial  ratios  of  the  acquiring  firm  before  and  after  the  transaction.  The  paired  ttest  thus determines  whether  there  is  a  significant  difference  between  the  means  of  the  two  periods (before  and  after  the  acquisition)  for  the  financial  ratio.  If  the  mean  difference  of  the  two variables is significantly different from zero it means that the acquisition has an effect (positive or negative) on the performance of the acquiring company. If the mean difference is equal to zero we can conclude that the acquisition has no impact on the corporate performance.  For each financial ratio we conduct a paired ttest based on the following hypotheses  ROE H0 Acquisitions have no significant impact on acquiring firm   s ROE H1 Acquisitions have significant impact on acquiring firm   s ROE ROA H0 Acquisitions have no significant impact on acquiring firm   s ROA H1 Acquisitions have significant impact on acquiring firm   s ROA  CIR H0 Acquisitions have no significant impact on acquiring firm   s CIR H1 Acquisitions have significant impact on acquiring firm   s CIR  We now illustrate the main steps to conduct a paired ttest. Firstly we elaborate the hypothesis that we want to test H0   d =0 H1   d    0  where   d is the mean difference. Secondly  we  calculate  the  differences  (henceforth     di   )  between  preacquisition  and  postacquisition data for each transaction. Now di represent our sample of data. To conduct a paired ttest  we  need  to  calculate  the  mean  difference  (    i)  the  standard  deviation  (Sdi)  of  the  78  differences  and  the  standard  error  of  the  mean  difference  (SE(    i)).  The  mean  difference  is defined as the mean of the paired differences    di   . The standard error of the mean difference is computed as SE(    i) =Our test statistic is                  where n is the number of differences.      =    i       0SE(    i) where    0  is  equal  to  zero.  Indeed  in  our  null  hypothesis  H0  we  assume  that  there  is  no difference between preacquisition and postacquisition financial ratios of the acquiring firm. The  tvalue  is  then  compared  to  the  pvalue  to  decide  whether  to  accept  or  reject  the  null hypothesis H0.  The values of these steps are reported in Tables from 6 to 11.  Results of the paired ttest  Using software R to conduct the paired ttest we report the outcomes for the three financial ratios in Table 6.  Table 6 Results of paired ttest for the financial ratios of the acquiring firm Financial Oneyear Oneyear after     i SE(    i) tpvalue ratios before (mean) (mean) value (twotailed) ROE 8.875 ROA 0.73 CIR 51 7.45 0.6825 50.125 *Not significant at 5% significance level  ROE 1.425 1.937 0.736  0.515* 0.0475 0.1586 0.299  0.784* 0.875 0.545 1.605  0.207* The mean difference of preacquisition and postacquisition ROE is equal to 1.425 the tvalue is 0.736 with a pvalue (twotailed) at 0.515. Choosing a significance level (  ) equal to 5% the pvalue  is  greater  than    .  Therefore  we  cannot  reject  H0  which  states  that  there  the  four acquisitions performed by BBVA have no significant impact on the acquiring company   s ROE. Failing to  reject  H0 we can conclude that there is  no difference in  preacquisition and postacquisition ROE of the acquirer. Looking at the means of ROE before and after the transaction the results show a decrease in ROE from 8.8% to 7.5%. This decrease might cause a negative effect  on  the  performance  of  the  acquiring  firm.  However  it  is  not  statistically  significant reduction since the pvalue (0.515) is greater than the significance level (  =5%).    79  ROA The table above illustrates that the mean difference of ROA is equal to 0.6825 with a tvalue at 0.299 and a pvalue (twotailed) at 0.784. Fixing the significance level    at 5% it results a pvalue  greater  than    .  Therefore  we  cannot  reject  H0  which  states  that  the  four  acquisitions performed by the Spanish Group have no significant impact on its postacquisition ROA. Since our test fails to reject H0 we can conclude that a significant difference between ROA before and  after  the  transaction  does  not  exist.  From  the  table  above  it  emerges  a  decline  in  ROA (average)  from  0.73%  to  0.68%.  Although  this  reduction  might  negatively  affect  the performance of BBVA it is not statistically significant given pvalue >   .  CIR The mean difference related to CIR is equal to 0.875 the tvalue is 1.605 with a twotailed pvalue at 0.207. Since the pvalue is greater than the significance level (  =55%) we cannot reject H0. We can conclude that there is no a significant difference between the preacquisition and postacquisition CIR of the acquiring company. Therefore it emerged that the four acquisitions performed by BBVA have no significant impact on its postacquisition CIR.  As for ROE and ROA also posttransaction CIR reduces with respect to the value before the acquisition (from 51% to 50.12%). With a pvalue greater than    we can state that the reduction is not statistically significant for the acquiring company.                    80  Conclusions  Considering  the  great  development  of  FinTechs  and  the  increasing  interest  of  banks  in  the FinTech  ecosystem  our  work  focuses  on  the  relationship  between  FinTechs  and  traditional banks. Particularly the  aim of  the dissertation is  to  assess whether acquisitions of FinTechs have a significant impact on the financial performance of acquiring banks.  We  referred  to  performance  in  terms  of  profitability  and  efficiency  of  banks  which  are measured  through  return  on  asset  (ROA)  return  on  equity  (ROE)  and  costtoincome  ratio (CIR).  To  investigate  this  issue  we  considered  the  four  acquisitions  of  FinTech  companies performed by the international banking group BBVA in 2014 and 2016. We choose BBVA   s acquisitions  since  the  Spanish  Group  is  the  most  active  European  player  in  the  FinTech ecosystem and acquirer of FinTechs. The initial objective of our work is to test whether the four acquisitions have a significant impact on  BBVA   s  postacquisition  ROA  ROE  and  CIR  comparing  preacquisition  and  postacquisition values. From the results obtained for the financial ratios we will infer acquisitions    global effect on the postacquisition performance of the acquiring firm.   The  financial  ratios  related  to  each  acquisition  are  measured  one  year  before  and  after  the acquisition to examine their change after the transactions. Since the values of each financial ratios are measured twice (before and after the acquisition) they can be considered as paired data. Verified the normality assumptions of financial ratios    values we conducted a paired ttest  to  investigate  whether  the  acquisitions  influence  postacquisition  financial  ratios  of  the acquiring  firm.  Three  hypotheses  were  formulated  to  assess  whether  BBVA   s  acquisitions significantly  affect  ROA  ROE  and  CIR  of  the  acquiring  company.  We  assumed  as  null hypothesis (H0) that acquisitions have no significant effect on the postacquisition ROE ROA and  CIR  while  the  twotailed  alternative  hypothesis  (H1)  stated  that  a  significant  difference between preacquisition and postacquisition financial ratios exists.   Considering the return on equity the results reported in Table 12 indicate a pvalue greater than the significance level (  =5%). Therefore we cannot reject H0 and so we can conclude that there is no significant difference between the preacquisition and postacquisition ROE. Moreover the  results  show  a  reduction  in  the  mean  ROE  which  declined  from  8.8%  to  7.5%  after  the acquisitions. Although this decline might indicate a negative impact of the acquisitions on the posttransaction  ROE  it  is  not  statistically  significant  given  that  pvalue  is  greater  than  the significance level. Analysing this profitability ratio we can conclude that the four acquisitions performed  by  BBVA  do  not  have  a  significant  impact  on  its  return  on  equity  after  the transactions.   81  The second paired ttest is conducted to examine the impact of acquisitions on acquiring firm   s return on asset. The results of the paired ttest show a pvalue greater than the significance level (  =5%).  So  we  cannot  reject  the  null  hypothesis  which  states  a  no  significant  impact  of acquisitions on acquiring company   s ROA after the transactions. Failing to reject H0 we can state that acquisitions do not cause a significant change in the return on asset of the acquiring company. In addition the mean of ROA reduces from 0.73% before the acquisition to 0.68% after the transaction even though this decline is not statistically significant. Finally  we  test  the  effect  of  acquisitions  on  the  CIR  of  the  acquiring  company.  As  for  the profitability ratios the results of the paired ttest highlight a pvalue greater than the significant level (  =5%). Since we cannot reject H0 we conclude that acquisitions do not have a significant impact on the cost efficiency of the acquiring firm after the transactions. Indeed the paired ttest do not show any significant difference between CIR before and after the acquisitions. The cost efficiency mean also diminishes after the transactions from 51% to 50.12% although this reduction cannot be considered statistically significant (pvalue is greater than   =5%). Considering these results we can state that the acquisitions performed by BBVA do not have any significant impact on its postacquisition ROE ROA and CIR. Therefore we can conclude that BBVA   s acquisitions do not significantly affect the performance of the acquiring firm.  The results of our work are in line with some findings of profitability studies in the academic literature. As mentioned above in the literature review authors are divided about the impacts of M&A operations on the performance of the acquiring companies. Some authors (Healy et al. 1992; Manson et al.2000; Ramaswamy and Waegelein 2003; Rahman and Limmack 2004; Powell  and  Stark  2005)  argued  a  positive  impact  of  acquisitions  on  the  performance  of acquiring and acquired companies. However most of the academic studies cited in our work (Mueller1980;  Ravenscraft and Scherer1989; Clark and Ofek 1994;  Philippatos and Baird 1996; Denis et al. 1997; Dickerson et al.1997 Ghosh2001; Kumar2009) found no or negative effect of M&A operations on the performance of the companies involved in the transactions. Differences  may  be  due  to  different  methodologies  different  samples  of  companies  and different accounting measures.  Although  our  findings  are  in  line  with  some  previous  academic  studies  they  are  not  out  of limitations.  A  first  limitation  of  our  analysis  is  linked  to  the  small  sample  size.  Indeed  we measure ROE ROA and CIR of BBVA only in relation to four acquisitions. Small sample size can lead to some issues in interpreting the statistical results especially in terms of pvalue. The sample size is strictly related to the confidence in the estimates uncertainty and precision. A small  sample size generally leads to  lower confidence in  the results greater uncertainty  and lower  precision  and  statistical  power.  Indeed  the  results  of  our  analysis  are  not  statistically  82  significant for all the three financial ratios. The small sample size is due to the small number of FinTech acquisitions performed by traditional banks. Acquisition of FinTechs is a very recent phenomenon in the traditional banking sector since initially banks considered FinTechs only as competitors and not as sources of competitive advantages. In our work we focused on BBVA   s FinTechs acquisitions since it is the European banks with the highest number of acquisitions in the FinTech ecosystem.  A second limitation in our analysis is the time interval adopted to measure the financial ratios of  BBVA  for  the  acquisitions.  Most  of  the  studies  in  the  academic  literature  measure  the financial ratios from two to five years before and after the acquisitions. Indeed many authors argued that potential effects (positive or negative) on profitability and efficiency emerge only in  the  longterm.  However  we  adopted  a  shortterm  horizon  due  to  the  unavailability  of financial data after 2017. The choice of a longer time interval would have excluded from our analysis  the  two  acquisitions  performed  in  March  and  December  2016  further  reducing  the sample size.                       83  Appendix  In the following tables we report the intermediary results necessary to conduct the paired ttest.
