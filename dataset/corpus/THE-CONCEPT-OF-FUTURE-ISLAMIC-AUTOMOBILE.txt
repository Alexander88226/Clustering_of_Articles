There  is  3  issues  in  developing  the  new concept of Islamic financing in automobile industries. financing  product Firstly awareness.  Secondly is  conflict  between conventional  financing  and  Islamic  Hire  purchase financing product and new technology and maqasid syariah perspectives.  Islamic  automobile there  2.0  ISLAMIC  AUTOMOBILE FINANCING PRODUCT AWARENESS  in According  to  Amin  H.  (2007)  customers  of  Islamic banking  products  especially Islamic  vehicle financing products have not been fully explored. This has  been found  by (Hamid and Nordin  2001; Metawa and Almossawi 1998; Gerrard and Cunningham1997; and Haron et  al.1994).  He  said there was a need to explore Islamic car financing in Borneo. The  research  model  covers  three  aspects namely and use of banking products  choice  of  banking  method and information medium. The results show that there is a  good  awareness  of  the  product  either  BBA  or AITAB. That  is 79.3  per  cent  and  74.5  per  cent  of respondents know about BBA AITAB financing products . From  perspective  approach  as much  as 70.31%  chose  to  come  over  the  counter  to awareness Islamic and information process  the  financing  documents. From  the  bottom from line  most  customers  get television. Therefore  bank  managers  need to their  product  marketing  programs understand according to their  gender  and  education differences.                     3.0  CONFLICT  BETWEEN  CONVENTIONAL CONCEPTS AND ISLAMIC HIRE PURCHASE AUTOMOBILE FINANCING PRODUCT  of 1986; points perceptions ( Fierstein   However  Islamic  automobile  basically  its  replicating the conventional framework in the area of consumer behaviours.  According to  Trocchia P. J. &  Beatty S. E. (2003) the most basic things are consumer behavior as Rosenbaum 1972) and (Belk  1988). Individuals  often  associate themselves with  the  things  they  have. But  there  are other view (Berry and Maricle  19 73; Durgee and O\'Connor 1995) that question why consumers are increasingly choosing to use  items  without  owning  them . Where they  can use items that are usually rented and leased by users including  apartments  and  cars. In  fact in  1983  there were  3000  independent  stores in  the  United  States and  by  1997  it  had grown  to  over  8000 . However it is still  limited  to  the  model  of  decisions  related  to economic  costs  and  the  interest  of  financing  the lease . Therefore there are four main motives related to automotive rental financing versus  purchasing decisions. Firstly  is a desire to diversify the needs and   22 \\x0cRamli et al. / Research Colloquium 2019 Vol. 1  (2019) 2225  a in will the are come ( riba ) interest as a agreements promotion of conventional  satisfaction  a in Shariah compliant the  person  can  use secondly  to  get  easy  maintenance. Then  thirdly  is satisfaction  and  lastly  is  upgrading  in  terms  of  the choice of slab model keeping the monthly payments low. The motivational discussion of the concept of use without  ownership  is  supported  by  decision  factors such  as  car  depreciation interest rates   cash  flow estimates  capital  costs  and  tax  rates. Even  shorter rental motivating factor. It allows manufacturers  and  retailers  to  better understand  why  a  large  percentage  of  the  market chooses  to  rent  rather  than  buy. Ads  of rental autos and way to obtain  vehicles for  those  shortcomings  money  than borrowing  money. With  aggressive  promotion as information expectations of behavior ownd car as the  car comfortable  stylish  and  fun  to  drive  it. However the concept  of hire  purchase  in  Islam  differs  from conventional. According to (Journal of Ijarah). Rent in Arabic  is  known  as Ij\\xc4\\x81rah resembling  \'lease\'  or  \'rent purchase\' banking system . It promises  the   profit  legally  while  avoiding usury financial transactions . The objectives of transaction are known as Maqasid Shariah. For the Islamic rental concept it must  comply   to  the  requirements  of  the  three categories  ( d ar \\xc5\\xab r \\xc4\\xab )  needs  ( \\xe1\\xb8\\xa5 \\xc4\\x81 j \\xc4\\xab )  and  luxury Imam Al Ghazali categorizes  his ( ta \\xe1\\xb8\\xa5 s i n i ). While objectives into main categories; religious objectives ( d\\xc4\\xabn\\xc4\\xab )  and  worldly goals  ( dunyaw\\xc4\\xab ). In general Maqasid is classified as basic divided into five types. That is to protect religion soul intellect lineage  and  property. As  already  mentioned  the contract conditions specific to the contract may have  separate  objectives  but  do not be against  the  general  objectives of  Shariah . In the contract of  Ijarah  the  benefits and  the  duration of  the  contract  period  had  to  be  determined precisely. This shows  that  the  main  objective  of the contract jar ah is  access the asset even if do not have it. Client will enjoys the use of  assets within  the  expected  time  frame. Thus  in  the contract  of the distribution  of  wealth  in  the  market  economy  as  set forth in the Quran (al Hashr  59 7). With the concept of Shariah Maqasid in ijarah. Then it can manage risk better. That  is  the  risk  of uncertainty ( gharar )  usury ( riban ) and  ignorance  ( jahalah ). However  there are  challenges  in  implementing  these  instruments.  Based  on  history the Ijarah Thummal Bay \' (a lease contract that expires with the sale)  known  as  AITAB  and Ijara muntahiyah bi al Tamlik (lease ending in ownership ). The difference between the two is that in the former case the title of the asset is transferred to the taxpayer at the end of the  contract  by  the  sale  agreement  whereas  in  the latter  the  transfer is  made  by  gift or  gradual  transfer throughout  the  lease  contract. But  the Islamic  hire the objective  of financing  model the benefits of  Ij\\xc4\\x81rah fulfills and the needs basic two are the to or in for risks bear liabilities  and giver rent should responsibilities  of responsible is purchase contract in Malaysia is under the jurisdiction of several government organs such as the Ministry of Domestic  Trade  and  Consumerism  which  exclusively has  control  over  higher  purchasing  efforts  and the Ministry of Transport which administers the levy of vehicles and road tax.  Lack of governance is a major problem  for  AITAB. Then  there  is  no  syariah  legal framework as it is  under the  Hire  Purchase  Act 1967. On  the issue  of  ownership  the  bank  as  the owner of the assets in the AITAB instrument should take the the asset. However in practice banks try to avoid all kinds of  liability  even  if they  claim  to  be  the owner  of the asset . For  example  according  to  the  principle of ijarah the the costs associated  with  these  assets  as the  cost  of insurance . But current  practice  in  Malaysia  shows the cost  of car that renters are insurance . This  measure legally  supported  by Section 26 (1) of Hire Purchase Act 1967 which clearly states that the vehicle owner  (bank) is liable  to bear the cost of insurance for the first year under the name of  the  lessee  and  Section  26  (2)  of  the  same enactment  explaining  the  responsibility  the  taxpayer to  bear  the  cost  of  insurance  for  the  next  two  years and  the  following  years and  this  is  violation  of  the Maqasid  Therefore the  Malaysian Government must take proactive steps to address the legal  barriers  towords  implementation  of  AITAB. This can be done whether there is a draft of   Mu\'amalah law  or  by  adding  some Law as  a amendments Act 1967 . This means that the Syariah court should  be given  greater  jurisdiction . Similarly  the Bank  should adopt  the  risksharing  method  of  providing  AITAB financial services to its customers. Therefore they will have  to  bear  the cost  of maintenance  due  to  the leased asset                                   4.0  ISLAMIC  FINANCE  AND  TECHNOLOGY framework Purchase Shariah. Hire the to DEVELOPMENT THROUGH MAQASID  as like key role peer driver a competitiveness in    As  an  immediate  solution  it  is  recommended  that Islamic banks with a high level of awareness of Shariah maqasid be  able  to  take  advantage  of  financial technology. According to Ghazali N. H. & Yasuoka T. (2018)  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  start to  play an important for economic growth and job the instrument  of creation .  Through  alternative financing (P2P) and  capital Crowdfunding comes in many forms  but its  specialty  is  in  the  form of public funds (sadaqah) and  private Equity).  Studies on Finance Technology  awareness have  been conducted  in  Malaysia and  many  countries such  as the  United  Kingdom (UK)  Latvia Finland  and more. Saksonova and  Kuzmina Merlino (2017) report that  consumers  are  unaware  of FinTech\'s services in Latvia a   23 innovations as (Private related equity peer and to \\x0cRamli et al. / Research Colloquium 2019 Vol. 1  (2019) 2225 a that the low.

However the  interesting results  of  the  study  show   the  majority of respondents have positive perception of FinTech development . Research suggested with the right regulations it may adoption of alternative financing Malaysia.             Therefore  the  ideas  of  technology  that  can  be analysed  together  with  the  Ijarah  instrument  (AITAB) and the Maqasid Shariah is the idea and the patent  presented  by  Forrester  K.  D.

Through   Similarly  the  idea  and  patented  by  Klinkhammer  K. W. (2007). The system called as SubPrime Automobile Sale  and   Financial System.  The system  is to  provide car  financing  to  individuals with lower  credit score and to provide an interest rate that matches the level of  customer  financial  ability  . It  uses  contracts  and terms automatically that come with job performance data the  applicant\'s  eligibility requirements  compared  to  the  applicant\'s  credit score. The system diagram is as below.   that  measures      to justice ensure through a  in modern the  changing the representative involved to  purchase in   Based  on  the  above  two  patent  applications  of vehicle finance  can  be  analyzed  through  the concept  of  Shariah  Maqasid. According  to  Awang M. D. &  Asutay M.  (2017)  Maqasid al Shariah is one of  the  important  methodology  in  islamic  laws  which provides the building the interpretivism in response to the  challenges  of social society times. Thus  many contributors consider the role of maqasid as the process of solving contemporary  problems  encountered  in  everyday life. Since maqasid is defined as  "human  wellbeing" any activity undertaken including financial has to be in line with "human wellbeing" and this by definition also includes hirepurchase. Therefore  the AiTAB contract  is based  on maqasid using the  HPA  provisions 1967 to protect the rights of customers. Under Islamic law   the spirit of protection must  be  applied to both parties for the all. Testament Scripture actually assets two contractsnamely al Ijara and al bai " . The al Ijara contract is  for  the  protection  of  the  rights  of the owner  in  the  case  where  the  tenant  fails  to meet the installments in which the owner  have the right to take the  assets  that  he still  exists under  the  lease contract. at the same  the contract also protects the rights  of the  tenant when  the  agreement  in  the to  purchase the contract  giving asset at the the period of implementation based  on  mutual  agreement  to achieve justice and  winwin  situation. it  should  be noted  that  the  current  lease  specified period  the customer is only considered as a tenant. But keep in mind that  some scholars say that the provisions of the in  1967 almost comply  with the  requirements HPA of Sharia. Therefore facility  AITAB  not  be prevented from adopting this rule and include it in the terms  of management  it agreement. in hire allowed to to in  certain purchase   and current practices (" urf ) places  so in conflict with Shariah principles.                                                                                       long  as  such  practices  are  not the  option end conventional fact refer the of in   24 \\x0cRamli et al. / Research Colloquium 2019 Vol. 1  (2019) 2225  5.0  CONCLUSION   Based on previous writings it can be concluded that the hire purchase through ijarah and  AITAB contracts can  be  used  in  the  concept  of  future  vehicle financing via finance technology  by replicating and modifying the western finance applications patents to Islamic  hire  purchase  applications. That  is  using  the Ijarah contract which is necessary to conform to the concept  of  the  Maqasid  Shariah.    Therefore  the implementation  of the AiTAB contract must  apply  to the contract involved such as the lease contract and any they specify a specific period of time .          contract provided other that  References  Amin  H.
