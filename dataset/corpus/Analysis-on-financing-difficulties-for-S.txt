The root cause of financing difficulty for SMEs is the serious information asymmetry that exists between financial institutions which lead to adverse selection and moral hazard. In this paper financing theories of SMEs  information  dissymmetry  and  credit  rationing  theories  are  used  to analyze  the  financing  difficulties  for  SMEs  and  financing  strategies  to  crack financing difficulty are proposed.  Keywords  Small  and  medium  enterprises;  information  asymmetry;  adverse selection; moral hazard; financing strategies JEL Classification Code D82; G32  INTRODUCTION  In  China  SMEs  have  gradually  become  a  great  force  for  promoting  economic  development. Related data show that SME\'s financing comes mainly from the external financing of financial intermediaries (eg.banks). However due to the information about SME\'s business status and credit status is not totally known to banks they tend to consciously cut down loans lending to SMEs.  This  is  exactly  what  we  call  "credit  rationing"  behavior.  As  a  result  many  small  and medium  enterprises  will  be  forced  to  close  down  for  lack  of  funds.  Therefore  how  to  break financing  barriers  facing  SME  under  asymmetric  information    and  promote  the  growth  and development of SMEs to make full use of its role played in economic development can be said are currently the most pressing problems to be solved. ANALYSIS ON IMPACT OF INFORMATION ASYMMETRY ON FINANCING BEHAVIOR information  asymmetry  that  exists  between  SMEs  and  financial The  root  cause  of  the  small  and  mediumsized  enterprise  financing  difficulties  lies  in  the serious institutions. Asymmetric  information  means  that  one  party  has  access  to  relevant  information  while  the other  is  lack  of  the  relevant  information  or  the  information  is  no  more  than  the  former  has. Unfortunately lack of relevant information would have adverse impacts on decisionmaking of the  latter  party  further  lead  to  inefficiency  of  resource  allocation.  In  fact  Asymmetric information  can  be  divided  into  ex  ante  informational  asymmetries  and  information asymmetry.  Ex  ante  asymmetric  information  can  lead  to  adverse  selection  information asymmetry leads to moral hazard. Applying the theory of asymmetric information to analyze credit market scan provide a theoretical basis to resolve financing problem bothering the small and mediumsized enterprise.

In  other  words  the borrowers  have  a  relative  information  advantage.  Therefore  financial  institutions  in  the relative disadvantaged position are only able to raise lending rates to reduce potential risk of credit  losses.  However  rising  interest  rate  of  loans  may  lead  to  those  normal  bluechip companies withdraw from the lending market because they do not want to pay the premiums in  terms  of  market  interest  rates.  On  the  other  hand  those  companies  who  having  poor business performance or pure cheater tend to acquire loans from banks as they willing to pay higher interest rate. Strange as it seems to be loan interest rate may turn out to reduce rather than increase bank earnings. In this case most of banks would probably choose relatively low interest rates and refuse part of the demand for loans rather than select higher interest rates and try to meet all of the borrowers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 demand for loans. This is socalled the first kind of "credit rationing" behavior.[1]To be more precise among all the applications for loan some got being admitted  while  some  others  are  denied  even  when  the  SMEs  willing  to  paid  more  interest. Because of the relative weakness of small and medium enterprises themselves compared with larger enterprises it is understandable that SMEs become the main targets been administered \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccredit  rationing\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Many  SMEs  have  been  eliminated  from  market  because  of  lacking  the access  to  loans.  Thus  asymmetric  information  leads  to  adverse  selection  which  would aggravate the financing difficulty for SMEs.   Information asymmetry leads to moral hazard Moral  hazard  in  financial  markets  occurs  when  the  borrower  has  already  acquired  the loan. Due to the financial institutions are unable to supervise the borrowing company all the  time  and  obtain  effective  information  about  the  borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  willingness  to  pay  back loans  business  performance  and  where  the  loan  go  there  are  chances  that  borrowing company may violate the original commitment they made when signing the loan contract and  engage  in  highrisk  investment  or  intentionally  flight  from  debt.  In  other  words  as banks cannot completely know and control what indeed the borrowers use loans for  and whether they would pay the money back or not the borrowers are likely to take risks to default  on  the  engagement.  This  opportunistic  practice  what  we  know  as  moral  hazard could  lead  to  bad  debt  which  could  take  its  toll  on  banks.  To  guarantee  loan  safety  and profitability  banks  and  other  financial  institutions  for  one  thing  will  implement  "credit rationing" policy. That is reducing lending to SMEs to avoid moral hazard which is what we  called  the  second  Act  of  "credit  rationing".[2]  Precisely  speaking  the  applicant\'s borrowing  requirement  will  only  partially  be  met  (such  as  applying  for  100  million  but only  receiving  20  million)which  can  lead  to  atrophy  of  the  SME  loan  market.  For  the other financial institutions may raise loan threshold strengthen SMEs credit appraisal and management in order to reduce the lending losses arise from the moral hazard. However this reaction will boost the transaction costs between banks and enterprises dramatically.  In  addition  SMEs  also  have  difficulty  to  come  up  with  satisfying  mortgages  to  the  financial institution. Therefore financial institutions may not dare to lend any loans to SMEs.  To  conclude  asymmetric  information  leads  to  moral  hazard  which  would  further exacerbate the financing difficulties of SMEs.  The transaction cost increase caused by asymmetric information Transaction cost can be divided into two kinds. One happens before  signing the contract with  any  borrowers  which  we  can  call  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csearching  cost\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Due  to  the  asymmetric Copyright \\xc2\\xa9 CCBYNCND 2014 Asian Business Consortium | GDEB  Page 29  \\x0cGlobal Disclosure of Economics and Business Volume 3 No 2 (2014)                                        ISSN 23059168                                                      information  the  bank  has  to  take  efforts  in  terms  of  money  and  time  to  search  for information which can reflect the real situation of the enterprise to ensure the safety and efficiency  of  loans  and  prevent  the  borrower  fraud.  These  information  varying  from financial statements the credit rating level to quality of management cash flow business prospects  and  so  forth.  However  information  related  to  this  is  not  easy  to  obtain  the credit  market  because  most  of  which  are  highly  internalized  and  not  accessible  which will drive up the cost on information searching. In fact the more incomplete and the less transparent the information is the higher searching cost will be.  The other transaction cost is loanafter supervision cost. To prevent borrowing enterprise from gambling behavior and speculation the banks also need certain cost on supervising. But most small and mediumsized enterprises are familyowned and implement extensive management their financial accounting practices and most often are not standard. So the financial  information  obtained  by  banks  is  often  inaccurate  and  can\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  reflect  the  real situation  of  SMEs  making  the  process  of  information  searching  and  supervising  even more difficult. In addition loans to small and mediumsized enterprise are small in scale but much higher in frequencies which could enhance the supervision cost per unit.[3] By  contrast  large  enterprises  have  very  huge  advantage  in  aspects  such  as  the  credit rating  valuable  mortgage.  Meanwhile  information  of  them  is  relatively  transparent  and accessible.  All  of  these  advantages  can  effectively  reduce  the  cost  on  searching  for information of transaction object and cost of supervision. Comparing the cost benefit and risk  among  different  types  of  enterprises  financial  institutions  will  inevitably  resort  to large  enterprises  by  reducing  the  loan  to  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  which further aggravate the financing difficulty facing the small and mediumsized enterprise.  COUNTER MEASURE OF FINANCING DIFFICULTY UNDER ASYMMETRIC INFORMATION The SMEs themselves need to strengthen their internal governance mechanism At present it is common that Chinese SMEs have several universal problems such as having unsound  corporate  financial  system  and  inaccuracy  financial  reports.  SMEs  should strengthen  their  internal  governance  mechanism  and  improve  the  standardization  of  the enterprise\'s  financial  system  and  enterprise  information  transparency.  Moreover  SMEs should  offer  effective  financial  reports  with  high  authenticity  to  help  commercial  banks make judgments. Besides SMEs should pay more attention to the credit consciousness and set up a good credit image to financial institutions. When the credit level of enterprise has risen  financial  institutions  will  change  their  impression  toward  SMEs  and  banks  will change their credit orientation. Hence the financing difficulties will be handled completely.  Developing and standardizing local small and medium financial institutions Regional  and  local  small  and  medium  financial  institutions  have  a  relative  advantage  in terms of low transaction costs and information when providing financing support for SMEs. That  is  because  local  mall  and  medium  financial  institutions  are  more  accessible  to  local information and can make full use of them. Thus they can easily gather information about operational  performance  development  prospects  and  credit  rating  level  of  SMEs  at  a relative lower cost .what\\xe2\\x80\\x99s more important they also have comparative advantages in credit screening  and  loanafter  supervision  of  SMEs  by  which  they  easily  overcome  information asymmetry that can lead to the problems of moral hazard and high transaction costs.

Government  should  simplify  procedures  reduce  the  financing  cost  actively  provides more  financing  opportunities  for  those  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  which  have high  growth  small  scale  and  weak  ability  for  resisting  risk.  Allowing  some  normative private  companies  with  good  profits  to  trade  at  the  counter  and  establishing  overthecounter market.[4] In addition actively broaden the bond financing channels cancel credit limit  that  is  adverse  to  small  and  mediumsized  enterprise.  Allow  the  outstanding  small and mediumsized enterprise financing through the issuance of enterprise bonds.  Above all diversifying the indirect financing channel .To achieve this government need to update the ideas and take effective measures to motivate bank lending loan to SMEs. For example implement the indiscriminate financing policy regardless of it is a largescale and mature enterprise or it is just a small and starting one. Simplify the process of verificationcancelation of nonperforming loans to small and medium enterprises. CONCLUSION Information asymmetry leads to adverse selection and moral hazard. Not only it will make a large number of SMEs which have good potential of growth have no access to loans but also cause banks and other financing institutions reluctant to lend to SMEs. To solve this SMEs  themselves  as  loanneed  side  should  improve  the  level  of  management  reducing moral hazard. As a loansupply side financial institutions should investigate information about corporate financial status to hold back financing market\'s adverse selection. At this stage the government should first of all promote the construction of small and mediumsized  enterprise  board  market  which  means  to  broaden  the  direct  financing  channels  of small  and  mediumsized  enterprises.  Then  actively  developing  and  standardizing  local small and medium financial institutions to fulfill its advantage in indirect financing. REFERENCES LiW.  and  Cheng  J.H.  (2005).
