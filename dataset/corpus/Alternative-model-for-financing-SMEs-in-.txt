They  contribute  to employment  GDP  innovations  human  resource  development  and  poverty  alleviation.  However  they  are constrained  by  access  to  credit.  The  main  objective  of  this  paper  was  to  develop  an  alternative  model  for raising  funds.  It  also  looked  at  why  lenders  are  cynical  in  advancing  credit  to  SMEs.  It  was  found  that inappropriate risk management moral hazard and possible adverse selection limit their access to credit. The SMEs Network Fund developed suggested the formation of a self managed fund by the SMEs to  finance their activities which would require no collateral if SMEs access funds and offer relatively cheaper capital to SMEs.

INTRODUCTION AND STATEMENT OF THE PROBLEM The  role  of  micro  small  and  medium  enterprises  (MSMEs)  has  been  identified  in  both  developed  and developing economies. It has been found  that it is not only the big businesses that provide the foundations of the nations economies but small enterprises also play significant role in developing the economies of nations. In  view  of  their  crucial  role  some  developed  countries  have  initiated  strategic  financial  and  counselling programmes to support them. Few of such examples in some developed economies include the USA where the government  through  the  Small  Business  Administration  provide  loans  advice  export  counselling  as  well  as legal assistance on exports; the United Kingdom now has a Minister for Small Firms within the Department of Trade and Industry and a Small Business Service which gathers evidence analyses the needs of small business. There is also the annual National Small Firms Policy and Research Conferences organised by the Institute for Small Business Affairs the main fora for researchers practitioners and policymakers enabling them to come together each year to share the latest thinking in the field. In Korea the institute of economic affairs (IEA) and the Korea Development Institute (KDI) of the Republic of South Korea entered into a form of collaboration to help develop a policy framework for SMEs in the country and assist them to grow to greater heights.  136   International Journal of Arts and Commerce                                                 Vol. 1 No. 5                                 October 2012   In order to help promote small business growth in Japan the state provides various types of support. First there is active support for the selfhelp efforts of motivated startups growth and technical innovation. Also there is reinforcement  of  articlemaking  technologies  and  technical  development  infrastructure  and  promotion  of smooth  access  to  and  use  of  management  resources  such  as  human  resources  technologies  funds  and information.   In addition there is enhancement of the potential of academia industry and government through promotion of collaboration among them and advancement of mutual exchange and education for articlemaking technologies and innovation. Not all there is the holding of training workshops and seminars and improvement of  the  common  infrastructure  of  SMEs  to  actively  use  information  technology  (IT)  and  promote  business innovation to cope with the IT revolution (SME Agency 2008). SMEs  have  been  found  to  contribute  to  employment  generation  gross  domestic  product  entrepreneurial  skill development  and  innovation  to  many  developing  countries  (Cook  &  Nixson  2000;  Agyapong  2011).  But  as was  pointed  out  by  Page  (1978)  inadequate  research  in  the  sector  poses  policy  constraint  in  that  area.  This continues  to  be  the  situation  in  Ghana  where  research  interest  in  the  critical  role  of  small  businesses  in economic growth still remains very low despite small businesses widespread. In Ghana though the data on this group is not readily available the little information available from the Registrar General indicates that 90% of companies  registered  are  micro  small  and  medium  enterprises  (Mensah  2004).  This  target  group  has  been identified  as  the  catalyst  for  the  economic  growth  of  the  country  as  they  are  a  major  source  of  income  and employment.  In  addition  as  was  identified  in  BoachieMensah  and  MarfoYiadom  (2005)  the  Ghanaian experience of SMEs and entrepreneurship has not been impressive as that of the developed economies. SMEs had  not  been  fully  integrated  into  the  main  stream  of  economic  activity  before  the  advent  of  the  Economic Recovery Programme (ERP). Support for these entities has been ad hoc irregular and uncoordinated. Despite  their  contribution  to  the  development  of the  country  they  are  confronted  with  the  problem  of  raising adequate  funding.  So  how  would  the  entrepreneurs  managing  these  SMEs  raise  adequate  or  at  least  improve upon their access to funds? The rest of this paper is divided into four parts; the second was the definition and the economic importance of SMEs; the third looked at financing SMEs in Ghana and the fourth part looked at the conclusions and the policy recommendations.  1.1 DEFINITION AND IMPORTANCE OF SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES The term SMEs has been severally defined by institutions regions and based on number of people employed sales or assets. In Egypt they are businesses employing between 5 and lees that 50 people. In Vietnam they are firms employing 10 and 300 employees. According to the World Bank a venture employing up to 300 people with  US$15  million  in  annual  revenue  and  US$15  million  in  assets  is  an  SME.  But  to  the  InterAmerican Development  Bank  an  SME  is  a  business  employing  up  to  100  employees  and  earning  not  more  than  US$3 million in revenue (Dalberg Global Development Advisors 2011). Furthermore European Union defines SMEs as a venture that employ fewer than 250 persons and which have an annual turnover not exceeding 50 million euro  and/or  an  annual  balance  sheet  total  not  exceeding  43  million  euro.     Small  and  medium  enterprises  are thus defined as firms with 10 to 250 employees as and more than 10 million euro turnover or annual balance sheet total.  Similarly  the  NBSSI  (1998)  provided  an  operational  definition  of  small  business.  According  to  this  body  a small business is any business that employs up to 29 people. They are divided into micro small and medium enterprises micro enterprises employing up to 5 employees with fixed assets (excluding land and building) not exceeding the value of $10000; small enterprises     employ between 6 and 29 employees or having fixed assets 137   International Journal of Arts and Commerce                                                 Vol. 1 No. 5                                 October 2012   excluding  land  and  building  not  exceeding  $100000  and  medium  enterprises       employ  between  30  and  99 employees with fixed assets of up to$1m. According to International Institute for Environment and Development when the firms are classified by sizes the  assessments  of  SME  firms  get  ranged  with  employee  size  that  is  less  than  a  100.  As  declared  by  Ghana Statistical  Service  the  firms  that  are  functioning  with  less  than  10  employees  are  recognised  as  a  small  scale enterprise. With more than 10 employees it will be firms with medium to large enterprises (Kufour 2008).  From the definitions provided it is obvious that there is empirical consensus on the use of number of employees in  defining  a  small  business  although  the  actual  employee  size  differs  from  one  definition  to  the  other.  The paper  adopted  the  NBSSI  definition  of  small  businesses  since  it  is  the  main  body  regulating  the  activities  of small businesses in the country.  1.1.1 Economic importance of SMEs in Ghana SMEs have been and continue to play significant role in the economy of Ghana. This is especially true as most graduates  learning  institutions  as  well  as  policy  makers  are  beginning  to  accept  the  fact  that  the  larger organisations  can  not  provide  all  the  needed  jobs  but  would  have  to  be  complemented  by  the  SMEs.  Fredua (2007) cited a World Bank Report in 2006 which states that Ghana's informal sector contributes to its economic activities  especially  contributing  significantly  to  employment  estimated  to  be  around  70%  of  the  total  labour force.  Small  firms  help  create  bulk  of  the  jobs  as  well  as  contribute  to  the  national  revenue  by  way  of  tax revenue but also improve upon national income (Keskin 2006; Abor & Quartey 2010). Kayanula and Quartey (2000)  and  Aryeetey  (2001)  found  among  others  that  SMEs  are  sources  of  employment  generation  help conserve  foreign  exchange  increase  exports  through  the  nontraditional  commodities  exports  as  well  as contributes to economic growth and development through innovation and creativity. These businesses are also considered by Abor and Quartey (2010) as providing about 85% of employment in the manufacturing sector and are believed to contribute about 75% to Ghana   s GDP and also account for 92% of businesses. They have often been described as improving the efficiency of domestic markets and making productive use of scarce resources and thus facilitating longterm economic growth in poor countries (Aryeetey & Ahene 2005). In Ghana small businesses make up the largest portion of the employment base and are the bedrock of the local private sector (Kufour 2008). Apart from these broader contributions there are some other identified importance of these entities. According to Buame (2004) SMEs are very important to an economy because they make more efficient use of resources act  as  a  source  of  skill  creation  cradle  of  entrepreneurship  utilises  financial  resources  that  are  otherwise dormant  like  family  savings  innovative  have  a  much  lower  cost  per  job  created  wider  geographic  spread wider presence in rural areas and higher capacity for absorbing labour. Small businesses are often found to have some advantages over large firms. Large firms have been found often to have undesirable working conditions such as  weaker autonomy stricter rules  and regulations  less flexible scheduling  and  a  more  impersonal  working  environment  (Brown  &  Medoff  1989;  Edmiston  2007).  Also SMEs are seen to rely on a personalised tailormade service. Moreover they tend to provide quicker services quality products fair prices as well as providing both formal and informal after sales service. As Vossen (1998) opined  while  largefirm  strengths  are  mostly  material  in  nature  smallfirm  strengths  are  mostly  behavioural. Perhaps the most critical strength is the lack of an entrenched bureaucracy that often characterizes larger firms. An entrenched bureaucracy  can lead to long chains of command and subsequent communication  inefficiency inflexibility and loss of managerial coordination (Edmiston 2007).  138   International Journal of Arts and Commerce                                                 Vol. 1 No. 5                                 October 2012   Further  small  firms  to  the  extent  that  they  operate  in  more  competitive  environments  may  have  a  greater incentive to innovate so as to stay ahead of rivals. Finally because ownership and management are more likely to be intertwined at smaller firms the personal rewards of potential innovators are higher. As a related factor smaller firms may be better able to structure contracts to reward performance (Zenger 1994). But despite such advantages  small  businesses  continue  to  face  especially  financial  difficulties  because  they  often  start  with inadequate capital. So in society where fewer bureaucratic firms exist and given the significant role of SMEs in job creation (Mensah 2004) if strategies are devised in solving their (SMEs   ) problems they could contribute more to the development of the society. Cook and Nixson (2000) outlined numerous merits of SMEs including the basis for entrepreneurship; utilising labour  intensive  technologies  and  thus  having  impact  on  employment  generation;  encouraging  the  process  of both  inter  and  intraregional  decentralisation.  In  addition  they  put  forth  that  SMEs  have  become  a countervailing force against the economic power of larger enterprises; and finally the development of SMEs is seen as accelerating the attainment of social and economic objectives including female unemployment poverty alleviation especially in rural Africa.  1.2 FINANCING SMALL AND MEDIUM ENTERPRISES IN GHANA Small  enterprises  and  most  of  the  poor  population  in  SubSaharan  Africa  have  very  limited  access  to  deposit and credit facilities and other financial services provided by formal financial institutions. For example in Ghana and Tanzania only about 5   6 per cent of the population has access to the banking sector (Basu Blavy & Yulek 2004). According to HFC Bank (2004) SMEs in Ghana tend to be marginalised or have limited access to credit.  Coupled  with  the  fact  that  few  informal  supports  exist  by  way  of  business  angels  and  personal  savings  this tends  to  affect  their  ability  to  adopt  modern  technology  (UNIDO  2002).  It  has  been  found  that  only  few  of these  businesses  are  financed  from  commercial  bank  loans  government  assistant  programs  or  other  informal sources (Osei BaahNuakoh Tutu & Sowa 1993; Bani 2003). Similarly Abor and Biekpe (2006) pointed out that access to finance is a dominant constraint facing SMEs in Ghana. It must be noted that access to funding is not  the  only  constraint  to  SME  development  (Liedholm  MacPherson  &  Chuta  1994)  finance  and  access  to funding are often the major challenge for SMEs development (see Bigsten et al. 2000; Buatsi 2002.). It should be  noted  that  the  availability  of  funds  could  improve  SMEs     access  to  other  resources  such  as  human information and physical resources. With  low  level  of  technological  support  (because  they  are  unable  to  finance  technological  resources)  they cannot  get  adequate  amount  of  production  and  subsequently  sales  and  profits.  This  obviously  leaves  small business  in  a  vicious  cycle  of  financial  constraint.  In  view  of  this  it  is  often  imperative  that  external  capital injections are necessary to help boost small business performance.  Besides  several  empirical  studies  have  recognised  the  issue  of  financial  constraint  as  the  main  problem thwarting  the  speedy  growth  of  small  businesses  in  developing  economies  including  Ghana  (Arthur  2003; Mensah 2004; Deakins North Baldock & Whittam 2008). Other studies have in developing economies have found funding as the major problem of SMEs. These studies have made varying recommendations but SMEs continue  to  be  constrained  by  funding  as  suggested  by  the  empirical  studies  cited  earlier  on.  Whereas  some countries have set up small business equity markets to help raise equity capital others have set up state grants and  develop  a  list  of  business  angels  to  assist  small  businesses.  But  the  situation  in  Ghana  is  more  of  moral suasion  where  appeals  are  often  made  by  policymakers  and  the  NBSSI  to  lenders  to  grant  credit  to  small  139  International Journal of Arts and Commerce                                                 Vol. 1 No. 5                                 October 2012   businesses. Studies that propose peertopeer lending as a funding alternative is yet to be carried out hence the need for the present study.  The main methods to access funds for SMEs are basically through debt or equity sources or both. Equity usually may be by the business owner relying on personal savings (bank savings or    susu1   ) from previous work gift from friends or family members or even remittance from abroad (individual remittances in Ghana for 2008 and 2007  amounted  to  US$1678.6  million  and  US$1660.3  million  respectively)2  venture  capital  fund  and  share (rare  in  Ghana  for  small  firms).  Ideally  entrepreneurs  would  want  to  rely  only  on  such  source.  But  typically such funds may not be adequate and they may have to fall on debt or borrowing. There is also financing through trade credit.  In Ghana apart from few traditional lenders and some other nonbanking lenders a greater proportion of debt capital could only be obtained through the banks. However financial institutions (FIs) such as banks would not just  lend  till  SMEs  are  able  to  make  a  convincing  case  about  the  future  prospects  and  sustainability  of  their business.  Such  loan  seekers  should  be  able  to  demonstrate  their  management   s  awareness  and  competency  to cope  with  business  risks  as  well  as  satisfy  providers  of  funds  that  they  are  taking  an  acceptable  risk  and  will receive  reasonable  return.    Lenders  would  give  out  loans  when  they  have  satisfied  themselves  with  the  loan seeker   s capability and developed a transparent relationship built on mutual trust with the loan seekers. Because as  Cook  and  Nixson  (2000)  posit  credit  is  provided  in  the  context  of  information  asymmetry  on  both  sides (Fischer 1995) and can be resolved by demonstrating creditworthiness and business viability. However because of poor accounting practices and record keeping many of such loan seekers are unable to do so. This increases the risks and transaction costs of small business lending.  Banks require  collateral to manage this risk (Tagoe Nyarko  & AnuwaAmarh 2005). Such indicators are used by financial institutions to assess the likelihood of business failure and payment default. That is a way to avoid adverse selection by the FI as well as to prevent moral  hazard.  Due  to  their  high  risk  consciousness  FIs  at  any  point  in  time  find  ways  to  protect  themselves from future negative outcomes.   Notwithstanding  these  SMEs  look  at  financial  soundness  being  their  ability  to  achieve  business  targets  and success and try to predict and portray future positive outcomes to satisfy repayment times in seeking for such funding. So that in times of seeking debt funding the risk of failure is the last thing the SME owner would want to consider. But this is what is of interest to the FI.  Nevertheless the possibility of failure can not be ruled out by the FI when the SMEs submits a loan application as some internal causes such as poor target selection or product positioning inadequate business management experience financial management as well as inappropriate management practices can lead to the collapse of the venture.  In  addition  external  causes  such  as  high  cost  of  compliance  with  regulation  fierce  competition  and difficulty in obtaining external funding are likely to lead to the failure of the venture (Accounting Web 2003).  1.2.1 SME Reliance on Banks and Credit Scoring According to Keith (2006) SMEs may selffinance but typically have very limited capital and rely on external finance.  When  seeking  external  finance  most  SMEs  rely  on  the  FIs.  But  these  FIs  would  not  grant  credit without relying on credit scoring methods. The problem here is that credit scoring will increasingly impact on                                                  1 Susu is a practice where a business owner makes a periodic (usually daily) savings with another (Susu Collector). The collector then marks  on  a  card  these  periodic  savings.  The  amount  accumulated  is  given  back  to  the  saver  usually  at  the  end  of  the  period.  The collector usually is rewarded by taking the last amount deposited by the Saver. 2 Bank of Ghana Monetary Policy Committee Press Conference on Tuesday February 24 2009. 140   International Journal of Arts and Commerce                                                 Vol. 1 No. 5                                 October 2012   SMEs as there are usually no SMEs Credit Officers to evaluate loan applications of such borrowers. So their applications are eventually given the same consideration like that of the larger organisations.  What is more is that due to the risk perception of SMEs by FIs their applications tend to be given a more critical scrutining and loans are granted more cautiously than the larger firms. Evidence from the Bank   s survey of credit conditions continues  to  point  to  tightening  of  credit  to  both  enterprises  and  households.  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises (SMEs) access to credit was tightened marginally while large enterprises    remained unchanged (Bank of Ghana 2009). But in a society where SMEs provide the junk of the jobs created providing financial assistance to this sector is  crucial for economic wellbeing of the  country  and the economically  active labour  force (Wolfensen 2001; Fredrick 2005; Agyapong 2010). Typically lending to SMEs in Ghana has been found to have high moral hazard     tendency of SMEs not using the funds for the purpose intended as was agreed with the FI (borrower dishonesty leading to a loss). Problems with financial credit facilities were always predominant to the SMEs of Ghana (Mensah 2004). Since there is the context of providing information that is actually asymmetry on both sides the credit options gets limited. On the  other  hand  it  can  be  well  resolved  with  the  help  of  demonstrating  the  SME  owners  with  the creditworthiness and all  kinds of project viability. However since SMEs in some developing world including Ghana have poor records keeping and accounting practices it will be hard for them to get out of it (Kwarteng 2009; Cook & Nixson 2000; Binks Ennew & Reed 1992). By means of restricting credits they can somehow plan  for  new  persuasions.    An  NBSSI  (2009)  pointed  out  that  a  number  of  SMEs  who  benefit  from  credit schemes do not use the credit for the intended purpose. Some of them use the fund to meet personal needs to the detriment  of  their  business  whilst  others  invest  it  in  their  business  but  do  not  go  according  to  their  business plan.  Still  others  invest only  part  of  the  fund  in their  business  with the  intention  of  getting  higher  yield.  This adversely affect repayment plan. But they added that the trend is changing with education. Second  lending  to  SMEs  have  its  own  adverse  selection       tendency  to  give  inaccurate  information  on  their assets  capital  liabilities  and  character  leading  to  the  selection  of  high  credit  risk  borrowers.  In  addition location3  is  major  wrong  information  given  due  to  poor  address  system  and  bad  town  planning.  The  Small Business Policy report (2002) analysing from a credit risk and rationing models perspective indicated that it is an underlying assumption by lenders that small business borrowers possess salient private knowledge that is not shared with lenders or investors. This makes it difficult for lenders to prevent adverse selection as it makes it difficult for lenders to differentiate between high quality and low quality borrowers. A potential risk faced by lenders in Ghana is the inability to locate defaulting small business borrowers due to inappropriate location and the tendency for the venture owners to give wrong information about their location. So in event where such risk is perceived the lender is likely to charge a higher rate of interest on the loan being granted (Wynant & Hatch 1991). But the problem of adverse selection is not only associated with lending to SMEs but with large firms (Gaul & Stebunovs 2009) as well. Third there is high tendency for default because there is lack of capital thus making SMEs more vulnerable to failure. Notwithstanding there is limited suitability of SME business assets as collateral. Also owner/manager guarantees  may  be  impaired  by  personal  revenue  reliance  on  SME  business.  In  effect  the  ability  to  access                                                  3  In  the  view  of  Kwarteng  (2009)  the  banks  can  hardly  be  blamed  for  their  rather  dismissive  attitude  towards  the  informal  sector because  they  lack  proper  books  well  defined  management  structure  sense  of  appreciation  for  accountability.  He  points  out  in  the case  of  Ghana  that  the  personal  residential  address  system  is  nearly  nonexistent  and  many  people  do  not  have  proper  title  to  their assets to afford them the opportunity to use them as collateral for loans.  141   International Journal of Arts and Commerce                                                 Vol. 1 No. 5                                 October 2012   funding will depend largely on the entrepreneur or the SME owners    ability to manage the risk of his or her firm through right business balance. The problem of inadequate information disclosure and lack of data on the number and role of SMEs in Ghana make  it  difficult  to  assess  the  real  contribution  of  the  sector  to  economic  development.  However  the contributions of SMEs in Ghana have been identified as very pivotal in the nation's economic transformation as it attempts to attain a middleincome status by 2015. Analysts say the sector accounts for about 90 per cent of enterprises in the Ghanaian economy generating a significant proportion of jobs created in Ghana. According to Abor  and  Quartey  (2010)  the  sector  contributes  about  85%  of  manufacturing  employment  in  Ghana.  They estimate  that  the  sector  contributes  about  70%  to  Ghana   s  GDP  and  account  for  about  92%  of  businesses  in Ghana. In  view  of  this  successive  governments  have  in  their  own  ways  try  to  find  some  solutions  to  the  greatest challenge  facing  SMEs  in  Ghana       problem  of  financing.  Thus  they  have  introduced  varying  SMEs  funding schemes  in  the  form  of  debt  and  equity  financing.  These  official  schemes  are  mostly  state  originated  with international  donor  support.  But  others  are  international  in  their  origin  and  operation.  Among  the  schemes include  Business  Assistance  Fund  Ghana  Investment  Fund  Export  Development  and  Investment  Fund  Bank Loans  Australian  Import  Program  NBSSI  Loan  Revolving  Fund  Venture  Capital  Trust  Fund  and  Fidelity Equity Fund. Therefore it is imperative that these SMEs devise alternative solutions to the problem of access to funding hence the proposed model.  1.2.2 Problems with Official Credit Schemes in Ghana Despite  the  numerous  financing  schemes  available  SMEs  still  contend  with  the  problem  of  financing  in  the country thus impacting negatively on their operations and the ability to  positively affect the economy of the country.    In  the  first  place  most  of  these  official  schemes  are  debt  in  nature  requiring  collateral  before  an entrepreneur is able to access it. Secondly the nature of the schemes is such that they are not meant only  for SMEs but the private sector. So that the SMEs would have to compete with some well established private firms for a fair share of such funds. Thirdly the schemes are mostly for importation which could defeat the economic growth purpose of SMEs. This is because one of the objectives of ensuring that the sector thrives is to serve as import  substituted  industries  to  help  conserve  foreign  exchange.  For  instance  the  Austrian  Import  Support Program was to be used by beneficiaries to procure equipment machinery raw materials and related services from Austria. In  addition  to  the  above  problems  there  is  more  often  than  not  over  subscription  (excess  fund  demand  over supply).  This  stems  from  the  fact  that  money  usually  made  available  by  the  state  is  inadequate  to  go  the numerous fund applicants. Also international donor support to complement government effort may sometimes not  come  or  come  with  some  strings  attached  to  it  (only  meant  for  SMEs  in  specified  sectors;  e.g.  the  Loan Revolving  Fund  was  set  up  to  promote  the  development  of  SMEs  in  services  and  manufacturing  sectors). Additionally high default rate due to operational difficulties discrimination among applicants and ineffective scrutinising  of  loan  applicants  and  their  firms  before  granting  credit  have  served  as  major  setback  in  this direction. In view of the foregoing equity funding would have been an alternative. However equity financing for SMEs in  tend  to  inadequate.  Mensah  (2004)  posits  that  SMEs  find  it  difficult  raising  equity  funding  because  equity investors seek high return consistent with the high risk of investment especially with small firms. In addition SMEs investment is hard to evaluate compared to other larger organisation (example listed firms). Furthermore 142   International Journal of Arts and Commerce                                                 Vol. 1 No. 5                                 October 2012   SMEs investments take time to mature and are difficult to liquidate in case the investor wants to opt out. Unlike some  developed  economies  there  is  no  stock  market  for  SMEs  in  Ghana  to  enable  the  possibility  of  capital acquisition through the floating of shares.   1.2.3 The Proposed Model for Financing SMEs  It is no doubt that the existing schemes are bedevilled with several problems and hence the need to look for a more effective and efficient funding schemes to help improve the access to funds by SMEs. The SMEs Network fund model (figure 1.1) suggests a fund to be setup with pooled funds from individual SMEs. Though the fund would  be  made  up  mainly  of  contributions  from  the  SMEs  owners  themselves  contributions  from  the  state venture capitalists and international donors would also be sought into the fund. What is more SMEs can assess capital from the fund as well as continue to access existing government venture and external funds. The difference between this scheme and what existed is that unlike others this scheme would be manned by a committee headed by a Fund Manager.  The members of this committee would constitute volunteers from the SMEs  representatives  from  other  contributors  such  as  the  government  international  bodies  and  other institutional investors. The Fund Manager would be responsible for making the necessary investment decisions of the fund. This is different from existing schemes usually controlled by the state or some bodies other than a committee made up members from SMEs.  Again unlike previous schemes that may not have a form of seed money by SMEs this one contains contribution by business owners (equity stake from SMEs). Fund manager and the committee would undertake scrutinise an applicants    documents for assessing funds from the scheme not as means of turning their application down but to enable the them advise and if possibly offer training and counselling to the member on how to utilise the funds. Funds accessed from the SMEs Fund would not require any collateral as other lenders do. Members belonging to the fund would be required to deposit their monthly reports to the committee which in a way could help deal with the problem asymmetry and invariable moral hazards. Not all there would be a periodic visits to members businesses by way of monitoring to help ensure funds collected are being reasonably used by SMEs for the purpose intended. This would also help deal with the problem of moral hazard in SME lending. Additionally the scheme would be opened to all SMEs in all sectors and activities. Admission of members into the scheme would not require stringent requirements but that they are ready to contribute towards the fund. In addition to those who would undertake to be members there would also be nonmembers who can access the scheme.    In  accessing  the  fund  members  would  be  made  to  pay  relatively  lesser  interest  than  nonmembers.  Thus  unlike  others  that  restrict  accessibility  to  a  specific  sector  this  fund  could  be  accessed  for  different purposes and categories of SMEs (be it those who are into production processing or service rendering). Meanwhile those who access the fund made up of contributors from the government and international donors can still access separate or additional funds from these bodies.  In effect SMEs can obtain more funds with the setting up of the SMEs    Network Fund.  1.2.4 Theoretical basis of the SME Network Fund model The model has its foundation from three theories     the social network theory social exchange theory and the theory of large numbers. The  SME  Network  Fund  model  based  on  the  network  theory  to  small  groups  which  also  has  its  foundations from five others including the theories of selfinterest theories of social  exchange or dependency theories of mutual or collective interest cognitive theories and theories of homophily.  143   International Journal of Arts and Commerce                                                 Vol. 1 No. 5                                 October 2012   The Social Network theory is of the view that actors are not as significant as the relationships (ties) and contacts with  other  actors  in  the  network  (HazzardRobinson  &  Loch  2012;  Borgatti  &  Li  2009;  Jorgensen  &  Ulhoi 2010). The theory focuses on the assessment of social relationships between or among actors in a network. The SME  Network  Fund  model  is  based  on  this  premise  that  once  SMEs  pool  resources  they  can  have  adequate funds  to  be  given  to  one  at  a  time.  Besides  fund  manager(s)  can  invest  the  pool  in  short  term  securities  to enable it appreciate.  In  addition  according  to  the  social  exchange  theory  humans  in  social  situations  choose  behaviours  that maximize their likelihood of meeting self interests in those situations. This theory assumes that the individuals (owners of the venture) are rational and engage in costsbenefits analysis in social exchanges. This implies they act as both actors and reactors in social exchanges. But at the core of social exchange theory are the concepts of equity and reciprocity; where the group in this network pool resources and give it to a member at a time.  This  theory  has  been  applied  in  various  economic  and  social  relationships  (see  Nomaguchi  &    Milkie  2003; Sprecher 2001; Lawler 2001; Monge & Contractor 2003). Although some weaknesses have been reported e.g. Miller  (2005)  several  empirical  works  (Cropanzano  &  Mitchell  2005;  Zafirovski  2005;  Liu  &  Deng  2011) have reported gains from it application.   The theory of large numbers (the law of large numbers) is a financial risk management practice often used in insurance  and  for  individuals  with  little  funds  to  invest.  The  law  of  large  numbers  is  simply  pooling  little resources  into  the  fund.  Although  SMEs  are  deemed  to  be  cash  starved  they  can  periodically  make  little contributions into the fund. As per the model proposed together with contribution by other stakeholders SMEs could have access to funding and at a cheaper rate than other lenders. In terms of management if necessary a fund manager can be employed to manage such a fund. In Ghana such practice is common especially with Cooperative Societies.  1.2.5 Assumptions Underlying the Proposed SMEs    Network Fund Firstly SMEs should be willing to disclose their operational and managerial information to the fund managers.  This  would  enable  the  fund  managers  to  create  a  database  of  SMEs  as  well  as  determine  the  appropriate contribution to be made by each SME.  Failure to disclose such vital information could lead to the failure of the scheme.    Secondly  the  SMEs  should  pay  back  the  funds  obtained  from  the  scheme  with  its  accompanying interest.  Periodic checks on the owner to determine how the fund is being utilised can help the SME payback into the fund.  Thirdly the assessment of documentation as to who qualifies to access the fund is devoid of all political social cultural and religious affiliations but access is made available to those who proof to the fund manager  and  the  committee  they    require  the  funds  to  finance  viable  projects.  This  criterion  mainly  is  on  the member   s  proof  of  financial  constraints.  Meanwhile  decision  making  authority  regarding  how  the  fund  is invested should rest with the entire members of who are contributors to the fund        144   International Journal of Arts and Commerce                                                 Vol. 1 No. 5                                 October 2012   Figure 1.1 The SMEs    Network Fund Model  J STATE CONTRIBUTION Venture Capital Funds H G I Private Investors K L M  N E F International Donors D C SMEs FUND P O A B Small and Medium Enterprises Author   s Construct 2012  As  one  of  the  strategies  to  sustain  the  fund  the  managers  would  be  required  to  update  members  on  monthly basis  their  receipts  and  payments.  This  they  would  do  and  as  a  way  of  peertopeer  check  information  about members not in good standing would be disclosed to colleagues during meetings. Monitoring would be done by the committee the fund managers and the entire members through the periodic circulars. The number of times a business would receive assistance from the fund and the rate of interest (if even free) would be agreed upon by all members. There would also be incentives for members who payback money received from the fund before or on time. As much as possible the number of times one can withdraw for a particular period would reduced if they consistently delay or default in payment. However if these assumptions do not hold then the scheme could encounter some problems.  1.2.6 Features of the Model The features of the model are illustrated by the individual arrows defined by the alphabets (A) to (P) 1.  This  arrow  (A)  indicates  fund  flow  from  international  donors  directly  to  SMEs.  Such  donations  can  be channelled  through  (arrow  E)  state  institutions  such  as  the  Venture  Capital  Fund  then  flow  onwards  into  the fund. 2.  This arrow (B) indicates what received in return  by the international donors. This is usually dependent of the type  donation.  For  grants  international  donors  would  want  a  project  progress  or  completion  report.  Similar reports  may  be  expected  from  the  state  agency  or  institution  (arrow  F)  if  the  donation  is  channelled  through them. 3.  Arrow  (D)  indicate  flow  of  donor  funds  directly  into  the  SMEs  Fund  whilst  arrow  (C)  report  from  fund managers about the possible use of funds 4.  Arrow (H) indicates fund flow from state institution into the SMEs fund while arrow (G) is the feedback from the  fund  managers.  The  feedback  may  come  in  a  form  of  periodic  financial  reports  and  possible  returns  on investment to the state.  145  International Journal of Arts and Commerce                                                 Vol. 1 No. 5                                 October 2012   5.  Arrow (J) indicates the flow of funds directly from state institutions (e.g. Capital Trust Fund Ghana Business Advisory  Fund)  to  SMEs.  Such  funds  may  be  government  guaranteed  loans  to  small  businesses.  The  SMEs report back to the state agency by paying back the soft loans and the interest (arrow I). 6.   Arrow  (L)  indicates  the  flow  of  funds  from  private  investors  directly  to  SMEs  while  arrow  (K)  shows  the potential  return  which  is  purely  a  kind  of  economic  profit.  This  is  because  private  investors  would  put  their funds into a venture only when they expect to obtain good returns on the fund so invested. 7.  Arrow  (M)  indicates  the  flow  of  funds  from  private  investors  directly  into  the  SMEs  fund  while  arrow  (N) shows the potential return which is purely a kind of economic profit.  8.  Arrow (P) indicate the flow of funds from the SMEs directly into the SMEs fund while arrow (O) shows fund flow  from  the  SMEs    Fund  to  finance  their  activities.  The  fund  flow  in  arrow  (P)  may  come  in  a  form  of members    contribution.  1.  CONCLUSIONS AND POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS SMEs contribute significantly to the economic development of the country in the area of employment creativity and entrepreneurship. In the course of setting up and operating they face financial and non financial challenges. Although both challenges have the tendency to slow down the growth of these businesses the one that is often highlighted is that of access to finance. In order to deal with the problem of funding institutions and different governments have put up some intervention measures but still the problem persists.  SMEs  have  had  to  rely  on  financial  institutions  (FIs)  as  an  alternative  source  of  funding.  However  these financial institutions would not grant credit to SMEs until collateral is provided. Even though society  usually discern on FIs for such conduct FIs are also trying to manage their risk as way to sustain institutional survival. In  view  of  this  there  is  the  need  to  look  for  an  alternative  model  to  funding  SMEs.  The  paper  developed  an alternative model to financing SMEs.  2.1 Policy Recommendations There is the need for SMEs to network or form partnership; pool financial resources and sometimes have joint projects. Such a fund can help these businesses to take such a step. This is because as they interact they could identify common areas of strategic partnership and collaborations.  Secondly such a Fund would SMEs have access to funds with less or no strings attach to it and possible at no or less costs of capital. Again they would be under relatively lesser pressure to payback without interest compared with loans from banks or other lenders. Also SMEs would access funds without any collateral. There is the possibility of donor support (from international and domestic agencies) if there is the evidence that the fund is being managed well. Again not only members have access to cheap capital they could also benefit from investment of their fund in a pool. SMEs  could  benefit  from  additional  group  training  and  counselling.  The  peertopeer  check  would  self  as  a monitoring system for businesses. Members would have a say in how the fund is managed  REFERENCES Abor J. & Biekpe N. (2006).
