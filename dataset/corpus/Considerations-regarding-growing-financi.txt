Cuza  no.13  Craiova Romania radu@profcons.ro 0722350573  Small  and  Medium  Enterprises  are  very  important  part  of  both  developed  and  less  developed  national economies. The European Union experience shows that it has a significant contribution to the GDP and to the reduction of the unemployment rate. In Romania as in many countries in the area there is still a long way ahead for reaching an adequate support for SME development potential. Romania has a sector which although has recently followed a positive trend it possess performances which are still low in comparison with  the  countries  from  European  Union  including  the  countries  which  entered  the  European  Union  in May 2004. The paper highlights financing methods used by SME the reasons for the present situation as well  as  the  measures  thought  to  be  the  best  for  its  improvement.  In  order  to  amend  the  situation  the Romanian  SME  are  in  Romania  must  take  multiply  sided  actions  the  main  role  being  assigned  to government  banks  and  guaranteeing  institutions  that  must  develop  a  series  of  transparent  efficient  and correct instruments. Cuvinte cheie SME\'s financing credit leasing guaranteeing funds structural funds   The challenges caused by regionalization and globalization of markets demand the compliance of SME to the  competitive  environment  by  consolidating  their  market  position  and  benefit  from  the  economical opportunities.  If  traditionally  small  and  medium  enterprises  were  considered  economical  operators belonging  to  the  internal  market  today  a  growing  number  of  SME  are  managing  to  conquer  the  global markets.  Approximately  one  fifth  of  the  SME  involved  in  the  productive  activity  in  the  OCDE  countries realize  a  proportion  of  10  to 40%  of  the  their  turnover  from  international  activities.  SME  contribute  in  a high  proportion  to  the  global  industrial  exports  and  increase  the  volume  of  foreign  direct  investments worldwide. In the European Union SME play an important role their number being predominant nearly 99% of the companies  are  SME  while  90%  of  them  are  micro  enterprises.  At  the  same  time  European  SME  work force accounts for nearly 70% of the total confirming the social role of SME. In fact all EU Member States have taken steps in stimulating entrepreneurial spirit. These measures widely vary and consist of loans and grants  offering  on  one  hand  and  on  the  other  hand  in  offering  support  services  such  as  technical juridical  managerial  consultancy  and  information  centers  for  setting  up  companies  training  possibilities for potential candidates and new entrepreneurs and market studies. In Romania the role of SME is lower from the point of view of the turnover percentage or the added value created in economy but on the other hand at their level there exist 57% workers of the total number of employees. As for SME structure there is a slight tendency of micro enterprises predominance and most of the employees may be found in the services sector. 379   Comparative definition between Romanian SME and European Union SME Necessary conditions for situating within SME Micro Small Medium Romania Employees number Turnover (in millions EUR) Other conditions (other companies    shares/social capital) European Union Employees number  Maximum turnover (in millions EUR) Maximum own capitals (in millions EUR) Other conditions (other companies    shares/social capital)   <10   <10 n/a n/a n/a  <50 <8 25%  <50 7 5  <250 25%  <250 40 27 25% 25% As  we  may  see  the  notion  of  SME  is  the  same  in  the  Romanian  legislation  and  in  the  European  Union; nevertheless  there  are  slight  differences  regarding  turnover  and  their  own  capitals  that  insure  equality conditions for Romanian SME on EU integration. In spite of a positive dynamics registered during recent years in the tendency towards productive sector as well as in the resources of the local entrepreneurial spirit SME contribution at GDP still remains low; this fact  proves  the  necessity  of  stimulating  quantitative  and  qualitative  increase  of  the  SME  sector.  SME access  to  capital  technology  and  infrastructure  is  much  beyond  the  extent  that  would  allow  using  SME significant  role  in  strengthening  economic  competitiveness  in  particular  adaptability  to  market  demands and introduction of new processes. In  the  context  of  competitiveness  most  of  the  small  and  medium  enterprises  in  Romania  need  financial support  if  we  were  to  take  into  account  that  their  productivity  is  lower  than  the  big  enterprises   .  SME financing  has  gone  a  long  way  in  the  last  17  years  in  Romania.  However  we  still  have  to  wait  a  little longer until we reach an adequate support for SME development potential. We  must bear in  mind  that on their evolution  SME  have  to pass different business development stages and  that  in  each  of  these  stages  there  are  needed  other  types  of  financing  having  different  terms  and conditions. As  we  may  see  in  the  chart  the  main  financing  method  that  SME  dispose  of  consists  of  selffinancing irrespective of the development stage while banking credits as well as the resources originating from stock market  are  relevant  only  in  SME  raise  development  or  maturity  stages.  Likewise  in  the  first  SME development stages we may also use risk capital financing. SME access to financing represents an important side of the entrepreneur   s stimulation; we may improve this  aspect  by  financial  system  and  public  sector  support.  The  role  of  the  financial  system  tends  to  be offered  a  particular  size  all  its  sectors  (banking  leasing  and  credit  guaranteeing  funds)  having  a significant potential in SME development. 380              !"#$%&  Fezabilitat !"#$%& !"#$%& !"#$%&Creati \'()*#+\'()*#+\'()*#+\'()*#+Developm.+/0*1/2 .+/0*1/2.+/0*1/2.+/0*1/2Selffinancing  sales  Results  314# 1           1 2  3            4   5##6 +71/+%"#1($#/4#(/ *#+/18("#$#%874#(/Invested capital  ;1)+71/+%;1)+71/+%;1)+71/+%;1)+71/+%5/8)4+*#/ 9+()*#61/ (cid1)Financing types in different business development stages The results of some surveys on financing methods used by SME prove that 57.66% of SME carry on their activity  only  through  their  own  sources.  Thus  the  most  frequently  seen  financing  methods  used by  SME  consist  of  selffinancing  (used  by  86.7%  of  companies  in  the  survey)  banking  credits (60.1%)  and  leasing  (53.2%).  This  is  due  primarily  to  difficult  crediting  conditions  in  Romania (high  interest  rates  high  bonds  numerous  and  difficult  grant  formalities  etc)  but  also  to  the possibility for some companies to finance their own activities especially in the trade sector. We may see the SME method used in financing in chart no.2. 9080706050403020100SCLNLOFSFrequency ofuseootaherelfeads rfiitieninsgmahcanesrtroesrsin isancingbgursablesue ...(cid1)Used financing methods 381  Covering the financing necessities primarily from own sources generates a decrease in liquidities total of companies  that  may  prevent  first  of  all  taking  advantage  of  some  business  opportunities  and  secondly financing  investments  having  an  impact  on  technological  modernization.  The  lack  of  liquidities  is emphasized  by  the  delayed  deduction  of  delivery  as  well  as  the  increased  tax  system.  These  shortcuts  in financing small and medium enterprises generate and develop the vicious cycle of illegal payments that are not included in bookkeeping thus triggering tax avoidance and corruption. Although  in  2005  SME  bank  debts  represented  only  10.5%  of  total  debts  in  the  first  half  of  2006  the increase  in  banking  financing  was  considerable  (33%)  but  if  we  compare  to  the  European  Union  where SME  financing  is  around  79%  by  means  of  banks  we  may  easily  conclude  that  there  is  still  a  long  way ahead of us. In  the  last  threeyear  period according  to  the  ENSRSurvey  76  % of  UE  SMEs  which  asked  for  a  bank loan received it. The reasons for not obtaining bank financing differ between size classes lack of collateral mostly affects  micro and small enterprises  while poor business performance and insufficient information are the main reasons for mediumsized firms. In fact in the last period taking into account the remarkable potential of SME sector the banks from Romania have begun to offer products and services aimed at these companies in line with their needs and capital. However at the same time starting with January 1 2007 there are important changes in the banking system also together with the appliance of new requirements of Basel II. Thus trade companies must have a very good rating in order to receive credits according to new requirements  of  capital  equalizing;  in  this  respect  they  must  have  capital  accumulation  and  select  the activities that may offer them good financial results. According to new capital requirements SME credits will be balanced by 100% if they fall under the category of corporate or by 75% if they fall under the retail category which means maintenance of the existing situation or even an improvement regarding credit risk appreciation of SME. Thoroughly  analyzing  the  causes  preventing  SME  banking  credit  system  from  developing  we  may discover the difficulties that entrepreneurs claim in their relation to banks. Decreasingly  difficulties  with negative  impact  on  banking  credit  system  are  the  following  bank  officer  relationship  thorough documentation required by the bank in view of granting a credit; the length period of approving the credit by the bank; guarantees level and interest rate. The ENSR Survey 2002 reports that European SMEs are satisfied with bank services. About two thirds of the  SMEs  are  satisfied  approximately  12  %  dissatisfied.  The  major  reasons  for  dissatisfaction  are  poor service  bank  charges  and  frequent  changes  of  contact  persons.  Especially  in  the  case  of  mediumsized enterprises banks do not seem to offer the best solutions to their clients. Mediumsized enterprises are also more often concerned by the refusal of additional loans or the withdrawal of existing credit facilities. There is a certitude that entrepreneurs are not reluctant in soliciting credits primarily because of the interest rate (that  they  include  in  products  price  anyway)  but  mainly  because  of  reasons  regarding  clientbank relationship.  There  is  a  serious  alert  for  banks  that  in  the  context  of  market  economy  would  have  to choose between adapting its  policies to clients that is always satisfying the clients    increasing needs and cut in turnover and profitability. From  the  UE  SMEs\'  point  of  view  the  cost  of  borrowing  (interest  rates  as  well  as  charges)  is  still  an important issue. External finance tends to be more expensive for smaller enterprises than for large ones as the  fixed  costs  of  lending  (e.g.  administrative  costs  and  the  costs  of  collecting  information  about  the borrower)  are  not  proportional  to  the  size  of  the  loan  and  make  small  loans  more  expensive  than  large ones132. This price difference is also caused by different risk positions taken by banks and some other sizerelated  factors  such  as  the  greater  financial  acumen  existing  in  LSEs  and  the  greater  leverage  often available to LSEs. These  difficulties  on  obtaining  a  credit  are  doubled  by  the  ones  specific  to  reimbursement  fluctuating exchange rate further costs generated by payment reallocation of unsuccessful credits interest adjustment during the credits reimbursement period.  In order to have an easier access to banking credits SME should benefit from a series of measures such as      Thinking the business over in perspective;      Presenting a wellstructured and conceived business plan;                                                            132  Wagenvoort  R.

A  solution  would  come  up  if  banks  and  guaranteeing  funds  had  a  common  strategy  for  SME  financing because one of the most important issue that entrepreneurs deal with when accessing a financing line is the lack  of  guarantees.  Guarantees  work  on  the  principle  of  shared  risk  between  the  bank  and  the  guarantee association thereby significantly reducing the degree of risk for the bank. In the context of regional policy guarantee  schemes  can  play  an  important  role  in  improving  access  to  finance  creating  private  sector funding leverage and encouraging the development of SMEs. Guarantee schemes are especially suitable for very small loans to micro enterprises unable to provide the lender with the required collateral. In table the advantages and disadvantages for the participating parties are listed133. Advantages and disadvantages of guarantee schemes Advantages Disadvantages SMEs  which  cannot  easily  get  finance benefit loan financing on better terms. facilitated  access from to Only a part of the risk is covered by the guarantee society or fund. Risk  sharing  between  the  guarantee  society or  fund  and  the  bank  reduces  the  capital requirement of the Basel rules. By  reducing  the  risks  to  banks  guarantee  schemes  may also reduce the extent to which banks scrutinize new loan applications. Through  guarantee  societies  and private leveraged promoting regional development. for  SMEs financing funds is sector The extent to which guarantee associations and guarantee funds  receive  support  from  public  authorities  varies across  the  European  Union  and  is  mainly  dependent  on the prevailing banking culture. Guarantee  societies  and  funds  provide  local input  and  tailored  business  support  and advice. (cid1)In most of the European countries loan guarantee funds and mutual guarantee schemes offer guarantees to SMEs with insufficient collateral especially micro enterprises. Loan guarantee schemes are often used by \'young\'  enterprises  (12  %  of  SMEs  with  less  than  5  years  compared  to  8  %  of  SMEs  with  more  than  10 years in business). In this respect in Romania was founded the SME Credit Guaranteeing Fund a ventured capital institution aiming at facilitating the access to financing through credits guarantees or letters of bank guarantee for SME not having enough financial resources and material guarantees but with viable business projects. Another method of financing for SME is leasing. In the European Union one of two SME has already used a leasing operation for business financing. The average penetration of leasing is estimated to be about 12 % in the European Union. In  Germany  over  70%  of  small  and  medium  enterprises  prefer  leasing  or  loan  in  order  to  buy  machines and  equipments.  A  study  made  by  the  Directorate  for  Enterprises  and  Industry  of  the  European Commission  indicates  that  nearly  half  of  small  and  medium  enterprises  in  the  old  EU  countries  have already used the leasing system loan and account overdraft for investments financing.  After Germany the SME of Austria (65%) and Sweden (63%) take the second place in their preference for leasing or loan. In Romania  the  leasing  market  experienced  a  significant  growth;  the  specialists  think  that  this  sector attraction is closely related to leasing development for the means of transport as a more approachable and easier way of financing for small entrepreneurs.                                                            133 European Commission Guide to Risk Capital Financing in Regional Policy Brussels 2002. 383  Within the EU economic and social cohesion policy Romania will benefit from structural funds of nearly 30 billion EUR during 20072013. These EU structural funds are treated by the European Commission and aim  at  financing  structural  aid  measures  at  the  Union  level  in  order  to  promote  low  developed  areas reconversion  of  areas  experiencing  industrial  decline  abolishing  longterm  unemployment  professional insertion  of  the  youth  or  promoting  rural  development.  One  of  the  main  fields  of  intervention  for operational  programmes  (Sectorial  operational  sector       Economic  competitiveness  increase)  aims  at accomplishing productive investments and preparing for competitiveness on the European market of small and medium enterprises the allocations in this field being managed by the National Agency for Small and Medium  Enterprises.  The  Programme  of  Competitiveness  Improvement  for  SME  consists  of  6  priority axes the main ways through which small and medium enterprises will be able to access funds within the sectorial programme that is Axis 1     Production modern system; Axis 2     Research technological development and innovativeness for competitiveness; Axis 3     Information and Communication technologies for private and public sector; Axis 4     Energetic productivity increase and durable development of the energetic system; Axis 5     Romania attractive destination for tourism and business; Axis 6     Technical assistance In order to improve the current situation of the Romanian SME we must take various steps the main role being played by the government banks and guaranteeing institutions that must develop a series of efficient correct and transparent instruments. We strongly recommend priority actions concerning      Setting  up  a  system  of  guaranteeing  and  coguaranteeing  funds  at  a  national  and  regional level for enterprises financing;      Significantly diminishing guarantees values and commissions required by banks on granting credits in line with the European Union procedures;      Simplifying credit granting procedures;      Subsidizing  interests  for  SME  credits  in  particular  for  the  ones  in  certain  fields  and categories;      Drawing up a national training programme for enterprisers in order to access structural funds based on the principle of publicprivate partnership;      Granting adequate grace periods for investments credits and periods increase;      Promotion of the use of nontraditional financial instruments such as risk capital funds etc. Bibliografie 1.
