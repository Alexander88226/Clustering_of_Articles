Thank you all!   Master in International Business  1 \\x0cAbstract The  interdependence  of  markets  the  reduction  of  barriers  to  entry  and  the development  in  technologies  leads  to  the  increase  of  international  business  leads  to  the increase of international business including both SME and big companies. This process is especially risky in the case of SME which have limited resources and knowledge of foreign countries/markets. The aim of this report  is to  analyze and  clarify  a software as  a service  company approach  when  entering  to  foreign  markets  applying  the  existent  literature  to  the development  strategy  of  SCRAIM  software  case  a  spinoff  owned  by  the  Strongstep Company  concerning  the  entry  strategy  to  the  BRICS  market  with  the  major  final objective  of  finding  the  best  suitable  countries  or  regions  according  to  the  company strategy and goals.   The  conducted  research  focused  on  both  political  economic  social  institutional and  juridical  implications  in  proceeding  to  the  product  internationalization  through  one among various options such as (1) establishing a partnership with a viable company in the market (2) analyze the alternatives of having a reseller with merely commercial purposes or  (3)  introducing  the  product  through  accelerators  and  incubators  centers  in  a  way  it  would  be  possible  to  achieve  robust  results  in  the  longterm  associated  with  the incremental growing process of ambitious startups.   Regarding SCRAIM focus the analysis was oriented to relevant data linked with companies and geographical areas which have a major awareness associated to the referred methods namely in what concerns effectiveness and accuracy in organizational processes. By doing so in a concise and coherent manner I performed an archival data research from different  sources  but  fundamentally  from  related  institutes  databases  and  research developed  concerning  the  area  of  organizational  management  and  IT  software.  Through this  process  ultimately  I  was  able  to  propose  a  set  of  regions  in  the  Indian  market regarding SCRAIM international expansion objectives.

Introduction Motivations goals and main research question Strongstep \\xe2\\x80\\x93 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInnovation in software quality\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was the hosting entity responsible for receiving  me  concerning  my  research  internship  application  a  firm  which  has  been developing  their  business  in  the  field  of  Software  and  Consulting  Engineering.  The company was founded by Dr. Pedro Castro Henriques in 2009 with the purpose of helping other  firms  improving  their  process  quality  and  ultimately  achieving  the  certification according to the best international practices.  SCRAIM  is  a  project  management  and  process  management  online  platform  in  a form of software as a service which aggregates the capability of improving process quality through  principles  based  on  the  best  standardized  practices.  This  tool  was  born  from  a research  consortium  between  FEUP  (Faculdade  de  Engenharia  do  Porto)  Multicert  and Strongstep;  both  companies  have  their  core  businesses  on  the  firm  certification  and security area.  The product intends to solve problems originated from the lack of processes within  the  organization since  the  multiplicity  of  tasks  involved  in  a  development  project and  the  geographical  distance  implicit  to  members  who  integrate  it  often  leads  to ineffectiveness and failure in accomplishing the proposed deadlines and budgets.  As an early stage international company SCRAIM falls within the concept of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorn Global\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and  benefits  from  having  an  extremely  hybrid  structure  in  order  to  acquire  the necessary  resources  to  reach  new  international  market  opportunities  (Madsen  &  Servais 1997; McDougall et. al 1994; Oviatt & McDougall 1997 1994). The company has already started  its  journey  beyond  the  domestic  market  having  entered  to  the  United  States  of America in 2015 through the inRes program a CMU Portugal initiative for the acceleration business projects. Developing  a  coherent  and  underpinned  strategy  the  company  realized  that  the Portuguese  market  presented  few  opportunities  of  growth  so  as  stated  by  Knight  and Cavusgil (2004) the limitation in size and geography of the domestic market leaded to the fast pace of internationalization. Following this purpose the firm wanted to impose itself in  the  global  market  starting  from  the  initial  implementation  phase.  The  BRICS  markets were  selected  given  the  range  of  opportunities  in  the  field  of  process  management  and project  management.  Being  an  extremely  large  area  in  what  concerns  the  target  market and  presenting  itself  as  a  tremendously  vulnerable  sector  where  the  smallest  misstep  can Master in International Business  6 \\x0cpurport the anticipated end of the company intentions it implicitly demands an extensive analysis of the risks and opportunities inherent to the process. Concerning the  curricular internship it is intended to  draw  an  effective internationalization  plan  with  regards  to  SCRAIM  software  but  more  precisely  to  the penetration  in  one  strategic  region  or  geography  among  the  ambitious  wide  range  of  the BRICS markets as well as to provide a strong set of information about the focal market.  In this report I also intend to explain how a \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorn Global\\xe2\\x80\\x9d strategy is shaped by the various dimensions inherent to the destination geography which in due course define the market framework. To complement this view recent studies have also have shown the core importance  of  the  social  and  cultural  dimensions  in  defining  the  market  entry  strategy (Hofstede 2001). Recent studies have shown that values and behaviours are elements that provide  a  clear  perception  of  the  context  in  which  the  norms  rules  and  ethics  are established.  This  characteristics  ultimately  moderate  the  strategies  adopted  according  to the  particular  context  the  firm  will  operate  in  (Hoskisson  et  al.  2000;  Meyer  and  Peng 2005; Tsui 2004; Meyer 2006 2007).  Summing  up  the  main  imposing  question  that  is  intended  to  be  answered  in  this report  is  Which  country  and  preferably  which  specific  region/regions  present  the  best conditions  for  SCRAIM  internationalization  purposes  among  the  BRICS  market  and  at what  level  of  commitment?  Therefore  and  based  on  the  literature  regarding  the international  market  selection  and  related  penetration  it  is  expected  to  draft  a  clear strategic  plan  that  will  bring  satisfying  and  undoubtful  results  not  just  for  the  company but  also  to  the  scientific  community  being  also  coherent  with  the  usage  of  pertinent material data in order to better support and fundament the results.        Master in International Business  7 \\x0c2. Literature review This  chapter  aims  to  structure  a  linked  selection  of  relevant  literature  regarding  the focal  question  of  research  starting  with  different  known  models  concerning  the international market selection in a way of being able to scrutinize the pattern that suits the best to the referred study. Moreover and following the initial topic I will then analyze the implicit internal and external variables related with the different mentioned strategies and lastly  the  best  market  penetration  strategy  in  order  to  illustrate  and  clarify  the  available topics related with this stage of internationalization. As well as the integration and critical analysis of the various contributes in the present literature. 2.1 International market selection   In the last two decades the society and the corporate world have been driven by the fast rhythm of technology evolution. This had several implications in the firm scope in areas such as production transportation/logistics telecommunications and more precisely the  internet  which  brought  the  fastest  evolution  pace  that  the  society  has  ever  assisted (Oviatt  and  McDougall  2000).  These  fast  developments  have  significantly  and  radically change  the  market  shape  easing  the  access  to  clients  suppliers  distributors  and partnerships in a worldwide range. Moreover the clients and the competitors are now seen in a global level eradicating the single domestic market restriction. These changes boosted a growing number of companies to the international market even right after their creation (Chetty e CampbellHunt 2004) as it is the SCRAIM case regarding their prior experience in the United States of America. The selection of markets upon the international expansion process is  now one of the  most  ordinary  however  complex  decisions  to  be  made.  When  addressing  a  given market which in other times could be considered a niche can nowadays be seen as a major \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccashcow\\xe2\\x80\\x9d due to vast global opportunities. Moreover internationalization is a musthave viable option for increasing a company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s chances to enlarge their supply and consequently their revenues.  Nevertheless  regarding  the  main  actor  when  entering  to  foreign  markets  as  SME few  studies  go  in  line  with  the  classic  literature.  The  classic  approach  states  that  the exposure  of  companies  with  a  small  dimension  to  the  international  market  should  only Master in International Business  8 \\x0coccur  in  accordance  with  the  proximity  of  the  geographic  networks  analysis  which actually matches with most of the theories concerning the internationalization theme such as  the  Uppsala  model  applicable  to  internationalization  processes  of  SME  (Tykesson  D. and  Alserud  M.  2011).  These  theories  argue  that  the  ideal  form  of  internationalization should involve a gradual process which is averse to risk however the studies are not able to  explain  the  changing  history  observed  concerning  the  global  market  structure  (Oviatt and McDougall 1997). Firms  which  operate  in  the  scope  of  internationalization  in  an  early  development stage  or  even  right  after  their  conception  are  characterized  as  being  the  already  referred \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorn  Globals\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (Oviatt.  et  al.  2004).  Although  these  companies  have  limited  resources which normally characterize new businesses  generally  the  Born Global  company  rapidly achieves  significant  international  sales  besides  according  to  several  studies  this  kind  of companies  is  emerging  in  a  large  scale  in  a  worldwide  basis  (Oviatt  et  al.  2004).  The concept differs in the literature regarding the scale and the range of the internationalization. According to Oviatt et al. (2004) it is possible to distinguish two different types of Born Globals (1) Firms  which operate in  considerable distant  markets (Born  Globals) and (2) firms  we  refer  as  Born  Internationals  which  start  their  international  path  by  entering relative  geographically  close  markets  and  adopt  strategies  that  go  in  agreement  with  the Uppsala  view  of  internationalization.  However  in  what  concerns  the  ideal  time  for internationalization all the revised literature is consensual these type of companies usually start their process at a fast pace promptly after their creation (Kuivalainen et al. 2007). Nonetheless whether we are referring to an internationalization in an early or in a mature phase there unequivocally are an enormous number of mainly exogenous variables that  need  to  be  taken  into  account  when  pondering  the  most  attractive  and  appropriated destination concerning the specifications of our business.  The international market selection is a mandatory element of operations employed by the companies that must not be despised and it is therefore one of the central features of  international  business  (Kay  1993;  O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Farrell  &  Wood  1994;  Papadopoulos  &  Denis 1988).  Brewer  (2001)  states  that  this  is  a  process  which  involves  a  major  quantity  of energy and resources concerning the company overall feasibility and for this very reason should  be  a  closely  analyzed  step  as  it  involves  a  combined  effort  of  all  the  company Master in International Business  9 \\x0cstrengths.  Firms  need  to  stimulate  growth  through  their  increasing  presence  in  the international  market  however  they  need  to  distinguish  among  the  large  number  of internationalization  hypotheses  which  do  in  fact  should  be  explored  given  the  scarce resources owned by the company. Moreover it is fundamental to select the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d market concerning the initial phase in order to ensure the export success and thereafter determine where  to  settle  bases  and  to  establish  a  favorable  position  among  the  approached  areas (Papadopoulos and Denis 1988). Among several important decisions attached to the international market selection approach  it  is  the  attractiveness  of  each  correspondent  market  concerning  the  field  of activity the firm is operating in. This will be pronouncement that dictates the pace and the tone  of  all  the  process  related  with  the  internationalization  strategy  (Kumar  et  al.  1994). Research  in  the  field  of  international  business  sphere  related  with  the  entry  mode  choice has  revealed  innumerous  relevant  factors  inherent  to  the  target  locations  that  should  be weighted  among the  decisionmaking  process.  This include the local  market competitiveness the easiness of trade and several other factors that arise from the deepest analysis  to  the  elements  of  each  market.  According  to  Argawal  &  Ramaswami  (1992) these elements are a function of its sales potential and the risk associated in terms of the economy correspondent size and growth.  Papadopoulos  and  Denis  (1988)  made  a  remarkable  work  concerning  the  IMS studies and they had summarized all the related methods existing until the 1980s decade proposing that the international market selection models suited into two different types of approaches \\xef\\x82\\xb7 Qualitative approaches \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Rigorous and systematic combining and analysis of qualitative information about one or more potential target markets; \\xef\\x82\\xb7 Quantitative  approaches  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  Analyzing  large  amounts  of  secondary statistical data about several or all the foreign markets. In this case a qualitative approach will be used since the group of countries to be object  of  analysis  is  already  established  and  the  aim  is  to  have  the  maximum  amount  of valuable  information  about  them  concerning  the  various  relevant  topics  that  define whether  the  markets  are  attractive  or  not.  Additionally  and  following  the  existent Master in International Business  10 \\x0cliterature I as the research author will focus on the nature appropriateness and sources of qualitative  information  that  can  be  used  in  the  process  of  selection  such  as  chambers  of commerce  consuls  embassies  banks  distributors  customers  and international organizations (Pezeshkpur 1979). Regarding the international  market  selection studies Papadopoulos et  al.  (2002) also  concludes  that  both  pluses  and  minuses  of  the  countries  under  analysis  must  be considered  in  order  to  make  effective  decisions.  The  authors  proposed  the  tradeoffs  as being  the  demand  potential  as  a  plus  and  barriers  to  trade  as  a  minus  considering  the countries under review. They also state that many relevant authors identify the barriers to trade as the most important obstacle to have in consideration when intending to export to a given country but most of them have not included it in their international market selection models  because  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  too  difficult  to  quantify  the  nontariff  barriers  in  the  international sphere  and  so  they  assumed  that  these  would  be  included  in  the  later  stages  of  analysis (Papadopoulos et al. 2002). Papadopoulos et. al (2002) have even account with the firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 strategic orientation to structure the model (fig. 1).    Fig. 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Papadopoulos et al. (2001) tradeoff model Source Department of economics society and politics University of Urbino Italy Four variables were attributed for each of the main topics of analysis the demand potential and trade barriers. The variables were chosen given their relevance frequency of Master in International Business  11 \\x0cuse  in  previous  researches  evidence  of  satisfactory  performance  in  various  settings availability of data reliability comparability and ability to express it qualitatively. In this sense is also important to refer other relevant existent models of analysis in the international business sphere. Considering the relevance of papers and articles this report  will  also  focus  on  the  process  for  potential  markets  research  (Cavusgil  1985)  and another that was already mentioned the country market selection model (Brewer 2001). The first model designed by Cavusgil (1985) follows the same logic of selection as the ones mentioned previously and intends to answer predefined management related questions once the firm decided to go abroad. Cavusgil (1985) divided the model in three different  stages  (1)  The  preliminary  screening  for  markets  in  attractive  countries  which tend to be the stage where the company tries to understand which market will they select to proceed  to  an  even  more  detailed  investigation;  (2)  Assessment  of  industry  market potential  where  the  actor  search  to  understand  what  is  the  aggregate  demand    in  the referred sector of each of the selected markets; (3) Company sales potential analysis where the company examine how attractive is the potential demand for the company products. Afterwards  this  complex  and  demanding  analysis  the  company  will  have according to Cavusgil (1985) the fundamental and necessary information to proceed to the final selection and implement the entry strategy. Alternatively Brewer (2001) designed one of the most complete models regarding the process  of market  selection in  the area of international  business  studies and highlight four main steps to  be taken. Starting from  (1) Establish a country market  set  where this potential country set might include countries which are in fact not feasible at a later stage perhaps due to legal restrictions but it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s still not recognized as such by the company; (2) Identify  a  country  even  if  the  firm  generally  have  a  global  view  when  addressing  the market  the  objective  lays  in  identifying  the  market  that  offers  the  minimum  transaction costs  and  better  levels  of  potential  gains;  (3)  Evaluate  the  country  concerning  its attractiveness  and  competitive  position  when  compared  to  other  promising  markets;  (4) Select  the market  which will be profitable concerning the company intentions and worth further development and commitment. Master in International Business  12 \\x0cAnother  particularly  important  matter  is  related  with  psychologic  distance inherent to markets topic that is also extremely relevant in the Brewer (2001) analysis for the international market  selection and presents itself as a feature which makes extremely difficult  to  understand  foreign  environments  (Johansson  and  Vahlne  1977).  The  main problem  is  that  the  implicit  cultural  differences  create  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwall\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  that  affects  both  the companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 activities abroad and the knowledge transference process. The greater cultural differences attached to the markets will directly increase the transaction costs being these costs  associated  with  all  the  information  acquisition  and  the  also  the  integration  process which  in  turn  tends  to  have  direct  impact  on  the  overall  success  abroad  (Williamson 1985).  In  the  BRICS  particular  case  is  even  a  more  striking  feature  since  the  distance widely varies from one country in comparison to another. This subject leads us to the firmspecific advantage and to understand where the differentiator feature is best leveraged as well as the institutionalspecific advantages related with the target economy.   2.2 Tripod strategy  Where  and  how  to  internationalize  once  the  firm  decided  to  go  abroad?  To answer this question most of the studies have been addressing special attention to the new intervenient on the tripod based view (Peng 2006) the institutionalbased view since this dimension have a major influence in  shaping the availability of the market  in  driving the internationalization  process  (Peng  2004  Wright  et  al.  2005)  or  on  the contrary  holding back  the  company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  intentions  by  making  the  process  extremely  bureaucratic  and ineffective. In this report it is intended to explain how SCRAIM strategy can be affected by institutional  and  organizational  dimensions  which  can  become  an  even  more  striking situation in the emerging economies sphere. Example of such is the BRICS case since it is directly related with the emerging economies matter. Nonetheless it is important to notice that  this  has  been  the  theme  that  has  been  pushing  the  third  element  of  the  tripod (institution  based  view)  to  the  cutting  edge  of  strategy  research  throughout  recent  times. The institutional based view has been a focus for several researchers when considering the international  business  scope  since  it  had  become  almost  a  mandatory  topic  particularly when  the  authors  address  the  usefulness  of  this  perspective  as  a  complement  of  the Master in International Business  13 \\x0corganizational  and  industrial  capability  of  the  firm  concerning  the  emerging  economies (Peng  2006).  This  subject  calls  for  heavier  emphasis  on  unexplored  divisions  that  are fundamental  to  the  context  such  as  culture  and  the  reliability  or  the  effectiveness  of institutions and how they are shaped among the different historic scenarios attached to the regions  having  ultimately  the  goal  of  understanding  how  and  in  which  way  does  the institutions  specifications  impact  on  the  firm  strategy  and  consequently  on  the  firm performance.  In  practical  terms  the  institutional  view  has  been  helping  managers  and researchers  understanding  in  what  way  they  can  enhance  their  competitiveness  when entering  the  market  and  playing  with  local  rules  which  may  be  extremely  different  from the ones played in the domestic market (Peng et al. 2008). Furthermore institutions have directly influence on the entry strategy adopted by the  firm  the  effect  tends  to  be  shaped  according  to  the  different  needs  of  the  entrant regarding the type of resources needed to the specific business. The   research concerning SCRAIM  case  needs  specific  demands  concerning  the  institutional  characteristics associated with the BRICS market and the process and project management market within those markets.   2.3 Entry mode selection  International market selection along with entry modes selection are in fact some of  the  most  important  decisions  concerning  the  internationalization  process  of  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cBorn Global\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and therefore critical factors when referring to firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s success overseas and even though  they  are  considered  separately  from  one  another  they  should  be  considered  as being part of the overall decisionmaking process (Root 1994). Regarding the entry mode selection there is a group of internal and external factors which can impact directly on the strategy  and  makes  it  not  work  the  same  way  considering  the  various  countries  (Root 1994).  Moreover  there  should  exist  a  consolidated  and  detailed  analysis  of  the  overall process  in  order to  have the most orientated and efficient  strategy of internationalization. As Root  (1994) stated there linked  factors that firms  cannot  control but  have to  prepare their  strategy  accordingly  which  are  the  so  called  external  factors.  The  external  factors include characteristics or dimensions associated with both the domestic/home country and the target country that may accredit in favor or against a given strategy or proposed entry Master in International Business  14 \\x0cmode. These factors are associated with market factors such as the competitive structure the  marketing  channels  the  respective  sales  potential  as  well  as  production  factors  and environmental  factors  such  as  the  structure  of  the  government  and  the  political  risks implicit  to  it.  On  the  other  hand  the  internal  factors  are  related  on  how  the  firm  will overcome the barriers imposed by the external factors and decide the best suitable strategy to effectively enter the market. These factors can be demonstrated by the product factors such  as  it  differentiation  and  the  resource/commitment  factors  such  as  the  capital managerial and technological feasibility of the firm. Also according to Root (1994) and giving emphasis to his detailed work on this particular field of international business there are three main approaches to possible entry mode  selection  (1)  Selection  in  absence  of  any  market  entry  strategy  or  the  so  called \\xe2\\x80\\x9csales  approach\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  where  the  process  is  characterized  by  short  time  period  no  systematic selection criteria and standardized products with few product adaptations to the destination market  as  well  as  no  effort  control  on  the  overseas  distribution;  (2)  Selection  made  in accordance  with  the  existing  firm  entry  strategy;  and  (3)  Selection  considering  strategy rules  and  involving  pertinent  comparisons  of  alternative  modes  available  concerning  the referred  market.  In  our  particular  case  and  given  the  set  of  countries  priory  chosen  the SCRAIM case fits on the more complete and coherent approach the selection considering the strategy rules and comparisons of alternative modes given that regarding the different entry  modes  Dunning  (1981)  proposed  fundamental  topics  that  should  have  a  proper weight  on  decision  making  process  a  wellknown  theory  that  became  known  as  the eclectic paradigm which refers to ownership advantage (qualified and special knowhow brand  name  managerial  and  experience  related  skills  etc.)  location  advantage  (factor endowments  such  as the land  natural resources low  cost labor  etc.)  and internationalization advantages (reducing risk of contractual entry modes). This paradigm will  be  the  basis  for  pondering  pros  and  cons  attached  to  the  different  entry  modes  and understanding  which  one  is  the  best  to  opt  bearing  in  mind  all  the  advantages  and disadvantages the company possess concerning not just an entry mode but also the target country and the implications associated with it as well as the internal capabilities. Regarding  the  different  entry  modes  the  author  will  highlight  the  viable possibilities regarding the SCRAIM case and the target market as being \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Exportations entry modes Master in International Business  15 \\x0cExporting is most likely the cheapest way of entering to new markets as well as the  lowest  commitment  in  terms  of  financial  resources  and  engagement  with  the  market where  they  can  escape  to  risk  of  establishing  operations  in  markets  that  have  low knowledge and lack of experience in the given area of activity (Hill 2007). \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Contractual entry modes  This  is  a  cost  efficient  mode  of  entry  where  one  firm  grants  to  another  firm  or individual  the  right  of  using  its  specific  trademark  or  technology  under  a  certain  time period (Hill 2007).  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Licensing/Franchising  The main advantage of a licensing agreement is that the licensor does not need to be  part  of  any  investment  cost  in  order  to  have  their  product  in  the  market  and  presents itself as a viable strategy for SCRAIM. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Jointventure  This  contractual  agreement  is  characterized  by  the  process  where  two  or  more firms establish a new firm that is jointly owned even knowing that is possible one of the companies  having  a  majority  share.  The  two  or  more  companies  involved  can  share  the risks of the project as well as the investment costs. The entering firm can also benefit from the knowhow linked to the target company(s) operating in the market (Hill 2007). \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Strategic international alliances  Business  relationship  between  two  or  more  companies  where  the  participants cooperate for mutual interest and share the risks (Hill 2007) \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Consortium  The same mechanism as the joint ventures with the difference that normally none of  the  companies  involved  in  the  contract  has  active  operations  in  the  target  country (Cateora et al. 2013) Investment entry modes \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Foreign Direct Investment  Companies invest or buy local firms with the experience and the knowhow in the referred  target  market  (acquisition)  or  establish  their  own  facilities  (Greenfield investment) (Hill 2007). Nonetheless  and  regarding  the  various  entry  modes  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  fundamental  to  add  the limited financial capability of the company to the scale knowing that even if the customer Master in International Business  16 \\x0cportfolio  is  diverse  and  stable  the  company  gains  are  canalized  to  be  reinvested  in  the company  growth.  Moreover  the  shortage  of  human  resources  and  the  scarce  knowledge about  the  target  market  affect  the  entry  strategy  that  will  be  adopted  in  the  short  and medium term. Therefore  I should enable the company to minimize the level of resources commitment  associated  with  the  internationalization  plan.  Strategy  that  fits  with  the patterns of exportation or licensing entry modes.   2.4 Network and relationshipbased strategies As in every internationalization case or even sale process the created network can and should lead to the establishment of new or renewed networks as well as new relation and partnerships in order to solidify and increment our engagement in the various phases of internationalization.  Regarding the main question of research and focusing on actors who intend to go abroad  SME  and  Born  Globals  have  the  need  to  outline  a  careful  and  detailed  analysis prior to  the action stage since the process  of internationalization is  attached with  several losses in case of failure mainly when the target are emerging economies \\xe2\\x80\\x9clow income and rapid  growth  countries  using  economic  liberalization  as  their  primary  engine  of  growth\\xe2\\x80\\x9d (Hoskisson et al. 2000) that can represent a huge threat when referring to violation of the IP rights and moreover having the implicit risk of jeopardizing the scope of the company expansion intentions. Concerning the line of thought of the tripod strategy (Peng 2006) is possible to answer  to  the  problems  outlined  above  through  guidelines  attached  with  the  institutionbased  view  (North  1990  and  La  Porta  et  al.  1999).  Utterly  associated  with  the  target markets  there is  a strong hypothesis of legal  institutions  revealing themselves weak  and consequently  not  contributing  to  empower  our  entry  strategy  in  the  desirable  scale. Therefore  the  company  will  have  to  rely  more  on  this  type  of  relationships  thereby developing  the  ability  to  enforce  contracts  which  are  often  informal  using  norms  as opposed to litigation fostering and creating networks and relationships with other entities firms  agents  among  the  distribution  channels  and  complementarily  with  government authorities  which  are  considered  to  be  fundamental  assets  when  entering  in  emerging economies (Peng and Heath 1996). Master in International Business  17 \\x0cAlthough  the  empirical  evidence  does  not  show  enough  clear  and  solid  results concerning this issue authors refer to the partnership selection as a fundamental variable in the creation and operation of alliances however theorists find it difficult to consider what makes the partner the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cright\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cproper\\xe2\\x80\\x9d one concerning the international  approach. Glaister  (1996)  addresses  the  critical  importance  of  how  the  alliance  is  formed  since  the outcome  will  be  in  part  determined  by  the  features  inherent  to  the  partner  chosen  and moreover  the  set  of  skills  and  resources  that  it  will  bring  in  order  to  add  value  to  the overall cooperation process when combining the overall strategic interest and strategies of both  parties.  At  the  same  time  the  technological  expertise  and  the  marketing  system  as well as the company status are extremely important criteria to have in consideration upon the partner selection process since the volume of knowledge transference is comparatively more widespread when there is evidence of the referred characteristics and allows a much quicker market penetration as well as less resource commitment and risk in trying to obtain the  information  through  another  means  (Geringer  1991).  However  once  again  it  is important  to  remember  that  according  to  the  present  literature  is  extremely  difficult  to define  exactly  what  are  the  set  of  characteristics  intended  which  are  going  to  define  the best or ideal partner regarding the international sphere. Moreover  the  present  literature  also  emphasizes  the  nonmarket  transactions (transactions  covering  goods  or  services  that  their  producers  supply  to  others  free  or  at prices  that  are  not  economically  significant  (OCDE  2006)  among  partners  as  a  critical dimension  to  the  survival  and  effective  performance  of  the  SME  in  the  emerging economies reality (Blumentritt & Nigh 2002 Boddewyn & Brewer 1994). Finally  and  when  addressing  the  specific  assets  the  company  intends  to  obtain when approaching potential contestants it is necessary to look deeply into the context the surrounding entrepreneurial environment and lastly the technological capabilities inherent to the target company as well as the current distribution channels as a broader analysis in order to understand if the company characteristics match in fact the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s intentions.  2.5 Integration and critical analysis of the various pertinent contributes to the present literature The  recent  wave  of  Born  Globals  comes  not  just  from  market  changes  and economy globalization but also from aggressive network strategies that diffuse knowledge Master in International Business  18 \\x0cthrough  the  continuous  gain  of  experience  (Chetty  and  CampbellHunt  2004).  These features  have  made  Born  Globals  enhance  the  particular  capability  of  detecting comparatively more global opportunities when compared to traditional companies. In order to proceed with this accelerated success in the international markets Knight and Cavusgil (2004) argue that companies have the need to possess global technological capabilities and the capacity of developing a unique and not replicable product having the primordial focus in  its  quality  during  the  entire  process.  These  advantages  are  fostered  by  the  capacity  of these companies in retaining the technological knowledge having has a final purpose the profitable  outcome  achieved  from  the  fact  of  being  pioneers  and  always  maintaining themselves  one  step  ahead  comparing  to  their  competitors.  Besides  having  an  innovative concept  the  Born  Globals  insistently  adopt  an  internationalization  oriented  approach where the entrepreneurial and visionary way of thinking is  crucial to the identification of global  opportunities  and  also  for  the  selection  of  the  ideal  partners  while  engaging  in  a relationship fostering process (Knight and Cavusgil 2004).  In the initial internationalization phase firms are characterized by having lack of experience in  the foreign markets  and simultaneously lack of financial  human as well  as tangible resources (Knight and Cavusgil 2004). These gaps are usually offset through the knowledge  acquired  by  the  company  founder  and  the  team  as  well  as  through  strategic partners having Bruneel et al. (2010) stated that throughout the process the company will gain  valuable  experience  and  will  gradually  becoming  less  dependent  from  their  partners and  consequently  their  exterior  elements.  The  ideal  timing  decision  for  indeed  taking  the step towards internationalization is not consensual according to the existent literature not having  a  preferential  moment  defined.  Theorists  actually  defend  that  there  is  a circumstantial  dilemma  related  with  this  matter  in  a  way  that  an  early  expansion  may likely  strengthen  the  viability  of  the  company  in  the  long  term;  nevertheless  the internationalization  in  an  initial  phase  of  development  is  simultaneously  cause  and consequence  of  increasing  the  growth  potential  in  the  short  term  (Carr  et  al.  2010). Companies which have  been operating in  the market  for a long period are more prone to survive once they enter foreign markets however these firms experience a relatively lower growth  when  compared  to  the  youngest  companies  in  the  market.  This  fact  could  be explained in a way by the major capacity of Born Globals in adapting to the needs of the target  market  since  they  have  relatively  few  severe  guidelines  or  policies  as  well  as  the Master in International Business  19 \\x0cimportance  of  their  way  of  acting  since  it  is  easily  shaped  by  the  reality  they  operate  in (Carr et al. 2010).  Concerning the Uppsala model and the internationalization theories Johansen and Vahlne have recognized that the Uppsala model written in 1977 was in fact obsolete when they  tried  to  apply  it  to  the  contemporary  world  regarding  the  current  market specifications. Therefore they decide to revise it and to make it more tangible to the new century  reality.  The  opportunity  effect  is  now  the  element  which  gives  the  body  and  the form regarding the drivers to the internationalization process. Moreover these chances are obtained  through  the  positioning  and  the  access  to  a  privileged  company  network (Johansen and Vahlne 2009). Linking this fact to the performance of the Born Globals in the  external  markets  it  is  possible  to  understand  concerning  the  network  these  type  of companies  are  integrated  in  that  they  are  able  to  benefit  from  an  increasing  number  of market opportunities as well as the experience learning processes (Zhou et al. 2007). The access  to  markets  in  an  indirect  way  through  this  strategic  collaboration  with  partners ensure  common  activities  of  R&D  and  knowledge  diffusion  in  comparatively  more effective  way.  These  processes  allow  the  use  of  resources  and  capabilities  in  an international  manner  and  furthermore  privileged  access  to  external  capital  financing opportunities.  Additionally  it  is  possible  to  state  that  cooperation  is  reflected  in incremental gains regarding innovation (Zeng et al. 2010). Nonetheless when addressing partnerships  concerning  companies  highly  specialized  in  technology  (ex  Software companies)  their  survival  is  highly  dependent  on  the  respective  comparative  advantage and complementarily on the capacity of adapting to fast changes. Additionally according Freeman et al. (2010) it is extremely beneficial to maintain this relations based in trust and strong  commitment  with  longterm  effects  in  a  way  it  will  be  possible  to  ensure  the easiness  of  sharing  technological  knowhow  allowing  the  transfer  absorption  and development  of  new  knowledge.  Nevertheless  the  eager  to  establish  the  referred  sort  of partnerships  is  not  the  primary  incentive  for  internationalization  in  the  Born  Global  case (Olaja  2009).  Studies  in  the  field  have  concluded  that  at  the  time  of  entering  distant markets  SMEs  tend  to  select  the  country  of  destination  without  any  influence  of  the potential  target  partners  even  though  that  as  the  process  evolves  SMEs  start  to  use  and develop  new  relationships  or  prior  contacts  in  order  to  successfully  achieve  that  market being more a matter of consequence rather than a cause concerning this topic. Lastly Olaja Master in International Business  20 \\x0c(2009)  argues  that  strategic  relations  are  an  important  asset  to  SMEs  facilitating  the market  entry  process  in  a  distant  geography.  Summing  up  the  progress  in  the internationalization is  implicitly associated with  an increase in  the range and scale of the network  and  with  a  decrease  in  the  commitment  and  restrictions  inherent  to  it  (Olaja 2009). 3. Company and product presentation  SCRAIM was born from a project called AIMS in the year of 2012. This project was  promoted  by  Strongstep  (leader  of  the  project)  FEUP  (Faculdade  de  Engenharia  do Porto)  and  Multicert  (project  partner)  and  the  support  of  QREN  (Quadro  de  Refer\\xc3\\xaancia Estrat\\xc3\\xa9gica  Nacional)  having  has  ultimate  goal  the  development  of  a  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoftware  as  a service\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  (SaaS)  platform  which  would  be  capable  of  managing  the  life  cycle  of  any software supporting the  AIM (Accelerated  Improvement Method) methodology from the Software  Engineering  Institute  of  the  Carnegie  Mellon  University.  This  methodology combines  CMMI  technologies  (Capacity  Maturity  Model  Integration)  Team  Software Process  (process  for  software  development  teams  which  gives  higher  guarantees  of compliance with  CMMI as well as performance  gains)  and Six Sigma (set  of techniques and methodologies of analysis and measurement for performance improvement). The  developed  platform  integrates  project  management  components  based  on TSP  process  knowledge  management  and  respective  compliance  with  CMMI  process performance  analysis  and  projects  based  on  SIXsigma  as  well  as  various  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cplugins\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and \\xe2\\x80\\x9caddson\\xe2\\x80\\x9d in order to assure the most completed coverage of the software development life cycle and its integration within the most popular work sites environment. The platform was piloted  by  Multicert  and  it  is  commercialized  by  Strongstep.  The  FEUP  team  has contributed  with  their  knowledge  regarding  the  various  methodologies  and  techniques related with software engineering. As an innovative product in the area of process and project management besides the  initial  institutional  and  government  support  SCRAIM  had  to  deal  with  several challenges  in  the  inception  years  such  as  lack  of  financial  support  lack  of  capital  for investment growth  and internationalization and somehow inexperience on management. However SCRAIM always kept loyal to its initial strategy which passed by stable growth and internationalization intentions. Moreover during these 4  years of activity the product Master in International Business  21 \\x0cpassed  through  several  landmarks  as  well  as  created  its  own  client  network  with  the support of its mother company Strongstep. The  tool  was  just  conceived  as  a  product  in  the  year  of  2014  passing  through several  improvements  and  being  tested  among  some  renowned  national  companies  in various  areas  such  as  telecommunication  industry  and  IT.  Later  on  and  after  receiving valorous  feedbacks  and  being  approved  by  the  market  the  tool  started  to  be commercialized  by  the  mother  company  Strongstep  in  the  final  of  the  year  2014. Moreover the product has begun its expansion to the United States of America in the year of  2015  through  the  INRES  initiative  a  business  acceleration  program  in  the  field  of information  and  communication  technologies.  The  program  enabled  the  initial  steps  of SCRAIM  towards  internationalization  which  through  the  sponsoring  of  CMU  Portugal managed  to  have  a  workspace  in  Project  Olympus  installations  in  Pittsburgh  a  business accelerator  owned  by  CMU.  The  United  States  were  a  focal  point  to  the  product improvement  and  development  due  to  the  potential  synergies  with  renown  multinational companies  operating  in  the  area  as  well  as  for  the  customer  acquisition  intentions  with some big players in the neighbourhood representing an extremely valuable opportunity.  4.  Methodology The  applied  methodology  in  the  present  master  internship  report  is  based  in  a qualitative  research  obtained  through  a  theoretical  and  practical  basis  concerning  the strategic  focal  questions  that  the  author  defined  as  being  the  starting  point  for  the international market selection. The purpose of this report is also to structure and to clarify the market  penetration strategy of SCRAIM into  the BRICS markets  creating a  coherent link with the existent literature.  When developing the research work the author should define first the main topic of the study since this will define and shape the following stages of the strategy as well as the right methodology to be adopted. The focal research question here is In what country and  preferably  in  which  specific  region  do  SCRAIM  intend  to  enter  among  the  BRICS market  and  at  what  level  of  commitment?  In  order  to  answer  the  proposed  question  and after  minutely  study  and  analyze  the  information  it  was  possible  to  stress  the  key Master in International Business  22 \\x0corientations  and  strategies  that  define  international  success  among  the  innovative  tech firms.  Additionally  the  initial  research  showed  that  the  existent  theoretical  analysis  is not  consistent  enough  to  support  and  sustain  the  internationalization  of  SCRAIM  case.   Concerning the research  made there different  stated theories regarding the description of the  internationalization  method  used  in  these  type  of  companies  however  none  of  the theories  is  able  to  specifically  describe  some  variables  that  the  author  have  found  as fundamental concerning the dynamic way of acting of such firms.  Therefore and after being wisely recommended by the thesis supervisor the used methodology  will  be  based  on  the  systematic  combining  method  (Dubbois  and  Gadde 2002).  The  research  will  be  oriented  through  the  analysis  of  several  players  from  the various fields of activities who have had contact with the proposed target market stressing out the difficulties and the opportunities that those in the field may have been faced with. As well as the testimony of 4 individuals who has experienced business situations within the  Indian business  sphere and culture. Representatives from  different  areas and different business statuses in order to better understand different points of view regarding the Indian business reality.  In  order  to  structure  a  much  more  cohesive  study  and  so  that  the  results  will  be considered as relevant as possible the author will avoid to focus our analysis in one or few cases that would influence and discredit the obtained results of the survey.  The  report  will  be  divided  on  2  fundamental  different  phases.  The  first  where having  the  need  of  founding  our  research  in  relevant  existing  data  about  the  5  target economies  focusing  on  economic  political  or  social  factors.  Secondary  data  will  be addressed  attributing  special  emphasis  to  the  technologic  field  having  resorted  to  some renown databases such as Zephyr (https//zephyr.bvdinfo.com)  Gartner (http//www.gartner.com/itglossary/dbmsdatabasemanagementsystem) and TechCrunch (https//www.crunchbase.com)  (as  the  tool  the  author  intend  to  internationalize  falls  into the  technology  market  category)  in  order  to  be  enlightened  regarding  the  advances  and setbacks  that  took  place  not  just  in  the  field  but  also  within  the  first  2  selected international  markets.  Moreover  other  reliable  international  rankings  that  can  help  us understand the surrounding restrictions and possibilities will be referred in association with Master in International Business  23 \\x0cthe  target  geographies  such  as  the  Global  Competitiveness  Index  Corruption  Perception Index or the English Proficiency Index. In  a  second  phase  the  author  proceeded  to  an  analysis  based  on  primary  data where the microeconomic and more detailed technologicrelated information as well as the interviews obtained data were privileged regarding the final selected market. According  to  the  applied  methodology  (Dubbois  &  Gadde  2002)  the  relevant findings  approached  in  the  specific  geography  of  the  BRICS  markets  that  influence  the market structure consistency and viability were     Incubators and accelerators location and influence within the geography; SCRUM user groups location and relevance; Competitors location; IT clusters within the regions of the different countries. The actors in the target market were chosen in a relevant manner according to the learning  opportunities  established  by  the  research  approach  suggested  by  Dubbois  & Gadde  (2002)  and  following  characteristics  that  match  the  SCRAIM  reality.  In  order  to select pertinent subjects of analysis a careful research was applied bearing in mind all the circumstances and probabilities of success attached to the different scenarios. As  Birkinshaw  and  Hood  (2001)  stated  when  the  company  tends  to  expand  to foreign  markets  they  have  two  driven  forces  that  in  fact  influence  the  efficiency  of  the strategy taken or even its rate of success; the  internal forces and the external forces. The internal  forces  are  linked  with  the  continuous  development  of  endogenous  bonds  and strengths moreover focusing on the external forces the created network is a focal point to take  into  account  when  internationalizing.  These  topics  are  referred  because  they  do underlie  subjects  or  actors  that  can  have  a  fundamental  role  easing  the  bridge  among  the seller and the costumer.  As referred in the literature review the potential use of alliances or  cooperative  arrangements  by  small  firms  in  the  internationalization  process  can potentially  improve  the  foreign  market  penetration  by  providing  access  to  a  network  of additional relationships (Welch 1992). Having  as  a  reference  the  entry  modes  strategy  as  well  as  the  comparative analysis  of  firms  in  the  same  field  and  with  a  similar  route  and  track  record  in  what concerns  the  internationalization  path  the  recommendations  that  can  better  advice Master in International Business  24 \\x0cSCRAIM  were  provided  at  the  time  of  making  decisions  regarding  the  international expansion. In  order  to  give  credibility  to  the  research  and  indeed  validate  the  conclusions drafted  in  the  final  report  the  legitimacy  and  approval  of  the  study  occurs  through  the combination of information coming from different sources as well as the reliability of such sources (renowned indexes institutions and databases and scientific articles or studies and interviews  to  actors  who  have  a  deep  knowledge  of  the  market).  Complementarily  is essential to outline the search for the most differentiated and segregated data which allows an extensive and complete comparison among the various research made in the field. The combination  of  different  sources  of  information  is  a  method  that  allows  leveraging  the strength and viability of the results which ultimately may be a precious help overcoming some gaps that may be found along the way as the information is obtained through diverse sources and yet still compliant.  Throughout  the  report  it  is  noteworthy  that  according  to  the  researched  data  I have tried to surpass the implicit subjectivity by combining the theoretical approach with the  material  data  not  having  nonetheless  achieved  the  results  expected  priory  to  the investigation but yet what data have revealed.  5.  BRICS market research  5.1 Exclusion factors for international expansion The acronym BRICS was first introduced in the year of 2003 by Dominic Wilson and Roopa Purushothaman in one of the Global Economics papers promoted by Goldman Sachs. However the world  has changed since then and  even so some of the predictions made  in  2003  proved  to  be  right  mainly  regarding  India  and  China  which  now  present themselves as 2 powerful emergent economies worldwide with years to come of sustained growth and development. The paper stated that the referred 5 nations would become much larger forces in the world  economy  within  50  years  with  results  starting  to  appear  in  less  than  40  as  they would  become  larger  than  the  G6  economies  regarding  GDP  values  in  US  dollar  terms being the first 30 years stage for the most dramatic steady increase of the economies real GDP growth (Fig. 2). Master in International Business  25 \\x0c  Fig. 2 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 BRICS GDP projections 2050 Source Goldman Sachs (O\\xe2\\x80\\x99Neill 2001)   The paper additionally mentioned that \\xe2\\x80\\x9c(\\xe2\\x80\\xa6) as advanced economies would become a  shrinking  part  of  the  world  economy  the  associated  shifts  in  spending  could  offer interesting  opportunities  for  multinational  companies.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Investing  and  be  enrolled  in  the right markets could become and surely did an increasingly important strategic choice. However  the  development  and  growth  of  some  of  this  emergent  economies suffered  a  few  drawbacks  as  the  recent  case  of  social  and  political  crisis  in  Brazil  as  a reflection  of  high  influence  of  corruption  involving  state  individuals  entities  and departments as well as numerous human rights  abuses among police and federal security forces acting in the country sphere. Or even the excessive government  role and influence regarding  the  FDI  and  the  international  presence  of  firms  within  the  Russian  economy. Moreover levels of violent crime in South Africa have increased in the year of 2011 and 2012 and lack of capabilities regarding management and skilled labor force adding to the excessive  government  interference  are  seen  as  significant  problems  to  sum  up  to  the equation when considering internationalization (Index Transformation Transformation & Index 2016b). China and India are the nations which have provided the most pleasant results even having in consideration the fact that both economies are still significantly behind in terms Master in International Business  26 \\x0cof general development with lack of good infrastructures in most of the regions nationwide and being stage for high levels poverty in some critical areas highlighting the Indian case as  the  more  severe.  However  both  economies  have  registered  the  highest  numbers  of economy growth worldwide in the past year (World Bank Group 2014) reforms in crucial areas have been taken and increasing numbers of external investment have been leveraging the countries ambitions to look into the future. Nevertheless  exclusion  factors  concerning  the  destination  economy  for  SCRAIM business  among  the  BRICS  geographies  are  implicitly  related  with  the  IT  sector conditions as well as its related labor force skills and knowhow and the juridical risks and conditions  regarding  the  legislation  in  force  for  the  sector.  In  order  to  measure  such capabilities  and  general  conditions  the  author  have  used  several  databases  and  relevant studies in order to support our final decision. Moreover  the  analysis  concerning  the  emerging  cloud  opportunity  in  the  BRICS market has a compound annual growth rate of 38.3% over the next 5 years and moreover 61% of the 150 top global cloud companies are aiming to invest in these market in order to provide a range of cloud computing services such as SaaS (Software as a Service) PaaS (Platform as a Service) IaaS (Infrastructure as a Service) hardware and IT not to mention that  there  are  already  over  100  million  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  businesses  within  these  countries  (Zinnov Consulting\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  report  2011).  According  to  these  numbers  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  already  possible  understand the mass market object of analysis therefore in order to proceed to a carefully planned and effective  strategy  it  is  necessary  to  analyze  all  the  involved  variables  and  base  our  final decision considering the several fundamental domains. Among  other  interesting  studies  and  analysis  one  that  will  clarify  leverage  our analysis will be the Global Cloud Computing Scoreboard which offer us very interesting insights regarding the referred topics as it approaches all the essential areas regarding the relevant business conditions in order to allow its flourishment. The  study  approaches  seven  pertinent  areas  regarding  proper  policies  to  establish  in order  to  leverage  the  transformation  of  both  businesses  in  the  cloud  computing  area  and national economies which are 1.  Ensuring privacy (In order to maximize the use of the cloud users must be able to transfer  data  across  the  cloud  in  an  efficient  manner  and  without  external interference); Master in International Business  27 \\x0c2.  Promoting  security  (Users  must  be  protected  and  must  have  their  risks  managed coherently and consistently therefore cybersecurity should assure) 3.  Battling cybercrime (Legal and juridical systems/entities should be  armed in order to provide an effective and flawless mechanism that ensures the law enforcement); 4.  Protecting  intellectual  property  (Protecting  IP  is  crucial  in  order  to  promote continuous  innovation  and  technological  improvements  not  just  for  the  national players  but  also  for  foreigners  who  bring  their  groundbreaking  technology  to  the country); 5.  Ensuring data portability and harmonization of international rules (The natural flow of data worldwide should be a mandatory condition regarding the openness and the interoperability of the cloud); 6.  Promoting free trade (In the cloud business sphere and being the internet a market place with no boundaries the internationalization is an implicit factor. The reach of the market is mostly dependent on how the sector and the respective governments overcome or eliminate the existing barriers) 7.  Establishing necessary IT infrastructure (Policies which incentive and promote the generalized  broadband  access  should  be  taken  regarding  the  cloud  business development). In order to have the most of the cloud services the geographies and its respective policy  makers  need  to  ensure  a  solid  legal  and  regulatory  set  of  measures  that  allows  IT businesses to  flourish  naturally and safety. Nevertheless  incentives are also an important factor that will in a large scale determine the quality and the quantity of the investment the geographies will be able to attract. Regarding  the  BSA  CloudScoreCard  report  and  the  crucial  factors  mentioned above  Brazil  have  been  presenting  innumerous  flaws  regarding  the  security  of  IT  and cloud related business being the third last country in the Scorecard rankings. The country have  had  its  initial  concerns  related  with  the  cybercrime  laws  just  in  the  year  of  2012 making  minor  policy  improvements  by  approving  the  first  related  cybercrime  legislation in a country where the cybercrime associated losses reached the $8 billion in the same year (Bsa  2013).  Additionally  the  country  does  not  provide  any  type  of  law  or  enforceable code  containing  any  specific  legislation  regarding  the  security  of  cloud  dependent businesses  or  platforms  as  well  as  regarding  intellectual  property  rights  and  support  for Master in International Business  28 \\x0csupport  for  industry  ledstandards  Brazil  continues  to  lag  behind  in  most  of  the  topics concerning  countries  who  aim  to  attract  innovative  and  disruptive  technologies  to  the economy. Another  not  so  cloud  friendly  case  is  the  South African  nation  with  some  points regarding data privacy and intellectual property protection still needing to be provisioned and still not having any national or private entity regulating neither the privacy of the user nor the data used and created within the cloud. Moreover the country does not apply any of the terms or protections established in WIPO copyright treaty which stands as  a major threat  for  any  cloud  business  related  company  who  intends  to  internationalize  their business to South Africa (Bsa 2013). Regarding  the  BRICS  conditions  to  receive  business  initiatives  related  with  the cloud running operations the study finds that Russia India and China are taking the right steps in order to minimize eventual damage that the business may suffer due to its implicit vulnerability. The picture bellow shows the overall results regarding crucial reform topics that the global industry has been taking in order to ensure to technological entrepreneurs a safe  and  stable  business  environment  in  what  concerns  the  data  protection  of  their activities and indeed of their users (Graph 1). Master in International Business  29 \\x0cGraph 1.  BSA Cloudscore BRICS Technology capabilities analysis Master in International Business  30  \\x0cGraph 1.  BSA Cloudscore BRICS Technology capabilities analysis Master in International Business   31 \\x0cNevertheless  Russia  political  and  macroeconomic  conditions  are  not  the  most suitable for foreign investors as it remains being led by high levels of political influence regarding  the  largest  companies  operating  in  the  market  in  particular  the  stateowned companies. The state of Russia has been increasing its respective shares on publicowned companies with strategic purposes as a mean to impede the private and foreign investors in  particular  from  gaining  relevance  or  market  share  within  industries  and  sectors  the government  considers  fundamental  regarding  their  market  control  objectives  (Index Transformation  Transformation  &  Index  2016a).  However independent  studies approaching this fact are still not available. Russia has had some controversy results on some rankings and studies worldwide having overall stable results but hiding some major flaws in specific crucial fields which highlight  the  direct  implications  of  having  such  a  stateoriented  economy.  For  example considering  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cEase  of  doing  business  2015\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  ranking  Russia  is  ranking  62  out  of  189 countries  however  in  capital  evaluation  topics  integrating  the  ranking  like  dealing  with construction permits Russia is positioned at 156th and moreover in trading across borders is  placed  as  155  (World  Bank  2015).  Unattractive  conditions  for  business  as  the  ones referred before especially concerning the lack of certainty associated with property rights cause  direct  impact  on  investment  levels  which  are  far  below  the  expected  in  order  to support  and  leverage  Russian  economy.  Regarding  the  continuous  pace  of  the  investors nonsupportive  policies  in  the  month  of  January  of  the  previous  year  Moody\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  and Standard & Poor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s announced a downgrade concerning the Russia credit rating to the BB+ level which will also certainly not be helpful in order to improve the business environment and the relations of the country with foreign investors. As  already  referred  above  there  are  some  strategic  sectors  within  the  Russian economy which the state does not want to relinquish controlling as these are considered fundamental  for  national  security.  These  mentioned  sectors  are  often  safeguarded  from any competitive pressures and have been incorporated within sector specific conglomerates in a way of dominating the market with no relevant opponents. Namely there is the case of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cRussian Technologies\\xe2\\x80\\x9d which is ruled by a longtime associate of Vladimir Putin Sergei Chemezov who have been protecting the industry according to the state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests. Even though  Russia  has  joined  the  World  Trade  Organization  (WTO)  in  August  of  2012  after Master in International Business  32 \\x0clong rounds of negotiating and despite the foreign trade liberalization in theoretical terms there are still on practice strong barriers to trade (Index et al. 2016a) These and other facts related with the lack of support from competent entities added with  the  weak  institutional  framework  which  increases  the  already  high  levels  of ineffectiveness of the market based on the free competition principles directly affects the confidence  and  the  trustworthiness  of  the  system  which  is  way  bellow  of  the  remaining BIC countries general levels as the picture above can highlight (Fig. 3).  Fig. 3 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Russia VS BIC VS OCDE average overall results Source World Economic Forum 2011 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Russia Report Addressing the general  macroeconomic picture related with the Russian economy there  are  some  major  facts  that  lead  us  to  conclude  that  the  Russian  geography  is  not  a viable option to install and distribute SCRAIM business. Ultimately  two  viable  options  are  presented  in  order  to  introduce  SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business India and China. Moreover and since the author is approaching accelerators and incubators  as  a  mean  of  distribution  is  important  to  understand  that  these  two  countries Master in International Business  33 \\x0cappear as an unique opportunity since they comprise almost 97% of their business through SMB\\xe2\\x80\\x99s (small and medium businesses) activities and these in turn generate approximately 40% of total exports and output (Zinnov consulting report 2011).  5.2 Analysis of the postselected target markets The market  selection for international  expansion is  always a challenging  process and  has  the  implicit  need  for  a  profound  and  coherent  analysis.  In  this  process  and regarding  the  strongest  possibilities  as  being  India  and  China  several  factors  must  be pondered in order to understand and define the best suitable geography to expand. During this  analysis  macroeconomics  perspectives  will  be  addressed  as  well  as  ICT  related conditions of each country in order to evaluate the best option to follow and subsequently define the best or the bests regions to settle SCRAIM business. India and China appear in the global scenario as the two fastest growing economies with  sustained  Gross  Domestic  Product  (GDP)  rates  varying  from  7  to  10  per  cent  and sometimes  higher  over  the  past  few  years.  Moreover  these  are  the  two  most  populous countries  worldwide  with  1.1  and  1.3  billion  people  respectively  and  represent  a  major opportunity even for niche markets due to the immense diversity of the market in terms of religions ethnicities customs and traditions. However India is the only country among the BRICS who has managed to maintain its growth rate during the year of 2015 and it is still expected to increase it in the year of 2016 (International Monetary Fund 2015). The  two  countries  have  been  sites  for  tremendous  growth  in  various  areas  as  the trade  liberalization  and  the  open  market  structure  have  took  place.  Even  though  they present  extremely  different  political  systems  both  countries  enhance  a  number  of similarities  regarding  the  reform  plans  they  have  been  following  namely  regarding  the government role or its degree of intervention in order to ultimately increase their openness to  foreign  trade  and  therefore  pursuit  their  path  to  become  major  economies  in  a  global sphere.  However  regarding  the  steps  both  countries  have  been  giving  towards  a  freer economy  in  order  to  follow  the  open  market  requirements  the  Economic  Freedom  Index shows that the outcome has not  been so identical to  both  countries.  It  has been noticed a clear  backset  concerning  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  policies  to  keep  the  investment  and  trade  open  towards Master in International Business  34 \\x0cthe global world since it has not introduced the desired changes considering the promises made  when  entering  the  World  Trade  Organization  in  the  year  of  2001.  Fact  which nowadays  lead  the  country  to  an  alarming  144th  position  out  of  178  countries  in  the Economic  Freedom  Index.  On  the  other  side  India  has  shown  a  steadily  progress  when compared  with  the  world  trend  as  the  country  has  even  surpassed  China  regarding  the overall score of economic freedom (Fig. 4).  Fig. 4. \\xe2\\x80\\x93 India and China economic freedom comparison Source Economic Freedom Index 2016     Regarding some other macroeconomic aspects the numbers for both economies are extremely  pleasant  as  it  was  already  referred  and  moreover  according  to  Richard  Herd and Sean Dougherty (2007) comparative work the areas within the Indian economy which showed  the  most  impressive  progress  until  the  year  of  2005  have  been  the  labor productivity (4.36% increase from 19901999 and 3.76% increase from 20002005) GDP per  capita  (4.80%  increase  from  20002005)  employment  (2.61%  increase  from  20002005) and on the financial side the capital stock has also been target for very compelling increases reaching a 6.68% growth in the period of 2000 to 2005. Regarding the Chinese economy the same author found that according to China National Bureau of Statistics and his  own  estimations  the  main  factors  behind  China  growth  were  the  labor  productivity having  compound  growth  rates  of  around  8%  since  the  beginning  of  the  90  decade  the arise of capital stock in the country (10.04 % increase from 20002005) and the GDP per Master in International Business  35 \\x0ccapita  growth  which  was  driven  by  the  overall  growth  of  the  economy  and  by  pleasing overall results regarding social welfare. In  order  to  have  a  state  overview  of  both  countries  in  a  macroeconomic perspective  the  table  below  highlights  the  most  relevant  rankings  and  the  two  countries associated position concerning the overall trade conditions they are found   Countries  World Bertelsmann IMD World World PRS Economist IHS Economic Foundation Competitiveness Justice International Intelligence Global Forum EOS India China 54 49  Source CPI 2015  TI Yearbook Project Country Unit Insight ROL Risk Guide 45 36 35 39 25 28 41 31 38 38 32 32 It  is  possible  to  understand  that  both  countries  go  hand  in  hand  in  most  of  the rankings founding themselves more or less in the same stage of improvement as well as in what  concerns  the  appropriate  conditions  for  doing  business  even  though  that  it  is relatively noticeable that China is in a more advanced stage of development comparing to India. Facts that are already explained above regarding the stage of development and wideranging  growth  the  Indian  nation  has  more  recently  entered.  Fact  which  promise  to  be reflected on a sustainable growth across the next decade or so. Moreover  A.  T.  Kearney  (2014)  realized  an  analysis  called  Global  Sources Location  Index  where  it  puts  India  on  the  top  of  the  classification  among  the  BRICS countries  considering  as  weighting  areas  the  financial  attractiveness  people  skills  and availability  as  well  as  the  business  environment.  India  ranks  first  with  7  points  on  the overall  score  being  immediately  followed  by  China  with  6.15  points  what  lead  us  to conclude  that  besides  the  relatively  more  advanced  stage  of  development  regarding China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  economy  India  presents  itself  as  a  nation  with  more  opportunities  as  well  as  a \\xe2\\x80\\x9csexier\\xe2\\x80\\x9d market for international risk takers. On  other  relevant  areas  related  with  the  corporate  level  and  regarding  Indian economy the increase of the labor productivity and the income growth had a highpitched impact  on  the  active  population  due  the  entrance  of  foreign  players  fundamentally regarding  the  big  cities  who  brought  along  with  their  internationalization  purposes  new Master in International Business  36 \\x0csystems  and  management  models  jointly  with  innovative  tools  into  the  Indian  business reality.  As  well  as  the  phenomenon  linked  to  the  shift  of  several  previously  public companies  to  the  private  sector  which  had  remain  many  years  under  the  public management  and  jurisdiction  and  have  change  its  dynamics  allowing  the  state  to accumulate and invest the capital gained with these processes in other crucial fields.  As it was already referred the Indian economy as well as its government have been constantly evolving concerning its investor friendly policies selling the image of a country where  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  being  more  and  more  easy  to  invest  in  having  emerged  on  top  with  a  47% increase in the year of 2014 and 641 announced projects considering the figures associated with  FDI  attractiveness  inclusively  beating  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  score  concerning  the  greenfield investment  within  the  country  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cInvestment  climate  statement  2015\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  2015).  The  country adds to this fact the abundancy of natural resources at a low price as well as the lower cost of production due to the lower labor rates. On the field of labor farce it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also important to mention that India is famous for being a cradle for extremely skilled manpower mainly on the IT and mathematics areas offering some genius heads to the world such as the actual Google CEO or the exInfosys Chief. Additionally and to magnify the possibilities among this  skilled  labor  force  65%  of  the  population  regarding  the  Indian  nation  is  between  15 and 35 years old according to the International Trade Center data which can be considered as an opportunity since SCRAIM business is technologyrelated and the learning process regarding the platform would be faster with younger people. Concerning  the  business  environment  conditions  in  India  according  to  Doing Business  2015  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  possible  to  highlight  some  major  areas  of  improvement  such  as  the ease to start a business topic which suffered the biggest changes in the last 5 years in order to  attract  new  sources  of  investment  and  provide  better  conditions  to  the  ones  willing  to invest.  The  country  is  also  raising  awareness  in  order  to  protect  minor  investors  and incentive  foreigners  to  partner  up  with  national  players  however  there  are  still  some topics that do not drive foreigners will for being part of the second biggest market of the world  such  as  the  construction  permits  and  the  enforcement  of  contracts  as  well  as resolving insolvency  which still are the  country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Achilles\' heel  in  the provided package for foreign investors. Regarding  China  the  fields  which  suffered  the  greatest  changes  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  possible  to highlight education; openness to foreign trade which particularly showed essential for the Master in International Business  37 \\x0ccountry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s overall development; the increasing participation of the private sector across the different  areas  of  activity;  and  lastly  the  urbanization  which  was  the  pillar  for  the economic boom  China has suffered  going  from  13% of the population  living in  cities in the  year  of  1950  to  45%  in  2010  and  projecting  to  have  60%  of  the  population  living within cities in 2030 (Yale insights 2013). The efforts made regarding the education sector have also been noticeable with the Chinese government trying to cover the isolated areas of the country with primary schools and expanding the university public services (OECD 2015). Even  though  China  has  been  making  huge  progresses  in  crucial  areas  for  the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  development  essentially  by  adopting  an  open  market  strategy  there  are  still some  details  that  make  the  picture  not  so  suitable  once  you\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve  already  passed  the macroeconomic analysis. Regarding Doing Business 2015 China still has some issues that not facilitate foreign companies operations within the country such as the topic concerning dealing  with  construction  permits.  This  is  still  a  major  motive  for  concern  regarding foreign  players  acting  in  the  country  although  there  were  some  improvements  made  the communist government  does not  like to  abdicate from  their land to  foreign investors and due to  this reason the  country still ranks 179 out  of 189 countries worldwide among the referred topic. Additionally to make matters worse China also does not ease the access to credit  when  demanded  for  foreign  players  as  well  as  does  not  provide  the  necessary protection  to  minor  investors  who  want  to  associate  themselves  with  a  Chinese  partner making  the  referred  factors  some  of  the  major  difficulties/obstacles  when  addressing matters related with starting a business within the Chinese geography (World Bank 2014).  As it is  possible to  state in  the figure provided by  the World Trade Organization and the Global Trade Alert report in 2015 China along with SouthAfrica is the country who made less policy changes regarding the commercerelated determination towards the openness of the market while India is by far the country which showed the higher concern for having its  economy  open  to  the  global  market  and  which  added  more  additional  measures regarding the database (Fig. 5). Master in International Business  38 \\x0c Fig. 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Global Trade Alert and World Trade organization coverage of BRICS commercerelated policy changes Source Global Trade Alert report 2015  Moreover and according to a study realized by the Centre of Economic Policy and Research  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGlobal  Trade  Alert  2015\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  no  country  in  the  world  has  seen  their commercial  interest  harmed  as  often  as  the  Chinese  nation  whose  interests  have  been affected in a total of 2153 times since the global crisis in 2008 has begun as  the picture bellow can show (Fig. 6).  Fig. 6 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Harmful measures among the BRICS commercial interests Source Global Trade Alert 2015 Master in International Business   39 \\x0cThis  is  not  just  related  with  global  economic  slowdown  but  also  to  the  risk associated with the country foreign investors which now are making more responsible and less intuitive decisions when internationalizing are not willing to risk their  investment in such  a  protective  and  nationalist  environment  even  though  that  we  are  talking  about  the world biggest market. India is still another worrying case however and as it is possible to observe in the picture above the Indian sphere seems to deal quicker and more effectively when approaching measures that do not incentive trade. The  countries  have  both  largely  invested  in  critical  areas  with  the  purpose  of closing  the  gap  with  developed  economies  worldwide.  This  has  involved  investment  in fields  as  education  with  the  purpose  of  forming  and  developing  their  people  having resulted  in  a  considerable  amount  of  extremely  qualified  labor  force  that  has  been  either creating  jobs  within  the  country  or  assuming  relevant  positions  in  top  multinational companies worldwide as some cases the author already referred.  Likewise both countries have also invested in the industrial field with major sums devoted to aggressive campaigns as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMade in China\\xe2\\x80\\x9d or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cMake in India\\xe2\\x80\\x9d doing substantial efforts  to  retain  investment  within  their  borders  and  moreover  attracting  foreign entrepreneurs who pursuit costs optimization and intend to maintain the quality standards.  Weighing  all  the  considerations  it  is  also  important  to  highlight  that  China  has started  earlier  the  transition  process  towards  the  international  market  openness.  Having comparatively  involved  greater  change  and  being  closer  from  the  market  economy paradigm  however  both  reforms  process  are  still  taking  place  therefore  it  would  be premature  to  evaluate  the  current  countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99  situation  based  on  the  previous  progress. Nevertheless since India is still on a much rawer phase it is possible to state that this fact mandatorily  indicates  that  the  country  presents  itself  as  a  much  stronger  opportunity  for SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s internationalization ambitions since the business  dynamics in  India it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in  an early stage of development and lacking tools that allow companies work more effectively and less costly. Additionally India still has the possibility of introducing new policies that would  certainly  improve  the  total  productivity  growth.  However  it  is  fundamental  to pounder all the pros and cons not just on a macroeconomic perspective but also regarding the conditions to receive cloud or networkrelated businesses and the attractiveness of the market demand for software as a service in the project and process management area.   Master in International Business  40 \\x0c5.2.1 ICT sector and business environment considerations of postselected target markets China and India have indeed been the countries in the spotlight among the suitable geographies  to  operate  in  cloud  and  networkbased  related  businesses  having  had  an increase  of  over  50%  in  terms  of  ICT  investment  in  the  last  5  years.  In  addition  and regarding the software industry with this being our main focus of analysis its associated spending  growth  has  assumed  different  scenarios  among  the  BRICS  countries  and  more precisely between India and China. According to a Gartner Research in the year of 2014 India has been taking the lead among the race with a 10% software spending growth rate just in the year of 2013 while China has had an also fairly impressive 7% spending growth rate.  These  figures  are  fundamental  when  trying  to  understand  what  is  the  trend  and  in which  direction  is  the  market  is  shifting  as  it  is  already  common  sense  that  most  of  the worldwide  major  players  are  moving  their  ICT  infrastructure  and  customer  support channels  towards  the  East  due  to  the  unbeatable  lower  labor  costs.  Moreover  in  this scenario  is  common  to  highlight  China  has  a  major  destination  due  to  the  actual  flow  of capital that has been entering to the country with such purpose however the shift to India is even more recent and has been gaining colossal dimensions.  There  is  some  suggestive  data  regarding  the  shift  the  countries  have  been assuming  such  as  the  employment  data  and  its  related  numbers  over  the  years.  It  is possible  to  notice  that  both  countries  have  been  stage  for  an  increasing  trend  concerning the  employment  outside  the  agricultural  sector  moreover  it  has  also  been  noticeable  the predominance  of  the  secondary  sector  comparing  to  the  mobility  towards  the  tertiary sector.  Focusing  in  the  Indian  case  more  than  70%  of  the  increase  in  the  employment came  from  the  secondary  and  tertiary  sectors  of  the  economy  with  the  secondary  sector accounting with 50% increase mainly due to small manufacturing sites in rural areas (Herd &  Dougherty  2006).  Nevertheless  the  actual  speed  of  the  declining  trend  regarding  the share  of  agriculture  workers  in  India  was  only  half  of  that  observed  in  China  during  the period of 1978 until 2003 which once again indicates that most likely India is just now in the start of the shift in order to become a global power (Fig. 7). This shift has a particular relevance  regarding  BPO  activities  (Business  Process  Offshoring)  and  more  recently various areas concerning the ICT sector assuming the 49th position among 128 countries in the Trade Performance Index and having had a change in the index of 54 positions just in Master in International Business  41 \\x0cthe year of 2014. Among the IT range one branch of the business that has been target of a major  affluence  is  exactly  the  software  industry  and  implicitly  the  field  of  SaaS (Software as a Service). %  Fig. 7 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Growth employment per year \\xe2\\x80\\x93 China VS India Source  China  National  Bureau  of  Statistics  and  Statistical  Yearbook  India  Central  Statistical Organization and National Sample survey 2007.  Based on these facts the Indian economy presents an appealing margin of growth concerning  not  just  the  general  employment  growth  but  also  the  margin  it  has  regarding the  shift  from  agricultural  activities  to  secondary  and  tertiary  sector  activities.  Moreover concerning  the  secondary  and  tertiary  sectors  of  activity  the  Indian  software  market  has been  a  particular  case.  According  to  an  already  referred  Gartner  research  the  Indian software market revenue accounted with a total of $4.765 billion just in the year of 2013 what directly means a 10 per cent increase comparing to the previous year of 2012 where the country achieved a revenue of $4.334 (Gartner Inc. 2014) (Fig. 8).

Based on Bhayish Sood (2014) statement it is already possible to affirm that companies in India  have  witnessed  a  boom  in  the  software  sphere  and  that  they  are  untiringly  looking after the type of service SCRAIM is providing with the purpose of helping the companies to  maintain  or  increase  competitiveness  through  the  cloud/subscriptionbased  platforms. Systems  which  enable  the  leveraging  of  the  company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  internal  processes  strength  and FIG. X \\xe2\\x80\\x93 BRICS software spending growth rate 20122013 Source Gartner (April 2014) allows to conceive better quality projects.  The  same  research  showed  that  currently  63%  of  PC  software  within  the  Indian sphere is pirated. Even though this numbers are a reason for concern as the graph on the figure  8  previously  showed  India  still  continues  spending  a  large  amount  of  money  in software  being  the  country  which  has  grown  the  most  among  the  BRICS  countries  in 2013.  Moreover  from  2005  when  the  country  accounted  with  74%  of  the  total  software pirated to  2008 the software piracy  rate decreased exactly 5% and plus  6% considering the numbers related to the year of 2011 which end up showing a pretty consistent drop as Master in International Business  43 \\x0cwell  as  a  general  concern  to  cease  the  piracy  means  to  enter  as  a  side  business  to  the software area. Furthermore Bhavish Sood referred that \\xe2\\x80\\x9crecent advances in ICT communications structure of the country has opened up avenues for local consumption of ICT software and associated  services\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  The  referred  efforts  towards  a  safer  and  secure  ICT  sphere considering  the  technological  ambitions  of  the  country  show  that  in  a  near  future  the country  aims  to  be  provided  with  the  necessary  infrastructure  in  order  to  support  various networkbased  and  cloudbased  services  such  as  SaaS.  Considering  the  reality  and dimension of the market this implies a golden offer to the type of service SCRAIM intends to commercialize and distribute in a new viable geography. On the other hand China at  a glance seems  to  be a suitable country to  install  and operate  in  the  cloud  and  networkbased  services  area  however  according  with  the  same Gartner research (2014) it is easy to understand that nonChinese companies find that hard to establish their business within the region given the adverse requirements a priori that a foreigner  investor  needs  to  be  able  to  compete  against.  Among  the  Chinese  IT  business sphere  besides  the  weak  understanding  foreign  players  own  about  the  local  business requirements newcomers are not just competing against the competitors in the market but also  against  government  support  in  a  relatively  controlled  market  in  terms  of  leads  and \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmonopolized\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  deals.  Additionally  Chinese  software  players  are  able  to  offer  24/7 support divided by segmented specialized multi layers in order to satisfy all the consumer needs which are very difficult to match being a foreign SME as it is the SCRAIM case. This happens due to the fact that this industry has been developing itself since the 1990\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and  the  2000\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  decades  fact  which  allowed  national  performers  to  have  a  much  more complex services structure in current times as well as it enabled Chinese players  to have provisioned systems able to combat foreign knowhow and financial power.  Additionally the piracy rate in China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s software business has always been a glaring case for the ones intending to sell and distribute their new feature product or service in the market. However this rate was continuously declining until the  year of 2010 date which marked its stagnation. Nowadays China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s piracy rate roughly matches India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s piracy rate 10 years ago and seems questionable whether the scenario it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s going to change in times to come. Master in International Business  44 \\x0cNonetheless  as  it  is  often  referred  during  this  work  China  and  India  have  some common points that make both countries attractive to operate in the ICT related area as the fact of both owning incredibly talented ICT engineers whom not always pursue their path working for third parties and often appear to use their skills to infiltrate and copy software which are the foundation for most companies internal processes. The case seems to be even more  alarming  when  considering  that  both  countries  are  now  adopting  opensource software  in  most  of  their  business  activities.  Fact  which  has  been  increasing  companies demand  for  complex  and  more  advanced  software  capable  of  enabling  foreign  and domestic  players  to  develop  their  activities  in  a  safely  manner  leaving  small  business copycats  without  a  chance  for  hacking  their  way  into  companies  unique  competitive advantages. Trends around business intelligence and analytics have been marking the focus for various enterprises investments in platforms databases or management systems capable of monitoring  either  punctual  clientfocus  projects  or  internal  managerial  processes. Furthermore it is comprehensive that due to financial availability and other capital factors most of these the investments are done by large corporations. However the Indian and the Chinese market have witnessed a trend of growing potential among the small and midsize businesses (SMB) segment which have actually been playing a crucial role in changing the consumption  trends  of  technology.  Nevertheless  these  sort  of  companies  always  fight against implicit problems of lack of experience lack of scaling in most of the cases as well as lack of financial power which are inevitable in order to understand and handling with the  market  challenges.  However  this  environment  fulfilled  with  entrepreneurialism  and technological irreverence is extremely beneficial for SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s maturation once we are in  the  imminence  of  a  product  in  an  early  phase  and  it  is  essential  to  develop  and  grow while  benefiting  from  the  maximum  interaction  and  approval  of  experts  operating  within those markets. Nevertheless  after  analyzing  several  studies  concerning  the  ICT  sector  among China  and  India  it  was  possible  to  conclude  that  besides  the  extremely  positive developments  both  countries  have  been  presenting  they  tended  to  specialize  on  different segments. In China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case is clearly noticeable that the country has been specializing their production in the manufacturing branch with large amounts inflows and outflows of FDI Master in International Business  45 \\x0cas well as export related activities being directly related with the ICT industry. Moreover as  of  2006  China  has  actually  become  the  largest  country  in  the  whole  world  producing ICT  products  where  the  value  added  of  the  sector  increased  to  188  billion  \\xe2\\x82\\xac  (Simon 2011).  Nowadays  80%  of  the  ICT  industry  activities  revenues  in  China  comes  from  the production  and  distribution  of  computer  systems  electronic  elements  and  components communication  equipment  and  audio  and  home  video  products  what  lead  us  to  say  that China produces and sells fundamentally hardware. Whereas India on the other side has specialized in the services sector concerning the  ICT  industry  being  the  principal  areas  of  expertise  composed  by  computer  related services and telecommunications. Moreover unlike the manufacturing branch the services have gained a significant incidence in the country business sphere with various categories of companies entering into the game and having directly contribute to a steady growth rate in  the  sector  upon  the  year  of  2000.  The  openness  for  the  global  trade  upon  the  entry  to World  Trade  Organization  in  2001  has  also  contributed  in  a  great  scale  for  these developments. Such events have backedup a boost among the entrepreneurial spirit in the country as well as fomented the already strong position of major worldwide Indian players being reflected on an annual grow in the sector of about 27% just between the year of 2000 and  2010  meaning  a  very  significant  increase  either  by  services  exportations  or  by aggregated flows of FDI (Malik P. 2011). Once again these facts lead us to strengthen the idea that India would be the most viable option. Finally  another  focal  point  to  consider  when  pondering  where  to  internationalize SCRAIM  business  is  the  language  adaptations  regarding  the  platform  since  it  directly affects  the  effectiveness  of  the  its  use  as  well  as  the  costs  of  providing  an  adequate customer  technical  support.  In  the  global  world  we  live  nowadays  is  consensual  among business habits as well as for effects of mean of communication among different nations cultures and ethnicities the English as the linguistic bridge whereas the same is applicable across  all  services  webpages  and  platforms.  Moreover  regarding  SCRAIM  financial capability and the aim of adapting the platform to the user in order to maximize the use of it  it  is  important  to  have  less  costly  adaptations  in  order  to  meet  the  company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  board interest. Moreover following this line of thought ideally the best suitable user would be the native or at least the fluent English speaker. Master in International Business  46 \\x0cIn a way of being able to fundament this selection criteria the author resorted to the English  Proficiency  Index  which  showed  the  tremendous  differences  across  Asia  and more precisely between China and India (Fig. 9).  Fig. 9 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Asia English proficiency overview Source English Proficiency Index As  the  graph  can  show  the  differences  across  Asia  are  vast  and  are  very  much related with some countries colonial past as the case of India which was colonized by the British  Empire  for  approximately  60  years.  It  is  fundamentally  due  to  this  events  that English  is  understood  and  used  commonly  as  a  medium  of  spoken  and  written communication  across  the  Indian  nation.  On  the  other  hand  even  though  China  business reality  have  been  passing  through  efforts  towards  an  integration  with  worldwide  players English is still used strictly as a business mean more applicable to the big cities where the presence  of  multinationals  has  been  more  widely  noticed.  Leaving  the  country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  interior areas with any contact or concern for learning the English language. In such way that the country  is  amongst  those  with  the  lowest  proficiency  in  all  Asia  having  an  established level  of  49.41  of  proficiency  (English  Proficiency  Index  2015).  Oppositely  India  is  the Master in International Business  47 \\x0cthird  highest  proficiency  country  in  the  region  being  only  overcome  by  Singapore  and Malaysia which are two of the main financial centers worldwide nowadays. Nonetheless besides the direct implications of adapting the platform language and customer technical support there are other factors related with the influence of the English language speakers as a study of the English Proficiency Index team can state. It is possible to  find  very  interesting  and  relevant  correlations  among  the  English  speakers  and  the expertise of the technicians involved for instance. Additionally it was found that English speaking  countries  have  a  correlated  increase  in  high  tech  exports  of  0.60  as  well  as  an associated  increase  in  the  expenditures  in  innovation  with  a  stated  correlation  of  0.75 (English Proficiency Index 2015). Lastly and pondering the implicit need for having qualified labor force concerning the IT activities that the company hereafter intends to develop it is important to compare the  level  of  education  among  the  2  countries.  According  to  Richard  Herd  and  Sean Dougherty (2007) India has more than doubled the average years of education across the last  40  years  being  classified  has  one  the  fastest  growing  rates  among  countries  with available estimations concerning the field of study originating considerable improvements regarding  the  12yearold  age  group  that  previously  to  this  developments  was  mainly illiterate  as  well  as  the  rate  of  illiteracy  amongst  the  young  people  which  has  evidently reduced. Additionally the increase in human capital was remarkably fast increasing at just under  09%  in  an  annual  basis.  Concerning  higher  education  as  being  the  primary  focus regarding  the  ICT  and  software  related  activities  Indian  higher  education  students  have particularly  specialized  in  these  fields  of  activities  however  and  once  again  focusing  on the tertiary level China has been gaining some ground concerning the proportion of people attending to higher education institutions.  Nevertheless based in the various fields and various consideration the author took in account is fair to indicate India as the most valuable option given the area of activity SCRAIM plans to develop and its associated specifications the language considerations as well  as  the  room  to  grow  that  both  markets  present.  Basing  on  the  assertiveness  of  this premise the author will embrace the final  phase of the project  and proceed their work in order  to  find  the  best  suitable  region  among  the  Indian  nation  to  successfully  install  the platform and hopefully witness the SCRAIM business grow.  Master in International Business  48 \\x0c6.  India \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Country diagnosis  6.1 PEST analysis India is a major mass market worldwide where 1600 languages are spoken and the history  as  well  as  the  cultural  heritage  are  extremely  vast  (Census  India  2011).  Each state/region  is  different  culturally  socially  and  politically  speaking  therefore  there\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  a recognizable  need  for  carefully  and  minutely  analyze  each  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csubtarget  market\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  as  being totally distinct from one another.  In order to effectively understand those differences the author took the liberty to interview  4  individuals  Jo\\xc3\\xa3o  Rodrigues  AIECEP  (Portuguese  government  agency) representative in India; Nat\\xc3\\xa9rcia Santos human resource specialist; Valdemar class trainer on  the  footwear  industry;  and  Miguel  Seixas  SONAE  board  director.  The  interviewed individuals  have  or  had  the  chance  for  work  and  live  within  the  Indian  reality.  The professionals  were  also  stemmed  from  different  hierarchic  levels  concerning  the organizations  each  one  worked  for  in  a  way  that  the  results  would  not  be  influenced  by any type of inaccurate information due to strictly dealing with one standard segment of the business  society.  The  contributions  of  the  individuals  interviewed  will  be  pertinent  on various  levels  but  mostly  regarding  the  social  and  cultural  definition  of  the  common Indian  worker  and  its  associated  specific  habits  and  behaviors  as  this  was  the  most tangible areas concerning their daily basis activities.  To  better  comprehend  the  Indian  market  a  PEST  analysis  of  the  country  was conducted also containing valuable information obtained through the pursued interviews.  Political Environment   India appears in the global scenario as the largest democracy in the world due the immense  demographic  mass  of  its  country  accounting  with  approximately  1.252  billion people with a longterm established democratic government having had its independency in 1947 and currently presenting 29 states and 7 centrally administered territories  (World Bank 2014).  The  Indian  party  system  is  extensive  and  legitimately  stable  however  and according  not  just  to  the  rankings  but  also  the  individuals  the  author  had  opportunity  to interview  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccorruption  is  felt  transversally  in  the  Indian  system\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Nevertheless  there Master in International Business  49 \\x0care  a  various  number  of  parties  expressing  common  and  particular  interests  that  coexist and are debated at a state and at a nationwide level. The two main political parties are the Indian  National  Congress  (INC)  and  the  Bharatiya  Janata  Party  (BJP)  having  both  born from coalitions. The Indian National Congress (INC) as a centrist and secular party leads the  United  Progressive  Alliance  (UPA)  and  applies  both  conservative  and  capitalist approaches  as  well  as  methodologies.  The  BJP  leads  the  National  Democratic  Alliance (NDA) and represents the traditional values as well as the small business people traders and the middle class through a rightwing approach.  Additionally the country has been commanded by several different parties along the history however regarding the historic areas of conflict within country there are still some  areas  that  not  make  themselves  represent  in  the  elections  such  as  the  case  of Kashmir  some  parts  of  the  Northeast  and  a  few  regions  in  Central  India  which  are  still controlled by the Naxalite Rebels (Bertelsmann Stiftung 2016).  Nevertheless  the  democracy  the  author  is  referring  to  lived  a  performance somehow bellow the expected levels most of its time fundamentally due to the blockade of the parliament via the opposition which delayed and many times stalled the introduction of crucial reforms regarding the country ideal development path.  Since  2004  the  country  was  governed  by  the  Indian  National  Congress  (INC) until the year of 2014. The proactive alliance was trying to introduce at a fast pace many delayed  reforms  over  the  years  in  fundamental  structural  areas  that  support  the  country economic  growth  in  a  sustainable  way  even  though  that  these  reforms  are  not  always materialized according to expectations. Among other factors these happens mostly due to the  disparate  coalition  partners  interests.  Efforts  have  also  been  done  regarding  the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s external relations namely with nations like the United States and China trying to support the diversification of the economy sectors with bilateral treaties that favor both sides with the ultimate goal of imposing their strength as an emergent economy. India  also  maintains  good  relationships  with  developing  countries  mainly  in  the Asian and African country leading to a versatile globalization of its economy. One of the interviewed individuals working for the board of a retail distribution multinational Miguel Seixas inclusively said that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit is pretty common to negotiate with African or MiddleEast companies  where  most  or  the  totality  of  the  board  members  are  Indians\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  since  besides Master in International Business  50 \\x0cIndia  having  extremely  qualified  people  for  the  jobs  there  are  strong  commercial  and historical bonds with some of the countries in the referred areas. Moreover  since  2014  Narendra  Modi  is  the  Indian  Prime  Minister  as  well  as chairman of Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP). As the highest figure in the Indian parliament he has pledged to accelerate the process of decision making within the government sphere by  removing  bureaucratic  hurdles  that  slow  the  country  willingness  to  develop.  This  was achieved  by  taking  bolder  measures  in  favor  of  a  renewed  broadspectrum  system concerning the linked administration of central government and the individual states. Nonetheless  not  all the steps given towards a better and more sustained country development  are  looking  through  pink  glasses.  Most  of  the  positive  outcomes  obtained through  the  work  of  Indian  institutions  is  often  conditioned  by  the  overstrained  judicial system  which  establishing  a  relation  to  its  population  has  only  15.5  judges  for  every million people across the nation (Bloomberg Business 2016).  Additionally the degree of corruption in the country is still a major motive for concern occupying the 76th position in the Corruption Perception Index (Corruption Perception Index 2016).  Is  also  important  to  highlight  that  concerning  the  Indian  political  environment there are a large number of interest groups in India however only a small part of the total population is integrated or participates actively in activities related with political or social associations. Most of the syndicates or unions are only partially autonomous since in most cases they are associated with political parties\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interests or influences consequently their capacity or willingness to act is much related with the electoral process. Therefore cases as the  labor  unions  are  very  much  reliant  on  whether  the  party  in  favor  of  the  workers interests  is  in  power  rather  than  acting  accordingly  to  the  worker  class  needs independently of whom party is in governance. Nonetheless  various  social  movements  have  emerged  and  become  more recurrent  along  with  the  increasing  number  of  NGOs  which  normally  are  promoted  by intellectuals and middle class not conformed citizens who normally fight for the rights of relegated social groups.  Economic Environment  On the economic field India has been shown some interesting numbers in terms of economic  growth  and  has  been  assisting  to  the  higher  speed  pace  of  economic Master in International Business  51 \\x0cdevelopment since the establishment of the marketbased system in the year of 1991 with major influence of the WTO (World Trade Organization) in the expansion of its trade. In the  recent  years  India  has  emerged  as  one  of  the  fastest  growing  economies  which  not only handled impressively well with the global downturn of 2008 but is also expected that the  country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  economy  continues  to  grow  consistently  over  the  next  few  decades. Moreover the country had even surpassed the growth percentage of China in the previous year  with  more  than  7%  in  the  year  of  2015  becoming  the  world  fastestgrowing  large economy  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndia  soars  high\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  2016).  Moreover  the  International  Monetary  Fund  (IMF) predicts that the country will retain this status at least until the year of 2020. Regarding recent disruptive policies reforms which contributed in a large scale to India  recent  boost  in  economic  growth  there  were  various  areas  with  great  incidence  on reductions  such  as  the  industrial  licensing  formation  of  Foreign  Investment  Promotion Board  (FIBP)  and  liberalization  of  foreign  capital.  These  have  been  considered  essential changes  in  order  to  instigate  a  steady  improvement  of  the  Indian  economic  environment. The  country  had  register  a  GDP  of  $  1.86  billion  in  the  year  of  2013  and  presented  a continuous improvement in the year of 2014 registering a growth rate of 73% comparing with  the  69%  on  the  former  year  (World  Bank  2014).  Additionally  is  relevant  to  point out  that  this  economic  growth  as  the  macroeconomic  event  supporting  significant improvements regarding topics such as the steady neutral score in the balance of trade as well  as  the  unceasing  decrease  of  the  inflation  rate  over  the  years  (Bertelsmann  Stiftung 2016). Regarding India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economic activities the most meaningful areas are still related with the financial sector with companies as SBI Capital Markets Ltd (SBICAP) or ICICI bank as well as the oil and the natural  gas sector with  major players  as  Oil  and Natural Gas  Corporation  Limited  India  (ONGCINDIA)  and  the  Tata  group  which  own  various major  companies  with  business  across  various  different  sectors.    Competition  in  some sectors  is  still  blocked  due  to  the  monopoly  of  a  few  big  companies  likewise protectionism  in  some  areas  still  remains  an  issue  with  lack  of  action  concerning  the established priorities of the new government in spite of the openness of some previously closed sectors to foreign investors. The  recent  elected  government  of  Narendra  Modi  has  also  been  focusing  on  the attraction  and  promotion  of  foreign  direct  investment  (FDI)  such  as  the  openness  of Master in International Business  52 \\x0cadditional sectors that were priory closed or reluctant to this type of investment as well as the cuts promoted on subsidies concerning the fuel activities. Nevertheless most of Indian firms ownership structure is yet linked to domestic private firms (\\xe2\\x89\\x88 90 % of all businesses) which indicates that even though the most recent  conjectural  policies have been focusing on the openness of the market for foreign investors in practical terms there is still a long way to go in what concerns mainly the conditions provided by the government for this type of  investors  regarding  not  just  elemental  factors  as  the  electricity  provision  the  water provision  and  the  infrastructure  services  implicit  delays  but  also  the  significant  rate  of corruption  which  represent  a  major  administrative  and  financial  burden  concerning  the decision  making  process  of  foreign  firms  regarding  the  possibility  of  investment  in  the Indian market (World Bank 2014). Corruption undermines the operational efficiency and leads to an unfavorable environment to the investors as they increase the costs of entering the  market  as  well  as  the  risks  associated  with  the  business  activity.  It  was  inclusively reported by all the interviewed individuals that the rate of corruption in India is intimately connected with inefficient regulations as these present an opportunity to  claim for bribes where companies and even individuals are forced to make \\xe2\\x80\\x9cunofficial\\xe2\\x80\\x9d payments to public officials in a way of having their requests addressed by the competent organisms. Concerning  the  imports  topic  there  are  also  massive  barriers  to  trade  which contradict the principle of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfull trade liberalization\\xe2\\x80\\x9d not just in terms of tariffs and customs policies but fundamentally in taxes and financial regulations which is considered a top 3 concern  for  investors  regarding  the  business  environment  obstacles  of  the  country particularly its permit system and its licensing (Ulrich et. al 2014). Following this line of thought the Prime Minister Modi aims to present India as an attractive manufacturing site and the government has made a promise in order to reduce the bare bones for entrepreneurs on their latest campaign \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmake in India\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. However as the product planned to be launched in the market is defined as software as a service and works integrally via web fortunately these are aspects that the author does not need to consider regarding the SCRAIM case at least in the shortterm. As far  as services are  concerned  India presents  itself as a major BPO  (Business Process  Outsourcing)  location  with  extremely  low  labor  costs  when  considering  the  ratio quality/price.  This  conditions  logically  enhance  India  sharpness  and  potentiated  the country grow in a globalwide sphere in the sector and allows it to have a surplus which Master in International Business  53 \\x0cwas valued as $6.2 billion in the year of 2014. Nevertheless the government highlights the priority as being the export promotion by among other initiatives promoting the constant development of the manufacturing activities through the creation of new Special Economic Zones  (SEZs)  where  unlike  its  other  international  counterparts  they  provide  equal scenarios  to  both  Indian  and  international  players  and  allowed  100%  of  FDI  for  all endowments  apart  from  the  referred  areas  that  do  not  list  on  the  constructive  record (Ministry of Commerce and Industry of India 2014). On  the  other  hand  there  are  some  statistic  findings  that  continue  to  prove  that India may be closer from a third world country rather than an emergent power such as the relevance of the informal sector in the Indian economy. According to the National Sample Survey  Organization  during  the  period  2011/2012  75%  of  the  active  population  was working  in  the  rural  areas  as  well  as  69%  of  active  population  working  in  urban  areas were employed by activities linked with the informal sector.  India also remains part of the world poorest countries regarding the distribution of wealth  and  welfare.  India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  GINI  Index  is  the  reflection  of  the  stated  inequality  having rose from 33.4 in the year of 2005 to 33.9 just four years after in 2009 being measured in terms  of  consumption  (Bertelsmann  Stiftung  2016).  Additionally  as  analyzed  by  Credit Suisse in the Global Wealth Databook 2014 the wealth share of the top  decile of India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s society rose from 65.9% in 2000 to 74% in the year of 2014 being followed by an increase the wealth share of the top percentile from 36.9% to 49% in the referred period. Moreover the  country  register  32.7%  population  share  bellow  the  income  poverty  line  (United Nations Development Programme 2014) and presents itself as the country with the largest absolute  number  of  poor  people  worldwide  counting  with  2$  perday  poverty  as  a reference. Miguel  Seixas board member of a Portuguese  retail  distribution multinational inclusively said that when in the surroundings of the Indian Capital of Nova Delhi seeing children searching for food and toys in  trash cans is  a common picture.  However and in spite  of  this  worrying  notion  when  approaching  the  Indian  reality  on  the  macro perspectives  the  country  has  surprisingly  been  doing  remarkable  steps  as  an  emergent economy  having  integrated  the  BRICS  block  and  presenting  very  pleasant  numbers concerning economic growth has a trace for stabilization and trigger for globalization.     Master in International Business  54 \\x0cSocial Environment  The  social  environment  in  India  is  probably  the  one  field  of  the  respective analysis  which  has  the  worst  picture  on  the  overall  outcome  since  there  are  still  many reforms  to  be  taken  in  order  to  confer  the  Indian  a  reasonable  standard  of  living.  As  the author already referred poverty is a major concern in the country and has also increasingly affected  a  various  range  of  states  that  were  not  boosted  by  the  macroeconomics improvements  that  country  has  been  registering  and  which  had  been  consequently compromised by decades of bad governance. Among them the most critical are the Uttar Pradesh state the Bihar and Madhya Pradesh with respectively 589.19 358.15 and 234.06 thousand of people living below the poverty line (Census Population extrapolated 2011). Furthermore India has an HDI score of 0.586 in the year of 2013 ranking as 135 among 187  countries  and  territories  and  additionally  registers  high  levels  of  discrimination  and inequality.  However  HDI  score  has  recording  a  steadily  increase  over  the  past  decade (United Nations Development Programme 2014).  Inequalities  are  also  visible  across  regions  social  groups  as  well  as  when comparing unskilled and skilled labor force. Social exclusion is also a noticeable topic that affects the traditionally relegated lower castes of the Indian society (the socalled \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDalits\\xe2\\x80\\x9d) with approximately 180 million to 200 million people in the referred situation as well as the  ethnic  minorities  and  Muslims  (Ninian  2008).  This  affects  the  everyday  work environment  as  reported  by  Valdemar  Costa  a  collaborator  of  a  Portuguese  textile  firm who  confirms  that  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnormally  the  individuals  integrating  the  lower  castes  of  the  Indian society only have the possibility of applying to the so called bluecollar jobs and that once working in  the  company these individuals have  to  request  for permission  in  order to  ask something  to  any  collaborator  who  is  at  least  a  level  up  in  the  hierarchy  of  the  company comparing to  him\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The discrimination  does not  end here whereas an enlightening study made  by  the  OECD  (Organization  for  Economic  Cooperation  and  Development)  assures that  90%  of  the  employees  in  India  are  out  of  the  social  security  system  which  may originate a chaotic situation under a hypothetic crisis phenomenon since many people may get out of their job without any unemployment guarantee or benefit. Other  reason  for  concern  is  the  gender  inequality  issue  where  despite  the improvements India counts with a Gender Inequality Index of 0.563 rating extremely low in  an  international  sphere  standing  in  the  130th  position  (United  Nations  Development Master in International Business  55 \\x0cProgramme 2014) as well as in what concerns women\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rights and gender equality which officially  are  recognized  but  in  fact  woman  still  largely  discriminated  and  mistreated within  the  majority  of  states  in  the  Indian  society.  Efforts  have  been  made  at  an international scale to change the situation considering that this subject has created such an awareness that is often brought to debate in international events concerning human rights. Discrimination  is  widely  noticeable  from  the  abortion  to  the  household  discrimination  in the  access  to  food  or  sanitation  and  this  is  mostly  associated  with  the  cultural  implicit actions of the malecontrolled family structures especially in region of Northern India but which happen also in main cities as Gurgaon as told by Nat\\xc3\\xa9rcia Santos a collaborator of a  consulting  company  operating  in  the  market.  Nat\\xc3\\xa9rcia  said  that  the  situation  is  clearly shocking  as  she  revealed  that  for  example  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen  a  foreign  woman  would  have  been victim of violation or harassment cases in the city surroundings the case would appear on the  news  and  reported  as  a  serious  crime  however  when  the  common  Indian  woman would report the same type of crimes to a police station she would have to may be subject of being frowned upon by the belonging society\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. Nevertheless improvements have been made in what concerns woman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s access to education  activists  and  a  much  more  committed  to  the  cause  government  have  been raising  awareness close to the parents  of the  youngest  generation in  the  Indian society to fight  against illiteracy in  such way that nowadays enrollment  rates on primary  education have  been  stage  for  a  significant  escalation  regarding  children  attendance  as  well  as having  additionally  obtained  a  remarkable  outcome  in  what  concerns  male  and  female ratio  which  has  finally  reached  equality  in  recent  times.  However  in  the  secondary  and tertiary education levels disparities are still noteworthy which registers a ratio femaletomale of 94 and 78.1 respectively (United Nations Development Programme 2014). As  already  mentioned  above  there  are  a  large  number  of  social  and  political interest  groups  within  the  Indian  reality  which  appears  to  be  natural  when  addressing  a society  with  around  one  billion  people  and  various  ethnic  groups  as  well  as  religions however  only  a  small  part  of  the  population  integrates  or  actively  participates  in  the activities  conducted  by  the  referred  associations.  These  movements  tend  to  occur  more often in areas where local tribes and communities are installed and mainly against mining projects  and  land  acquisitions  since  these  social  groups  have  long  traditions  in  opposing the  governance  and  fight  for  their  rights  since  the  times  of  the  colonial  era.  However Master in International Business  56 \\x0cfrequently  these  protests  and  the  organizations  in  charge  of  them  are  manipulated  with political  purposes  working  very  often  as  a  mean  of  communication  among  states  and national governments. Despite the heterogeneity that exists within the Indian society there are common aspects  that characterize the society  as a whole.  Accordingly it is  useful to  use Hofstede analysis  (Fig.  10)  and  related  further  studies  in  order  to  help  contextualize  the  cultural values  of  the  Indian  society.  This  will  allow  to  highpoint  India  as  a  hierarchical  society with  a  welldefined  structure  among  the  lowest  and  the  highest  levels  with  powerprivileged  individuals  in  decisionmaking  positions  having  little  or  no  receptivity  to  the individuals  positioned  bellow  them  as  already  confirmed  by  the  information  collected regarding  the  author  pursued  interviews.  Power  tends  to  be  centralized  and  employees commonly  expect  clear  directions  within  the  business  environment.  Moreover  as  the author  already  refer  and  as  the  graph  clearly  shows  India  is  an  undoubtedly  masculine society flashing ostentation that goes beyond the household practices even displaying on brand ads or in religious philosophies a noticeable man supremacy.  Furthermore  India  has  an  extreme  diverse  religious  and  cultural  society presenting  itself  as  mainly  Hinduist  fact  which  shows  to  be  very  much  related  with  the preference  for  a  longterm  orientation  and  having  a  high  tolerance  for  different  ideas  or point of views regarding social interactions as well as a pragmatic way of approaching the everyday life. Fig. 10 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 India social dimensions Source Geert Hofstede country rankings Master in International Business   57 \\x0cLastly a relevant curiosity already referred is that India has a wide list of spoken languages  among  the  various  groups  of  people  inhabiting  the  country  nevertheless  the Indian  Constitution  has  stipulated  Hindi  and  English  as  the  official  communication languages  for  the  national  government.  Moreover  there  are  18  languages  which  are officially  adopted  by  different  states  for  administrative  purposes  and  also  as  a  mean  of communication between the national and the state governments.  Technological Environment   Regarding  PEST  analysis  this  is  the  most  relevant  component  concerning  the SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case and is safe to say that India is presented as the geography which owns the most  suitable  and  interesting  conditions  to  our  service  as  the  country  has  one  of  the strongest IT sectors worldwide being constantly promoting the development of this area fundamentally through software upgrades as well as other technological improvements.  Assuming the need to follow up the global economy pace of development India is still giving steps towards a more open economy and the recent R&D and industrialization policies as well as the joint collaboration of government and states competent departments (such  as  the  Science  and  Technology  department  as  well  as  the  Industrial  Research department) with the industry having the aim of promoting publicprivate partnerships are clearly  signs  of  the  continuous  progress  the  country  has  been  doing  as  well  as  a demonstration of willingness to incentive the private initiative on the field.  The need for the referred global approach led the incentives to the private industry towards new findings in R&D by providing shared costs and rewards as well as coverage against the high implicit risk associated with the research related process. An evidence of such  enrollment  by  part  of  the  responsible  entities  of  the  government  is  the  recent  data from  the Ministry of Science and Technology which states that the gross expenditure on R&D  has  been  steadily  increasing  over  the  years.  In  the  year  of  20042005  the  gross expenditure in the field reached 24.117.24 Indian rupees (\\xe2\\x82\\xb9) and just 5 years later in 20092010  the  volume  suffered  an  increase  of  around  45%  reaching  the  53.041.30  Indian rupees (\\xe2\\x82\\xb9). The  government  has  been  pursuing  extremely  useful  measures  in  order  to  make the country an example of the best  embryonic conditions regarding the  IT advancements namely in high education. The country is inclusively considered the third largest center in Master in International Business  58 \\x0cthe  world  on  this  category  only  surpassed  by  China  and  United  States.  Additionally  the science  and  technology  sectors  have  been  target  for  significant  research  and  constant development  of  innovative  methods  being  nowadays  capable  of  providing  3G  and  4G technology  to  their  population  which  facilitates  the  progress  of  several  projects  in  the field. The country has focused so much in the area that the Global Innovation Index (GII) has  ranked  India  has  been  an  outperformer  in  its  peer  group  regarding  its  innovation capabilities. India  appears  in  the  global  picture  as  a  digitally  empowered  society  with innovative characteristics having already achieved the goal of having WiFi services to all cities  with  populations  greater than  one  million  broadband internet  access to approximately 250.000 village clusters and 400.000 internet access points predicted for the year of 2019 (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndia soars high\\xe2\\x80\\x9d 2016). Additionally the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSmart Cities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d program aims to enable  the  introduction  of  stateofart  ICT  solutions  in  order  to  leverage  the  living conditions and the governance as well as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDigital India\\xe2\\x80\\x9d program which was designed in  order  to  improve  conditions  in  a  much  broader  way  across  infrastructures  processes skill  sets  delivery  platforms  and  manufacturing.  Through  the  achievement  of  these developments  India  has  the  ultimate  goal  of  providing  all  the  necessary  conditions  to create a selfreliant knowledge economy. However besides the planned future achievements and related programs there are still some arrangements that urgently need to be taken care of. The carried out interviews and the data analyzed suggest that topics such  as the  electricity  connection issues which are fundamental for conducting any business or most basic process operations still needs to be unavoidably addressed. In the Indian case according to the Doing Business analysis getting electricity in India currently requires in average 5.00 procedures takes 90.10 days and  costs  44330%  of  income  per  capita.  The  country  is  currently  ranked  as  70th  in  the ranking  of  189  economies  regarding  the  ease  of  obtaining  electricity  however  the  main cities as the case of Mumbai Delhi and Bangalore made getting electricity less costly by reducing the security deposit for a new connection and also conceived a simpler and faster process  by  eliminating  the  internal  wiring  inspections  and  by  improving  internal  work processes and coordination.  Master in International Business  59 \\x0c 6.2 Legal aspects \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Protecting Intellectual Property India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s legal system follows the common law principles as it belongs to the group of  countries  which  were  under  the  British  regulation  or  were  part  of  the  British Commonwealth  network.  As  such  the  jurisprudence  followed  in  India  is  practically  the same as the one prevailing in the United Kingdom however with adaptations to the typical Indian values and beliefs. The constitution of India has set up three branches of state 1. The executive; The judiciary; 3. The legislature. However  and  since  SCRAIM  is  entering  the  country  as  a  foreign  entity  it  is needed  to  address  relevant  associations/entities  in  the  field  who  can  protect  our  interests and promote opportunities to explore within the country. According to 2 of the interviewed individuals  it  was  stated  that  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cit  is  advisable  to  contact  associations  which  promote international  business  in  a  primary  phase\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  over  the  individual  and  proactive  contact. Among  the  various  option  most  being  considered  inefficient  and  having  lack  of  means when  compared  to  the  demand  for  their  services  (Bloomberg  news  2016)  there  are structures  typically  used  by  foreign  investors  in  India  in  order  to  facilitate  business promotion and explore opportunities which are called Liaison Offices. These offices act as a  communication  channel  between  the  head  office  of  foreign  corporations  and  business parties in India (Sanghavi D. 2015).  The same is applied to the Branch Offices which are settled as an extension of a foreign company in India and additionally to the Liaison Offices have the jurisdiction for inclusively  export  and  import  goods  as  well  as  rendering  professional  consultancy services among other legal advantages (Sanghavi D. 2015). However  these  kind  of offices  are  costly  and  their  expenses  are  met  entirely  by inward remittances of foreign exchange from the head office outside India. Therefore and as these offices can represent a group of companies with the help of previous contacts and partnerships established by SCRAIM which reinforced the previous entry on United States could in fact be extremely useful in the case of having or being connected with a liaison office. Nevertheless  since  SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  business  is  a  technologyrelated  one  and  it  is extremely  important  to  protect  the  business  and  its  competitive  advantage  from  copycats and  hackers  there  are  institutions  which  can  legally  ensure  that  SCRAIM  has  their Master in International Business  60 \\x0cintellectual property or its trademarks certified as their owns at a national or at a state level. So  following  this  logic  appropriate  offices  that  would  guarantee  a  safer  environment among India copycats sphere were identified (Table 1 and Table 2).  Table 1.

India \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Development of hypothesis for international expansion  As  already  referred  India  is  the  second  most  populated  country  worldwide having  53  major  cities  and  urban  agglomerations  with  more  than  a  million  people    the most populated  being Mumbai (Bombay) with  12.4 million  people New Delhi with  11.1 million Bangalore with 8.4 million Hyderabad (Andhra Pradesh) with 6.7 million Gujarat with 5.5 million Chennai (Tamil Nadu) with 4.6 million and Pune (Maharashtra) with 3.1 million people (Census India 2011).  Likewise  in  order  to  coherently  address  this  major  market  there  is  the  need  to understand what the company main strategy is and where SCRAIM has more conditions to grow  according  to  it.  After  having  made  a  macro  analysis  of  the  country  a  carefully examination of the major cities was conducted in order to show where the demand for this kind  of  software  is  higher  and  where  it  is  possible  to  gain  from  symbioses  to  the  further development  of the platform which  of them  has the greater need for the type of services SCRAIM  provides  and  which  of  the  cities  has  the  biggest  focus  on  industry  as  well  as projections made for them in the long run. The market current growth rate and the significant potential in the cloud services area leave no margin for error and place the country in the 8th position in the ITA\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Cloud Computing Top (2015). Nowadays over 250 million Indians use webconnected services which  besides  seeming  an  appealing  number  leaves  more  than  4/5  of  the  population  not Master in International Business  63 \\x0caware of the benefits  of  this new emerging era. Generally people who already embraced the cloud era rely their services on cloud applications and other functionalities such as ecommerce internet access mobile devices and other applications usage fact which leaves room  for  expansion  when  referring  to  the  openness  for  business  activities  adoption. Nevertheless  and  as  stated  in  the  previous  chapters  according  to  a  Gartner  Research (2014) the cloudrelated spending in India should overcome the rest of the world reaching nearly  2  billion  euros  in  2018.  Moreover  the  most  significant  driver  for  these  optimistic predictions  comes  from  the  generalized  interest  among  business  customers  across  a widespread  number  of  industries  in  the  most  various  kinds  of  cloudrelated  services.  A related survey showed 96 percent of existing business use or are planning to use until the end  of  the  year  cloud  related  services  what  show  that  even  though  other  analyzes  don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t uplift such appealing data the  Indian market  has been building  greater awareness  for the need  of  integration  and  interaction  of  their  businesses  with  cloudrelated  tools  (ITA markets report 2015). The scenario of R&D foreign and national investment is not any different. During the 90\\xe2\\x80\\x99s the main cities were clearly ahead of the race comparing to investment made in the rest of the country. Cities as Pune Hyderabad Bangalore and Chennai in the southern part of India constituted almost 100% of the R&D talent pool within the country and even though  the  other  areas  in  the  north  and  center  have  now  speed  up  with  the  help  of equalitarian  and  promotional  policies  from  recent  governments  the  southern  referred cities still constitute 65% of multinationals R&D talent pool and undoubtedly are the way to follow regarding SCRAIM case (Llc 2012).    Among this attractive ecosystem Bangalore stands out by owning an excellent IT infrastructure and appearing with a domination position over all other contenders in what concerns  the  multinationals  spending  in  software  product  development  and  embedded R&D as well as regarding the product companies starting in India in the last two decades with 55% based in the mediations of Bangalore and NCR regions (Zinnov analysis 2012). Besides this eyecatching target was suggested by 3 of the total 4 interviewed individuals as  being  the  matchless  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndian  technological  hub\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  The  region  is  well  known  as  the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSilicon Valley of India\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and is demarcated from all others not just in inflows of FDI but also regarding security life quality and lack of likelihood for having natural catastrophes. It  holds  35%  of  India\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  talent  pool  and  has  a  thriving  startup  ecosystem  with  over  than Master in International Business  64 \\x0c60% of the product  startups in  all India as well as a privileged contact  with  noteworthy academia  institutes  within  the  region.  Additionally  as  being  a  Special  Economic  Zone (SEZ) integrating the government program concerning the efforts being made for a faster development of the main industrial cities of India its infrastructure system it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also rapidly catching up the technologic boom being targeted for new power generation and metro rail projects in order to boost de the infrastructure overall improvements of the region (Zinnov analysis 2012).  Bangalore  has  some  worldwide  known  multinationals  operating  within  its surroundings such as Yahoo Mcafee HP Microsoft IBM Oracle and Netapp and it has been  witnessing  a  steady  software  export  grow  every  year  nevertheless  it  leads  to  high operations costs and high attrition due to the fame and profit of hosting major worldwide players.  Besides  the  region  of  Bangalore  is  also  known  by  its  multicultural  sphere  (also due  to  the  noticeable  presence  of  multinationals)  and  the  various  number  of  languages spoken what makes it even a more propitious place for having English as the number one mean of communication. Therefore  through  the  opportunity  for  demand  making  the  platform  grow benefiting from the richness of interactions with this particular entrepreneurial and highly quoted  ecosystem  and  having  privileged  contact  with  academic  institutions  the suggestions are P1 Internationalize SCRAIM to India having the Bangalore IT hub region as the initial focus. Accomplishing very compelling results in the last 2 decades is also the region of Pune  also  located  in  the  southern  part  of  the  country  and  known  as  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cOxford  of  the East\\xe2\\x80\\x9d due to its oldest and accredited education institutes. Furthermore it hosts prominent research institutes and privileged links to the corporate world fact which made one of its business  districts  known  as  the  SBD  East  appear  in  the  Indian  scenario  as  the  3rd  most profitable  business  district  national  wide  (Report  2013).  According  to  one  of  the interviewed  contributors  to  this  work  Jo\\xc3\\xa3o  Rodrigues  who  is  living  in  India  now  for  17 years and works for the Indian branch of the External Commerce and Investment Agency of  Portugal  (AIECEP)  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPune  has  over  400  German  companies  operating  mainly  in  the manufacturing  sector  and  owns  the  2nd  biggest  center  of  R&D  worldwide  which contribute as a major attraction for international companies and originates a spillover effect Master in International Business  65 \\x0cto all the Indian companies who already supply or intend to supply this same international corporations\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  Jo\\xc3\\xa3o  Rodrigues  strongly  advised  the  installation  of  SCRAIM  business within the sphere of the region in order to have the most of this resourceful and opportune ecosystem.  Furthermore the region brags for having as one of its key drivers for success the  proximity  with  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinancial  capital  of  India\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  Mumbai  which  leveraged  Pune  to appear  as  an  IT  services  center  and  a  support  arm  for  some  of  the  major  global  banks located  in  the  country  as  well  as  by  providing  evidence  of  a  very  strong  business ecosystem  mainly  due  to  its  manufacturing  capabilities  (\\xe2\\x80\\x9cIndustrial  Corridors  And  its Impact Cities\\xe2\\x80\\x9d n.d.). Similarly  to  Bangalore  Pune  presents  a  privileged  base  for  fresh  talent  pool which among other facts such as having a thriving physical infrastructure and hosting 18 new  special  economic  zones  in  the  last  government  program  has  driving  numerous multinationals to invest in the region. Example of such are global companies as IBM the Indian leaders TATA Consultancy Services Larsen & Toubro Ltd. and Infosys Wipro and the  American  major  player  Cognizant  as  well  as  the  German  Siemens  who  owns  its biggest research center worldwide in the region of Pune (Llc 2012). It  is  also  with  no  surprise  that  Pune  appears  as  one  of  the  leading  exporters  in software  nationwide.  The  fast  growth  rhythm  of  the  IT  and  IT  enabled  services  in  the region  (which  account  with  75%  of  the  industry  in  the  region)  lead  to  a  consequent revolution in the auto  & auto ancillary industries which absorbed most of the knowhow created among this attractive ecosystem and boosted the overall development of the region (  Zinnov  Management  Consulting  report  September  2013).  Sectors  like  the  baking  and financial  services  and  insurances  have  a  significant  presence  in  terms  of  market  volume within  the  region  even  though  they  are  essentially  located  on  the  main  center  of  Pune among the CBD and the OffCBD business districts given that the peripheries do not have the same connectivity capabilities with the various parts of the city center locations which in turn hold some of the greatest manufacturing sites in the region (Report 2013). Pune  is  also  known  for  its  wide  diversity  in  cultural  terms  good  climate conditions and along with most of the main regions of India the various languages spoken within its sphere. Additionally the region now owns a brand new airport on its East side fact  that  mitigates  one  of  the  less  solid  points  of  the  area  which  was  international Master in International Business  66 \\x0cconnectivity. Summing  up  due  to  the  overall  great  demand  for  SCRAIM  business  whether concerning  the  manufacturing  sector  or  the  financial  area  of  the  region  as  well  as  its important  link  with  Mumbai  the  opportunities  to  explore  in  the  region  are  vast  and  by saying so our suggestion is P2  Internationalize  SCRAIM  to  the  region  of  Pune  India  benefiting  from the  good  academia  and  corporate  links  while  being  close  to  the  financial  capital  of Mumbai. Chennai  also  witnessed  a  major  progress  over  the  past  decade  and  it  is  also  a location  to  have  in  consideration  is  now  famous  for  being  an  industrial  reference  hub dubbed as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cDetroit of South India\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The region has been the scene for an emergence of numerous manufacturing industries such as the auto & auto ancillary electronic hardware engineering  and  even  the  apparel  industry  being  the  reflection  of  the  corporative  market dynamics the region has been offering. Once  again  and  similarly  to  some  of  the  major  cities  of  India  which  has  been stage  for  a  major  social  economic  and  political  development  the  IT  and  the  IT  enabled services  have  been  behind  the  sustained  grow  of  these  industries  occupying  56%  of  the total  occupied  office  space  in  the  region  and  backing  up  practically  all  the  industries operating  in  the  area.  The  majority  of  those  within  the  sphere  of  the  DLF  IT  Special Economic  Zone  due  to  the  increasing  importance  of  the  Olimpya  Technology  park  and Tamarai  Tech  Park.  Moreover  predictions  say that the  enhanced  connectivity proportionated  due  to  the  development  of  the  new  metro  corridor  will  continue  to contribute  to  increase  the  importance  of  the  SBD  business  district  and  therefore  the importance  of  the  embedded  DLF  IT  Special  Economic  Zone  (  Zinnov  Management Consulting report September 2013).  Nevertheless  the  manufacturing  sector  also  possess  a  significant  26%  share among  the  overall  areas  of  Pune  concerning  the  total  occupied  space  in  the  region immediately  followed  by  the  banking  financial  services  and  insurance  owning respectively 10% ( Zinnov Management Consulting report September 2013.). The  infrastructure  availability  of  the  region  is  also  following  the  ambitious Master in International Business  67 \\x0cprograms of development promoted by the government matching the good availability of other  main  cities  in  the  country  having  an  especially  reliable  power  supply  of  office space additionally owning an airport and having good links nationally and internationally. Moreover the region of Chennai owns a clear advantage having real estate costs estimated in  1012%  lower  than  the  center  of  the  closest  IT  hub  Bangalore.  Nevertheless  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  a generally perceived poor region and besides having a various number of language spoken it is characterized by having a low cultural diversity (Llc 2012). Having  in  consideration  the  opportunity  presented  by  the  industrial  boom  the region  has  witnessed  the  growing  importance  of  the  IT  sector  concerning  the  region market volume as well as the overall occupied office space and the benefits that can mean to the SCRAIM platform maturation within the Indian market our suggestion is  P3 Internationalize to Chennai India benefiting from its recent industrial boom.  The  National  Capital  Region  (NCR)  where  it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  based  the  Indian  capital  New Delhi  is  undoubtedly  a  region  with  mandatory  entrance  to  the  hypothetical  framework since  it  is  the  region  which  holds  the  biggest  number  of  population  and  therefore  the biggest market national wide and moreover it\\xe2\\x80\\x99s also a cradle for equally important cities in the country such as Gurgaon Noida and Gester Noida. Likewise the region is also the prime  offices  destination  in  the  country  as  well  as  the  political  hub  of  India  and  the responsible location for being the harbor of most political parties as well as administrative offices. Obviously as a consequence of the influence exercised and the great lobby power felt  in  the  country  sphere  NCR  and  more  precisely  the  city  of  Delhi  also  attract  major corporations who have the highest interest that their intentions and purposes will be heard and  will  influence  decision  makers.  Topics  as  availability  and  land  cession  favorable government  policies and conducive business  sphere led the increasing demand for office spaces  for  both  national  and  international  companies  within  the  region  (Zinnov Management Consulting report September 2013).  Once again and similarly to the previously mentioned main cities in India the IT and the IT enabled services owns the majority share of the office space absorption within the region with 42% of the total occupied space but the region is also known by its quality commercial  properties  in  the  Gurgoan  area  city  which  also  hosts  more  nonIT  related activities in the main center zone typically operating in the sector.  Master in International Business  68 \\x0cThe region is also home for 52 Special Economic Zones (SEZs) and counts with the presence of more than 100 engineering colleges and research institutes and therefore with an interesting availability outcome of fresh talent pool. Furthermore the region has an excellent  IT  and  transportation  infrastructure  as  well  as  excellent  international  and national  connectivity  facts  which  led  us  considering  the  NCR  region  as  an  option. Therefore we suggest P4  Internationalize  to  the  NCR  region  of  India  benefiting  from  the  lobby influence and the valuable political and corporative network. Lastly  Hyderabad  was  found  as  an  equally  interesting  additional  option.  The region is known as the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cCyberabad of India\\xe2\\x80\\x9d due to the fact of being the first original  IT hub  location  developed  in  India  and  once  owning  the  title  of  cyber  capital  of  India however in recent time has been overcome by Bangalore which has been the main actor for a noteworthy shift by topnotch software multinationals within the Indian market. The city is  the  administrative  financial  and  economic  capital  of  Andhra  Pradesh  and  the  largest contributor  to  the  state\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  Gross  National  Product  (GDP).  This  city  was  also  positively affected by the IT boom that spilled over almost to all the main areas of the country in the last  decade  with  companies  like  Facebook  IBM  Google  Accenture  General  Electrics Amazon  Dell  and  Oracle  among  others  setting  up  in  some  cases  some  of  the  biggest offices they have besides the ones on their country of origin (Indian Times 2016). The  IT  and  the  ITenabled  services  area  has  an  overwhelming  presence  when compared  to  all  other  industries  in  the  Hyderabad  market  occupying  75%  of  the  total office space leaving fundamental sectors in the Indian economy such as the banking and financial  services  sector  with  a  minor  6%  portion  of  occupied  office  space.  Even  though the city was one of the most affected nationwide in the 2008 crisis era a strong recovery  took  place  concerning  the  demand  for  office  spaces  within  the  area  enhanced  its underlying strength as a city to invest in among the Indian market (Report 2013). This  city  was  also  strongly  advised  by  Jo\\xc3\\xa3o  Rodrigues  representative  in  the Indian branch of the External Commerce and Investment Agency of Portugal (AIECEP) as a viable option saying that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cIt  presents  an extremely interesting option  within the  Indian market  since  all  the  main  players  have  been  fleeing  to  the  recent  and  trendiest  IT  hub region  of  Bangalore.  The  city  of  Hyderabad  can  represent  a  valuable  opportunity  to Master in International Business  69 \\x0cSCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business due to a steady demand of its services as well as a calculated capable rate  of  response  by  SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  small  team  who  aims  to  quickly  respond  to  the  market needs and provide an effective customer support\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The region is inclusively the largest supplier of engineering students nationwide fundamentally  due  to  the  educational  institutions  installed  within  the  city  of  Andhra Pradesh. Region which owns one of the strategically positioned IT corridors coupled with a substantial development pipeline that ensures the city remains an ideal location for setting up ITrelated businesses (Report 2013). Additionally the city of Hyderabad is noticed by its associated ease of doing business as well as for its good physical infrastructure. In  short  due  to  its  IT  capabilities  and  market  opportunities  the  extremely  good academia links and the eventual interaction with major global players operating in the area the final suggestion is P5  Internationalize  to  India  having  the  primary  focus  on  the  IT  market opportunities of Hyderabad.  7.1 Propositions assessment  The  dices  are  thrown  and  in  fact  it  is  possible  to  understand  regarding  the number of propositions achieved that the decision process was not simple or taken lightly as besides the attractive vast Indian market and the overwhelming mass opportunity that its demography presents these cities stand out by highlighting several different related strong topics which are not always moved towards the same benefits but distinguish the regions from one another. The  robustness  of  the  IT  markets  is  one  of  the  main  topics  to  have  in consideration when deciding what is the best suitable regions to initialize our action plan and  regarding  this  weighting  factor  our  focus  points  out  the  sites  of  Bangalore  (P1)  and Hyderabad (P5) however there are other relevant factors as well as possible externalities that need to be taken into account.  A competitive and diverse market  ecosystem is also  a fundamental criteria when weighting the market demand and the room for growing within the  market.  A  broader  market  demand  with  clients  from  sectors  different  from  the  ones SCRAIM  has  already  been  tested  combined  with  the  possibility  of  sowing  seeds  for  a broader and more favorable internationalization plan in the future close to the political and Master in International Business  70 \\x0cadministrative network supports the P4 of the National Capital Region and factors as the importance of the R&D cradle SCRAIM will be inserted in as well as the good academia links  support  P2  Pune  and  the  opportunity  of  expansion  among  a  clearly  booming manufacturing industry supports the P3 of Chennai. Nevertheless  there  some  critical  disadvantages  implicit  to  the  reality  of  some regions  and besides the  overall  score  seeming  positive  and  ambitious  for  all  the  referred cities there are different levels of compliance with the various required parameters in order to  increase  the  chances  to  be  well  succeed  in  the  Indian  market.  The  next  sequence  of charts  will  help  us  understand  what  are  the  relative  differences  regarding  the  accordance with selected crucial criteria.  Chart 1. Infrastructure parameters rating Chart 2. \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Support Ecosystem Chart 3. \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Business continuity risk Chart 4 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Overall environment Master in International Business     71 \\x0c Source Zinnov Analysis 2015 It is possible to notice some crucial differences among the regions that may affect directly the success of SCRAIM business within the country sphere. Starting from the support ecosystem perspective it is noteworthy that the regions of Pune and Bangalore are clearly some steps forward regarding the involving and nurturing entrepreneurial ecosystem with a wide base of startups operating in the area and striving for  the  focus  on  the  R&D  development  while  regions  like  Hyderabad  do  not  have enthusiastic  ratings  and  do  not  seem  to  be  the  desired  flourish  dynamic  that  SCRAIM pursues. Regarding  the  business  continuity  risk  rating  is  also  clearly  noticeable  that  the region  of  Chennai  represents  a  threat  for  an  aimed  long  run  journey  according  to  the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  intentions.  Moreover  when  I  analyzed  the  overall  environment  the  Chennai region have also some discouraging rating among the weighting factors. Therefore after a detailed analysis I could be able to select 2 of the 5 preselected propositions  and  fundament  the  choices  in  favor  of  cities  which  present  themselves  as greater  reliance  sites  to  initiate  SCRAIM  plans  and  against  regions  which  even  though having relatively  good conditions  to  be the initial focus for SCRAIM internationalization process did not match up with other offered conditions by the chosen propositions.  Concerning  the  P1  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternationalize  SCRAIM  to  India  having  the  Bangalore  IT hub region as the initial focus\\xe2\\x80\\x9d it is  consensual that \\xe2\\x80\\x9cwhen  you want  to  be the best  you need to be surrounded by the best\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and if this recent technologic hub is catching the eye of all the major players worldwide in the IT area and it transversally provides all the needed conditions  for  the  business  to  succeed  SCRAIM  should  not  waste  the  opportunity  of enlarging its probabilities for success in the Indian market. Moreover the data analyzed is consistent with this option and supports P1 as a viable one. Other  valuable  option  is  the  case  of  the  P2  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternationalize  SCRAIM  to  the Master in International Business  72 \\x0cregion  Pune  India  benefiting  from  the  good  academia  and  corporate  links  while  being close to the financial capital of Mumbai\\xe2\\x80\\x9d. The data analyzed supports the P2 regarding the good  IT  infrastructure  that  characterize  the  region  the  excellent  link  with  remarkable education  institutions  as  well  as  the  opportunities  among  the  manufacturing  growing sector in  the market  represent  a tremendous opportunity for SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s evolution  and an interesting  cash  flow  possibility  for  a  future  and  broader  investment  regarding  the internationalization plans for the country. P3 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternationalize to Chennai India benefiting from its recent industrial boom\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was found not to be compelling with the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s interests as the poor city perception and  the  lack  of  openness  to  different  cultures  or  mentalities  as  well  as  above  average political  risks  comparing  to  other  regions  in  the  country  may  be  major  roadblocks  when trying  to  implement  SCRAIM  strategy  in  the  short  term.  Moreover  the  relatively  weak startup  ecosystem  is  also  a  minus  adding  to  the  equation  and  not  supporting  the proposition. The  P4  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternationalize  to  the  NCR  region  of  India  benefiting  from  the  lobby influence  and  the  valuable  political  and  corporative  network\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  regarding  the  National Capital Region is not supported by the data found since even though the region holds the biggest  city  market  in  the  country  the  efforts  made  by  the  company  in  order  to  be successful in the region would be comparatively costlier and more time spending than the hypothesis  validated.  Moreover  the  fact  that  the  region  market  culture  is  not  completely focused  or  prioritized  towards  the  IT  sector  or  the  startup  environment  exhibiting  a software exportations growth rate extremely scarce or even null over the last few years is also  a  clear  disadvantage  as  SCRAIM  intends  to  be  leveraged  from  breathing  in  the surrounding know how and spillover effects. Finally  the  P5  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cInternationalize  to  India  having  the  primary  focus  on  the  IT market opportunities of Hyderabad\\xe2\\x80\\x9d is also not supported by the analyzed data as the city represent a comparatively higher business continuity risk and owns a relatively poor startup  ecosystem.  Additionally  the  city  has  witnessed  a  shift  from  the  settled  multinational players towards the new IT capital which supports the P1 and ends up labelling Hyderabad as an \\xe2\\x80\\x9coutdated trend\\xe2\\x80\\x9d even though major players still have their major offices located in the area. Master in International Business  73 \\x0cAs it has been referred throughout this report SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s international expansion is unavoidably  limited  by  the  company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  current  financial  situation.  Even  though  the company  current  financial  results  are  stable  and  all  the  profits  are  channeled  to  be  reinvested  in  the  company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  growth  it  is  fundamental  to  not  compromise  the  future  of  the company.  Moreover  and  after  discussing  the  suitable  scenarios  the  company  board understood  that  adding  to  the  shortage  of  human  capital  and  the  limited  knowledge regarding the target  market  the definition of the entry strategy should allow SCRAIM to minimize the involvement of resources of the previously referred kind.  With that being said and having had a previous fairly optimistic experience in the USA  market  with  the  same  kind  of  strategy  the  company  board  decided  that  SCRAIM would  enter  in  the  market  through  a  reseller  agreement  with  potential  incubators  and accelerators within the potential regions.  In order to better clarify where SCRAIM could have the best conditions to settle it was  pursued  a  detailed  market  research  in  the  areas  of  Bangalore  and  Pune.  The  image bellow gives us an enlightening image of the validated P1 and show us the scenario among Bangalore technological center.  Fig. 11 \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Bangalore Business Environment  Source Own elaboration   Master in International Business   74 \\x0c Among all the relevant data was decided to divide the points of interest through the following categories    Competitors \\xef\\x82\\xb7  JIRA Resellers (Once this platform is the leader in the project and process management worldwide); \\xef\\x82\\xb7  SaaS companies.   Partnership possibilities \\xef\\x82\\xb7 Incubators and accelerators \\xef\\x82\\xb7  SCRUM  users  group  (since  SCRUM  is  one  of  the  methodologies  used  in SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s platform and there are previous contacts with this organization) The  same  methodology  was  applied  to  the  city  of  Pune  (FIG  X.)  where  the number  of  interest  groups  was  clearly  smaller  due  to  the  different  market  reality. Fig. 12  Pune Business Environment  Source Own elaboration    This illustrative map will provide the company with the means necessary to have a  clear  look  into  the  city  geographies  and  eventual  strategic  positioning  as  well  as  the Master in International Business  75 \\x0cnotion of where to locate in order to benefit from the lack of services provision within the markets of each region. Although both options are viable given to the current status of the company  it  is  strongly  advisable  to  choose  one  region  over  the  other  even  though  that both options are viable the company can lack the means necessary in order to effectively approach both markets simultaneously. 8.  Conclusion Regarding the fast pace of the economy globalization and the associated openness for  international  business  interactions  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  are  more  and  more  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cgoing  global\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and expanding  their  activities  to  foreign  markets  that  can  present  better  and  more  ambitious opportunities  to  their  businesses.  The  reductions  of  barriers  to  trade  the  constant developments made on the field of technology communications and information reduction of  costs  regarding  the  achieved  economies  of  scale  and  scope  among  other  several reasons are nowadays responsible for the unceasing need of approaching the international markets as a priority strategic option implicitly needed fundamentally concerning SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s in order for them to accelerate and improve the molds of their businesses. Nonetheless  undeniable  barriers  to  these  processes  continue  to  exist.  Barriers such  as  the  lack  of  knowhow  concerning  the  target  markets  as  well  as  the  lack  of resources to effectively approach international opportunities are broadly related with most of the actors in international business scenario but end up to be magnified at a SME scale. Moreover  that  is  the  reason  why  it  is  fundamental  to  develop  an  extremely  detailed  and sharped prior analysis in a way the referred players will be able to minimize the eventual existent  risks  associated  with  these  processes  and  consequently  guide  them  through  an unequivocal and errorfree internationalization plan which will then allow to penetrate and quickly adapt to the specifications of the aimed market targets.  The  challenge  proposed  concerning  the  curricular  internship  at  SCRAIM  was exactly  to  conceive  an  effective  and  coherent  internationalization  plan  to  the  platform regarding the BRICS market geographies. The concrete objective of the internship was to understand among the BRICS market reality which would be the best suitable geography concerning  not  just  SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  ambitions  but  also  the  conditions  provided  by  the destination  market  in  order  to  successfully  develop  the  business  within  the  chosen environment.    The  fact  that  SCRAIM  is  an  innovative  software  as  a  service  (SaaS) Master in International Business  76 \\x0cplatform  embedded  with  extremely  modern  and  stateofart  methodologies  capable  of suiting  to  extremely  different  kinds  of  businesses  realities  made  this  project  particularly appealing  and  tempting.  Despite  all  the  challenges  faced  I  truly  believe  that  this internationalization  plan  will  provide  SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  management  team  with  the  means necessary  to  pursue  and  fulfil  their  objectives  in  the  short  medium  and  long  run concerning the target market selected.  As it was already referred this study was based on a curricular experience and as an  academic  report  it  includes  a  literature  review  addressing  the  importance  that internationalization  researchers\\xe2\\x80\\x99  analysis  can  have  regarding  the  applicability  to  practical terms.  Several  concepts  and  relevant  theories  on  internationalization  were  addressed which  ultimately  contributed  to  delineate  the  actual  situation  of  SCRAIM.  Nevertheless international  market  selection  models  were  also  resorted  as  a  mean  to  better  understand which  way  to  go  regarding  SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  internationalization  ambitions.  In  the  following phase  the  referred  insights  were  applied  to  the  SCRAIM  case  in  a  way  it  would  be possible  to  answer  to  the  proposed  research  questions  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cWhich  country  and  preferably which specific region/regions present the best conditions for SCRAIM internationalization purposes among the BRICS market?\\xe2\\x80\\x9d After having done a proper diagnosis not  just concerning the preselected target markets but also the strengths and weaknesses of the company the author proposed some focal  strategic  points  were  proposed  in  order  to  guarantee  the  future  of  the  company towards the project. Following this line of thought and after applying the selection models a  triage  process  was  conducted  concerning  the  five  initial  geographies  where  they  were able  to  identify  two  promising  countries  regarding  SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  ambitions  as  well  as  the receptiveness capabilities of the targeted markets India and China. Posteriorly the author pursued to a macro analysis of both countries as well as a micro analysis regarding the ICT sector where it was possible to indicate India as the final ideal destination due to the suitable market characteristics regarding not just the SCRAIM business but also the economic track the country has been follow. Moreover in an initial phase  it  was  possible  to  highlight  five  interesting  regions  to  set  up  SCRAIM  business being lately reduced to two remarkable options which excelled as having the best features to host SCRAIM internationalization project. Master in International Business  77 \\x0cHaving in consideration that the company is committed to pursue an international expansion  strategy  it  becomes  relevant  to  point  out  some  major  considerations  that  still may  affect  the  process  even  though  that  a  demanding  analysis  was  priory  made  namely concerning  the  legal  and  juridical  implications  concerning  the  Indian  market  since  the legal aspects associated to the process such as the contract establishment or the intellectual property  protection  are  those  who  can  threaten  the  most  SCRAIM\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  further  ambitions. SCRAIM  management  team  need  to  be  prepared  to  develop  and  conceive  a  specialized juridical  team  preferably  working  in  the  Indian  sphere  as  well  as  promoting  the establishment of various partnerships in a way the team will not be dependent on a limited network that can threat the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credibility or reputation in a later stage. Having  that  said  I  truly  believe  that  this  was  a  rewarding  experience  as  the knowledge concerning not just the proposed geographies but also the software as a service (SaaS)  business  were  found  as  extremely  valuable  tools  that  will  certainly  be advantageous both in my future professional and academic life.
