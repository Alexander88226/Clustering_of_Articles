In  some  financial  technology industries such as digital payments China is in the forefront of the world. In the area of financial products and services FinTech is reducing costs improving service quality and promoting market liquidity  and  efficiency.  Until  recently  FinTech has  been  focused  on  payments  peertopeer (P2P) lending and equity crowdfunding. However the evolution of FinTech in capital  markets  has  accelerated;  technological  advances  such  as  artificial  intelligence  (AI)  robotic  process  automation blockchain  and  cloud  technology  have appeared.Alibaba and Tencent); hot investment; explosive growth in ecommerce and digital payment  systems;  soaring  financial  services  demand;  and  regulatory  pressure. Unlike in the U.S. or Europe in China disruption by FinTech firms is not occurring at  the  periphery  of  the  financial  sector. It  has  gone  past  the  infection  point  with technological innovation reshaping the financial landscape.The rise of the BATChina   s FinTech sector is fueled by several factors such as the rise of the BAT (Baidu Baidu  Alibaba  and  Tencent  rank  as the  top  three  internetbased  companies  in Figure 1 China Fintech Investment Activity of Venture CapitalBacked CompaniesUSD Million3000Investment (LHS)Deals (RHS)372675250020001500100050002610205201251082011161982013619201420154035302520151050Source KPMG The Pulse of Fintech 2015 in Review (2016)FinTech in China   s Capital Market  |  9 China is online payments and Alibaba and Tencent  combined  could  control  50%  to 60% of the FinTech market.

They are all entering into FinTech to challenge the traditional financial services industry.  Taking  advantage  of  their  large customer bases and competitive advantages  they  provide  FinTech  solutions  across a  variety  of  subsectors.  Alibaba  started  as the largest ecommerce platform in China and  it  has  now  become  a  giant  in  digital payments  with  its  AliPay  app;  moreover through its financial arm Ant Financial it is  actively  tapping  into  the  opportunity  in China's fastgrowing FinTech market. Actually  founder  and  chairman  Jack  Ma  said Alibaba is not a retail company but a data company which makes the most of big data from its ecommerce transactions. In addition Tencent through its social media app WeChat  also  uses  a     red  envelope     function  to  train  customers     digital  payments habit and occupies a dominant position in FinTech. According to JPMorgan what will drive a large part of the FinTech market in 10  |  NOMURA JOURNAL OF ASIAN CAPITAL MARKETS  |  Autumn 2017 Vol.2/No.1From  above  China  has  been  quite active in FinTech solutions for the past few years. Meanwhile the investment boom in FinTech is on the way. According to KMPG VC backed investments in China boomed in 2015 (Figure 1) and in 2016. Furthermore Ernst and Young (EY) estimates that FinTech investment in China reached USD 8.4 billion among which 46% was raised by Ant Financial. The sources of funding include governmentguided funds private funds and IPOs. More  than  750  governmentguided  funds have been launched which stimulates the private funds to support startups. For latestage FinTechs Chinese FinTechs also benefit from an active IPO market completing more IPOs in the past 10 years than the leading U.S. and UK exchanges. All provinces in China also have provincial industrial funds allocated  to  encourage  technology  investment from which the FinTech sector naturally benefits.Explosive growth in ecommerce and digital paymentsDue to a large population and internet  consumption  habits  China  has  built the  world   s  largest  ecommerce  market (accounting for 47% of global digital sales) and digital economy. Over 25% of the population about 358 million Chinese customers used mobile payments in 2015. In 2016 internet  payments  totaled  about  RMB 1639 trillion (Figure 2) among which RMB 200 trillion were mobile payments nearly 50 times the amount of mobile payments in the U.S. Additionally Chinese SMEs have historically been underserved by the traditional banking system. This is one vital reason why P2P lending has prospered in the past  few  years  (Figure  3)  and  now  faces tightened supervision. Soaring demand for financial services creates a significant base of financial institutions to generate corporate demand for FinTech solutions.Regulatory pressureThe  People   s  Bank  of  China  (PBOC) plays  a  central  role  in  formulating  guidelines and has adopted an open and tolerant stance while designing the regulatory framework  for  internet  finance  which will leave certain space for the continued development  of  internet  finance  while drawing the bottom line clearly. However a large number of internet finance compa nies are turning into FinTech fields. There are at least two reasons for this phenomenon.  For  one  thing  FinTech  firms  focus on technology and circumvent regulations on internet finance; for another the regulators seek novel solutions like regulatory technology  (RegTech)  to  better  comply with  regulations  which  impose  pressure on traditional financial institutions to taken more seriously on FinTech.FinTech Development of Capital Market in ChinaAccording  to  KPMG's  China  Leading  FinTech  50  Report  for  2016  big  data  ranked top  in  the  business  models  of  the  top  50 companies in the sector while blockchain internet  securities  investment  management and crowdfunding ranked 9th 11th 12th  and  13th  respectively.  Since  data  is at the heart of recent developments in the financial  services  sector  companies  that seek to harness the power of big data enjoy a  significant  competitive  advantage  over their peers.BlockchainA new report from Goldman Sachs Investment Research projects that the implementation  of  blockchain  technology  could streamline  the  clearing  and  settlement  of cash securities saving capital markets USD 1112  billion  globally  on  an  annual  basis. The  adoption  of  blockchain  technology provides  operational  transparency  for  the asset which greatly enhances the efficiency  safety  and  traceability  of  the  product. Blockchain technology is not new to China     about 80% of bitcoin volume is now exchanged into and out of Chinese yuan     but when it comes to its app in the capital market  blockchain  startups  are  mainly  at  the experimental stage. In 2016 China   s Ministry of Industry and Information Technology published China Blockchain Technology and Application  Development  White  Paper  and organized  a  special  governmentindustry working group to speed up promoting R&D and deployment of blockchain applications. Several consortiums that focus on the application of blockchain in finance commerce public  service  and  other  industries  have been established in China. Some examples are China Ledger Alliance Financial Blockchain  Shenzhen  Consortium  Qianhai  International Blockchain Ecosphere Alliance which  focus  on  the  application  of  blockchain in finance commerce public service and other industries.Representative cases Baidu Finance announced  the  issuance  of  the  first  blockchainbased  assetbacked  security  (ABS) product in China in May 2017 backed by RMB  424  million  worth  of  personal  car leases;    Tencent  has  released  the  blockchain  consortium  platform  TrustSQL and  launched  the  Financial  Blockchain Cooperation  Alliance  (Shenzhen)  which carries out research on the application of blockchain in the financial services sector. Alibaba has adopted blockchain technology for its charity project with the Chinese Red  Cross  Foundation.  JD  Finance  tested the first blockchain consortium with China  Unionpay.  Taiyiyun  Technology  is  a blockchainbased enterprise that is listed on  the  National  Equities  Exchange  and Quotations (NEEQ). It has recently begun collaborating  with  a  number  of  public bodies  on  using  blockchain  technology in financial services and insurance. It is a member of Hyperledger an open source project  that  seeks  to  promote  the  development of blockchain globally. Antshares which  was  launched  by  Shanghai  Haike Internet  Financial  Information  and  Services (Onchain) in June 2014 is one of the first blockchain services in China that provides enterprises with customized blockchain  solutions  including  asset  register transitions  enterprise  internal  risk  control and voting and resolution.These  blockchain initiatives  are baby  steps  into  the  finance  services  sector and maybe will prosper in the future. However this trend is creating enormous challenges  including  difficulties  in  integrating  with  current  ecosystems;  lack  of security  protection  for  application  data logic and operating environment; and issues around trust and protection of individuals    and business    privacy. Big data & AITo  meet  demand  from  a  growing generation of consumers for a richer landscape of investment vehicles wealth management firms are launching smartphone apps to appeal to this younger newly rich demographic. Representative  cases  WeBank  has  applied several innovative technologies such as face recognition voice recognition and robotics in its mobile apps such as Credit Particles  WeCar  Credit  etc.  WeBank  has also  launched  We  Zhong  Financial  Management a mobile app for rural banking as  well  as  another  app  for  the  interbank market.  FUTUNN.COM  provides  services to support the front middle and back office functions of securities companies. JFZ is an internet wealth management company that provides wealth management services for high net worth individuals. Wacai Money Manager is the company   s personal wealth  management  platform  and  Wacai Bao  is  designed  to  provide  its  users  with bespoke  financial  management  services. Shenzhen Suishou Technology was established  in  July  2011  and  is  wellknown  in China  for  providing  wealth  management services.Meanwhile  an  even  newer  digital tool  introduced  in  mid2016  by  digital wealth  management  firms  provides  simplified investment advice through sophisticated automated online platforms. These platforms  socalled  roboadvisors  are modeled on U.S.based automated investment  advisers  such  as  Wealthfront  and Betterment.  They  incorporate  big  data and AI to eliminate or reduce the need for facetoface interaction with substantially lower  costs  yet  provide  customised  online financial advisory services. Roboadvisory firstmovers in the Chinese market include  CreditEase  which  launched  its roboadvisory  product  ToumiRA  using trading algorithms to match investors risk preferences  and  objectives  to  their  optimal portfolios. Another notable player is PINTEC with Xuanji which automatically rebalances  a  global  portfolio  including onshore RMB and offshore USD assets for retail investors.*1 Zipeiyi develops AI systems for securities and other financial services companies. Based on the concept of making asset allocation more straightforward  and  efficient  the  company  applies AI  technology  to  the  asset  management industry.  Tiger  Brokers  uses  a  variety  of internet technologies which are designed to improve efficiency in the financial services sector and to facilitate investment in global securities markets. Others offering machineassisted investment advisory include  Baidu  Gupiao  PingAn  One  MiCai and Clipper Advisor.Roboadvisory  could  well  reshape the future of China   s wealth management business. Which players succeed will depend on their developing clever partnerships  with  global  peers.  They  will  also need broad and deep asset offerings portfolio  allocation  and  technological  superiority in big data analytics and machine learning.FinTech in China   s Capital Market  |  11 C H I N AFinTech   s Influence on China   s Capital MarketServing more lowincome groups at lower costsDue to the costs a large number of lowincome  customers  (with  annual  net income  less  than  RMB  100000)  cannot meet the threshold to invest in traditional financial products. Chinese SMEs also have the same problem. Despite this about 358 million Chinese customers use mobile payments which create a solid foundation for FinTech  development.  Actually  FinTechs focus on serving the vast majority of people  including  the  lowincome  group  and improving existing financial services. They help  promote  efficiency  without  raising costs  through  automation  and  simplification.  They  also  enable  disaggregation  of the  traditional  value  chain  in  the  capital market as they become more embedded in business and consumption.Boosting ruralinclusive financial systemThe  establishment  of  a  leading  digital finance sector is increasingly expanding beyond the cities into the rural areas. FinTechs  such  as  onlineonly  banks  can reach  unbanked  individuals  in  line  with the  Chinese  Government   s  policy  to  promote financial inclusion. 71% of the country   s 234 million unbanked adults and 54% in the poorest two quintiles of households live in rural areas. There are few physical branches of banks in rural areas but mobile  phones  are  another  story.  With  the help  of  financial  apps  large  banks  like Postal  Savings  Bank  of  China  (PSBC)  and FinTech firms have expanded aggressively into rural China.Promoting cooperation between financial institutions and FinTechsIn  order  to  increase  revenue  and market share more and more firms in the securities  industry  will  seek  to  cooperate with FinTechs. The FinTechs know how to innovate products and services to deliver more  value  to  underserved  clients  and market segments. FinTechs have data and technology; they have customer data consumption  patterns  and  intimate  relationships  with  customers;  they  will  take  full advantage of structured and unstructured databases or big data on which sophisticated  analytics  will  be  processed  easily and quickly to develop pricing and service strategies.Delivering regulatorydriven change at acceptable costFarsighted  regulators  in  China  are seeking to establish mechanisms to reduce regulatory  uncertainty  and  time  cost  in financial market. The PBOC the country's central bank announced on 15 May 2017 that  it  has  set  up  a  committee  namely People's  Bank  of  China  Financial  Technology  Committee  to  enhance  research planning and coordination of work on financial  technology.  The  central  bank  will also increase the use of RegTech to boost its capabilities in identifying preventing and dissolving  financial  risks  including  both crosssector  and  crossmarket  risks  with technology such as big data AI and cloud computing.  FinTechs  will  likely  benefit from the transparency of RegTech to lower the complexity and costs of maintaining regulatory compliance. Gaining competitive advantageTechnological  innovation  will  disrupt the competitive advantages of participants in global capital markets. Regulation may  cause  disruption  and  uncertainty. However  it  is  also  creating  opportunities for  new  players.  In  many  ways  technology  is  making  it  possible  for  new  entrants to compete with or enhance existing players  and  value  chains       examples  include the  use  of  AI  to  displace     voice   dominated  markets  and  alternative  research  providers  that  leverage  unstructured  data to  generate  deeper  insights  into  existing trends and market opportunities. In short technology will touch and transform business models in a vast array of areas such as data management market surveillance cyber security regulatory reporting funding and alpha capture.The Future of Chinese FinTechAs China will continue its policy of opening up to the outside World its FinTech firms  face  great  opportunities.  Chinese FinTech firms will expand out of China and foreign FinTech firms with competitive  advantage  will  enter  China.  How can we seize the opportunity? Here are some points which relate to the future of Chinese FinTech.BlockchainIn  China  blockchain  initiatives  are still  in  the  early  stages  of  development where major banks have only just started to commission proofs of concept and pilot projects  for  blockchain  applications.  FinTechs in Europe and America have more mature technology solutions and can leverage these innovations capabilities and expertise to develop the Chinese blockchain market further.RegTech and regulatory sandboxFinTech  firms  abroad  have  developed  solutions  related  to  compliance  advanced data analytics and risk evaluation. These  techniques  and  knowledge  could all be leveraged to great effect in the Chinese marketplace as its FinTech sector and regulatory framework mature further. Besides the regulatory sandboxes in the UK Singapore and elsewhere are friendly and experienced  with  FinTech  startups;  their authorization processes and guidance are worth learning.Foreign ExchangeChina  will  gradually  relax  control over  Qualified  Domestic Institutional Investors  (QDII)  and  Qualified  Foreign Institutional  Investors  (QFII)  to  show  its determination  to  speed  up  the  yuan's convertibility  under  the  capital  account. Money transfer FinTechs and traditional financial institutions can supply FX services and ensure strict observance of laws in the Chinese market.Chinese investment demandWith  much  investment  flowing  between  China  and  overseas  there  is  likely  a  strong  demand  to  meet  the  needs  of FinTechs and investors in China. We may start  to  see  more  direct  competition  between for example Baidu and Google Alibaba and Amazon Tencent and Facebook. Whatever happens in China there is no denying that incumbents and FinTech firms alike will need to transform to remain relevant in this new world order. The next few years will be an exciting time for the industry. Chinese FinTechs should look to partner with firms and financial institutions to develop crossborder partnership to serve this sizeable market.12  |  NOMURA JOURNAL OF ASIAN CAPITAL MARKETS  |  Autumn 2017 Vol.2/No.1 Needless to say China   s FinTech sector will flourish in regulation blockchain trading  clearing  and  settlement  and  create a safe and efficient capital market for the near future.EY  and  DBS.
