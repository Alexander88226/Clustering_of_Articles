Specifically our intent was to invite articles that examine the overlaps and complementarities between these two activities. In combination technology commercialization with entrepreneurship brings to fruition the process of introducing into a market a new tool or a new application for an existing tool (Markman et al. 2008) and the venturecreation process to exploit an entrepreneurial opportunity (Davidsson 2015).Not all startups are led by technology entrepreneurs (Bailetti 2012; Giones & Brem 2017a; Wallin et al. 2016). However in disruptive environments we increasingly notice the adoption of digital technologies to implement startup business models (von Briel et al. 2018; Westerlund et al. 2014) or organizational structures (Nambisan 2016). So in the end technology commercialization and entrepreneurship often become intertwined in a complex process of coevolution resulting in the emergence of new technologies as well as entrepreneurial activity (Giones & Brem 2017b).Take for instance the developments around some recent digital technologies such as social media and blockchain. Some entrepreneurs have engaged in developing applications and then bringing them to the market with a focus on overcoming the technology commercialization challenges; others have utilized these new technologies as external enablers for their new venture ideas (Davidsson et al. 2018). A similar pattern can be observed relating to cleantech (Bjornali et al. 2017) nanotech (Woolley 2014) or the drone industry (Giones & Brem 2017b). Interestingly microlevel dynamics between promising technologies and entrepreneurs can contribute to the successful creation of ecosystems (Spigel & Harrison 2017) with significant regional impact leading even to the emergence of new industries (Alvarez et al. 2015; Forbes & Kirsch 2011).In order to provide an informed perspective and useful insights to researchers and practitioners we have organized the contributions in this special issue within a  Technology Innovation Management ReviewJanuary 2019 (Volume 9 Issue 1)4timreview.caEditorial Technology Commercialization and EntrepreneurshipChris McPhee Ferran Giones and Dev K. Duttaframework integrating technology commercialization and entrepreneurship. Our objective is to make this framework a reference for future researchers and practitioners intending to examine these issues further.Bringing together technology commercialization andentrepreneurshipThe intersection of technology commercialization and entrepreneurship captures a scenario where entrepreneurs potentially have an advantage over established players when bringing novel technologies to market. Novelty is an advantage even if it also makes survival harder (Hyytinen et al. 2015).From the viewpoint of technology commercialization these are often situations where there either is an emergent technology without a clear application or market or there is a technology that is new to a specific market or industry. Emerging technologies include new promising insights from science and engineering that are being developed as tools that could potentially change the current state of the art (Rotolo et al. 2015). At the other extreme existent technologies repurposed for new applications in new markets are defined as technology exaptations (Andriani et al. 2017; Andriani & Cattani 2016). They are often the more prevalent form of technology commercialization among digital entrepreneurs who recombine existent technologies for a new use. Therefore we propose to divide the technology commercialization axis between    emerging technology innovations    and    exapted technologies and digital innovations    as being a priori sources of substantial differences in the technology commercialization process (see Table 1).From the intersecting viewpoint of entrepreneurship we know that founder characteristics and the new venture   s team composition have an influence on the identification of an idea and its exploitation as an opportunity (Klotz et al. 2013; Unger et al. 2011). We also know the ways in which the business model (Foss & Saebi 2017) the firm   s strategy (Gans et al. 2018) the strategic orientation and learning (Dutta & Crossan 2005; Dutta & Hora 2017) and the ecosystem where they are embedded (Drori & Wright 2018; Kohler 2016; Mian et al. 2016) can make a difference. Finally we also know that there are overarching institutional network and societal elements that can have an impact on technology entrepreneurship activities for instance the regulation approaches (Gurses & Ozcan 2015) or regional innovation policy choices (Clayton et al. 2018; Sorenson 2018). Thus we divide the entrepreneurship axis (see Table 1) using three broad levels that includemicro meso and macrolevel components of the phenomenon.The juxtaposition of these two viewpoints generates the opportunity to identify specific research areas that can contribute to advances in both domains by identifying practiceoriented problems (i.e. What should I consider in my specific situation?) and academic research problems (i.e. How could I introduce technology commercialization challenges in my entrepreneurship research?). We have added only for illustrative purposes possible research questions or scenarios that can inspire future work on the topic (see Table 1).This special issue of the TIM Review takes the first steps towards addressing these research gaps. The articles in this issue introduce perspectives from managers leading their organizations new firms (startups) and maturing firms (SMEs). The articles show how digitalization has permeated the different decisionmaking spheres across a diversity of contexts. The interplay of technology commercialization and entrepreneurship processes goes beyond the growth pains of hightech firms. At the same time the diversity of contexts and cases included in the special issue capture the complexity of the phenomenon and the relevance this has for technology entrepreneurs and innovation managers.First Andrew G. Earle Michael J. Merenda and J.Matthew Davis from the University of New Hampshire in the United States explore the case of a technology venture in the    green energy    industry to identify tools that entrepreneurs can use to overcome new venture development transitions. The authors address the question of    how do entrepreneurs navigate key transition points in the phases of the technology commercialization process?    They focus on the case of an emerging technology from the entrepreneur   s perspective (microlevel). Their findings highlight the nonlinearity of emerging technology commercialization emphasizing the value of taking    strategic pauses    that allow the firm to pivot or explore new partnerships. The authors also introduce suggestions on how tech firms can prepare to more effectively navigate these transitions.In the second article Christopher Svensson Jakob Udesen and Jane Webb from Chalmers University of Technology Sweden study how fintech startups and incumbents build legitimacy in the financial ecosystem. The authors explore the perspective from the viewpoints of both new entrants (15 fintech startups) as well  Technology Innovation Management ReviewJanuary 2019 (Volume 9 Issue 1)5timreview.caEditorial Technology Commercialization and EntrepreneurshipChris McPhee Ferran Giones and Dev K. DuttaTable 1. A practiceoriented research framework for technology commercialization and entrepreneurship Technology Innovation Management ReviewJanuary 2019 (Volume 9 Issue 1)6timreview.caEditorial Technology Commercialization and EntrepreneurshipChris McPhee Ferran Giones and Dev K. Duttaas the incumbents (established financial firms) in terms of their response to regaining their organizational legitimacy. The focus is on one of the fascinating digital innovations using a firm perspective (mesolevel). Their findings expand the implications of legitimacy theory in contexts where regulatory frameworks mediate the social and economic impact of digital innovations. The authors provide specific insights as to how new digital entrepreneurs can build legitimacy in highly regulated and competitive contexts.Next Manon Enjolras Mauricio Camargo and Christophe Schmitt from the Universit   de Lorraine France investigate the effects of technology intensity on the growth and internationalization of SMEs. The authors explore the consequences of technology commercialization from a firm perspective by answering the question Does an SME   s high technology intensity result in high innovativeness and export performance? The authors build on the observation of nine different SMEs with different levels of technology intensity and innovation types to extract potential profiles that connect technology commercialization outcomes and innovation. The findings suggest that a longterm implication for firms with high technology intensity is that they sustain a focus on product innovations looking for    the next big thing    using emerging technologies. In contrast firms with low technology intensity are more prone to specializing in process innovations looking at options to recombine existing technologies to find solutions that address existing problems. The authors discuss the implications of such configurations for the longterm growth and internationalization of the firms.Then Saheed A. Gbadegeshin from the University of Turku Finland investigate how digitalization has changed the technology commercialization processes in the life sciences industry. The author explores this question from the angle of new drugs medical devices and ehealth companies. The article takes a firm ecosystem and regional perspective into account (mesolevel and macrolevel) to explore how digitalization changes the technology commercialization of digital innovations and emerging technologies in a specific industry (life sciences). The participation of a diversity of firms and stakeholders allows Gbadegeshin to extract common and specific insights. Common to the different types of technology commercialization processes is that lower costs and higher flexibility lead to more iterative processes and adoption of agile business model approaches across the industry. The article also presents specific examples of the downside of digitalization for instance related to cybersecurity or hacking threats. The final article by Maksim Belitski and BainLiversage from the University of Reading in the United Kingdom describes how digital technologies and eleadership skills influence the development of SMEs. The authors use the context of an emerging economy to study how transformation and eleadership in SMEs can help to create and capture value using digital technologies. The article takes the perspective of the SME manager (microlevel) to identify what eleadership capacities contribute to the exploitation of digital innovations. The authors use a mixedmethods approach (interviews and a survey) to gather insights on what it means to introduce transformational eleadership and how this can have an impact on the development and growth of the SME. They discuss how the study findings extend the impact of digitalization beyond technology commercialization and entrepreneurship noting that as firms mature it becomes necessary to realign the new technologies    potential with business strategy.Taken together the contributions to this special issue of the TIM Review provide a first step to address the research opportunities at the intersection of technology commercialization and entrepreneurship. They provide a sample of perspectives with different units of analysis and a rich combination of research methods. The international background of the authors as well as their respective studies indicate the interest in the topic as well as its relevance at a global scale highlighting practiceoriented responses to what is a complex but promising and growing area of research.Ferran Giones and Dev K.
