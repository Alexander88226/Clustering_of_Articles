The paper aims at identifying and describing key internal business processes that contribute to growth through a longitudinal study of eleven SME case companies located in a lowgrowth region. The findings of the study reveal six key growthfacilitating themes that are critical when actively supporting firm growth in a lowgrowth region.Key wordsGrowth factors small and medium size enterprises (SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s) longitudinal multiple case study1. IntroductionIn recent years a large number of studies of smallfirm growth have been performed and reviewed (Delmar 1997; Wiklund and Shepherd 2003; SadlerSmith et al. 2003; Davidsson et al. 2010; Love and Roper 2014). Although the topic of smallfirm growth has received quite extensive attention several reviewers deliver with relatively critical accounts. The criticism concerns both theoretical and methodological shortcomings (Storey 1994; Gilbert et al. 2006; Davidsson et al. 2010; McKelvie and Wiklund 2010; Wright and Stigliani 2013). In spite of the longitudinal and process nature of the concept of \\xc2\\xbbgrowth\\xc2\\xab many growth studies are crosssectional. In growth and entrepreneurship research there is a general wish for more longitudinal \\xc2\\xbbreal time\\xc2\\xab research (Davidsson et al. 2010; Wright and Stigliani 2013). As described in the theory section below a large number of firm growth factors exist (Gilbert et al. 2006; Davidsson et al. 2010). These growth factors can both be internal/organisational factors and external market factors and they can act both as positive drivers of  growth  and  as negative barriers or obstacles for growth. 21\\x0cExtant growth and SME literature has extensively addressed how firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 grow is related to favourable external conditions and how firms do not grow due to unfavourable market conditions (barriers) (Wright and Stigliani 2013). However current empirical research on firm growth in adverse conditions is scarce and knowledge of how firms may grow (i.e. the mechanisms and drivers) in spite of generally unfavourable external conditions is limited (Bamiatzi and Kirchmaier 2014). This explorative study investigates key drivers of growth for SMEs in an external context characterised by low growth and economic recession. The study investigates how a number of Danish SMEs have achieved high growth rates in spite of unfavourable external conditions. These SMEs are facing the specific challenges of few highly specialised employees low funding opportunities for SMEs few large companies from which to attract larger groups of employees and educated/specialised citizens moving to highgrowth regions with more possibilities. Growth in the context of lowgrowth regions is an unexplored area within SME and growth research and the findings presented here are relevant and applicable for managers in SMEs as well as for policy makers and institutions supporting growth and business development in lowgrowth regions. This paper provides insight into the key facilitators of growth in Danish SMEs in a lowgrowth area. The research question of this paper is \\xc2\\xbbHow can SMEs in lowgrowth regions actively support firm growth and which facilitating activities are applied?\\xc2\\xabTo answer this research question we examined eleven Danish SMEs over a period of 18 months within a specific region of Denmark characterised by low growth and a less favourable socioeconomic situation compared to growth rates and the financial situation in the rest of the country. In the next section of the paper we discuss and elaborate on the theoretical perspectives of firm growth and SMEs including internal and external growth factors. After the theoretical discussion we present the methods applied in the study. We then present the empirical findings and we conclude with a discussion of the results and the implications of the study.2. Firm growth and growth facilitatorsFrom the review of growth studies (Penrose 1959/95; Gilbert et al. 2006; Garnsey et al. 2006; Davidsson et al. 2010; Senderovitz 2010; Wright and Stigliani 2013) it is clear that growth factors can make out a very long \\xc2\\xbblaundry list\\xc2\\xab of factors that may facilitate or hinder growth. Growth factors can roughly speaking be divided into internal (within the firm) and external (environmental) factors even if it may in some instances be difficult to determine what is truly external and truly internal (Davidsson et al. 2010). The industry development is usually seen as an external factor whereas in a Porterian world industry affiliation is seen as a strategic choice made by the firm (Porter 1980 1985). Similarly opportunities may be viewed as external factors i.e. factors \\xc2\\xbbout there\\xc2\\xab to be discovered or as factors that the firm should create and develop internally (Shane and Venkataraman 2000; Dew et al. 2009).22Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015\\x0cHow can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?2.1 Internal growth factors facilitating or hindering growthIn her seminal work on firm growth Penrose (1959/95) argues that firm resources play a key role in achieving growth and competitive advantages. Limited resources mean limited possibilities for growth. It is through the internal resources in general and management resources in particular that the firm may develop unique entrepreneurial (managerial) services which are in turn seen as a prerequisite to firm growth and to achieving competitive advantage. According to Penrose the internal resource use is a key determinant of firm growth. Internal inducements to expansion arise from the existence of currently unused productive services resources and specialised knowledge which according to Penrose are always to be found in any firm (Penrose 1959/95 p. 66). The issue of management capacity has been elaborated on and categorised by Storey (1994) as management motivation education management experience number of founders and functional skills. A number of studies have investigated the relationship between growth aspirations and actual growth. These studies in general find that managers with higher aspirations achieve higher actual growth. In this view it is up to the management of the firms to lay the foundations for growth (Wiklund and Shepherd 2003; Delmar and Wiklund 2008; Stam and Wenneberg 2009).2.2 External factors facilitating or hindering growthExternal factors also influence growth. These factors include macroeconomic development market conditions environmental dynamism access to external financial capital access to other external resources and network and access to general human capital (education level) and specific human capital (experience) (Wiklund and Shepherd 2003). Growing ventures are highly dependent on the local environment for resources needed for their operations and the ability to acquire resources locally has substantial implications for the levels of growth the firms will attain. The growth of the individual firm is also influenced by the growth of the industry and the economic and financial situation of the country and region as well as the industry dynamism (Gilbert et al. 2006; Bamiatzi and Kirschmaier 2014). In general firm growth appears to correlate with the general macroeconomic and regional financial trends. Summarising from a theoretical perspective we argue that achieving growth may be a matter of management capacity growth aspiration willingness and skills but that fundamental facilitators and obstacles in the environment play a key role for firm growth.3. Methodology and empirical contextThe objective of the paper is to obtain applicationoriented knowledge of what creates growth in SMEs. To investigating this we use an exploratory longitudinal multiple case study design. This article is based on a research project conducted in collaboration with Danish Regions (Danske Regioner) with an aim to enhance SME growth in a lowgrowth region. The research project falls in two phases. The first phase identi23\\x0cfied growth processes in SME growth companies in the specific lowgrowth region of South and Western Zealand in Denmark where 38 randomly selected companies were contacted. The case companies were selected based on their size  (private SMEs)  their location in or in close proximity to the region of South and Western Zealand a positive growth record during the past 3 years and finally case companies were selected representing different industries. The fourth criterion was included because industrial characteristics may affect growth potential. We contacted 38 case companies expecting that approximately half of them would accept the invitation to participate in an interview. Out of the 38 case companies 20 companies accepted to participate in the project and through site visits and individual interviews with the CEOs and other key personnel we made extended company portraits of these 20 companies. The data collected during the interview sessions were analysed using meaning categorisation (Kvale and Brinkman 2009) where similar statements from the interviews were grouped within related themes and six key growth themes were derived through an abductive process (Danermark et al. 2002) going \\xc2\\xbbback and forth\\xc2\\xab between theory and the empirical evidence (company portraits and data from the interviews).These themes were explored further during the second phase of the project in which 11 out of the 20 firms were selected for further indepth longitudinal analyses (see Figure 1). The eleven firms were selected based on relevance to the project objectives variation across different industries (four production/retail five service/knowledge service and two building & construction) and willingness and ability to participate in the indepth studies.We investigated the 11 firms over a period of 18 months where management and employee representatives were interviewed to explore the specific contents of the identified growth themes and the actual growthfacilitating activities involved. The data derived from the interview sessions were analysed through meaning\\xe2\\x80\\x93categorisation and the facilitating activities within each of the six growth themes are explained in detail in the findings. 3.1 The empirical contextThe firms in this study are located in the Southern and Western part of Zealand. The four key growth and socialeconomic challenges of this region are related to low productivity in the region\\xe2\\x80\\x99s own businesses; globally oriented industries gradually moving to other regions; difficulty attracting and retaining highly skilled employees; and finally that innovation is concentrated on a few but very innovative companies. In addition the region is challenged by the demographic development. If the projections of the age composition hold the reduction in the number of people in the working age (as predicted by 2015) will significantly decrease the level of prosperity and growth in the region (Copenhagen Economics 2005).24Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015\\x0cHow can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?4. Findings In the following section we will describe the growth facilitating activities according to the six growth themes and the contexts in which the activities unfold for the respective firms. Figure 1 shows the case companies with an indication of primary and secondary growth themes as some growth themes were of higher priority in some of the case companies. The identified growth themes include 1. Strategic thinking 2. Selfmanaged teams 3. Management of public fundraising 4. Open source innovation 5. Middlesourcing and 6. Local and regional networks.Figure 1 Company overview and growth themesCompanyIndustryOfferingsWestrupProduction A global export and production company of  agricultural machineryToftebo maskinfabrikProductionA small blacksmith shop manufacturing its own products in stainless steel and specializes in playground equipmentNo of employees809Primary themes1;4;5Secondary themes2;3;62;61;3;4;5RM FintechProductionA precision engineering workshop that specializes 262;5;61;3;4Osteb\\xc3\\xb8rsenGeocenter M\\xc3\\xb8ns Klintin the machining of precision components and other precision mechanical productions.Retail/ productionA small trading company that buys and sells luxury cheese and carry out eventsServiceAn experience and conference center with more than yearly 500 events 3D cinema expeditions snorkeling trips and nature walksVilcon ServiceA conference center which consists of three centersKragerup godsServiceA conference center with a GoHigh activity areas Gerlev legeparkServiceand an integrated course programAn activity park that is part of a Sports Academy that offers different play projects to the private and public sectorCasalogicKnowledge serviceA consulting company that provides Itinfrastructure services and solutions to companies using \\xe2\\x80\\x98Open Source\\xe2\\x80\\x99 systemsUrh\\xc3\\xb8j SmedieAltan.dkBuilding and constructionBuilding and constructionA smithy that supply plumbing ventilation and other energy preserving solutionsA construction company which designs supplies and installs balconies on existing blocks of flats. 18251570121226851;2;63;4;51;2;34;5;6 1;2;4;63;52;3;41;5;63;4;61;2;5 4;61;2;3;51;5;62;3;41;2;63;4;5After a description of each growth theme we present a small reallife narrative to illustrate how SMEs may work with the specific themes in practice.25\\x0cGrowth facilitating theme 1 Strategic thinkingWhat does working with strategic thinking imply?Existing research underlines that the SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 approach to strategy is inherently different from that seen in large companies (Hofer and Charan 1984; SadlerSmith et al. 2003; Evald and Senderovitz 2013). The management in a small firm usually consists of a single or very few individuals who then naturally have to carry out all managerial and strategic tasks and responsibilities. One of the important issues in terms of strategic thinking is how to balance the tension between strategic planning and goal setting for setting targets and giving the firm a clear sense of direction on the one side and to stay flexible and improvisational for being able to explore and exploit the unexpected events and contingencies on the other side. Managing this balance may be one of the most important factors influencing smaller firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 growth and competitive advantages (March 1991; Hitt et al. 2011).How do SMEs work with strategic thinking in practice?Osteb\\xc3\\xb8rsen\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to improvise and make quick iterative moves according to the changes in food trends and customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 taste has made them competitive and able to achieve high growth rates. However as the organisation is growing the management feels that too many decisions are made going in various directions; and they need to become more structured and have a more formal clear strategy and work in one unified direction. The challenge is to plan ahead and remain flexible and agile. In this process the two owner managers have started mapping the individual functional areas of the company including the related actions and each employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s required competences and responsibilities while leaving room and flexibility for each team of employees to make their own independent decisions. They thereby try to maintain a balance between improvisation and planning.Growth facilitating theme 2 Selfmanaged teamsWhat does the establishment of selfmanaged teams imply?Establishing selfmanaged teams means deliberately giving autonomy and formal decisionmaking power to a team of employees without the classic direct supervision of a line manager. By giving responsibility to small teams of employees and allowing them to exercise a high level of selfmanagement the team should \\xe2\\x80\\x93 according to the firms \\xe2\\x80\\x93 carry out key decisions without management\\xe2\\x80\\x99s involvement and the firm thus attain a higher level of flexibility and efficiency. The informants from all eleven case companies indicated that they had been able to ensure higher growth through the application of selfmanaged teams in different functions of their organisations. 26Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015\\x0cHow can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?How do SMEs work with selfmanaged teams in practice?GeoCenter M\\xc3\\xb8ns Klint applies selfmanaged teams in its development and innovation function. In this function six people with very different skills (e.g. biology geology project management financial management and creative skills) are put into play by their collaboration on specific projects. The growth potential in the application of selfmanaged ad hoc based teams at GeoCenter M\\xc3\\xb8ns Klint lies in the benefits that come with the small and flexible organisational way in which the eventoriented businesses of the company are organised. This allows them to be more efficient more flexible and have fewer fixed costs than would be the case with a permanent development organisation. Growth facilitating theme 3 Management of public fundraisingWhat does management of public fundraising imply?SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to attract external funding for development projects particularly from the public sector is a way to overcome the regional resource scarceness within the private sector. Public funding can help the SMEs obtain growth by financing and supporting firmb ased development projects serving e.g. a cultural or a leisureoriented purpose. Some of the companies have experienced declining sales in recent years; however with effective project management targeted towards public project funds the companies have been able to develop and grow strategically into other businesses and industries. In order to obtain adequate public funds it is important to duly prepare project descriptions which includes integrating \\xc2\\xbbadministrative\\xc2\\xab public procedures and obtaining publicprivatecollaboration experience with new technologies; and it is important to develop personal relations (local regional national) for project collaboration and fundraising.  How do SMEs manage public fundraising in practice? Kragerup Gods has developed and created growth through an investment project in an experience centre offering \\xc2\\xbbGohigh activity areas\\xc2\\xab and they have developed an integrated course programme. Owing to a publically funded investment project Kragerup Gods has been able to develop and attract new business and reach new target groups which has improved their competitive advantage and corporate branding in comparison to other traditional conference centres.Growth facilitation theme 4 Open source innovationWhat does working with open source innovation imply? Open source innovation focuses on the interaction between producers and users of innovation and employeedriven innovation is focused on innovation initiated and facilitated by staff. These two innovation approaches conceptualise companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 processes of interactive learning at the micro level (Lundvall 2009). Both research and practice show that both a formal and an informal approach to these innovation processes may 27\\x0cbe taken (Smith Ulhoj & Kersting 2012). In the present cases active and continuous dialogue with customers to detect their needs is a key growthfacilitating activity that generates new solutions. The customer is indeed the key driver of the innovation processes providing input for tailored services and products to suit the specific needs of customers whenever possible. This approach gives smaller firms a potentially competitive advantage compared with larger companies with more formalised processes that lend themselves less readily to such flexibility.How do SMEs work with opening the innovation processes in practice? Vilcon is experiencing a growth dilemma the owner is a key driver of the business innovation processes but may become a bottleneck hampering the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s continued innovation and growth. The solution for Vilcon has been to create an open and forthcoming culture where ideas can come from anyone inside or outside the organisation; and once \\xc2\\xbbmatured\\xc2\\xab the ideas may be integrated quickly and efficiently owing to the firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s flat and teamoriented structure which promotes the implementation of userproducer and employeedriven innovation. At Vilcon customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 needs and requests and customers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 interaction with the employees often initiate ideas for new products or services.Growth facilitating theme 5 MiddlesourcingWhat does working with middlesourcing imply?Middlesourcing occurs when similar production/operations are taking place simultaneously in two (or more) different \\xe2\\x80\\x93 but collaborating \\xe2\\x80\\x93 companies. Middlesourcing may be seen as an \\xc2\\xbbalternative\\xc2\\xab to outsourcing where the production of (part of) a product is removed completely from the focal firm. In SMEs outsourcing may be counterproductive for various reasons; first because transaction costs may be higher than expected; second because smaller firms may encounter difficulties dealing with the management challenges of international outsourcing cooperations; and finally companies which have experienced ongoing improvements and efficiencies in a Danish context may find that this may not necessarily continue when production is outsourced to foreign countries. To address these challenges of outsourcing middlesourcing is emerging as a viable alternative that achieves competitive advantage and flexibility while minimising productionrelated risks and maintaining the potential for continued improvement. How do SMEs work with middlesourcing in practice? The two companies FM Fintech and Hardi are in the same line of business and they produce similar (albeit not identical) products. Originally Hardi planned to outsource their production completely to FM Fintech. However the two firms decided to engage in middlesourcing instead to stimulate the flexibility and the competitive advantages of both companies. By applying middlesourcing they assist each other in gaining access 28Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015\\x0cHow can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?to larger customers and they both minimise their individual risks. They can enhance flexibility and potentially exploit each other\\xe2\\x80\\x99s production capacity in peak situations and enhance flexibility and reduce costs. For FM Fintech and Hardi a positive side effect is that the production and business stay in the local region (as opposed to outsourcing to other countries/regions) which creates a local demand for skilled labour. Growth facilitating theme 6 Local /regional relations based networksWhat does working with local/regional relation based networks imply?SMEs are highly dependent on local/regional relationbased networks in their pursuit of growth and development. A key challenge of SMEs relates to the fact that they have fewer internal knowledge resources because of the smaller number of their employees. The local/regional relationbased networks do not only provide opportunities for collective learning and knowledge development they also provide access to resources and potential collaboration. This creates a good foundation for innovation and growth among the SMEs \\xe2\\x80\\x93 both as individual organisations and as groups (Keeble & Wilkinson 1999). Characteristic of success in these types of networks is a high level of mutual trust and interest among the networking partners as the networks are not based on formal contractual relations. However a regulative factor is proximity as \\xe2\\x80\\x98everybody knows everybody\\xe2\\x80\\x99 in local/regional communities. So if one network partner does not deliver or live up to the expected level of cooperation that partner may be excluded. The incentive to be trustworthy as a network partner may therefore be expected to be relatively high in these types of networks.How do SMEs work with local /regional relationbased networks in practice? Toftebo is actively networking with similar companies that otherwise could be seen as direct competitors. Such cooperation with the \\xc2\\xbbcompetitors\\xc2\\xab is based as much on social relations as on business deals. In this network solutions are created in a mutual and flexible process that does not rely on formal agreements or contracts. This network helps Toftebo gain competitive advantages flexibility and access to more and larger assignments and contracts that they would otherwise be able to carry out themselves. In Toftebo\\xe2\\x80\\x99s local region demand is rather confined and collaborating with other similar otherwise competing firms makes it possible to gain largerscale orders outside the local area in with they normally operate.In summary the eleven case companies revealed that a logical and hierarchical order of the six growth factors exists. Fundamentally the case companies all had clear growth intentions and shared an interest in strategic thinking and worked diligently on nurturing their strategic growth potential through various strategic initiatives. This appeared to be a prerequisite for their success and growth. The lack of resources in these small firms was accommodated by organisational designs focusing on selfmanaged teams. By allowing the employees room to explore and to take on responsi29\\x0cbilities the case companies gained access to more knowledge and innovation potential from their dedicated employees. The strategic thinking combined with the selfmanaged organisation of employees was supported in particular by three key activities open source innovation middlesourcing and fundraising. Open source innovation was applied by all the case eleven case companies in various ways and resort to selfmanaged teams  allowed the firms to \\xe2\\x80\\x98think outside the box\\xe2\\x80\\x99 and to open up the development and innovation potential. Middlesourcing was applied as a way to ensure flexibility primarily by the production companies. Furthermore fundraising was applied to gain access to resources for new development activities yet primarily by the service companies. However all three activities were undertaken in an attempt to gain flexibility (either financial innovation/resourcewise and/or to achieve production flexibility) and as a way to navigate effectively as a local/regional SME in a lowgrowth region in a postfiscal crisis time. Finally the case companies\\xe2\\x80\\x99 local and regional based networks contributed to all the other five growth facilitators by providing knowledge collaboration innovation and by facilitating joint growth; hence the networks were therefore used extensively by all eleven case companies. Figure 2 below illustrates the logical order of the six growthfacilitating themes. 5. DiscussionThe study reveals that firms achieve growth by applying an interplay of internally and externally oriented activities. The different characteristics of the eleven case companies indicated variations in which growth facilitators were most optimal in supporting growth in the specific context industry and situation of the case companies. In line with contingency theory (Galbraith 2012; Van de Ven et al. 2013) the practical implications of the findings stress the need for SMEs to identify and develop their unique set of combinations of growth facilitating activities in pursuit and support of growth as no one solution or specific set of growth facilitators fits everybody. However a larger comparative study would have to be carried out to be able to identify the correlations between industry company situation and growth facilitating activities. Strategic thinking is a key element in ensuring growth in SMEs. Existing research has stressed that strategy in SMEs is different from strategy in large organisations. However little is known about how SMEs actually apply strategic thinking manage their organisations on a daily basis and to which extent they use emergent and/or planned actions. The findings of the present study revealed different combinations of actions where the SMEs were combining their flexile emergent actions with more planned activities to various degrees. These findings are not conclusive and a large study of strategic thinking among SMEs could provide  further knowledge  in  relations  to how combination of  planned  and emergent  actions  or  combinations  hereof  generate  30Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015\\x0cFigure 2 The six growth facilitation activitiesHow can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?Networks   gnisiardnuf gnganaMinoitamrofni ecruos nepO gnicruoseddMli Selfmanaged teams Strategic thinkingmore  growth  in  certain  types  of  SMEs contexts and situations. The successful application of the autonomous teams and selfmanagement as growth facilitators implies in practice that SMEs invest in developing the employees\\xe2\\x80\\x99 professional skills to be able to handle more and different assignments including their ability to organise plan and communicate at many different levels. The new project economy may be an important and neglected growth facilitator for SMEs. The study show that administrative capabilities and effective processes encompassing preparation of project descriptions that include integration of public procedures as well as the use of personal network (local regional national) for project collaboration and fundraising are important for attracting new public funding.It is a common theme in the public debate that wage competition (primarily in the industry) from lowwage countries constitutes a serious challenge for maintaining and expanding employment in Denmark. Conversely the case companies have applied middlesourcing activities to ensure a movement in the opposite direction \\xe2\\x80\\x93 maintaining flexibility as well as production and jobs in Denmark. Middlesourcing as a business strategy is perhaps one of the findings with the greatest growth potential. It is also a phenomenon that is not (yet) wellidentified and included as part of the economic policy efforts. The recommendation is therefore to consider this opportunity and to further examine how middlesourcing may take place in a Danish lowgrowth regional context. In regard to userproducer and employeedriven innovation SMEs need to be aware of the fact that the lack of process formalisation and involvement of external knowledge 31\\x0c(apart from that of the customers) may represent challenges. Knowledge sought primarily among a few company employees may represent a potential limitation to new innovative solutions. If you ask the same people each time then you are like to only get the same response and approach. This finding stresses that extended interaction with external partners is important to ensure innovative solutions and development. However the customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s knowledge \\xe2\\x80\\x93 or lack of knowledge \\xe2\\x80\\x93 may potentially be a barrier to radical innovation if companies focus too much on solving each customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s hereandnow needs. As a business strategy userproducer and employeedriven innovation may demand the fewest resources for generating positive growth for businesses. The findings of the present study support the existing research suggesting that SMEs participating in networks enhance their competitive advantage and growth. Conversely much of present research focuses on the professionalization and formalisation of the networks. However the cases presented here show that there is a wide selection of collaborative networks that are informal and the findings stress the need for companies to nurture their local networks and harvest the growth potential even more. The informal networks should not necessarily be changed into more formal ones as it appears that the level of informality may actually be the strength of the networks for the SMEs. The six growthfacilitating themes were present in all the case companies. However some of the case companies portrayed these growth themes to a much larger extent than the others and some of the themes were critical to their ability to generate growth. The growth themes and facilitating activities identified in the present paper will hopefully inspire both theoretical and applied studies in the field of SME growth.6. ConclusionThe findings provide demonstrate a chronology of growth facilitators and the identified six growth themes and related activities may serve as inspiration for SMEs. A longitudinal study of eleven cases may be considered acceptable for preliminary and exploratory conclusions; yet no statistical generalisation can be made based on the present study. The findings and contributions of this paper offer suggestions for future research. Of particular interest would be to perform similar research across different companies and industries to determine whether the present findings are generic or industry/contextspecific. One could speculate whether the industrial context would emphasize certain growth facilitators over others because of the similarities in industrial context and characteristics. This study was performed in a regional context of Denmark and the findings may therefore also be influenced by regional/national characteristics. Given the implications of the present study a quantitative comparative study of applied growth facilitators across different industries and different regional/national contexts is called for to test the combinations and generalisability of the six growth factors.32Danish Journal of Management & Business nr. 2 | 2015\\x0cHow can SMEs support growth in a lowgrowth region?ReferencesBamiatzi V.C. and Kirchmaier T.
