The future tightening of monetary policy will worsen the financing  situation  of  SMEs.  A  proper  policy  response  to  the  financing  predicament  of  SMEs  is imperative  and  should  be  based  on  a  good  understanding  of  the  reasons  for  their  financing difficulty  to  which  this  survey  study  is  designed  to  contribute.  The  survey  reveals  that  financial institutions  are  quite  selective  in  responding  to  the  financing  requests  of  SMEs.  Basically  the financial institutions give preference to older larger and fastergrowing SMEs in specific types of business. The backgrounds of the SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 owners is also important. An experienced wealthier and older SME owner is more trusted by financial institutions. Other factors matter too for instance if the SMEs have collateral or participate international production networks their chances of getting financing would be improved. The financial institutions also favor an SME with strong innovation potential and business capability and good performance. In China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s situation a number of policy areas are of particular importance. \\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa0\\xc2\\xa01    Both  Authors  are  from  the  Institute  of  Economic  Research  National  Development  and  Reform Commission  of  China.

Overview In past two years China has experienced a lending spree arising from the exceptional efforts  of  the  government  to  shield  the  economy  from  the  impacts  of  an  international financial  crisis  of  a  severity  unseen  since  the  great  depression.  The  lion\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  share  of  a  4 trillion RMB (586 billion U.S. Dollars) stimulus package was financed by bank loans. As a result  the  total  of  new  loans  in  2009  was  as  high  as  10  trillion  RMB  (1.5  trillion  U.S. Dollars)  doubling  its  2008  level.  Loans  grew  at  a  slower  pace  in  2010  but  still  added another 8 trillion RMB (1.2 trillion U.S. Dollars) to the total outstanding. SME financing however  did  not  improve  very  much  in  this  period.  Although  systematic  statistics  are lacking anecdotal evidence shows that around the country SMEs still suffered financing difficulties.  Most  loans  went  to  localgovernmentsponsored  financing  vehicles  for infrastructure projects or stateowned big business that expanded rapidly. As inflation is looming larger China has now begun a cycle of policy tightening. The People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s bank of China (PBOC) the Chinese central bank has raised the interest and reserve ratio several times.  The  PBOC  also  scrapped  the  practice  of  setting  a  loan  growth  target.  Instead  a dynamic monitoring and adjustment mechanism has been put in place so that any bank that issues  excessive  loans  would  be  subject  to  a  higher  reserve  requirement.  The  tightening credit environment will inevitably make SME access to finance ever more difficult. Policy is badly needed to address the predicament of SMEs. With better access to finance SMEs could play a more active role in sustaining the recovery as stimulus policy comes to an end. This study is intended to shed light on factors that have impeded SME financing and to put forward recommendations on how to overcome them.    1.2. Literature Review Despite a lack official statistics SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 difficulty in accessing finance has been long recognized  in  China.  There  is  quite  a  big  body  of  literature  devoted  to  explaining  this situation.  One  school  of  studies  follows  the  classical  model  developed  by  international \\xc2\\xa0352 \\x0cscholars.  Justin  Yifu  Lin  (2001)  cited  asymmetric  information  especially  lack  of  \\xe2\\x80\\x9csoft\\xe2\\x80\\x9d information as a major factor leading to SME financing difficulties. Yang Fenglai et.al. (2006)  argued  that  the  governance  of  SMEs  often  run  by  their  owners  exacerbates  the moral  hazard  problem  because  there  is  no  check  and  balance  mechanism  between  the professional  manager  and  the  owner.  Zhang  Jie  (2000)  showed  that  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cPeckingOrder Hypothesis\\xe2\\x80\\x9d was true in China. As a result the startups would seek internal financing first. At the macro level external financing such as loans to SMEs would be disproportionately low. Some researchers on the other hand tried to identify idiosyncratic factors behind the financing difficulties of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SMEs. Lee Zhiyun (2002) pointed out that China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s big\\xe2\\x80\\x93bankdominated  banking  structure  makes  SME  financing  more  difficult  because  of  the higher  transaction  costs  when  a  big  bank  deals  with  an  SME.  Related  to  this  argument Zhang Jie (2002) believed the transfer of loan decision power from a bank\\xe2\\x80\\x99s local office to a  branch  or  even  to  its  headquarters  a  measure  to  control  financial  risk  adopted  by Government after the Asian financial crisis contributed to SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financing predicament as the asymmetric problem became ever more severe. Empirical studies in China are relatively few.  Zhang  Jie  and  Wang  Xiao  (2002)  found in  their visitingbased  survey  that  the  life cycle of an SME was closely related to its access to finance. They also tested the ownership discrimination hypothesis which states that the lack of access to finance of SMEs is the result  of  discrimination  against  the  private  sector  by  the  stateowned  banking  sector. However  the  survey  did  not  prove  this  argument.  Li  Yong  et  al.  (2004)  conducted  a questionnaire survey in Wenzhou Zhejiang Province a city famous for its booming private sector. They found that banks are increasingly displacing informal financing as the major channel  of  SME  financing.  The  city  has  a  long  history  of  informal  financing.  The proportion  of  SMEs  seeking  bank  loans  was  78.9%  while  the  proportions  of  those  who sought  financing  from  relatives  and  from  internal  reserves  were  68.6%  and  45.7% respectively. Lin Xiankun (2009) did a field survey on SME financing in Dongping County Shandong province. He concluded that the major barriers to SME access to finance were 1) unreliable  SME  financial  information  due  to  poor  book  keeping;  2)lack  of  collateral  as many  SMEs  operated  with  rented  equipment  and  property;  3)  high  cost  associated  with \\xc2\\xa0353 \\x0cbank loans especially when asset assessment insurance and guarantees were involved; 4) poor track record of credibility.       2.  SME Access to Finance Empirical Analysis  2. 1.  Description of the Survey The survey was conducted in three locations to ensure that it was representative. They were  Changxing  county  Zhejiang  province  Dalian  Liaoning  province  and  Tianjing. Changxing is on the Yangzi Delta and close to Shanghai. Changxing has a booming SME sector and traditionally a privatesectordominated economy. Dalian a harbor city and the most developed in the northeast region has a strong manufacturing sector and is moving quickly  towards  the  hightech  sector.  Tianjing  together  with  Beijing  Shanghai  and Chongqing is one of four municipalities directly administered by central government. It is also an important port and has emerged in recent years as a hub of highend manufacturing of  China.  The  survey  was  conducted  by  local  partners  in  three  locations  and  data  were collected  from  151  SMEs  and  10  financial  institutions.  The  basic  characteristics  of  the sample were as follows. The size distribution of SME in the sample is consistent with the first  survey.  There  was  only  one  micro  enterprise.    SMEs  with  100199  employee  had biggest share in the sample accounting for 35% followed by SMEs with 200+ and 5099 employees 25% of the total respectively. SMEs with 649 employees accounted for 13%.   The survey once again demonstrated that the size of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SMEs measured by number of employees is consistently larger than their foreign counterparts.         \\xc2\\xa0354 \\x0cFigure 1.

Industry  distribution  of  SMEs  was  as  follows;  70%  of  SMEs  were  in  the  targeted industries of this survey namely garment and textiles automobile and parts and electronics electrical and machinery which account for 21.8% 3.4% and 44.9% respectively. Clearly quite a large number of SMEs are concentrated in the electrical electronics and machinery sectors  consistent  with  the  industrial  structure  of  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  economy.  The  remaining  30% were mostly in the service and building materials sectors (see Figure 2).  Figure 2.    Industry Distribution of SMEs  Garment and TextilesAutomotives3.4 Electrical ElectronicmachineOther 29.9 21.8 44.9 Source Authors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 calculation based on the survey data. \\xc2\\xa0355 \\x0c In the sample 36.1% of SMEs were less than 5 years old 28.7% were aged between 69 years and those older than 10 years accounted for 35.2%. So almost two thirds of the SMEs were younger than 10 years. And the smaller the SME the younger the SME. The average age of SMEs with less than 50 employees was about 6 years while the average age of those with more than 50 employees was 11 years.    Figure 3.

Most  SMEs  in  the  sample  were  domestically  owned  while  17%  were  wholly  or partially owned by foreign investors. Government ownership was rare; only two cases in the sample had government equity.  2. 2.  Economic Model and Regression Analysis In  this  section  we  will  reveal  the  source  of  SME  financing  and  explore  the  major factors  or  the  characteristics  of  SMEs  that  the  financial  institutions  weigh  most  in  their financing  decisions.  We  will  first  use  the  descriptive  statistics  to  tentatively  identify  the important  factors or  characteristics then  employ  a  logit regression to  test  the conclusion again where applicable.     \\xc2\\xa0356 \\x0c2.2.1.  Sources of SME Financing The survey shows that the commercial loan is the single most important source of SME financing. 47.8% of SMEs reported they had used commercial or personal loans and lines of credit from financial institution at some time in the past. Retained earnings were second in importance to commercial loans with 31% of SME having used them. Less than 20% of SMEs used sources of financing other than commercial loans and retained earnings. Among them the relatively important ones are credit from government lending agencies or grants personal  savings  of  business  owners  loans  from  individuals  unrelated  to  the  firm  and microcredit.  More  than  10%  of  SMEs  had  used  each  of  these  sources.  Lease  financing trade credit owing to suppliers and loans from employees are uncommon in China and less than 10% of SMEs had used each of them. There are different reasons in different cases. Leasing financing usually involves heavy equipment and large scale installations that SME don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t  very  often  use.  The  weak  market  power  of  SMEs  may  explain  the  low  use  of supplier\\xe2\\x80\\x99s credit in China. Loans from employees however may be not as low as the data indicates. In China arrears of employee\\xe2\\x80\\x99s wages are widely reported and this can be seen as a hidden form of loan from employees. In general our findings are consistent with the earlier  studies.  They  once  again  demonstrate  that  banks  remain  the  primary  financing source of SMEs despite the fact that the SME has many difficulties in dealing with banks. Internal  and  informal  financing  are  still  important  and  these  are  part  of  a  wide  social resource that SMEs cannot afford to ignore.    Table 1.

In our sample 82 out of 150 businesses had been created by their owner of which 72 answered the question about the source of startup finance. Although commercial loans were still an important source of financing evidenced by the fact that 44.4% of SMEs had  used  it  the  most  important  source  was  the  personal  savings  of  the  business  owner reported by 50% of SMEs. Retained earning and loans from friends and relatives are also significant;  each  was  used  by  more  than  20%  of  SMEs.  And  the  government  lending agency plays a bigger role than private \\xe2\\x80\\x9cangels\\xe2\\x80\\x9d funds. The proportion of SMEs who used credit from the government lending agency was 15.3% higher than the 9.7% for private \\xe2\\x80\\x9cangels\\xe2\\x80\\x9d funds.  Table 2.

What  factors  or  characteristics  of  SMEs  are  crucial  for  the  result  of  their  financing request? This section is devoted to identifying these factors and characteristics. There is a long list of potential characteristics or factors that matter and we aimed to test age size type  costs  of  finance  collateral  firm  lifecycle  growth  of  sales  owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  net  worth and gender management experience labor productivity and innovation capability.   Age and life cycle of SME. It is expected that the younger the SME the more likely it is to be refused by a financial institution due to lack of a record of credibility and proven \\xc2\\xa0358 \\x0cperformance. The data seem to support this argument. The average age of SME who had ever been declined by a financial institution was 7.5 years younger than the average age of 9  of  those  had  not.  However  the  difference  is  only  1.5  years  which  is  not  substantial. Comparing  the  average  ages  of  those  who  had  never  made  financing  requests  and  those who had leads to similar conclusions they are 7.8 and 8.5 respectively. The result from the logit model confirms that the age of an SME is a factor that affects the likelihood of its access to financing as the probability of being refused by a financial institution decreases when the age of the SME increases.    Table 3.

In our sample each SME could identify itself only in 3 out of 5 stages of a life cycle; say fast growth slow growth and maturity. The statistics show the mature SME enjoyed the best financing probability with the lowest proportion being refused and the highest proportion getting fully authorized financing. SMEs in the slow growth stage suffered most in getting financing  with  the  highest  proportion  being  refused  and  the  lowest  proportion  obtaining fully authorized financing. SMEs in fast growth were in between. The result of the logit model also suggests that the lifecycle of an SME is a strong factor in SME financing. This conclusion is consistent with earlier studies.   Table 4 .

It  is  reasonable  to  assume  that  the  size  of  an  SME  would  matter significantly  for  access  to  financing.  Not  surprisingly  our  survey  data  shows  this.  For SMEs  with  less  than  200  employees  the  proportion  of  SMEs  who  had  been  refused  by financing institutions was 2033%. This proportion declined to 15% if the enterprise had more  than  200  employees.  For  those  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdiscouraged\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  SMEs  defined  as  those  who  never made a financing request size matters even more. The proportions of discouraged SMEs declines  significantly  with  growing  size.  One  third  of  SMEs  with  50  and  fewer     employees had never made  a  financing  request  while only one tenth  of  enterprises  with 200  and  more  employees  had  never  made  a  financing  request.  The  result  from  the  logit regression also shows that the probability that an SME is refused financing decreases as its size gets larger. The survey of financial institution confirms that SME size matters for its ability to access financing. 6 out 10 banks asked business clients to provide their number of employees or an employment size.

The literature reports that ownership discrimination is a factor responsible for SME financing difficulty. In general the private SME is said to be discriminated against by the stateowned bank sector. Because there are too few governmentowned enterprises in our sample we cannot test this statement directly. However the sample allows us to do a similar comparison between foreign ownership and domestic ownership. The data shows that  having  foreign  ownership  very  much  improved  an  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  probability  of  obtaining external  financing.  The  proportion  of  SMEs  with  foreign  ownership  which  had  not  been refused was 81.8% while domestic counterpart\\xe2\\x80\\x99s probability was only 56.7%. The chance of a foreign owned firm was 0 but for domestic ownership was 20.9%. The proportion of SMEs  whose  loan  requests  were  fully  authorized  tells  the  same  story.  90%  of  foreign funded SMEs obtained full authorization of their financing requests while only 65.3% of the  domestic  firms  received  full  authorization. The difference is  telling.  The logit model confirms  that  foreign  ownership  would  reduce  the  possibility  of  being  denied  access  to financing.  In  conclusion  we  may  not  be  able  to  prove  that  the  private  SME  was discriminated against but clearly foreign ownership is favored by the financial institutions. \\xc2\\xa0362 \\x0cTable 6.

The earlier studies found that different industries suffered different financing  gaps.  Looking  the  proportions  of  SMEs  who  were  refused  recent  financing request  we  cannot  find  a  significant  industry  difference;  all  industries  were  close  to  the average  level.  Looking  at  the  SMEs  who  had  never  made  a  financing  request  however electrical  electronic  and  machinery  show  an  outstandingly  higher  proportion  than  other industries. One third of SMEs from the electrical electronic and machinery industries had \\xc2\\xa0363 \\x0cnever made a financing request contrasting to one tenth and even fewer in the garment and textiles and other industries. The financing difficulty of firms in the electrical electronic and machinery industry is also demonstrated by data on the results on authorization of their latest  financing  request.  Because  most  of  the  latest  financing  request  were  authorized  to some extent we compare those fully authorized to those partially authorized. From table 8 we can see that the electrical electronic and machinery industry has the lowest proportion of fully authorized financing requests and highest proportion of partially authorized. So the survey data tends to suggest that type of business is a factor that matters for SME financing.  Table 8.

International production network (IPN). In the last study we found that being or not being  in  an  international  production  network  would  make  a  big  difference  to  the performance  of  an  SME.  Here  we  can  test  if  being  in  an  IPN  impacts  the  chance  of \\xc2\\xa0364 \\x0cfinancing for an SME. The descriptive statistics seem to suggest that firms in an IPN are on par with those not in an IPN in terms of financing probability This is evidenced by the observation that the frequencies of different financing situations for those in an    IPN and those  not  in  an    IPN  are  roughly  the  same.  However  the  logit  regression  suggests  that being part of an IPN may help an SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financing probability. The conclusion is not very reliable however as it is only significant at the 90% confidence level.    Table 10.

Both theory and empirical evidence show that collateral is very important for SME financing. Our survey result agrees with this. 77.8% of the SMEs who made a financing  request  were  asked  to  provide  collateral  much  higher  than  the  proportions  of SMEs  asked  to  provide  a  guarantee  or  cosignature  which  were  14.1%  and  40.5% respectively.  The  importance  of  collateral  can  also  be  shown  by  analysis  of  the  reasons given for turning down a financing request. The reasons cited by SMEs were insufficient sales income or cash flow insufficient collateral inadequate business plan and poor credit history. Among them insufficient collateral was mentioned far more often than any other reasons.  From  the  perspective  of  the  banks  however  there  was  little  difference  in  the importance of collateral. The data from the financial institution survey show that the banks see  insufficient  sales  income  and  poor  credit  history  as  more  important  reasons  than insufficient collateral for turning down an SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financing request.

Innovation Capability. When technology capability is measured by R&D spending and number of patents its relationship with financing probability is not clear. Although SMEs which  were  not  refused  by  a  financial  institution  have  higher  R&D  spending  relative  to their sales SMEs with fully authorized financing had a lower percentage of R&D spending. This inconsistency is also found in the relationship of the number of patents and financing probabilities.  The  logit  model  result  suggests  that  R&D  spending  tends  to  positively correlate with the probability of getting financing while the number of patents does not. The reason for this may be that the quality of patents themselves is not high. In China the majority of patents are reportedly awarded to applications that make changes to a product\\xe2\\x80\\x99s appearance rather than to its function.   \\xc2\\xa0366 \\x0cTable 13.

Activities  which  Improve  Business  Capability.  Do  activities  which  improve  business capability help an SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financing chances? The data show that it depends on what kind of activities  the  SME  has  adopted.  The  activities  that  help  are  meeting  an  international standard  establishing  new  divisions  or  a  new  plant  introducing  new  knowhow  in production methods and introducing new products or services. The SMEs carrying out these activities have a much lower proportion of refusal by financial institutions than those not \\xc2\\xa0367 \\x0cdoing so.  The biggest difference  was found in new products or service introduction. For those  SMEs  introducing  new  products  or  services  the  proportion  of  refusal  was  10.7% compared to 35.3% for those not doing so. Activities such as introducing ICT buying new machines  or  facilities  with  new  functions  in  the  operation  or  improving  existing machines  equipment  or  facilities  do  not  reduce  the  SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  probability  of  being  refused financing. These activities seem too common to serve as a signal of excellence. The logit model also confirms this conclusion as shown in figure 10.  Table 15.

Sales and sales growth are important indicators of an SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s performance.  However  the  data  suggest  that  they  have  quite  different  impacts  on  the SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  financing.  Sales  seems  not  play  an  important  role  in  the  financial  institutions\\xe2\\x80\\x99 decision making. The 2008 data consistently suggest that SMEs with low sales are more likely to get financing. The 2009 data however present a contradictory relationship. While those  who  received  full  authorization  have higher  sales  than  those  receiving  only  partial authorization those who had never been refused by a financial institution had lower sales than those who  had been  refused. The  logit  regression however  fails  to  find  significant relationships between the probability of financing and sales in both 2008 and 2009. We tend to believe that sales is not an important factor of concern for financial institutions.  Table 16.

In  both  2008  and  2009  and  for  both  full  and partial loan authorization the data consistently suggest the financial institutions prefer high growth SMEs. The differences in average sales growth are notably large.  Table 17.

The logit model confirmed the significance of sales growth in loan decision making. As  shown  in  the  Figure  11  the  probability  of  being  refused  by  financial  institution decreases as sales growth increases.   Figure 11.

Its  profit  is  a  very  important  gauge  of  a  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  performance.  We  tested  the relationship between the accessibility of financing to an SME and its profit as percentage of sales.    The descriptive statistics indicate that the chance of access to financing of an SME is more related to recent profit performance than to the more distant past. The profits of 2009  of  those  not  refused  financing  and  those  with  full  authorization  are  consistently higher than the profits of those refused or with limited access to financing. However their 2008 profit does not signal well their chance of financing. Those with full authorization did have lower profits than those with partial authorization. The logit regression also finds that the  profit of  2009  was  a  significant  factor in  explaining  the  probability of  being  refused financing. So we tend to accept that the latest profit is the factor that financial institutions give weight to.  Table 18.

Productivity. Here we measure productivity in terms of sales per employee. The SMEs with the  full  amount of  their  loan requests  authorized or  at  least not refused had  much higher  productivity  than  those  with  partial  authorization  or  outright  refusal.  This  may suggest  that  productivity  is  an  important  factor  in  SME  financing.  However  the  results from  the  logit  model  reject  this  hypothesis.  The  pronounced  differences  of  productivity were due to outliers. Productivity growth also proved not to be a critical factor in deciding the probability of getting financing.    Table 19.

Age and Sex of Owner. While the average age of owners receiving full authorization was  higher  than  those  who  got  partial  authorization  the  average  age  of  owners  whose \\xc2\\xa0372 \\x0cfinancing requests were not refused was lower than those refused. In both cases the age differences  were  small  however.  So  the  results  of  the  descriptive  statistics  were inconclusive. However the logit regression result tends to indicate that the age of owner plays a role in the decisionmaking of financial institution. In terms of gender it looks as if the  female  owner is  slightly  favored by  financial  institutions. However  due  to the small number of female owners  in  the  sample  (only  11)  the result  is not  reliable.  We tend to think  the  sex  does  not  play  a  significant  role  in  the  financing  decisions  of  financial institutions or at least that females are not discriminated against.    Table 20.

Management  Experience  of Owner.  The  data  consistently  suggest  that  the  owners  of SMEs who get full authorization or at lease are not refused by financial institutions have longer management experience. The difference is quite small however. The result of the logit  regression  also  supports  the  conclusion  reached  from  the  descriptive  statistics.  The management experience of the owner may therefore play a role in the financing decision.    Table 22.

The  proportion  of  those  refused  financing  was  40%  among  SME owners with less than $1 million personal wealth and 19% among those with more than $1 million. And the proportion of fully authorized financing was 53.8% among SME owners with less than $1 million personal wealth and 65% among those with more than $1 million. These distinctive differences tend to suggest that personal wealth is an important factor for accessibility of financing to the SME. The result from the logit regression agrees with this conclusion.

Discussion of the Result The survey shows that commercial loans are the single most important financing source for  SME  operations.  And  that  the  owner\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  personal  saving  is  the  most  frequently  used source for the startup of an SME. This conclusion is generally in line with earlier surveys. Most financing is intended for use as working capital followed by growth of the business and  purchase  of  machinery  and  equipment.  The  financing  is  also  used  for  R&D expenditure  which  ranked  fourth.  In  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  case  the  financing  is  seldom  used  for purchase  of  vehicles  debt  consolidation  or  purchasing  a  business  (see  table  25).  SMEs frequently  need  financing  evidenced  by  the  fact  that  80%  of  SMEs  had  ever  made  a financing request but only 58.7% of SMEs had used just one kind of external financing. \\xc2\\xa0376 \\x0cThe difference shows that there is still a financing gap for SMEs. And the survey confirmed again  that  lack  of  financing  is  a  serious  problem  for  the  growth  of  SMEs  in  China. Obtaining financing ranked fourth in Table 26. However if we consider the fact that some obstacles listed here are either an integral part of a market economy such as competition or are  rather  short  term  problems  such  as  rising  business  costs  the  financing  difficulty  is second only to lack of qualified labor in terms of seriousnessness.    Table 25.    Which of the Following Obstacles are Serious Problems for the Growth of your Business?

Other purpose Source Authors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 calculation based on the survey data.  \\xc2\\xa0377 14 0 3 28 60 25 0 3 0 46 1 \\x0cThe empirical studies reveal that financial institutions favor SMEs with certain specific characteristics which then have more chance of access to financing. The characteristics that matter include size age ownership lifecycle type of business collateral and whether the firm  is  in  or  not  in  an  international  production  network.  Certain  characteristics  of  the owners of SMEs such as age personal wealth and management experience are also related to the probability of financing. The capabilities of SMEs are taken into account by financial institutions.  The  survey  shows  that  the  SMEs  which  spend  more  on  R&D  have  met  an international standard have established new divisions or new plant have introduced new knowhow in production methods and introduces new products or services are more likely to  gain  access  to  financing.  In  theory  performance  should  be  an  important  factor  that financial institutions look for most. The survey does find the sales growth and latest profit strongly  affect  the  chance  of  getting  financing.  However  other  performance  indicators such as sales and productivity are not found helpful for SME financing.          3. SMEs Policy Support  3.1.  General In  the  past  ten  years  SME  policy  has  gradually  taken  front  seat  in  the  government agenda. As SME Promotion Act was promulgated in 2002 and several other major policy initiatives have been announced China has established a policy framework to support SME development. The major items of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SME policy include   Creating an enabling environment in which SMEs can fairly compete with big business and  be  treated  equally.  The  discrimination  against  SMEs  should  be  eliminated.  The accesses  of  SMEs  to  sectors  previously  open  only  to  stateowned  business  is  to  be expanded.   Mitigating  the  difficulties  of  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  access  to  financing.  Incentives  have  been established  to  encourage  the  financial  institutions  to  increase  their  SME  financing. \\xc2\\xa0378 \\x0cReorganization of the banking sector has been carried out to allow small communitybased banks  to  grow.  And  an  SME  board  in  the  stock  market  has  been  established  to  expand SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to equity financing. A government guarantee program has been launched to reduce the exposure of banks when making loans to SMEs. The credibility of information systems has been strengthened to help the banking sector better identify SME risks.   Increasing fiscal support to SMEs. Both central and local government have established SME development funds in order to support innovation restructuring and employment by SMEs.  SMEs  are  entitled  to  more  tax  reductions  in  economic  hard  times.  The  fees  and levies collected from SMEs have been rechecked and reduced to ease the burden on SMEs. SMEs  should  also  enjoy  preference  in  the  government  procurement  market  and  a  grace period for contribution to the Social Security Fund. Speeding up the technological progress and restructuring of SMEs. The SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 R&D activities  are  to  be  encouraged.  Upgrading  of  technology  and  the  introduction  of  new methods of production and new products may be partly financed by government programs. Accelerated  depreciation  is  allowed  to  support  the  use  of  new  equipment.  Cooperation between big and small enterprises and the clustering of SMEs are encouraged. Expanding market access for SMEs. SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 expenses for participating in trade fairs can be  partly  reimbursed  by  government.  SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99  use  of  export  credit  has  been  increased  to expand  their  access  to  the  international  market.  The  use  of  the  ecommerce  is  being encouraged to help SMEs access a wider market with lower costs.   Strengthening  and  improving  service  to  SMEs.  The  government  encourages  the development of the institutions and networks that provide professional services to SMEs.   Infrastructure  such  as  public  platforms  for  testing  quality  inspection  incubators  and information network will be improved for better service to SMEs. The regulatory system will be examined to reduce red tape. Improving  the  management  of  SMEs.  The  consultancy  service  for  management  of SMEs will be strengthened. A governmentsponsored training program has been launched to improve the policy and regulation literacy and the skills of marketing client service and \\xc2\\xa0379 \\x0cmanagement. The program plans to train 1 million managers of high growth SMEs in three years. Promoting  the  use  of  IT.  A  program  to  promote  the  use  of  IT  by  SMEs  has  been implemented  on  a  pilot  basis.  The  introduction  of  IT  is  expected  to  improve  the  R&D management manufacturing and services of SMEs. The IT sector is encouraged to provide platforms  and  solutions  for  SMEs  equipping  the  SMEs  with  hardware  and  software outsourcing and other services. Strengthening policy coordination. A  state  council leading  group  for SMEs  has been created to strengthen policy planning and coordination. Statistics relating to SMEs will be improved to better serve policymaking. And a monitoring risk prevention and prewarning system  will  be  put  into  place  to  ensure  that  policy  can  promptly  respond  to  changing situations. Compared  to  the  policy  index  developed  by  the  OECD  we  find  that  China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  SME policy covers all important areas. In most policy items China scores 3 or above showing that a sound policy framework has taken shape. However in the field of entrepreneurship education online access and topclass small business support China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s policy is still weak. And another big problem of China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s SME policy is enforcement. It remains the case that many policies remain on paper and are not delivered on the ground.    Table 27.

Access to the Finance   Policy  to  mitigate  the  financing  difficulties  of  SMEs  has  long  been  central  to government SME policy. The major policy initiatives on SME financing include Motivating the financial institutions to make more loans to SMEs. A risk compensation fund has been created to subsidize the SME business of financial institutions and to make up part of any losses from nonperforming loans (NPL). The regulations on bad loans have also changed to allow the financial institutions easily to `write off NPLs and not to hold bank staff personally to account if he or she proves due diligence.   Reorganization of the banking sector has been carried out to allow small community based banks to grow. The private sector can launch or sponsor small financial institutions such  as  village  and  town  banks  credit  companies  etc.  The  participation  of  the  private sector in restructuring rural and urban credit unions is now encouraged. The big banks are required to set up departments dedicated to SME financing.   Developing  financing  products  tailor  to  the  needs  of  SMEs.  The  problem  of  lack  of collateral should be properly addressed. The range of assets qualified as collateral needs to be expanded to include property receivables equity intellectual property inventory etc.       Increasing SME access to direct financing. The SME board of the stock market was established to expand SME access to equity financing. The number of SMEs listed in the stock  market  will  be  increased.  The  development  of  venture  capital  leasing  financing pledge financing and trust financing is also encouraged. The issuance of SME corporate bonds will be increased.   Improving  the  credit  guarantee  system  for  SMEs.  A  multilayer  guarantee  fund  and organization jointly sponsored by central and local government and the business sector has been launched to reduce the exposure of banks when making loans to SMEs. The guarantee organization should be entitled to the preferential tax treatment and regulatory requirement Insurance companies are to be encouraged to develop insurance products for SMEs. Strengthening  the    credibility  information  system  to  help  the  banking  sector  better identify SME risks. An SME credibility system has been built to collect and evaluate the credibility information of SMEs. The system is easily accessed by financial institution. A \\xc2\\xa0381 \\x0c\\xe2\\x80\\x9cpunish and reward\\xe2\\x80\\x9d mechanism should be put into place to foster a culture of honesty so as to enhance the credibility of SMEs.   4. Conclusion and Policy Recommendations    Although  many  policy  initiatives  have  been  put  forward  and  macro  financial conditions  are  favorable  SMEs  still  suffer  from  difficulties  of  financing.  The  financial institutions  remain  the  major  channel  of  SME  financing  and  they  are  quite  selective  in approving  the  financing  requests  of  SMEs.  Basically  the  financial  institutions  give preference to older larger and faster growing SMEs in specific types of business. The good background of an SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s owners helps also. An experienced wealthier and older owner of an SME is more trusted by financial institutions. Other factors matter too. For instance if SMEs have collateral or participate in international production networks their chances to getting  financing  are  improved.  The  financial  institutions  also  favor  SMEs  with  strong innovation and business capability and good performance. The selectiveness of financial institutions  is  reasonable  given  their  nature  as  profitseeking  commercial  bodies.  This shows that the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cfinancing gap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d faced by an SME is partly due to the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cdevelopment gap\\xe2\\x80\\x9d of the  SME.  It  infers  that  along  with  the  development  of  the  SME  its  financing  situation would be improved even without policy intervention.   But  there  are  financing  difficulties  coming  from  drawbacks  inherent  in  the  financial system or institution framework requiring the intervention of policy. In China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s case there are several policy areas that are particularly important. First China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s big bank dominated financial  system  exacerbates  the  problem  of  asymmetry  of  information.  Small  financial institutions should be developed to be in proximity to SMEs. Financial sector liberalization therefore  needs  to  be  expedited.  Barriers  to  the  private  sector\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  participation  should  be eliminated.  Second  the  excessive  risk  aversion  of  financial  institutions  toward  SME financing  needs  to  be  corrected.  The  Asian  financial  crisis  alarmed  the  Chinese government  and  in  consequence  it  began  to  tackle  NPL  problems  very  seriously.  As  a \\xc2\\xa0382 \\x0cresult the banking sector has taken a very conservative stance in risk control when dealing with the private sector and SMEs even though the economic situation has now changed. To alleviate  the  SME  financing  situation  a  little  more  risktaking  by  banks  should  be encouraged. Third China should take bolder steps to develop direct financing for SMEs. Among other things private equity (PE) is now a booming business in China as more and more  wealthy  people  seek  high  returns  from  their  assets.  The  SME  sector  has  the opportunity to benefit from the private equity investor. A favorable regulatory environment and fair competition should be established for the development of direct financing. Fourth the  credibility  gap  of  SMEs  needs  to  be  addressed.  Government  should  facilitate  the collection  and  dissemination  of  the  credit  records  of  SMEs.
