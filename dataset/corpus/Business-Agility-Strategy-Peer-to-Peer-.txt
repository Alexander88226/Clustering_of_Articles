This study is intended to illustrate the business agility strategy of Fintech companies which perform peertopeer lending. The method used in this study is qualitative research with descriptive approach. The data collection technique applied is by literature study. The result shows that P2P lending companies have already done a business agility strategy to grab their customers in the era of digital finance in Indonesia.

INTRODUCTION The rapid development of technology eliminates limitations and opens up various business opportunities. The internet has the potential to connect everyone and everything. A  competitive  business  environment  causes  new  companies  or  startups  to  develop  a strategy to dominate the market which will drive the need for business agility. Fintech startups use this opportunity to grab the market. Every company needs to make an agile action to support its adaptability. Agility is the core of the fundamental requirement of all Fintech  startups  to  succeed. According  to  Dove  (2001)  agility  derives  from  both  the physical ability to act (responsive ability) and the intellectual ability to find appropriate things to perform (knowledge management). The technology also influences the financial industry in which the era of financial literacy  is  coming.  Transformation  in  technology  triggered  by  many  companies  has changed their platform to business digitalization (Hendriyani & Raharja 2018).  Fintech comes to simplify all financial affairs with a wider reach through a collaboration between government banks institutions ecommerce startup and telecommunication. With the emergence of the Fintech era startup companies can take a banking role in managing finance.  Fintech  in  Indonesia  is  growing  to  Fintech  3.0  in  which  many  independent   Copyright \\xef\\x9b\\x99 2019 GMP Press and Printing (http//buscompress.com/journalhome.html) ISSN 23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)  \\x0cReview of Integrative Business and Economics Research Vol. 8 Supplementary Issue 4  240 technology companies (startups) join the financial market. Fintech has a big market in Indonesia because based on Indonesia Fintech Association it is only 36% of Indonesian people who have bank accounts and based on DailySocial.id there are still fortynine million SMEs in Indonesia which have never been in contact with a bank. People who use Fintech and specifically have made three transactions or more have greater confidence in the legal protection of financial transaction reliability stability and responsiveness (Paripunyapat & Kraiwanit 2018). Based on Bank of Indonesia (2016) the share of credit to Gross Domestic Product is  only  fulfilled  through  financial  banking  of  34.77%.  This  reflects  that  the  market potential can be taken by PeertoPeer (P2P) Lending which is as much as 65.23% without having to reduce the market share of the banking. It means many Indonesian people are unwilling to deal with the banking process because of its complicatedness no access to a region and lack of knowledge about banking products. A wide Indonesian market has not been fully exploited by the formal financial sector which also shows the magnitude of the potential of Fintech.   P2P lending in Indonesia is a financial innovation armed with platforms that bring together both lenders (investors) and borrowers in a company. P2P lending grows rapidly in a short time and successfully manages transactions with a significant value that can be optimized through a collaboration with banking. Indonesia Fintech Association (2016) states that Fintech players in P2P lending are 17% out of all Fintech players in Indonesia.  Based on the explanation above this study aims at describing the business agility strategy namely peertopeer lending in Fintech startups to raise the market share.   2.  LITERATURE REVIEW 2.1. Strategy Business Agility    The success of a company depends on its strategy design that matches the needs and desires of customers so that the value provided to them increase and they become loyal. The changes in customer paradigm and behavior due to technological developments must be responded as quickly as possible by the company. The word \\xe2\\x80\\x98strategy\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is derived from the Greek word strategos which means the art of war. A strategy should be agile and able to  adapt  to  different  situations  to  maintain  competition  (Eisenhardt  &  Brown  1998). Business agility is a company strategy to succeed in turbulent environments. According to Evans (2002) the following principles describe the forces driving the digital economy which  demands  business  agility.  Business  agility  involves  shaping  technology.  It  is achieved via mbusiness. In addition every business will become an mbusiness so it will drive both business and technology transformation.  Industry  convergence creates new threats and opportunities. Meanwhile Smith and Sidky (2009) say that agile principles should be pursued to embrace change; plan and deliver software frequently; use humancentric  methods;  not  abandon  practices  disciplines  focus  on  collaboration  and communication; achieve technical excellence and engage in customer collaboration. Business  agility  strategy  is  defined  as  an  ability  to  develop  and  to  detect opportunities and threats of a company by using its capability to launch an appropriate response. The company should be able to judge the benefits and risks in initiating action and execute it with competitive speed and success (Hooper et al. 2001; Sambamurthy et al. 2003; Yang and Liu 2012; and Van Oosterhout et. al 2006).  The strategy is the most obvious keystone to have the ability to transform and renew business model strategy. Agility  is  considered  as  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x98thoughtful  and  purposive  interplay\\xe2\\x80\\x99  in  the  part  of  top management between three \\xe2\\x80\\x98metacapabilities\\xe2\\x80\\x99 such as strategic sensitivity leadership Copyright \\xef\\x9b\\x99 2019 GMP Press and Printing (http//buscompress.com/journalhome.html) ISSN 23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)  \\x0cReview of Integrative Business and Economics Research Vol. 8 Supplementary Issue 4  241 the  foundation  of  company  agility unity and resource fluidity (Doz and Kosonen 2010). Agility methods have emerged largely from practices as a response toward complicated managerial controls which seek to address the socalled \\xe2\\x80\\x98software crisis\\xe2\\x80\\x99 (Gamad Leticia C 2018). Lin et al. (2005) states that integration  of  system information/technology people business process and facility. The purpose of company agility is to enrich customer and employee satisfaction. An agile company therefore can gain  competitive  advantages  by  providing  lower  operating  costs  satisfying  customer requirements  quickly  introducing  new  products  and  eliminating  nonvalue  added activities (Nzewi and Moneme 2016). lies the in  2.2. PeertoPeer (P2P) Lending Financial technology is an emerging phenomenon for rapid technology. Technology makes customers go online anywhere and change their lifestyle. Fintech is considered as a disruptive innovation because it destroys the conventional market. One of the features in Fintech is PeertoPeer (P2P) lending. It is a new platform of financial transaction that passes a series of conventional intermediary by directly connecting borrowers and lenders (Yum2012). Almost  all  interactions  between  a  lender  and  a  borrower  occur  through website interface where the borrower submits a loan request and the lender chooses to fund that request or not (Larrimore et.al 2011).  Although P2P lending is a profitable business at the moment it has a high risk like asymmetric information and moral hazard of the borrowers (Feng et.al 2015). Feng et al. (2015) also describe the comparison between the traditional loan financing market and the lending market. Tabel  1  The traditional Loan Financing  Market vs Lending Market. Major Aspect Traditional Loan P2P Lending  Financing LowMedium High Yes Interest Rate Loan Amount Collateral/Endorsement Party Involved  Regulation/Supervision Process Risk Transaction Cost  Complex Long Strict Low High Borrower Bank Borrower Lender MediumHigh Low No Platform Loose Simple Fast High Low Sources  Feng et.al 2015 Klafft (2008) confirms that the rules applied in P2P lending are very similar to those in the traditional banking system. Borrowers with weak creditrating who cannot get funding from a traditional bankingsystem are unlikely to apply via P2P lending. According to Milne and Parboteeah (2016) competitive advantages of P2P lending can be grouped in four categories (1) a better rate of return offer than the rate available in bank deposit together with relatively low fee for borrowers; (2) provision of credit to some categories of borrowers that are unable to access to bank lending; (3) a perception that P2P lending is more responsible and having greater social value than conventional banking;  and  (4)  finally  technical  innovation  that  improves  the  quality  and  speed  of Copyright \\xef\\x9b\\x99 2019 GMP Press and Printing (http//buscompress.com/journalhome.html) ISSN 23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)  \\x0cReview of Integrative Business and Economics Research Vol. 8 Supplementary Issue 4  242 service to both borrowers and lenders.  P2P lending quickly spreads globally because of rapid technology.    3.  METHOD The method used in this study was qualitative research with descriptive approach.

Tabel 3  PeertoPeer (P2P) Lending   P2P Lending Company KoinWorks  Amartha Investree  Crowdo  Modalku Author & Concept Milne  and Parboteeah (2016) P2P Lending low fees provision  of credit to some categories social value quality speed service s and of Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes Yes No Yes Yes Yes No  Yes Yes Yes No Yes Sources  Results of the researcher\'s analysis(2017)  Table 3 show that from the perspective of Milne and Parboteeah (2016) all P2P lending companies have done various actions to increase the competitive advantage with a lower fee than traditional banking giving provision of credit for individual and company such as the loan for a new startup and more pace in the process. However out of five P2P lending companies it is just Amartha which really focuses on social value by targeting the customer to women who have a micro business.   5.  CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTION 5.1. Conclusion P2P  lending  companies  have  a  big  opportunity  in  Indonesia  because  Indonesian Copyright \\xef\\x9b\\x99 2019 GMP Press and Printing (http//buscompress.com/journalhome.html) ISSN 23041013 (Online); 23041269 (CDROM); 24146722 (Print)  \\x0cReview of Integrative Business and Economics Research Vol. 8 Supplementary Issue 4  245 people  who  have  bank  account  only  36%  of  the  population.  Lifestyle  change  and affordable technology are key developments. P2P lending companies have a more mobile and agile capability because there are not many binding government rules yet. Innovation and  differentiation  and  their  convenience  are  the  driving  force  for  enhancing competitiveness and dominating market share.  5.2. Suggestion As  a  new  product  on  the  market  P2P  lending  companies  must  improve  their communication program and create continuous education programs to increase customer trust. The government as the regulator is expected to continue to support the growth of P2P lending company in order to grow and help to disseminate the P2P lending program as a program that gets support from the government. P2P  lending  company  as  a  startup  company  should  improve  an  aggressive collaboration to grow and always improve fast response with customer engagement.
