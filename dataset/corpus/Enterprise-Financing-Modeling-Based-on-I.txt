would raise interest rate low one return symmetry also reduce cost second credibility reflect objectively people stereotype scale would poor credibility low index fact plenty lack good reputation therefore screen mechanism would safeguard right low index screen relief screen chance would place find deficiency improvement favor investor one hand enhance credibility reduce default hand improve corporate governance structure necessary disclosure avoid reverse choice investor screen dialectical first choose transparent reason investor take adverse selection face unknown group screen different could quantify compare transparency investor could positive choice accord characteristic second minimization transparency choice investor would much objective fair generally index would win favor investor financier compete improve quality probability moral hazard would decline rapidly addition performance capacity index satisfactory default would also maintain low level conclusion application screen would change original lemon financier accurate timely disclosure private investor could well grasp objective choice due improvement symmetric original adverse selection moral hazard reduce
