b'herein file     INTERNATIONAL FINANCIAL ARCHITECTURE  FOR STABILITY AND DEVELOPMENT/ CRYPTOASSETS AND FINTECH Mind the gap Making Basel standards work for developing countries Thorsten Beck (Cass Business School) Emily Jones (University of Oxford) Peter Knaack (University of Oxford)  March 14 2019   Abstract International  banking  regulations  are  developed  by  a  small  group  of financial  regulators  largely  from  advanced  economies.  Offthe  shelf adoption  of  these  standards  in  developing  countries  particularly  low and  lowermiddle  income  countries  poses  substantial  costs  and  risks. Yet many regulators are pressing ahead with them nevertheless partly due to concerns about reputation and competition. We explain why in today   s  world  of  globalised  finance  regulators  cannot  simply  ignore international  standards  even  if  they  are  illsuited  to  their  regulatory environment. We propose ways that the international policy community can move from a minimalist    do no harm    approach to actively designing international  standards  that  are  genuinely  useful  for  low  and  lowermiddle income countries and support financial sector development.   International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech   Challenge   Challenge International Banking Standards Pose Challenges for LMICs and introduce requirements Designed in the wake of the Global Financial Crisis the Basel III reforms tighten capital and macroprudential tools. These reforms were agreed upon by the 28 members of the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  (hereafter     Basel  Committee   ) representing  major  advanced  and  emerging  economies.  Basel  standards  are designed to address financial risks emanating from large complex banks with international operations. requirements liquidity While in principle only member countries are obliged to adopt and implement Basel standards many nonmembers are moving to implementing them. As at 2015 90 out of 100 surveyed nonmember jurisdictions were implementing or preparing  to  implement  aspects  of  Basel  II while  81 were  implementing  or preparing  to  implement  aspects  of  Basel  III  (FSI  2015).  It  is  striking  that regulators  in  many  low  and  lowermiddle  income  countries  (LMICs)  are implementing international standards even though their jurisdictions feature simpler banking systems and different financial risk profiles. Overall the available evidence suggests that while there are strong arguments for strengthening the regulation of banks in LMICs it is far from clear that the Basel standards are the most effective approach (Barth and Caprio 2018). The implementation of Basel II and III poses particular challenges for LMICs1     Financial infrastructure gaps. Even the simpler components of Basel II and III presume a degree of financial development and the existence of infrastructure that is not in place in many LMICs. For instance the standardised approach to credit risk under Basel II relies on credit rating agencies but many LMICs do not have national ratings agencies and the penetration of global ratings agencies is                                                       1 There is a substantial literature. See for example (Beck 2018b 2018a; Beck et al. 2011; Fuchs LosseMueller and Witte 2013; Gobat Yanase and Maloney 2014; GriffithJones and Gottschalk 2016; Louis A. Kasekende 2015; L. A. Kasekende Bagyenda and Brownbridge 2012; Murinde 2012; Murinde and Mlambo 2010; Powell 2004; RojasSuarez 2018; RojasSuarez and Muhammad 2018; Stephanou and Mendoza 2005)   2  International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech   limited to the largest corporations. Poor match for financial stability threats. Basel II and III address financial risks that may be of little relevance in the simpler financial systems of LMICs such as counterparty risk for derivatives exposures or liquidity mismatches arising from wholesale funding. Conversely they may not adequately address key macroeconomic threats to financial stability in LMICs such as volatility in crossborder capital flows and large swings in global commodity prices. Human and Financial Resource Constraints. Implementing Basel II and III imposes significant adjustment costs onto both banks and regulators. The costs derive not from regulatory stringency    capital requirements in most LMICs are higher than Basel III     but from the complexity of Basel rules. The implementation of the new global standards exacerbates regulatory resource constraints that are already significant in many LMICs. Exacerbated information asymmetry. In many LMICs remunerative differences and brain drain to the private sector already pose challenges for regulatory authorities. Information asymmetries may be exacerbated when the more complex elements of Basel II and III are implemented widening the scope for regulatory arbitrage. Distorted regulatory agenda. Implementing Basel II and III may take scarce resources away from other priority tasks of the regulatory agency. Implementation of Basel II/III does not necessarily address underlying weaknesses in the regulatory system. As designed international standards embody a complex regulatory regime not necessarily a strong one. Deterioration of credit composition. Banks that implement Basel II and III may have an incentive to shift their portfolio away from sectors of the economy that are key for inclusive economic development. For instance higher risk weights for loans to small and medium enterprises (SMEs) may not properly reflect the potential benefit of diversification away from a few large enterprises and may discourage financial inclusion. 3                         International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech   Proposal  Why  are  regulators  in  many  LMICs  implementing  international  banking standards despite the challenges they pose? What steps can be taken to ensure that international banking standards are genuinely useful for low and lowermiddle income countries and support financial sector development? The political drivers of implementation A recent research project we led titled "Developing countries navigating global banking standards" combines crosscountry panel analysis and indepth case studies of eleven LMICs across Africa Asia and Latin America. It examined the political economy of Basel II/III adoption and provides important insights into the  factors  that  explain  why  or  why  not  regulators  in  developing  countries adopt and implement international regulatory standards. Politicians and regulators in small developing countries particularly those with nascent  financial  sectors  are  often  looking  to  attract  international  capital maintain  (or  attain)  investment  grade  ratings  from  international  ratings agencies and stay on good terms with international financial institutions like the  IMF.  Our  research  shows  how  this  generates  powerful  reputational  and competitive  incentives  that  lead  regulators  to  adopt  international  standards even when they are illsuited to their local  context. We find that regulators in developing countries do not merely adopt Basel II/III because these standards provide  the  optimal  technical  solution  to  financial  stability  risks  in  their jurisdictions. Instead regulatory decisions are also driven by concerns about reputation and competition (Jones 2019; Jones and Zeitz 2017). We find that the following factors are important drivers of Basel II/III adoption in LMICs     Signalling to international investors. Incumbent politicians may adopt Basel standards in order to signal sophistication to foreign investors. For example in Ghana Rwanda and Kenya politicians have advocated the  implementation  of  Basel  II  and  III  and  other  international   4  International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech                   financial  standards  as  part  of  a  drive  to  establish  financial  hubs  in their countries. Reassuring  host  regulators.  Banks  headquartered  in  LMICs  may endorse Basel II or III as part of an international expansion strategy as they seek to reassure potential host regulators that they are wellregulated  at  home.  We  see  this  at  work  in  Nigeria  where  large domestic  banks  have  championed  Basel  II/III  adoption  at  home  as they  seek  to  expand  abroad.  Their  fervour  has  been  met  with reluctance among regulators who fear that a rapid regulatory upgrade may put weaker local banks in jeopardy. Facilitating homehost supervision. Adopting international standards can  facilitate  crossborder  coordination  between  supervisors.  In Vietnam for example regulators were keen to adopt Basel standards as  their  country  opened  up  to  foreign  banks  to  ensure  they  had  a    common language    to facilitate the supervision of the foreign banks operating in their jurisdiction. Peer  learning  and  peer  pressure.  Even  while  acknowledging  the shortcomings of Basel II and III LMIC regulators often describe them as  international     best  practices     or     the  gold  standard       and  there  is strong peer pressure in international policy circles to adopt them. In the  West  African  Economic  and  Monetary  Union  (WAEMU)  for example  regulators  at  the  supranational  Banking  Commission  are planning an ambitious adoption of Basel II and III with the support and encouragement of technocratic peer networks and the IMF. Domestic banks  however  have  limited  crossborder  exposure  and  show  little enthusiasm for the regulatordriven embrace of Basel standards. Technical advice from the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank plays an important role in shaping the incentives for politicians and regulators in developing countries. While the Financial Stability Assessment Programmes (FSAPs) are designed to merely evaluate the regulatory environment of client countries against a much more basic set of socalled Basel Core Principles we find evidence that Fund and the  Bank  motivate  regulators  in  LMICs  to  engage  in  Basel  II  and  III adoption in some cases with explicit recommendations.   5  International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech   Steps regulators in LMICs can take What  steps  can  financial  regulators  in  LMICs  take  to  harness  the  prudential reputational  and  competitive  benefits  of  global  banking  standards  while avoiding  the  implementation  risks  and  challenges  associated  with  wholesale adoption? Given the challenges and risks associated with implementing Basel II and III regulators  in  LMICs  face  difficult  choices  and  tradeoffs.  LMIC  regulators  are under pressure to adopt the full suite of international Basel standards in order to signal to regulators in other jurisdictions and to international investors that their  banks  are  soundly  regulated.  Yet  there  are  major  challenges  and  risks associated with implementation. Our  research  highlights  specific  ways  that  LMICs  can  tailor  Basel implementation to their domestic circumstances 1. 2.    Consider the risks of an overly ambitious Basel II/III implementation. Prioritise  key  financial  challenges  and  assess  to  what  extent  Basel implementation  may  exacerbate  reliance  on  credit  rating  agencies information  asymmetry  between  regulators  and  banks  and  the exclusion  of  economic  sectors including  small  and  medium enterprises. Implement  a  selection  of  Basel  components.  Regulatory  agencies outside the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision are not bound by its rules and not subject to peer review procedures. Regulators in the financial periphery can use this freedom to adapt global standards to meet  domestic  regulatory  needs.  Basel  II  and  III  are  in  practice compendia  of  different  standards  so  regulators  can  select  those components  that  are  most  desirable  and  feasible  to  implement. Components vary substantially in the amount of regulatory resources they  require  both  in  the  implementation  and  supervision  phase. Regulators  can  identify  domestic  prudential  needs  and  regulatory capabilities  first  and  then  assess  the  adequacy  of  each  Basel  II/III component in  matching  those  needs  given  existing  capacity 6  International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech   3. 4. constraints. Indeed regulators in nonmember countries are adopting Basel II and III in a highly selective manner. Regulators are more likely to  adopt  the  simpler  Basel  II  standardised  approaches  to  credit market  and  operational  risk  instead  of  muchdisputed  advanced approaches that rely on the use of internal models by banks (Figure 1). Similarly simple components of Basel III such as the new definition of  capital  and  the  leverage  ratio  are  more  popular  than  complex requirements such as the liquidity ratios or the countercyclical buffer (Figure 2). Proportional  rules  implementation.  Regulators  can  refrain  from copying prudential requirements from the Basel II and III rulebook. They  can  use  their  intimate  knowledge  of  the  domestic  financial system to write rules that match local circumstances better than the Basel  template.  In  the  Philippines  for  example  regulators  have adjusted the riskweights for small and medium enterprises to reduce the incentive of banks to move away from lending to these firms Adjust the perimeter of banking regulation. Regulators can adjust the perimeter of banking regulation so that regulations that are aligned with international standards only apply to large internationally active banks  and  simpler  (although  not  necessarily  less  stringent)  rules apply to small domestic banks. This approach is common in countries belonging  to  the  Basel  Committee  (Castro  Carvalho  et  al.  2017).  In looking to modify international standards regulators should tap into the wealth of knowledge among their peers. While regulators in many developing countries look first to international institutions for advice they  should  also  look  to  strengthen  mechanisms  for  peertopeer learning.    7  International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech   Figure  1.  Implementation  of  Basel  II  by  countries  outside  of  the  Basel  Committee  (2015) Source Data from FSI Survey (2015) Figure 2. Implementation of Basel III by countries outside of the Basel Committee (2015) Source Data from FSI Survey (2015)   8   International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech   Steps for the G20 and international policy community While LMIC regulators can tailor the local adoption of global banking standards this  is  not  straightforward    sifting  through  the  full  suite  of  international standards  and  adapting  them  to  fit  the  local  context  is  a  painstaking  and resourceintensive  task.  Rather  than  place  the  burden  of  adjustment  on regulators  in  LMICs  who  face  the  greatest  resource  constraints  the international community can take steps to ensure that international standards are  designed  in  ways  that  support  financial  stability  and  financial  sector development in LMICs. The Financial Stability Board World Bank and IMF explicitly advise countries with  limited  international  financial  exposure  and  supervisory  capacity constraints to    first focus on reforms to ensure compliance with the Basel Core Principles  and  only  move  to  the  more  advanced  capital  standards  at  a  pace tailored to their circumstances    (FSB World Bank and IMF 2011 7). While this advice is wellintentioned it fails to recognise the powerful reputational and competitive  incentives  that  regulators  in  LMICs  face  to  converge  on international  standards  even  when  they  are  illsuited  to  their  national circumstances. Simply telling LMIC regulators politicians and banks to    go slow    on Basel II and III implementation leaves them without a way to credibly signal to  international  investors  and  other  regulators  that  their  banks  are appropriately and effectively regulated. National regulators in LMICs often lack the resources to adapt global standards to national circumstances. Moreover they face the risk having to explain to incumbent politicians why the adapted rules and regulations fall short of    global best practice   . The  core  problem  for  LMICs  is  that  their  interests  are  not  effectively represented when international standards are designed and the international community provides little advice on how to adapt Basel standards for use in LMICs     Development prerogatives remain at the margins of regulatory debates at the Basel Committee. In the wake of the global financial crisis there were  calls  for  international  standards  to  be  simplified  and  to  build proportionality  into  their  design.  But  little  has  changed.  The  Basel   9  International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech   countries Committee  set  up  a  Task  Force  on  Simplicity  and  Comparability  in 2012 and has implemented some of its recommendations such as an output floor for risk weight calculations using internal models. But the Task Force paid no attention to implementation challenges faced by developing countries (BCBS 2013). There have been calls for the Basel Committee  to  build  greater  proportionality  into  the  design  of  its standards. The Basel II Accord of 2004 included a socalled Simplified Standardized Approach to credit risk a regulatory standard that was specifically  designed  with  developing in  mind. Unfortunately the Basel Committee has not engaged in a revision of the  standard  in  line  with  Basel  III  even  though  developing  country comments  in  consultations  consistently  emphasized  the  costs  of complexity  (World  Bank  2015).  A  recent  proposal  to  simplify  the Basel approach to market risk has also been criticized by developing country representatives as still excessively complex (BCBS 2017). LMICs are chronically underrepresented in standardsetting. In 2009 the membership of the Basel Committee was expanded to incorporate representatives from ten emerging market economies of the G20. This opened  up  the  prospect  that  international  standards  would  be recalibrated to work in a wider range of contexts. Yet the incumbent network  of  wellresourced  regulators  from  industrialized  countries continues  to  dominate  the  regulatory  debate  (Chey  2016;  Walter 2016).  The  Basel  Consultative  Group  is  tasked  with  facilitating dialogue  between  members  and  nonmembers  but  few  LMICs  are chronically underrepresented and the Group has little influence over the design of international standards. Hence international standards are  not  designed  with  LMICs  in  mind.  In  the  wake  of  the  global financial crisis the G20 asked standard setting institutions to assess the  implications  of  international  financial  standards  for  developing countries  and  further  open  up  decisionmaking  processes.  The Financial  Stability  Board  created  an  internal  workstream  on  the effects  of  regulatory  reform  on  emerging  market  and  developing economies  (FSB  et  al.  2011)  .  It  also  established  six  Regional Consultative  Groups  but  conversations  with  regulators  give  the impression  that  these  Groups  have  little  input  into  the  design  of 10        International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech           in  global  financial  standards international standards functioning instead as fora for regulators to troubleshoot implementation. Regulators  in  LMICs  have  little  guidance  for  proportional  Basel standards adoption and adaptation. Even though key stakeholders in the global regulatory community have endorsed the proportionality principle implementation  useful guidance for regulators in LMICs is still lacking. Existing publications have  analysed  proportional  implementation  of  Basel  III  among advanced  economies looked  at  unintended  consequences  for emerging  market  G20  members  and  offer  advice  on  the  Basel  Core Principles. But guidance on how to approach proportional Basel II or III  implementation  from  a  development  perspective  has  not  been compiled systematically although the BIS Financial Stability Institute has  taken  important  preliminary  steps  in  this  direction  (Castro Carvalho et al. 2017; Hohl et al. 2018). The  International  Financial  Institutions  do  not  provide  consistent advice regarding Basel II or III implementation. The Financial Sector Assessment Programmes (FSAP) conducted by the Fund and the Bank assess the financial regulatory system of client countries. Our research shows that while assessors explicitly warn against hasty Basel II or III implementation  in  some  LMICs  they  encourage  it  explicitly  or implicitly in others. The Bank and the Fund can do more to encourage a  tailoring  of  global  standards  that  safeguards  financial  stability highlight positive cases of proportional or nonadoption of Basel II and III and facilitate peer learning among developing countries. To address these challenges there are a series of steps that the G20 can take to ensure  that  the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  Financial  Stability Board IMF and World Bank provide support to LMICs 1.  Mandate  the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Standards  to  build  in proportionality into the design of Basel standards. Instead of placing the  burden  of  retrofitting  complex  international  standards  on regulatory  agencies  in  LMICs  proportionality  should  be  hardwired into  international  standards.  International  standards  should  be designed so that they can be readily adapted for use in a wide range of   11  International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech   financial  sectors  at  all  stages  of  development.  Research  by  the  BIS Financial Stability Institute (Hohl et al. 2018) should be expanded to obtain  a  clear  understanding  of  proportionality  in  standards implementation  This  would  enable  LMICs  to  keep  up  with    international  best  practices     in  a  manner  that  is  genuinely  aligned with  their  prudential  regulatory  needs.  The  mandate  of  the  Basel Committee could be broadened beyond an exclusive focus on financial stability  to  recognise  the  importance  of  other  objectives  such  as financial  sector  development  and  financial  inclusion.  Even  bringing these in as secondary considerations would incentivize more careful analysis  in  internationalstandard  setting  (Jones  and  Knaack  2019). Rather  than  waiting  to  see  whether  standards  generate  adverse impacts  on  developing  countries  the  Basel  Committee  could undertake ex ante assessments. Open  the  standardsetting  processes  to  more  meaningful  input  from LMIC  representatives.  At  a  minimum  the  Basel  Consultative  Group should  include  representatives  from  LMICs;  the  Basel  Consultative Group and the FSB   s Regional Consultative Groups could move away from  the  current  topdown  modus  operandi  of  focusing  on  the implementation  of  global  standards  towards  facilitating  bottomup proposals to influence their design. Improve  the  accountability  of  standardsetting  bodies.  A  small multilateral  organisation  could  be  created  to  audit  the  Basel Committee  akin  to  auditorgenerals  in  national  jurisdictions  or  the Independent Evaluation Office of the IMF (Helleiner and Porter 2010). This would help ensure that the Basel Committee decisions robustly reflect  the  views  of  all  members  and  consider  implications  for  nonmembers. Prevent  an  illfated race  to  the  top  among  LMICs  towards  maximum Basel II and III implementation by clarifying under which conditions proportional  or  nonimplementation  of  specific  Basel  II  and  III components is recommended; Recognize  the  signalling  function  of  Basel  standards  as  a  seal  of regulatory quality and devise complementary methods to assess and communicate the quality of prudential financial regulation in LMICs; 12 2. 3. 4. 5.    International Financial Architecture for Stability  and Development/Cryptoassets and Fintech   6. Engage  in  further  research  on  the  repercussions  of  Basel  II/III implementation  for  credit  allocation  in  the  real  economy  and  for financial  inclusion.  The  Financial  Stability  Institute  IMF  and  World Bank  could  invest  greater  resources  in  analysing  international financial  standards  from  the  perspective  of  LMICs  increasing  their dialogue with regulators and making recommendations to the Basel Committee. Rather than focusing on ways to minimise the harm and challenges that international standards pose for developing countries this  research  agenda  should  start  from  the  question  of  what regulations are most needed in peripheral developing countries.
