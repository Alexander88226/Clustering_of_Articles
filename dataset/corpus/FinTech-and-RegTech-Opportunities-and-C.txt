SSRN http//ssrn.com/abstract=2676553 forthcoming Georgetown Journal of International Law Background DefinitionThe term   s origin can be traced to the early 1990s with the    Financial ServicesTechnology Consortium    a project initiated by Citigroup to facilitate technologicalcooperation. However only since 2014 has the sector attracted the focused attentionof regulators consumers and investors.Google Search Trend Interest Over Time Number of Vewsi ImplicationsMain current concerns of policymakers and industry arise not from the technologyitself but from the question of who is applying technology to finance along with thespeed of development.An evolutionary approach to create a framework of understanding is necessary to understand the implications for established financial institutions IT companies startups and regulators alike. FinTech Evolution and Typology EvolutionFinTech is often seen today as the new marriage of financial services and informationtechnology. However this interlinkage has a long history and has evolved over threedistinct time periods.DateEra1866  1967 1967  20082008  CurrentFinTech 1.0FinTech 2.0FinTech 3.0GeographyGlobal / DevelopedGlobal / DevelopedDevelopedKey elementsInfrastructure / Traditional / Mobile / Startups / New entrantscomputerisationinternetShift OriginLinkagesDigitalization2008 financial crisis / Last mover smartphoneadvantageFinTech 3.5Emerging / Developing  FinTech 1.0 (1866     1967)In the late 19th century finance and technology combined to produce the first periodof financial globalization.   The inhabitant of London could order by telephone sipping his morning tea in bed the various productsof the whole earth in such quantity as he might see fit and reasonably expect their early delivery uponhis doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the naturalresources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world and share without exertion or even trouble.

Better to break down highlevel approaches (e.g. risk or productbased) andcomplement them with a subset of specific regulations (eg payments AML).Broadly speaking financial regulators have 4 main mandatesFinancial StabilityConduct & FairnessPrudential RegulationCompetition & Development Regulatory implicationsMany startups use technology to disintermediate banks and directly propose theirservices or products to consumers (eg Telco providing payment services).This creates a set of questions   Increasingly a blurred line    Who can/should provide financial services or products? (eg Telcos orBanks)    How to balance startup low cost models and agility benefits with compliancecosts?    Banking licence restrictions limits business model freedom (eg mobilemoney balance acting as a current account) Regulatory thresholdNew emerging FinTech companies often have limited track records regarding theirbusiness (eg risk management liquidity and profitability) and difficulty identifyingtheir obligations (eg applicable regulations or licences).For regulatorsthese earlystage companies represent a limited prudential &consumer risk. However exponential company growth can create    risk blind spots   .Additionally frequent failures or fraud can impact market or investor confidence.Too Small to CareTacit acceptance Too Large to IgnoreLicensing obligation Too Big   to Fail Risk blindspotsUsing size (eg small large systemic) as a way to evaluate risk is not adequate givenfinancial markets and rapid uptake of certain financialinterconnectedness ofproducts. Today some small companies    path to become systemic is not linear butexponential    Kenya (2008) In three years Mpesa was being used by over 18 million customersand 43% of Kenya   s GDP was flowing thru this service    China (2014) Third party mobile payment market reached 1433 trillion yuan a+400% increase compared to 278 trillion exchanged in 2013    China (2014) Yu   e Bao a money market fund part of Ant Financial Group (Alibaba)held over US$ 90billion (e.g. 4th largest in the world) just 10 months after itscreation New risksNew business models and delivery mechanisms create new sets of risks    P2P platform capital buffers during credit cycle change or interest rate liberalisation    2.5% deposits vs 15% P2P lenders (eg warning over 1250 platforms in China)    Money Market Fund (MMF) maturity mismatch enhanced by technology    Technology facilitation of ondemand redemptions (eg    mobile app bank run   )    Liquidity problems for mobile money agents to meet large withdrawal requests    Can undermine public confidence but also slows scalability of the solution   Scalability of process policies and risk management frameworks    Particularly for companies with exponential growth (eg loan originationquality) Regulatory innovationSince 2008 national and international regulators have been focused on drafting andimplementing reactive regulations covering the causes of the GFC to avoid itsrepetition. However the increased layering of regulations and compliance costfacilitated the emergence of new FinTech startups.There is nonetheless a set of proactive regulations emerging to allow for innovativebusinesses propositions to emerge eg    US Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act 2012 (JOBS Act)     Alternative financing    EU Payment System Directive 2008     Realtime payments    UK Small Business Enterprise and Employment Bill     Loan referral to P2P    HK Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP)    Automated bill payments Institutional changeRegulatory supervision by specialist bodies focused on products appears inadequatewhen looking at the rate of technological progress. This can create grey areas as towhich body should be regulating a specific business (eg insurance companiesperforming banking activities in the US pre2007).Thus financial innovation driven by technology is preferably overseen in the context ofa twin peaks / functional model such as in the UK or Australia. This is particularlyrelevant in jurisdictions that have more a sectoral approach.Product Based ApproachVsFunctional Based Approach(eg United States China Hong Kong)(eg United Kingdom Australia) Recent approaches in AsiaUnlike US and EU where FinTech sector emergence was driven by the private sectorfirst in Asia governments and regulators are often seeking to leadesahP ssenerawASingaporeInvolvement with FinTechAccelerator + consultationAustraliaASIC creates InnovationHub Hong KongSFC on the governmentFinTech Steering GroupSouth Korea Simplifying retail banking licence for tech firmsNew ZealandLifting investment criteria'sfor equity crowdfundingChinaComprehensive strategy esahPevitalsigeL RegTechBlackett Report (UK) government recognizes the new challenges but also opportunitiesbrought by the FinTech sector.
