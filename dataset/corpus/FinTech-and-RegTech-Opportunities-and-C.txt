Better to break down highlevel approaches (e.g. risk or productbased) andcomplement them with a subset of specific regulations (eg payments AML).Broadly speaking financial regulators have 4 main mandatesFinancial StabilityConduct & FairnessPrudential RegulationCompetition & Development\\x0cRegulatory implicationsMany startups use technology to disintermediate banks and directly propose theirservices or products to consumers (eg Telco providing payment services).This creates a set of questions\\xe2\\x80\\xa2Increasingly a blurred line\\xef\\x83\\xa8 Who can/should provide financial services or products? (eg Telcos orBanks)\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 How to balance startup low cost models and agility benefits with compliancecosts?\\xef\\x83\\xa8 Banking licence restrictions limits business model freedom (eg mobilemoney balance acting as a current account)\\x0cRegulatory thresholdNew emerging FinTech companies often have limited track records regarding theirbusiness (eg risk management liquidity and profitability) and difficulty identifyingtheir obligations (eg applicable regulations or licences).For regulatorsthese earlystage companies represent a limited prudential &consumer risk. However exponential company growth can create \\xe2\\x80\\x9crisk blind spots\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.Additionally frequent failures or fraud can impact market or investor confidence.Too Small to CareTacit acceptance Too Large to IgnoreLicensing obligation Too Big   to Fail\\x0cRisk blindspotsUsing size (eg small large systemic) as a way to evaluate risk is not adequate givenfinancial markets and rapid uptake of certain financialinterconnectedness ofproducts.

However the increased layering of regulations and compliance costfacilitated the emergence of new FinTech startups.There is nonetheless a set of proactive regulations emerging to allow for innovativebusinesses propositions to emerge eg\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 US Jumpstart Our Business Startup Act 2012 (JOBS Act) \\xef\\x83\\xa8 Alternative financing\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 EU Payment System Directive 2008 \\xef\\x83\\xa8 Realtime payments\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 UK Small Business Enterprise and Employment Bill \\xef\\x83\\xa8 Loan referral to P2P\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 HK Electronic Bill Presentment and Payment (EBPP)\\xef\\x83\\xa8 Automated bill payments\\x0cInstitutional changeRegulatory supervision by specialist bodies focused on products appears inadequatewhen looking at the rate of technological progress. This can create grey areas as towhich body should be regulating a specific business (eg insurance companiesperforming banking activities in the US pre2007).Thus financial innovation driven by technology is preferably overseen in the context ofa twin peaks / functional model such as in the UK or Australia. This is particularlyrelevant in jurisdictions that have more a sectoral approach.Product Based ApproachVsFunctional Based Approach(eg United States China Hong Kong)(eg United Kingdom Australia)\\x0cRecent approaches in AsiaUnlike US and EU where FinTech sector emergence was driven by the private sectorfirst in Asia governments and regulators are often seeking to leadesahP ssenerawASingaporeInvolvement with FinTechAccelerator + consultationAustraliaASIC creates InnovationHub Hong KongSFC on the governmentFinTech Steering GroupSouth Korea Simplifying retail banking licence for tech firmsNew ZealandLifting investment criteria'sfor equity crowdfundingChinaComprehensive strategy esahPevitalsigeL\\x0cRegTechBlackett Report (UK) government recognizes the new challenges but also opportunitiesbrought by the FinTech sector.\\xe2\\x80\\x9cBig data\\xe2\\x80\\x99 regulatory online reporting and analytics among other technologies could create a newgeneration of UK regulatory technology (RegTech)\\xe2\\x80\\x9dSome other benefits\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Data driven compliance and regulation\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Harmonization of data standards to be shared nationally regionally and globally\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Real time transaction analysis online registration open source compliance systems\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Regulatory policy modelling to simulate impact of new policies before legislating\\x0cLooking Forward\\x0cAPAC investment trendsFinTech startup investment quadrupled within the last 12 month reaching USD$3.5bn.\\x0cAsian fragmentationUnlike the US and EU markets that are more homogeneous in their composition thelimiting the rapid scalability of certain FinTechAsian market remains fragmentedbusinesses (eg crossborder payments).USA 51 JurisdictionsNational RegulationHomogeneous MarketVsAPAC25 JurisdictionsVsEurope 27 JurisdictionsHarmonized RegulationHomogeneous Market25 sets ofbehaviours 25 sets of  regulations25 sets of  infrastructures\\x0cCollaboration or disruption?FinTech covers banks and startups.
