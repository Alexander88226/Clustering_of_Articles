However  the  financing  difficulty  has  largely  contrasted  with  the important  contribution  of  small  and  middle  enterprises  for  the  national  economic  development.  As  viewed  from  the course of the development of small and middle enterprises in the world the financing difficulty of small and middle enterprises in the world has been a true fact. After the financial crisis broke out the financing difficulty of small and middle  enterprises  is  increasingly  being  deepened  and  the  governments  of  various  countries  have  adopted  multiple measures to deal with this problem. In this article by analyzing the different financing modes adopted by US Japan and Euro  countries  under  the  economic  situation  of  financial  crisis  the  proper  financing  mode  in  the  present  economic environment is expected to be found for effectively solving the problem of financing difficulty for small and middle enterprises. Keywords Small and middle enterprise Market economy Financial crisis 1. Small and middle enterprises financing modes of US in the financial crisis 1.1 Analysis of the development of small and middle enterprises financing modes of US US is the representative country which mainly adopts the direct financing mode assisting with indirect financing mode. Because of the economic system and the developed securities market US offers the platform of direct financing for small  and  middle  enterprises.  The  US  Small  Business  Administration  controls  the  constitutions  of  macro  control policies  and  the  investments  of  civil  capitals  for  small  and  middle  enterprises  and  the  government  only  leads  and supervises the financing of small and middle enterprises. 1.1.1 Mode of direct financing (1)  Direct  financing  companies.  The  direct  financing  mode  of  US  means  the  investments  by  the  direct  financing companies  i.e.  the  venture  capital  companies  and  the  attention  of  these  companies  is  to  offer  financing  service  for small and middle enterprise and these companies can acquire the preferential loans below 90 million dollars from the federal government for the development and technical updating of small and middle enterprises. From 1958 to 2007 the investment amount to small and middle enterprises has exceeded 13 billion dollars and the amount of small and middle enterprises which have obtained the investments has exceeded 100 thousands. The main investment target of the venture capital companies includes those small and middle enterprises which have the courage to technical innovation but lack in capital supports and loans. For the development of hightechnical small and middle enterprises the function of these venture capital companies is crucial. (2) Securities financing. Except for the main market of securities trading the capital market of US with the multilayer and  allround  securities  market  and  the  bonds  rating  mechanism  has  the  NASDAQ  market  and  the  counter  trading market which can offer large numerous of opportunities for small and middle enterprise. Because the listing standards are lower than the main board of the stock market and the listing conditions of the counter trading market are looser most rising and growing companies choose to list in the NASDAQ market. 1.1.2 Mode of indirect financing loans from commercial banks The interior accumulation of small and middle enterprises of US occupies 25%~85% in the longterm financing amount and the proportion of commercial financing is not high which is same with the financing of Chinese small and middle enterprises. The difference is that the mode that the US government leads the commercial financing institutions to loan to small and middle enterprise is to offer the guarantee funds by the policy financing institutions of small and middle enterprises. The US government only directly loan to those mall and middle enterprises with strong ability of technical 76  \\x0cInternational Business Research                                                                                                                      January 2010 innovation and good development foreground so the loan volume is very limited. 1.2 Analysis of the financing modes adopted by small and middle enterprises of US in financial crisis When  the  domestic  banks  of  US  are  reluctant  of  lend  for  small  and  middle  enterprises  the  government  adopts  the financing  mode  of  credit  mortgage  guarantee  to  support  small  and  middle  enterprise  and  the  original  policies  are frequently broke. To stimulate the small and middle enterprises of US and reduce the financing difficulty of trading of small  and  middle  enterprises  and  force  the  loan  banks  to  provide  more  powerful  supports  for  small  and  middle enterprises the ExportImport Bank of Washington which is the import credit guarantee institution supported by the government  recently  integrated  FTP  and  SDAP  (Sustainable  Development  Action  Plan)  to  make  the  total  guarantee amount acquired by the loan banks in the original frame to achieve 0.45 billion dollars. This measure of US means that after giving more financing conveniences for small and middle export enterprises the new frame can not only help them to establish reasonable stock repertory system but offer the risk control ability. 2. Small and middle enterprises financing modes of Japan in the financial crisis 2.1 Analysis of the development of small and middle enterprises financing modes of Japan Japan is the first country which constituted the support policies for small and middle enterprises and in the longterm process when small and middle enterprises of Japan could benefit from these support policies the perfect small and middle  enterprises  financing  mode  including  direct  financing  indirect  financing  and  credit  supplement  has  been gradually established. 2.1.1 Mode of direct financing The  capital  cost  paid  by  large  enterprises  for  direct  financing  is  far  less  than  small  and  middle  enterprises  and  the proportion  of  direct  financing  in  the  exterior  financing  of  small  and  middle  enterprises  in  Japan  is  small.  There  are following  sorts.  (1)  Venture  capital  companies.  They  are  invested  by  the  government  civil  institutions  and  local institutions and their responsibility is to invest capitals for small and middle enterprises specially. The venture funds publicly  issues  bonds  to  the  society  which  is  guaranteed  by  the  venture  capital  companies  and  the  venture  capital companies also invest or loan to venture funds. (2) Civil risk investment companies. They are similar with the venture investment  funds  of  US  and  they  are  composed  by  banks  securities  companies  and  guarantee  companies.  (3)  The second board markets (counter trading market JASDAQ market). The establishment of the second board markets of Japan could solve the financing difficulty for Japan small and middle enterprises. 2.1.2 Mode of indirect financing The indirect financing mode not only occupies very important status in the whole financing mode of small and middle enterprises  in  Japan  but  also  is  the  main  form  of  exterior  financing  for  small  and  middle  enterprises  in  Japan.  The governmental financial institutions and the civil financial institutions compose the indirect financing system for small and  middle  enterprises  in  Japan.  The  institutions  which  capitals  or  debt  guarantee  are  offered  by  the  government  is called as the governmental financial institutions and these institutions don\\xe2\\x80\\x99t accept saving in principle but individual financial  institutions  also  accept  a  few  private  capitals  but  their  main  capital  sources  are  from  the  government.  To support  the  development  of  small  and  middle  enterprises  Japanese  government  specially  established  three  financial institutions  serving  for  small  and  middle  enterprises  i.e.  the  financial  treasure  of  small  and  middle  enterprises  the financial treasure of national life and the central treasure of commerce and industry. These three governmental financial institutions are divided and complemented each other and serve for small and middle enterprise from different angles and approaches of financing. The loan transaction is charged by the financial treasure of small and middle enterprises and the financial treasure of national life and the securities investment exchange trading and other diversified services are  charged  by  the  central  treasure  of  commerce  and  industry  and  its  responsibility  is  same  with  other  commercial banks. The cause that small and middle enterprises with bigger scale choose the financial treasure of small and middle enterprises  is  that  the  loans  offered  by  this  institution  emphasize  the  demands  of  small  and  middle  enterprises  with bigger  scale but  small  enterprises  lean  to the  financial  treasure of national  life because  this  institution  can provide small turnover capital loans to maintain the production. The civil financial institution is composed by two departments. The nonprofessional financial institutions are composed by the city bank the local bank and the mutual bank. The bank which develops their businesses surrounding many big cities such as Tokyo Nagoya and Osaka is called as city banks. The business of local bank spreads all over whole Japan and it is closely related with small and middle enterprises and local governments in different regions. The mutual bank is the predecessor of the second local bank which was turned into the common bank in 1989 and its operation inherits the tradition of the mutual bank. 2.1.3 Mode of credit guarantee To  disperse  the  risk  the  doubleguarantee  mode  is  adopted  in  Japan  and  the  credit  guarantee  of  small  and  middle enterprises  is  first  evaluated  by  the  guarantee  operation  association.  The  guarantee  association  which  takes  the guarantee  of  credit  financing  activity  sequence  of  small  and  middle  enterprises  as  the  aim  saves  the  loans  in  the  77\\x0cVol. 3 No. 1                                                                                                                        International Business Research financial  institutions  and  promotes  the  increase  of  the  guarantee  loan  businesses  of  small  and  middle  enterprise  by increasing  the  savings  of  financial  institution.  At  the  same  time  the  guarantee  association  requires  the  financial institutions to reduce the interest rate of guarantee loans by their savings in it. 2.2 Analysis of the financing modes adopted by small and middle enterprises of Japan in financial crisis In the financial crisis Japan used the mode combining the credit guarantee mode with the civil loan mode to relieve the financing difficulty of small and middle enterprises. The halfyear report of Japanese policy financial treasure showed that because the business of its main operation object small and middle enterprises is deteriorated in the financial crisis in the first half year after this financial institution is established the loss of 6.68 billion dollars occurred. This financial treasure  is  the  financial  institution  invested  by  the  Japanese  government.  In  the  past  term  to  improve  the  financing status of small and middle enterprises the government extended the credit guarantee system and let the policy financial treasure to offer guarantees for the loans of small and middle enterprises. At the same time to relieve the pressure of guarantee Japanese government tried to promote the loans of civil financial institutions. 3. Small and middle enterprises financing modes of Europe in the financial crisis 3.1 Analysis of the development of representative small and middle enterprises financing modes of Europe The financing mode of small and middle enterprises in Germany gives priority to the indirect financing mode which is similar with the Japanese financing mode but the proportion of interior financing of small and middle enterprises in Germany is bigger than the interior financing of Japan. Because of the occurrence of financial crisis after the World War II in Germany large numerous of stocks of enterprises were forced to be purchased by commercial banks to commute bank loans which further strengthened the association between banks and enterprises. Different with the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cprofessional bank  system\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  in  other  countries  the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuniversal  bank  system\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  of  Germany  is  also  called  as  the  comprehensive  bank system. German laws allowed commercial banks to deal with all financial activities in the securities market such as offering the shortterm commercial turnover loans the middle and longterm loans of fixed assets and the securities investments and entrusts. Because the operation range of commercial banks is wider i.e. they can utilize the credit to create the stock options and the transaction of securities issue and securities underwriting so only small space is leaved for the development of German securities market and the banks which dominate the enterprises exist by the \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuniversal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d form.  Contrastively  the  German  capital  market  with  weak  equity  system  is  not  developed  because  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cuniversal\\xe2\\x80\\x9d factor of banks makes enterprises more easily to obtain capitals from banks and on the other hand many problems such as higher cost taxation and the opening of enterprise finance make enterprises would not to finance in the securities market. The  financing  mode  adopted  by  British  is  similar  with  US  and  small  and  middle  enterprises  all  depend  on  the developed  capital  market  and  financial  market  to  finance.  Because  British  government  regulated  that  the  securities issued by enterprises were limited by the lowest capital amount so the proportion to issue capitals for financing is lower than US. The capital source of British small enterprises is mainly from two aspects i.e. the own funds and the portfolios. Because the British government leads commercial banks and civil banks to invest for small and middle enterprises by the industrial investments with the public character so the proportion of policy loan is very small. 3.2 Analysis of the financing modes adopted by small and middle enterprises of Europe in financial crisis Since the beginning of 2009 many Europe large listed companies financed by increasing capital and stock or issuing bonds of small and middle enterprise to reply the financial crisis and solve the extremely urgency of seriously deficient own capitals. After the sign that the economy was stabilized just occurred Europe stock markets rebounded universally and  enterprises  showed  strong  financing  desires  to  the  financial  market  so  small  and  middle  enterprises  chose  to finance in the market one after another. For example in the last tenday of March of 2009 British HSBC financed 14.5 billion Euros in the market by increasing issues in stocks which is the largest single financing in Europe companies since this year. And the British Xstrata Group financed 4.4 billion Euros from the capital market in this year. There are three important causes that Europe countries such as British and Germany adopted the debt financing and the equity financing. (1) Since the April of 2009 the stock market of Europe warms up and there were about 60 large listed companied financed from the capital market according to relative statistics and the financing speed of listed companies is quickening. (2) Investors\\xe2\\x80\\x99 attitude has changed obviously and in the initial of this year the stock markets of Europe and US continued to descend following the depreciation tendency of last year but when the stock markets warm up the excessive pessimism emotion of the market has been changed largely and investors though that the worst stage had already past and they devoted capitals to the market again. Not only the stock market but also other financial channels are changing for example the enterprise bond market is changed also which is the good opportunity for small and middle enterprises to finance from the market. (3) Because banks universally frap loan conditions so enterprises are more difficult to finance form the market. In the past two years the loan conditions of Europe and US were relatively loose  and  Europe  enterprises  accumulated  mint  debts  and  to  reduce  the  burden  of  loans  and  remedy  the  deficient capitals Europe enterprises starved for flow capitals so the financing in the stock and securities markets is possible and 78  \\x0cInternational Business Research                                                                                                                      January 2010 convenient which can fulfill enterprises\\xe2\\x80\\x99 demands for a great lot capitals. In  above  analysis  because  of  the  differences  various  national  situations  and  the  developments  of  small  and  middle enterprises in different countries various countries certainly would adopt different financing modes. However because of the uncertainty and high interest rate of civil financing and the nonnormative character of financing mode in the present economic situation the financing of small and middle enterprises would get in larger difficulty. Therefore the mode of civil financing is not applicable for small and middle enterprise in present economic environment. But with the information enhancement of the public to the financial market and the enhancement of the financial institutions and banks\\xe2\\x80\\x99  mortgage  risk  control  ability  for  small  and  middle  enterprises  the  equity  &  bond  financing  mode  and  the mortgage guarantee financing mode can more effectively solve the financial difficulty for small and middle enterprises at the present stage.
