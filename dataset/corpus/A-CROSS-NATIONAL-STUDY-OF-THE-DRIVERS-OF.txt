You  have  to  serve  financial  markets  reimagine  how  money  can  be  managed  and  moved because there   s going to be more change in the next five years in financial services than happened in the past 30    ~ Dan Schulman CEO PayPal  The five classical functions of the financial sector are making and receiving payments saving to invest or consume later borrowing to be able to consume or invest now the insurance of risks and  advice  on  all  the  above.  Nowadays  all  these  five  dimensions  know  a  new  wave  of technological initiatives which is accelerating change in the global financial landscape (He et al. 2017).  This  emerging  wave  is  called  fintech  or  financial  technologies  and  can  be  defined  as financial  solutions  based  on  information  technology  (Douglas  et  al.  2016;  Keke  et  al.  2018; Pollari 2016). The application of these technologies may be businesstoconsumer or businesstobusiness and are often found in applications for mobile devices such as MPesa and PayPal. As documented in the literature review the fintech industry has experienced a substantial growth in recent years. It has led to fierce competition but also to cooperation with financial incumbents revolutionising financial services and products. But what drives the formation of fintech startups? Previous studies have focused on specific fintech sectors such as crowdfunding behaviour (Burtch et al. 2015) home bias in crowdfunding (Lin & Viswanathan 2016) or the success of crowdfunded ventures (Mollick 2013). Although these studies offer insight into the success of specific fintech sectors only one study that explains the startup rate of fintech companies as an industry can be found. Haddad and Hornuf (2018) investigated the economic and technological determinants of fintech startups. They find that fintech companies are more likely to be formed in countries that have a welldeveloped economy and where venture capital is available. Other than the aforementioned paper very little research has tried to explain the startup rates of fintech companies in general. There are however indications that cultural variables are related to high innovation and high growth entrepreneurship and therefore possibly also to startup rates (Frese Rauch & Zhao 2012). We try to fill this scientific lacuna by building a theory based on Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 6         cultural dimensions personality traits and use correlation with entrepreneurship and innovation to  link  and  predict  the  possible  explanatory  power  of  culture  for  the  emergence  of  startup formations in the fintech industry.  We contribute to literature by replicating a study on fintech startups and exploring the impact of culture on startup rates. Bettis et al. (2016) argue that replication studies are critical for building a body of research knowledge. A replication study for fintech startups is particularly relevant due to the extremely limited research that has been done. Due to the nature of our research topic we test the robustness of the findings of Haddad and Hornuf (2018) to a different model and added different dimensions measuring crosscountry cultural values. Finally we also examine interactions between cultural dimensions to explain fintech startup rates. Our results indicate that culture may/may not impact startup rates in an emerging sector and could therefore be relevant for research in this field. In the following sections this paper will discuss o  A  literature  review  of  fintech  and  culture  and  its  influence  on  entrepreneurship innovation and investments; o  The introduction of our hypothesizes; o  The description of our variables and data; o  The descriptive and regression results; o  A summary of our contribution and implications.Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 7         2. Literature review The literature review starts by showing the relevance of the fintech industry and its growth in recent years. In the second section culture is explained using Hofstede   s cultural dimensions. This  section  also  reviews  literature  that  links  cultural  dimensions  with  entrepreneurship  and innovation.  Because  personality  traits  can  be  linked  to  culture  the  third  section  reviews  the relationship between the Big Five personality traits and entrepreneurship firm performance and innovation.  The  next  section  describes  the  relationship  between  the  Big  Five  and  Hofstede   s cultural dimensions which is required to formulate hypotheses based on both measures. Finally the  fifth  section  reviews  literature  which  relates  to  the  link  between  investments  in  young ventures and cultural dimensions. 2.1  Fintech Several forces are driving the interest in fintech. On the one hand technologies allow the creation of new products and services. These technologies may bring costsavings to incumbents or easily give  market  entrants  access  to  profitable  markets  (Keke  et  al.  2018).  On  the  other  hand customer behaviour and demand are also changing. Consumers adopt new technologies more quickly than before and they demand more convenience and immediacy (Pollari I. 2016). The adaptation  of  mobile  devices  and  digital  platforms  allows  fintech  companies  to  easily  access markets and respond to consumer demands. In Australia for example the alternative financing market for fintech companies increased from 24 million US dollar in 2013 to over 348 million US dollar in 2015 (Pollari I. 2016).  Businesses developing or exploiting financial technologies may compete against or collaborate with financial incumbents. The entities developing new financial technologies in collaboration with financial incumbents are not always independent organisations but may be owned by a financial institution. One of the reasons new ventures are able to attract considerable customer bases are the declining levels of trust in major financial institutions. Pollari I. (2016) argues that    review communities    give customers a more objective opinion of service providers or products than  information  of  major  financial  institutions  that  they  distribute  themselves.  Possible Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 8         shortcomings in service by incumbents are therefore more easily discovered by customers who will look for an alternative service provider. Stewart and J  rjens (2017) also argue that banks are embracing fintech due to the promise of higher revenue streams personalisation of offers and consumer service improvement. Regulators also recognize the importance of the fintech industry. Nowadays more than twenty countries try to support the sector with a mechanism called    regulatory sandboxes   .1  This is a framework set up to allow small scale live testing of innovations by private firms in a controlled environment  (operating  under  a  special  exemption  allowance  or  other  limited  time  bound exception) under the financial sector regulator   s supervision. These sandboxes are established to promote competition and efficiencies in financial service markets through innovation (Jenik & Lauer 2017). It has the goal to reduce the time and cost of getting innovation to the market. A sandbox also has the objective to improve access to finance for startups by reducing the risk of the product or service   s client adoption and increasing the return on capital investment (Ernst & Young 2018). Within the fintech sector there are several markets in which competition can arise. Haddad and Hornuf (2018) find that financing is by far the most important segment of the emerging fintech market  followed  by  payment  asset  management loyalty  programs  risk management exchanges and regulatory technology. The fintech sector can also be divided into other  segments.  A  WEF  report  (2017)  also  uses  the  payment  investment  management  and insurance categories but adds a digital banking and market infrastructure category. Additionally financing is split into a lending and equity crowdfunding segment. Based on these two papers we consider the following fintech categories insurance Fintech category Asset & Investment management Financing & Lending Definition Services related to investments and portfolio management such as roboadvice financial or stock exchange services wealth management personal financial management apps or software. Services and platforms that facilitate project or venture financing for example  crowdfunding (equity) crowdlending microcredit and factoring solutions.                                                         1 Other initiatives like    (fintech) innovation hubs    or    (fintech) accelerators    are also common mechanisms that support financial innovative companies.  Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 9        Insurance Loyalty programmes Payment & Digital Banking Regulatory technology Others   Insurance related services e.g. spot insurance usagedriven insurance insurance contract management and brokerage services as well as claims and risk management services B2C applications providing rewards for brand loyalty or giving customers advanced access to new products special sales coupons or free merchandise. Banking services and innovative payment solutions such as mobile payment systems or ewallets. Services based on technology in the context of regulatory monitoring reporting and compliance benefiting the finance industry Other services e.g. innovative background services like authorization services or other technical advancements classified under other business activities of fintech startups. The fintech industry has experienced a significant growth during the last few years leading to extensive access to finance. According to the Dealroom data base the invested amount in fintech has increased from 23.4 billion and 24.3 billion euros in 2016 and 2017 respectively to at least 467 billion euro in 2018 in Europe alone. The large increase is partly driven by the size of the deals.  Draganov  (2019)  reported  127  megarounds  larger  than  50  million  euro  using  the Dealroom data base. KPMG (2019) also confirms that the sector was characterized by megadeals in 2018 e.g. VC   s invested 14 billion dollars in Art Financial and 12.8 billion dollars in Worldpay. The fintech industry belonged to the top three sectors in which most investments were made. Exitwise the fintech segment ranks as the third largest sector in Europe with an exit value of at least 103 billion euro in 2018. This is an increase from 85 billion euro in 2017 when it was the sector with the highest value of venture capital exits.  Recent  growth  of  the  fintech  industry  has  been  documented  by  literature  as  well.  The  high growth of fintech is associated with more investments in the sector. Haddad & Hornuf (2018) find  that  welldeveloped  economies  and  capital  markets  allow  entrepreneurs  to  more  easily finance their business and have a higher demand for fintech services such as asset management. Secondly they hypothesized that fintech startups are more frequent in countries where latest technologies and supporting infrastructure are prevalent. Haddad & Hornuf only find results that support the need for latest technologies in their sample without the US but variables measuring supporting infrastructure are found significant in their entire sample. These variables include the amount of secure internet servers and mobile telephone subscriptions. Thirdly Haddad & Hornuf Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 10         hypothesize  that  fintech  startups  occur  more  frequently  in  countries  with  a  fragile  banking sector. The authors find significant coefficients for variables measuring regulation but not for soundness of banks partially supporting their hypothesis. Their final hypothesis argues that the size of the labour market and more benevolent regulations regarding labour credit and business conditions and bankruptcy laws leads to more fintech startups. Haddad & Hornuf find positive significant coefficients for regulation and strength of legal rights supporting their theory. Other aspects that positively impact the startup rates of this sector are related to the use of information technology available labour force benevolent regulations and the degree to which companies find it easier to obtain credits. Some scholars even argue that venture capital investments in fintech are becoming inefficient (Cumming & Schwienbacher 2018). They find that fintech companies are more likely to receive equity  financing  in  countries  without  a  major  financial  centre  which  is  due  to  differential enforcement of banking rules. The differential enforcement originates from economies of scale in  prudential  supervision  that  can  be  achieved  in  countries  with  a  major  financial  centre. Cumming and Schwienbacher (2018) also find that fintech companies have a higher probability to  fail  in  countries  without  a  major  financial  centre.  This  is  possibly  due  to  a  higher entrepreneurial risktaking resulting from weaker regulation. The same authors also find that fintech deals are less likely to be acquired after the financial crisis and that they have a higher likelihood to be liquidated. However He et al. (2017) showed that market valuations of fintech sectors have quadrupled since the crisis. Haddad and Hornuf (2018) declare that this happened because of various reasons such as of lack of confidence in banks (especially in countries that suffered extensively in the financial crisis) increased cost of debt of traditional banking products and the frequent exemption for fintechs from regulations due to differential enforcement of the more strict banking rules (Koetter & Blaseg 2015). Cumming and Schwienbacher (2018) argue that there is an exuberance of venture capital investment in fintech which is described as a    hot industry". The investment data in the fintech sector and the literature thus point to an increase of  interest  in  the  sector.  The  success  of  some  applications  such  as  MPesa  a  mobile  money transfer service demonstrate that fintech applications can bring true added value to an economy Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 11         and its participants. Research exploring drivers of fintech venture creations may consequently unveil pathways to facilitate startup rates and indirectly stimulate economies. The given number of startups depends upon the entrepreneurs that nations can draw from their population and sources of financing that entrepreneurs can obtain (Pollari 2016). Overall young ventures typically rely heavily on love money and venture capital (VC) to obtain financing for their growth and commercialization. Thus in order to conduct research regarding fintech startups variables that influence entrepreneurship and the availability of VC financing must be taken into consideration.  Although  both  entrepreneurship  and  venture  capital  have  been  extensively studied there is no consensus about the impact of culture on fintech startups or startups in general. 2.2  Cultural dimensions innovation and entrepreneurship Numerous studies have examined the impact of cultural variables on entrepreneurial activity (e.g. Thornton et al. 2011; Frese Rauch & Zhao 2012). These have indicated that culture may impact entrepreneurship and new firm formation rates. Davidsson and Wiklund (1997) argue that culture influences the psychological characteristics of individuals in a population increasing or  decreasing  the  supply  of  entrepreneurs.  The  results  of  their  study  suggest  that  cultural variation has an impact on new firm formation rates. Frese Rauch and Zhao (2012) argue that culture affects entrepreneurial activities through the behaviour inherent to specific cultures and through  formal  institutions.  They  call  these  views  respectively  the     national  culturepersonal valuesentrepreneurial behaviour model    and the    cultureinstitutionentrepreneurship model   . Frese Rauch and Zhao (2012) find that entrepreneurial activity can to some extent be explained by cultural variables. This study mostly focuses on the relation between cultural dimensions and personality traits entrepreneurship and innovation. Additionally the literature review will take possible relationships between culture and investment behaviour is also taken into account. Researchers have primarily used Hofstede   s culture dimensions (Hofstede & Bond 1984) to study the relations between culture and entrepreneurship and innovation. The fintech sector is an emerging  market  using  technology  to  bring  innovative  solutions  to  its  clients.  Innovation Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 12         therefore is relevant and may help to explain startup rates indirectly through the degree to which personalities are associated with innovation. Furthermore innovation is also important because it is described as a critical factor to distinguish between entrepreneurs and small business owners (Carland et al. 1984). There are several data sets that describe culture with different dimensions such as the Schwartz GLOBE and World values survey (Aggarwal et al. 2016). This study will make use of Hofstede   s cultural dimensions which are available in the data set and seem to be mostly used in empirical research. According to Hadwick (2011) the group of researchers that analyses crosscultural themes in other primary academic fields like finance will mainly focus on the main constructs of Hofstede rather than the more complex findings of the GLOBE study. The reason is that the Hofstede dimensions are somewhat with regard to culture the lingua franca for reviewers.  In the following sections this paper will discuss the cultural dimensions and their correlation with personality traits entrepreneurship innovation and investments in new firms. Hofstede   s  cultural  dimensions  are  based  on  a  population  of  employees  in  a  multinational corporation (IBM). He defines culture as broad patterns of thinking feeling and acting (Hofstede 1990). This    collective programming of the mind    allows to make distinctions of one group of people from another. These distinctions can have an impact on institutions which are    product of  dominant  cultural  value  systems     (Hofstede  2001).  Institutions  can  stimulate  or  obstruct startup rates because they comprise economic political and contractual rules (Li & Zahra 2008). Hofstede identified four cultural dimensions that are widely used in research. These dimensions describe cultures at the national level and may explain variables across nations. Using a different inquiry the Rockeach Value survey taken on a different population and a correlation analysis Hofstede and Bond (1984) find that the same dimensions can be identified. Initially four cultural dimensions were uncovered. Several years later a fifth dimension was added after a Chinese value survey. Because the fifth cultural dimension longterm orientation was added only years after  the  first  four  dimensions  not  a  lot  of  studies  cover  this  dimension.  In  2010  a  sixth dimension indulgence was added to Hofstede   s cultural dimensions. Because it was only added recently  there  is  even  less  literature  to  be  found  that  connects  this  dimension  with entrepreneurship innovation or financing. Moreover it was not included in the data set and is Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 13         not used in the data analysis of this paper. Consequently indulgence will not be reviewed in the literature review. Power distance The first cultural dimension power distance is described as the extent to which less powerful members of institutions and organizations accept that power is distributed unequally and the amount of authority a person has over others. People with authority in societies high on power distance are expected to be courageous capable socially recognized imaginative. They tend to control a lot of resources which are not as easily accessible for others. Parents in cultures with a highpower  distance  would  also  put  a  higher  value  on  children   s  obedience  and  students    politeness (Hofstede 1984). Regarding entrepreneurship and the power distance dimension there seems to be a negative relationship. Bogatyreva et al. (2019) find that power distance has a negative moderating effect of entrepreneurial intention on entrepreneurial action. Entrepreneurial intention is often used in  research  because intentions  are  a  good  predictor  of  planned  behaviour  such  as entrepreneurship  (Krueger  et  al.  2000).  Ozgen  (2012)  argues  that  social  inequality  and  the localization of resources in the hands of a few prevent individuals with entrepreneurial intentions from commencing a venture. According to Rusu (2014) low power distance societies can be associated  with  a  more  entrepreneurial  mindset  because  these  societies  would  support  high independence and autonomy. A study by Mitchell et al. (2000) studied conceptualized script dimensions which were afterwards used to examine the venture creation decision. Arrangement scripts are related to having contacts resources and assets that are necessary to create new ventures. Mitchell et al. (2000) find that power distance moderates the relationship between arrangement scripts and the venture creation decision. This study therefore also indicates that culture may have an impact on venture creation. Another theory formulated by Sim  nMoya et al. (2014) argues that a nation high in power distance ought to be more entrepreneurial. They theorise that there is a need for independence which  cannot  be  satisfied  when  working  as  an  employee  in  organisations  with  autocratic leadership.  A  greater  economic  independence  could  be  achieved  by  working  for  one   s  own Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 14         account and eliminating the risk of being dismissed as an employee. Therefore these individuals will seek greater independence by trying to start their own venture. However Sim  nMoya et al. (2014) did not find evidence to support their own theory. Other empirical results also contradict the  positive  relation  between  power  distance  and  support  the  first  theories  that  link  higher power distance with lower entrepreneurial action. Societies high in power distance also are less inclined to change power distributions (Hofstede 1980). This is detrimental for the innovation opportunities  that  arise  because  Tushman  (1977)  finds  that  innovation  tends  to  alter  the distribution of power in organisations. The change in power distribution occurs when the persons generating the innovative ideas were originally lower in the hierarchy. Knight (1987) notes that the chances for success of innovative ideas decrease dramatically if    the person generating the idea is not the person who gets to run with it as champion   . Shane (1993) later find support that power  distance  is  negatively  related  with  innovation  measured  as  per  capita  number  of trademarks. The results were only statistically significant for 1975 and not for data from 1980. Given the age of the studies it is possible that the role of the power distance variable has changed over time. In a later study Bukowski & Rudnicki (2019) examine the effect of culture on national innovation rates which is measured by e.g. patent applications. The authors also find a negative relationship  between  power  distance  and  rates  of  innovation.  The  negative  relationship  is however  only  significant  one  of  the  six  dependent  variables  that  were  used  as  a  proxy  for innovation. Power distance thus seems to be weakly related to innovation rates through time. It is  however  noteworthy  that  this  cultural  dimension  seems  to  be  negatively  related  to  both innovation and entrepreneurship in prior studies. Individualism & collectivism The second dimension individualism versus collectivism reflects the degree to which individuals depend  upon  themselves  and  their  immediate  family.  Cultures  that  lean  more  towards collectivism have a high sense of loyalty towards the groups or collectivities that they belong to. Hofstede (1980) finds that individualism is correlated to variety enjoyment in life and pleasure. People in an individualistic culture therefore value freedom autonomy and individual interests. They have a preference for acting in their own interest rather than that of a larger group to which they belong. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 15         Literature  on  individualism  reveals  different  theories  with  regards  to  its  relationship  with entrepreneurship. Mitchell et al. (2000) find that individualism has a significant moderating effect on the relationship between arrangement scripts and the venture creation decision. Their results do not formulate a positive or negative relation with individualism but they provide further support that culture may influence entrepreneurship across cultures. Other research indicates that  individualism  is  associated  with  higher  entrepreneurial  activity  due  to  the  focus  on materialistic  achievement  whereas  collectivistic  cultures  exhibit  more  group  conformity (Hofstede 1980; Gupta et al. 2010). In a study by Mueller and Thomas (2000) the likelihood of entrepreneurial orientation is found to be positively correlated with cultures that score higher in individualism. Shane (1993) find indications that there might be a positive relationship between individualism and the rate of innovation across countries. Mueller and Thomas (2000) also find more  support  that  there  is  a  positive  and  significant  coefficient  between  individualism  and innovative  orientation  measured  by  the  Jackson  Personality  Inventory  Manual  (JPI).  Thirdly Bukowski and Rudnicki (2019) also confirm that individualism may be a predictor of innovation rates.  Populations  that  are  more  inclined  towards  individualism  thus  seem  to  have  a  higher chance of creating startups and bringing innovation. For techrelated sectors older research has linked the motivation of hightech entrepreneurs in Japan with the drive for selfactualization which can be associated with personal achievements and individualism (Ray & Turpin 1990). Other  authors  however  have  argued  that is  negatively  correlated  with entrepreneurship.  Tiessen  (1997)  argues  that  entrepreneurship  may  be  a  group  effort  and therefore is linked with the collectivist side of the cultural dimension. This is based on    clan    cultures  within  organisations  in  which  trust  and  commitment  move  individuals  to  serve  the group interest. The intimate ties between members in these organisations allow resources to be stretched  through  efficient  internal  communications  and  the  lack  of  the  need  to  monitor contingent  agreements  between  workers  and  the  company  (Tiessen  1997).  Overall  the consensus  seems  to  point  to  a  positive  relationship  between  individualism  and  both entrepreneurship and innovation rates. individualism  Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 16        Masculinity & Femininity  The third cultural dimension is related to the choice of social sex roles and its effect on people   s selfconcepts (Hofstede 1980) the two opposing poles are masculinity and femininity. Masculine societies value money and success whereas the dominant values in a feminine society are the quality  of  life  and  care  for  others.  Femininity  is  associated  with  social  justice  selfcontrolled (versus macho behaviour in masculine cultures) and selfrespect. Populations scoring higher on femininity have a stronger belief in service and intuition. The feminine pole is also described as more  modest  whereas  masculinity  is  rather  assertive  and  competitive  (Hofstede  &  McCrae 2010). Bogatyreva et al. (2019) argue that individuals in societies scoring high on masculinity give the value of their career more weight than the value of family interests compared to societies scoring high on femininity. Starting up a venture is usually a timeconsuming process; entrepreneurs consequently tend to count more working hours than an employee. When individuals spend more time at work there is less time left to build up relationships. Bogatyreva et al. (2019) find that  entrepreneurial  intention  is  translated  into  a  higher  chance  of  starting  a  venture  for individuals scoring higher on masculinity. Regarding innovation Shane (1993) did not find that this  cultural  dimension  has  explanatory  power  in  the  United  States  sample.  More  recently Bukowski  &  Rudnicki  (2019)  also  did  not  find  any  support  for  hypotheses  claiming  that masculinity is related to national innovation rates in their sample of 33 countries. Uncertainty avoidance The fourth cultural dimension uncertainty avoidance is also related to politeness and obedience. Cultures scoring high in uncertainty avoidance construct institutions and beliefs that impede the creation  of  ambiguous  situations.  These  cultures  also  require  a  high  level  of  obedience  and politeness so that the structures of organizations can be held intact. The population of countries characterised by a low uncertainty avoidance index tend to attach high value to selfrespect    inner  harmony     and  capability  (Ng  et  al.  1982).  Individuals  in  countries  high  in  uncertainty avoidance are characterised by a greater fear of failure and lower levels of ambition. They try to minimize uncertainty by applying strict rules and laws (Shinnar et al. 2012).  Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 17         Kreiser et al. (2010) examined the relationship between cultural values and risk taking within SMEs. They find that both risk taking and proactiveness are negatively related to uncertainty avoidance suggesting that this cultural dimension has a negative relation with entrepreneurial traits. Entrepreneurs have shown a higher propensity for risktaking in prior research (Stewart et al.  1999).  Decisionmaking  in  a  venture  involves  assessing  and  taking  risks  due  to  uncertain outcomes individuals that are less uncomfortable with uncertainty thus may be less likely to start a business. A study by Wennekers et al. (2007) looked at the rate of business ownership and the cultural dimensions. They find that the effect of uncertainty avoidance changed over time from a push effect of high uncertainty avoidance on the rate of business ownership to a pull towards entrepreneurship in a climate of low uncertainty avoidance. Baum   s push hypothesis argues that individuals dissatisfied with a climate of high uncertainty avoidance are pushed towards selfemployment reducing uncertainty related to labour conditions. Wennekers et al. (2007) argue that  individuals  in  low  uncertainty  avoidance  societies  are  pulled  towards  selfemployment because  these  individuals  attach  higher  utility  to  the  rewards  of  selfemployment.  In  later studies uncertainty avoidance also is found to be negatively correlated with starting up a new venture.  In  the  model  that  predicts  entrepreneurial  action  that  Bogatyreva  et  al.  (2019) constructed the uncertainty avoidance variable is found as a negative significant variable. On top of  this  main  effect  this  cultural  dimension  also  has  a  negative  moderating  effect  on  the relationship between entrepreneurial intentions and the formation of new ventures. The findings of Kreiser et al. (2010) mentioned above may help explain the findings of Bogateyreva et al. Moreover Shinnar et al. (2012) argue that individuals in low uncertainty avoidance societies tend to engage more in analysing entrepreneurial activities as opposed to cultures high in uncertainty avoidance where an entrepreneurial career may be socially discouraged to do so. Two important characteristics that guide individuals towards entrepreneurship are risktaking and tolerance for ambiguity (Shane et al. 2003). Because cultures scoring high on uncertainty avoidance try to avoid ambiguity and uncertainty it seems logical that individuals in these cultures are less likely to embark on a new activity. Moreover earlier research (Shane S. 1993) has provided support that innovation is higher in populations where individuals are more tolerant towards risk and change and have a higher uncertainty acceptance. Innovative orientation however is not found Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 18         to be dependent on the uncertainty avoidance dimension (Mueller & Thomas 2000). Bukowski and  Rudnicki  (2019)  also  find  inconclusive  results  for  the  predictive  power  of  uncertainty avoidance on measures of innovation. Due to a lack of more recent studies regarding innovation and  uncertainty  avoidance  it  is  difficult  to  formulate  a  relation  between  the  two.  It  is  also possible that this cultural dimension may not impact the innovative orientation of the population but that it does impact the execution of new ideas. If this is the case then uncertainty avoidance could indeed be negatively related to the formation of new ventures. Longterm orientation Later  a  fifth  cultural  dimension  was  uncovered  longterm  versus  shortterm  orientation. Following the results that people   s way of thinking might be culturally constrained Bond and Hofstede argue that their own thinking also might be constrained (Hofstede & Minkov 2010). Hofstede   s questionnaire and Bond   s adapted version of the Rockeach Value Survey (RVS) which examine cultural differences were both developed in western cultures. They asked themselves to what extent this was responsible for the correlation of their results and whether relevant questions had been omitted. A new questionnaire was developed by Chinese colleagues the Chinese Value Survey (CVS) which found a new cultural dimension that is strongly correlated with economic growth. On one side the new dimension combined the values persistence and thrift and on the other side it combined personal stability tradition and a focus on the present and the past. Hofstede (1991) introduced the fifth cultural dimension as respectively longterm and shortterm orientation. In longterm oriented cultures children learn thrift tenacity and not to  expect  immediate  gratification  of  their  desires  (Hofstede  &  Minkov  2010).  Hofstede  and Minkov  argue  that  working  values  in  these  cultures  are  honesty  learning  adaptiveness accountability and selfdiscipline. Owners managers and workers share the same aspirations and people  invest  in  lifelong  personal  networks.  In  shortterm  oriented  cultures  norms  require people to respect social codes and to be seen as stable individuals. People in these cultures also seem to be sensitive to social trends in consumption an immediate need for gratification and want to    protect their face   . Main work values in shortterm oriented cultures are freedom rights achievements and thinking for oneself. Hofstede and Minkov argue that managers and workers are in two different psychological camps as personal loyalties vary with business needs. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 19         Regarding longterm orientation Bogatyreva et al. (2019) hypothesize that cultures scoring high on  this  cultural  dimension  should  be  more  likely  to  translate  entrepreneurial  intentions  into entrepreneurial  actions.  Their  reasoning  is  that  individuals  in  a  longterm  orientation  culture have a higher propensity to plan and are better prepared to wait for entrepreneurial rewards. Additionally the positive relationship between innovation and longterm orientation (Bukowski & Rudnicki 2019) may support their hypothesis. The results of Bogatyreva et al. (2019) however do not provide support for their theory. The cultural variable longterm orientation as a main effect is not found to be significant in their regressions predicting the start of a new venture. The interaction term consisting of entrepreneurial intention and longterm orientation are significant but  negative  indicating  a  negative  moderating  relationship.  Bogatyreva  et  al.  believe  that individuals in shortterm oriented cultures are less hesitant to commence a venture as they value quick results. In  the  next  section  literature  that  further  links  the  previously  described  dimensions  with personal traits will be reviewed. The section will also include a review of correlation between certain  personal  traits  and  entrepreneurship  or  innovation.  If  certain  traits  associated  with cultures are correlated with more entrepreneurship or innovation this may indicate that cultural dimensions help explain fintech startups through personality dimensions more prevalent in one culture than the other. 2.3  Personality traits innovation and entrepreneurship There are indications that entrepreneurs display certain traits (Stewart et al. 1998; Rauch & Frese  2007)  that  distinct  them  from  other  individuals  in  countries  who  do  not  embark  on  a business  venture.  These  traits  may  be  more  pronounced  in  certain  cultures  than  in  others leading to a population with more individuals that would seem capable of starting a successful venture.  Because  fintech  startups  are  the  result  of  entrepreneurship  predictors  of entrepreneurship are discussed in this section. Therefore explaining variables of entrepreneurial intention that can be linked with culture are relevant for this study. Personalities are considered to consist of several traits. Based on these dimensions of personality an entrepreneurial profile may  be  defined.  Because  certain  personality  traits  can  be  related  to  cultural  dimensions Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 20         (Hofstede  &  McCrae  2004)  entrepreneurial  profiles  could  be  more  common  within  certain cultures. An additional aspect of entrepreneurship that may be related to personality traits is innovation (Marcati et al. 2008). Out of all theories that construct a set of personality traits the fivefactor theory (Goldberg 1993) seems to be the most validated (e.g. BenetMart  nez & John 1998) and most widely applied in empirical research. This theory describes the following five traits Openness Conscientiousness Extraversion Agreeableness and Neuroticism. They are also referred to as    the Big Five    or the OCEAN acronym. In this chapter on one hand the Big Five are explained and they are linked to entrepreneurship using two studies. Firstly a metaanalysis by Zhao et al. (2010) verified potential relationships between the Big Five and entrepreneurial intention or entrepreneurial performance. Secondly Wang et al. (2016) tested the mediating effect of selfefficacy on the relationship between the Big Five and entrepreneurial intention among 195 agricultural students. The latter study is added to the review because it is more recent and uses different data. In their study Wang et al. (2016) use conviction and preparation to account for entrepreneurial intention. On the other hand the Big  Five  are  also  linked  to  innovation.  Marcati  et  al.  (2008)  define  specific  innovation  as  the predisposition to be among the first to adopt innovations in a specific domain. Their study links innovativeness with personality traits based on a questionnaire answered by 188 entrepreneurs.  Openness to experience Openness to experience defines the extent to which individuals are intellectually curious seek new experiences and explore novel ideas (Zhao & Seibert 2006). People scoring high on this trait could  be  described  as  creative  innovative  and  untraditional.  These  characteristics  ought  to improve  the  odds  of  entrepreneurship  (Schumpeter  1942).  Individuals  low  on  openness  to experience may be more conventional unanalytical and narrow in interests (Zhao & Seibert 2006). The metaanalysis performed by Zhao et al. (2010) shows that the coefficient of openness to experience is positively related to entrepreneurial intention. The coefficient of openness is also positively related to firm performance but its confidence interval includes zero. If zero is included in the interval it means that there possibly is no relation between openness and firm performance. The authors thus find no evidence of a relation between openness to experience Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 21         and firm performance. Wang et al. (2016) find that openness predicts entrepreneurial intention through selfefficacy. Additionally statistical results suggest that openness has a direct effect on the conviction to become an entrepreneur. Openness thus seems to be positively related to entrepreneurial intention but cannot be significantly related to firm performance. Openness to experience is also found to be positively related to innovation (Marcati et al. 2008). People high on this personal trait should therefore be more capable of creating a venture in an innovative market such as the fintech sector. Conscientiousness Conscientiousness  describes  values  that  seem  to  occur  more  frequently  with  ambitious individuals. It indicates the degree to which one is persistent hardworking and motivated by goal achievement  (Zhao  &  Seibert  2006).  This  dimension  has  proven  to  be  a  good  personality predictor  of  the  ability  to  work  hard  (Barrick  &  Mount  1991)  and  could  be  regarded  as  a composition of achievement motivation and dependability (Mount & Barrick 1995). Literature suggests that values such as achievement motivation are correlated to entrepreneurship because individuals  feel  that  performance  is  due  to  their  own  efforts  rather  than  other  factors (McClelland 1961). The metaanalysis of Zhao et al. (2010) finds support for this theory because conscientiousness  is  found  to  be  positively  related  to  entrepreneurial  intention.  Wang  et  al. (2016) also find that conscientiousness can predict entrepreneurial intentions but through the effect  of  selfefficacy.  Just  like  openness  to  experience  Zhao  et  al.  (2010)  find  a  positive relationship  between  conscientiousness  and  firm  performance  but  its  confidence  interval contains zero. Therefore conscientiousness is also positively related to entrepreneurial intention but also cannot be significantly related to firm performance. Regarding innovation Marcati et al. (2008)  find  a  negative  significant  correlation  with  conscientiousness.  Individuals  high  on conscientiousness  may  consequently  aspire  entrepreneurial  ambitions  but  may  not  be sufficiently inclined to adopt innovative technologies to start a fintech venture.  Extraversion Extraversion describes energetic talkative enthusiastic assertive and dominant people (Costa & McCrae 1992). More introverted individuals that score low on this trait are more reserved quiet Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 22         and independent. Zhao & Seibert (2006) find that entrepreneurs score higher on extraversion than managers which suggests that extraversion is positively correlated to entrepreneurship. They  argue  that  traits  related  to  extraversion  are  important  for  entrepreneurs  who  need  to convince  stakeholders  to  invest  or  do  business  with  them.  Additionally  they  argue  that extraversion promotes social interactions with employees. Entrepreneurs who are talkative and enthusiastic may improve human relations at work and enhance team performance. The study by  Zhao  et  al.  (2010)  provides  support  for  a  positive  relationship  between  extraversion  and performance. Wang et al. (2016) also find an indirect relationship between extraversion and entrepreneurial intention supporting the previously mentioned arguments. Finally extraversion is also positively related to innovation (Marcati et al. 2008). Individuals high on this personality dimension therefore ought to be more likely and capable to start a fintech venture. Agreeableness Agreeableness indicates to which degree individuals are trusting forgiving caring altruistic and even  gullible.  Individuals  scoring  high  on  agreeableness  have  a  preference  for  positive interpersonal  relationships  whereas  individuals  on  the  opposite  side  of  the  scale  are  more manipulative selfcentred and suspicious (Costa & McCrae 1992). Zhao and Seibert (2006) argue that high agreeableness may inhibit the willingness to drive hard bargains look out for one   s own selfinterest and the ability to manipulate others for one   s own interests. These characteristics are probably helpful in venture creation and success. Later Zhao et al. (2010) hypothesised that agreeableness would be negatively related to entrepreneurial intentions. They argue that people high on agreeableness are more interested in careers in social work or teaching than in business because those occupations allow them to work for the benefit of others. The confidence interval predicting  entrepreneurial  intention  contains  zero  in  the  study  of  Zhao  et  al.  (2010)  they consequently  find  no  support  for  a  relationship  between  agreeableness  and  entrepreneurial intention. Wang et al. (2016) however do find an indirect relationship between agreeableness and  entrepreneurial  intention.  Agreeableness  therefore  is  the  first  personality  dimension  for which no clear relationship with entrepreneurial intention exists. For firm performance Zhao et al. (2010) also did not find sufficient studies to examine the relation with agreeableness. This dimension is found to be negatively related to the adaptation of innovations (Marcati et al. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 23         2008). Agreeableness thus does not seem to promote innovative entrepreneurial action which is required for fintech startups. Neuroticism Neuroticism  represents  the  emotional  stability  of  individuals;  the  low  end  of  this  scale  is emotionally  stable.  Individuals  scoring  high  on  neuroticism  are  characterised  by  negative emotions such as anxiety hostility impulsiveness vulnerability and selfconsciousness (Costa & McCrae  1992).  Emotionally  stable  individuals  ought  to  be  more  calm  selfconfident  even tempered and relaxed (Zhao & Seibert 2006). Because entrepreneurs and young ventures are likely to deal with uncertainty and consequently stressing environments individuals acting in these environments ought to be emotionally stable. This theory is supported by Zhao et al. (2010) who find a positive relationship between emotional stability and the intention to become an entrepreneur. However for this personality dimension Wang et al. (2016) did not find a relation with entrepreneurial intention. Based on the metaanalysis of Zhao et al. (2010) and the study of Wang  et  al.  (2016)  the  effect  of  neuroticism  on  entrepreneurial  intention  thus  remains inconclusive. Interestingly Zhao et al. (2010) find that neuroticism is negatively related to firm growth and profitability which proxy for firm performance. This may indicate that more calm and selfconfident  individuals  can  make  better  decisions  regarding  firm  operations  and  strategy. Marcati  et  al.  (2008)  found  no  significant  correlation  between  neuroticism  and  specific innovation. The  following  table  summarizes  the  expected  correlations  between  personality  traits  and entrepreneurial intention firm performance and innovative behaviour. Openness to experience and  extraversion  seem  to  be  beneficial  traits  to  possess  when  one  starts  a  venture. Conscientiousness and agreeableness seem to be positively related to entrepreneurial intention but negatively to the adaptation of new innovations. These two traits therefore may not increase the likelihood of successful venturing in emerging markets where new technologies are key to diversify  from  incumbents  and  competitors.  Neuroticism  is  negatively  related  to  both entrepreneurial  intention  and  firm  performance  and  thus  is  unlikely  to  stimulate  startup formation and success.

Hofstede and McCrae (2004) studied the degree to which these personality traits can be associated with cultural dimensions. They argue that mean levels of personality traits in populations may give rise to different cultural practices or institutions. Hofstede and McCrae did not include the longterm orientation in their study because its scores were only available for 24 out of the 33 countries used to measure the other four dimensions. Additionally the LTOdimension is only positively with extraversion but the correlation of extraversion with individualism is stronger so adding longterm orientation added no  value  to  the  analysis.  Longterm  orientation  also  was  too  strongly  correlated  with individualism  (0.72).  Hofstede  &  McCrae  (2004)  found  the  following  zeroorder  correlations between the cultural dimensions and the Big Five. IBM Culture Dimension E IND PDI MAS UA 0.64*** 0.57**   C  0.52**   O  0.39* 0.40*  N   A   0.57** 0.58** 0.36* 0.55** Significance levels *p < 0.05 **p < 0.01 ***p < 0.001 In  the  remainder  of  the  article  Hofstede  and  McCrae  (2004)  each  offer  a  model  in  which dimensions of culture explain mean levels of traits and vice versa. However it is interesting to note that individualism is only strongly and positively correlated with extraversion. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 25        Hofstede   s stepwise regression includes gross national product per capita a proxy for wealth as a control variable. If this variable predicts a phenomenon better than culture the explanation from cultural dimensions is considered to be probably redundant. This is the case for power distance as a predictor of conscientiousness. Hofstede & McCrae (2004) argue that prosperity allows people to behave less conscientiously or more wastefully.

Hofstede (2001) found studies that link uncertainty avoidance with stress anxiety and expression of emotions. Masculinity is associated with higher neuroticism because cultural femininity has a focus  on  relationships  people  and  quality  of  life  which  are  more  conducive  for  emotional stability. Extraversion is mostly explained by the individualism dimension. Hofstede (Hofstede & McCrae 2004) argues that collectivism is correlated with expertise duty and security which suggest more introverted behaviour. Femininity also explains extraversion; this is possibly because individuals need  to  display  extraverted  behaviour  to  build  relationships  which  are  important  for  people scoring high on femininity. Openness to experience is positively correlated with masculinity and uncertainty avoidance but negatively with power distance. Cultures low on power distance tend to stimulate independent exploration. Hofstede shows that low power distance countries obtained more Noble prizes to support this theory (Hofstede 2001).  Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 26         McCrae  (Hofstede  &  McCrae  2004)  proposes  two  hypotheses  which  support  his  claim  that personality traits may be among the causes of culturallevel differences. Firstly the selective migration hypothesis argues that individuals move in and out of groups to find an environment where they fit best. Populations high on power distance could for example be explained by highly introverted individuals who more easily tolerate the restricted access to positions of leadership. Secondly  the  reverse  causation  hypothesis  suggests  that  culture  is  shaped  by  the  aggregate personality traits of its members (Hofstede & McCrae 2004). Consequently value systems and institutions are seen as social adaptations to the psychological environment represented by the distribution of personality traits. Stepwise regression of culture scores against Big 5 scores across 33 countries Criterion Predictors Cumulative Adj. R2 Uncertainty Avoidance Power Distance Individualism Masculinity + N  A  E + C + E + N + O 0.31 0.45 0.31 0.43 0.39 0.30 0.37 The  combined  effect  of  neuroticism  and  low  agreeableness  leads  to  a  group  of  people  who generally are tense and irritable (Hofstede & McCrae 2004). Decisions in these groups would be a  potential  source  of  conflict  so  they  adopt  rules  and  develop  institutions  to  avoid  this.  Individualism is associated with freer social interactions and the inclination to make new social contacts. These behavioural actions are more associated with extraverts which consequently is found to predict individualism. Introverted individuals rather tend to stick in tight groups which are familiar people such as family or colleagues. Power distance is associated with introversion and conscientiousness because natural leaders which are few due to high levels of introversion can easily rise to positions of authority. Individuals are conscientious in this scenario and would therefore accept the dominance of leaders leading to a stable and productive system (Hofstede & McCrae 2004). Hofstede & McCrae (2004) find no real reason why neuroticism or openness would are positively associated with masculinity.  Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 27        2.5  Cultural dimensions and venture investments  Another factor that has an impact on the amount of startup companies across different nations is the availability of capital that can be invested in fintech startups. Haddad and Hornuf (2018) find  that  access  to  venture  capital  is  an  important  factor  to  facilitate  the  startup  of  fintech ventures. They state that access to venture capital is not equally available in every region of the world  indicating  geographical  differences  possibly  originating  from  cultural  differences. Literature  linking  culture  and  capital  investments  in  young  businesses  is  very  scarce.  This  is possibly due to the fact that the venture capital markets seem to be nationally based and the relevance of culture is probably low (Wright et al. 2005). Wright et al. (2005) argue that venture capitalists would be restricted from investing abroad due to cultural differences and geographical distance. Li and Zahra (2012) argue that venture capital activity is lower in cultures high in uncertainty avoidance because risky activities require a higher risk premium and investors in high uncertainty societies are less likely to enter into these risky activities. Their results support this theory with a significant negative coefficient for uncertainty avoidance predicting the number of investments in new firms. Later Cumming et al. (2016) report a negative and statistically significant impact of uncertainty  avoidance  on  the  amount  of  cleantech  venture  capital  deals.  They  attribute  this relationship to a lower openness of venture capitalists towards risk taking and new ideas in high uncertainty avoidance countries. Perry et al. (2015) also find that new venture investments are influenced  by  this  cultural  dimension.  They  report  that  individuals  with  high  degrees  of uncertainty avoidance are less likely to invest in a family member   s venture. Perry et al. (2015) hypothesize  that  societies  characterised  by  a  high  uncertainty  avoidance  strive  to  make  the future predictable. In these societies investments in new ventures would be perceived as too risky versus investments in established companies. Their tests support this hypothesis providing further  support  for  a  negative  expected  relationship  between  uncertainty  avoidance  and investments in new ventures. There are indications that collectivism is also negatively associated with the number of startups that are being invested in. Li and Zahra (2012) hypothesize that a collectivist orientation weakens Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 28         the positive impact of formal institutional development on venture capital activity. They argue that  the  collectivist  orientation  would  limit  the  development  of  institutions  confine  venture capitalists    deal flows to those connected to their existing network and exclude potential new unknown  venture  capitalists  from  joining  the  network.  Li  and  Zahra  (2012)  find  that  the collectivism coefficient is negative and significant predicting fewer investments in new firms and supporting their hypothesis. Perry et al. (2015) studied the effect of ingroup collectivism on the likelihood  of  investment  in  new  ventures  begun  by  family  members.  GLOBE   s  ingroup collectivism refers to the degree to which individuals express pride loyalty and cohesiveness in their groups. This definition corresponds with Hofstede   s collectivism dimension. Perry et al. find a negative significant coefficient which implies that not only venture capital investments but also investments made by earlier stage financers seem to be negatively affected by cultures that are highly collectivist. This cultural dimension thus may also influence the financing before venture capital is required for further growth financing. 3.  Hypotheses  To explore the impact of the cultural dimensions on fintech startups we build in this section our hypotheses around the five Hofstede dimensions and three indispensable factors for venture creation entrepreneurship innovation and access to financing. The literature review gave insight into different contradicting theories regarding the first cultural dimension power distance and entrepreneurship. The lack of a consensus suggests that this cultural dimension on its own will not impact the fintech startups. A potential manner for this dimension to influence the startup rate of fintech ventures is through ownership of ideas and innovations. This is based on Knight   s theory (1987) that the chances of success of innovative ideas increases with the degree of ownership that individuals can take for it. In nations scoring low on power distance the acceptance of unequal distribution of power is less inherent and the possibility to take ownership may be higher. Individuals might therefore have more incentive to pursue innovative ideas that may bring new fintech services or products. Moreover individuals in these societies may have access to resources more easily and quickly in low power distance cultures and can consequently execute ideas more easily and quickly. Finally power distance is Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 29        also found to be negatively related to the adaptation of innovative technologies (Marcati et al. 2008) and entrepreneurial intention through its negative correlation with extraversion (Zhao et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2016; Hofstede & McCrae 2004). Building on the    Ownership Theory    and the relation of power distance with extraversion we hypothesise the following  Hypothesis 1 Fintech startup occur more frequently in countries that score low on the power distance variable.  Hofstede (1980) argued that the population of countries scoring high on individualism tend to be more autonomous and attach more value to freedom and individual interests rather than the interests of groups they pertain to. Additionally successful entrepreneurship can bring great rewards for entrepreneurs. The literature review found that individualistic cultures may have more interest in materialistic achievement against whereas there seems to be a propensity in collectivist cultures towards conformity. The population of individualistic countries may thus be more motivated to pursue the creation of ventures. Additionally individuals in high individualism countries may be more confident and believe that they can make successfully start a venture. Mueller & Thomas (2000) argue that individualistic cultures foster entrepreneurial values which promote selfreliance and independent action as opposed to collectivistic cultures. They find that individualism is a positive and significant predictor for internal locus of control. Locus of control measures to what degree individuals believe that external factors around them drive events in their lives. An internal locus of control indicates the belief that one can control events. This theory is  supported  by  the  relation  of  extraversion  with  individualism  (Hofstede  &  McCrae  2004) because extraversion is associated with a higher entrepreneurial intention and adaptation of new technologies (Zhao et al. 2010; Wang et al. 2016; Marcati et al. 2008). Innovation therefore seems to be positively related to individualism. The freedom and autonomy that are correlated to individualism may spur individuals to think creatively and execute new ideas. The combined positive influence of individualism on entrepreneurial traits intention and innovation suggests that fintech startup rates are positively correlated with individualism. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 30         Hypothesis 2 fintech startups are more likely to occur in countries that score high on the individualism cultural dimension.  Cultures that score high on the masculinity dimension ought to have populations that are more ambitious because they value money and success more than people in cultures that score low on masculinity. However Hofstede and McCrae (2004) show that the correlation of masculinity with personality traits is the strongest with neuroticism and has a positive relation. Neuroticism is negatively  related  to  both  entrepreneurial  intention  and  firm  performance.  Additionally femininity is associated with agreeableness and building good relationships with people. This may benefit relationships with both internal and external stakeholders. Masculinity should thus lead  to  fewer  successful  startups  given  its  expected  relation  with  personality  traits.  On  the financing side the competitive aspect combined with machoism may lead to more risktaking behaviour to strive to be the best. This could have a positive impact on available financing. Fund managers  in  a  more  masculine  culture  could  be  more  easily  persuaded  to  invest  in  risky businesses with high potential resulting in a higher count of VC backed fintech startups. Because we don   t find conclusive answers in the literature review and think that the feminine pole also has  advantages  for  startup  creation  we  hypothesize  that  masculinity  will  have  no  predictive power. Hypothesis 3 fintech startup rates cannot be predicted by the masculinity dimension.  The fourth cultural dimension uncertainty avoidance goes hand in hand with greater fear of failure and less ambition which aren   t beneficial for entrepreneurship. Bogatyreva et al. (2019) argue that individuals in societies low in uncertainty avoidance are also more comfortable in unstructured  situations  and  find  supporting  results  for  their  theory.  To  start  a  venture  in  a technology related sector the company and entrepreneurs will have to bear risks and be tolerant to ambiguity. Risks can originate from the potentially fierce competition against incumbents and other fintech companies entrepreneurs in the sector should thus be proactive and ambitious. Additionally Hofstede and McCrae (2004) find a positive relation between uncertainty avoidance and the neuroticism personality trait. Neuroticism is negatively related to both entrepreneurial Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 31         intention (Zhao et al. 2010) and the adaptation of new innovations (Marcati et al. 2008). Finally the negative relationships between uncertainty avoidance and investments by venture capitalists (Li  &  Zahra  2012)  or  family  venture  financing  (Perry  et  al.  2015)  suggest  that  early  stage financing is harder to obtain in cultures high on uncertainty avoidance. We therefore expect that countries  that  score  higher  on  the  uncertainty  avoidance  index  see  fewer  fintech  startup formations  due  to  a  smaller  supply  of  entrepreneurs  which  may  be  less  inclined  to  adopt innovations and less access to financing. Hypothesis 4 fintech startups occur more frequently in countries that score low on the uncertainty avoidance index.  Because  fintech  companies  highly  depend  on  their  technology  and  innovation  values  that characterize longterm oriented cultures ought to be more beneficial for the creation of these companies  than  their  shortterm  counterparts.  Longterm  working  values  that  may  be particularly stimulating for fintech entrepreneurs are learning planning and adaptiveness. These values are important for acquiring knowledge and using that knowledge to create more relevant products  or  services.  An  environment  or  nation  where  these  values  are  prevalent  may consequently stimulate the search for new alternative products within the financial technology market. Additionally the importance of thrift and tenacity to pursue goals are also expected to be positively correlated with entrepreneurial characteristics. Values associated with shortterm orientation on the other hand may be detrimental for entrepreneurial success. The immediate need for gratification and spending norms could for example lead to a population that has a lower tendency to apply bootstrapping whereas the opposite would be true for cultures on the other side of the spectrum. A national longterm orientation should thus stimulate the application of knowledge  in  the  creation  of  innovative  products  or  services.  We  therefore  hypothesize  the following Hypothesis 5 fintech startups occur more frequently in countries with a longterm orientation. The effect of high individualism may be strengthened in a culture low in uncertainty avoidance because  this  combination  ought  to  make  entrepreneurs  more  comfortable  in  a  dynamic Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 32        ambiguous  environment.  Ambitious  individuals  who  take  initiative  are  comfortable  in ambiguous situations and that have a high degree of independence should be more predisposed for fintech entrepreneurship than their less ambitious counterparts who prefer less risky working environments. We therefore introduce the following hypothesis with an interaction between individualism and uncertainty avoidance  Hypothesis 6 fintech startups are more likely to occur in countries that score high on the individualism and low on the uncertainty avoidance cultural dimension.  Because growing a business requires patience and longterm planning we argue that there may be an interaction effect of individualism and longterm orientation. Previously we mentioned that people in individualistic cultures tend to attach more value to materialistic achievement. If these individuals are more able to learn and to use knowledge to reach their goals they may be more inclined to start a venture trying to obtain a higher wealth. This relation may be enhanced by cultures high on longterm orientation because investment managers may be more inclined to be educated and think in the long term in a more pragmatic approach.  Hypothesis  7  fintech  startups  are  more  likely  to  occur  in  countries  that  score  high  on  the individualism and high on the longterm orientation cultural dimension. 4.  Methodology  The platform used to gather data for our dependent variable is the Dealroom database. It helps investors  corporates  and  local  governments  to  discover  and  track  innovative  companies  by collecting data across all investment stages from seed to late growthstage. In total the database holds  information  of  about  831  845  companies  (from  which  441  049  startups)  and  85  324 corporate investors across the entire globe. The database has information about 38 412 fintech startup companies worldwide. The sample of Haddad and Hornuf (2018) was restructured in Dealroom  finding  17  420  fintechs.  This  is  remarkably  higher  than  the  7  353  fintech  startup formations found in their sample using CrunchBase.  As a result Dealroom is used instead of CrunchBase because it collects more data about fintech companies and its financing. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 33        We retrieved the data about fintech startups at March 8 2019 in collaboration with Dimitrios Kolokas from Vlerick Business School. Our sample consists of 85 countries over the period of 2009 until 2017 and includes crosscountry data without any income geographical or restriction filter (see appendix Table 1 for a list of countries used in our data). However information of 2018 is not included because it is possible that some of the Dealroom data is obtained with a time lag.   To research the impact of culture on the fintech startups data of the two dependent variables new fintech and new VCbacked fintech is retrieved from Dealroom. In this sample consisting of panel  data  765  observations  per  dependent  variable  are  collected.  The  variable  new  fintech describes the number of fintech startup formations in a given year and country and is our main dependent variable. The second measure defines the number of the previously mentioned new fintech  startups  in  a  given  year  and  country  that  currently  are  or  were  backed  by  venture capitalists (from seed to late growth stage) up to 2019. The second measure will be used as a robustness check in our research. In total 17 477 new fintech formations of which 6 049 VCbacked started in the post 2008 financial crisis period. We controlled for survivorship bias by excluding the hidden filter    closed    in Dealroom. As a result our analysis also takes into account startups that are no longer operational today but that were launched during the period of 20092017. In line with the statistical method used in research by York and Lenox (2013) Dushnitsky et  al.  (2016)  and  Haddad  and  Hornuf  (2018)  we  also  apply  a  random  effects  model  for  our regression analyses. However the dependent variables are count variables and thus normalized through its natural logarithm.2 The random effects model takes into account the clustering of observations at country level by affirming that dispersion varies randomly from cluster to cluster (Rao 2004). It incorporates random crosscountry specific effects into the relationship between the expected number of fintechs independent variables and mediators. We also include a set of year dummies to account for the unobserved effect of time on the number of fintech startups. For the independent variables data about the cultural factors  power  distance  individualism masculinity uncertainty avoidance and longterm orientation is collected from the database of                                                         2 All mentioned transformations of variables are executed by calculating the LN(X+1) with X as the observed value of the variable. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 34         Hofstede Insights and checked with the most recent data provided by professor Geert Hofstede. Not only the main effects but also interaction effects of these dimensions named IND * (UA) and IND * LTO will be researched to test the aforementioned hypotheses. The quantified scores of the five Hofstede dimensions are given in a range of 0100. Consequently multiple mediators are included in our data set to control for several factors that will affect the number fintech startup formations. These variables are lagged for one year (20082016) to predict the effect on the dependent variable for the period of 20092017. There are several databases consulted to collect  this  data.  As  mentioned  in  literature  Haddad  and  Hornuf  (2018)  proved  that  several factors will positively or negatively impact the number of fintech formations. The authors do not link this with cultural traits and the appropriate variables which control for factors other than culture. However we include one model (named model I) in which we replicate the study of Haddad and Hornuf but with adding the cultural dimensions. Furthermore we built a second model (named model II) following the method used in the paper of Frese Rauch and Zhao (2012). Beside culture they distinguish two variables that are important to predict earlystage or highinnovation entrepreneurship.  Model I  First  we  specify  the  control  variables  for  model  I  by  replicating  the  significant  variables  in research about the emergence of fintech startup formation from Haddad and Hornuf (2018). To  test  the  impact  of  welldeveloped  economies  and  capital  markets  we  included  several variables. Firstly to control for the general development of financial inclusion in capital markets the natural logarithm of the variable deposits to GDP is introduced. The deposit to GDP variable is retrieved from the version of the IMF   s International Financial Statistics by using demand time and saving deposits in deposit money banks as a share of GDP.3 Research shows that countries where the availability of financial products and services is higher with deposits to GDP used as proxy  will  not  only  aid  economic  development  and  poverty  alleviation  but  will  also  help  to enhance financial stability (Han & Melecky 2013). The variable deposits to GDP is not included                                                         3 Calculated using the following deflation method {(0.5)*[Ft/P_et + Ft1/P_et1]}/[GDPt/P_at] where F is demand time and saving deposits P_e is endof period CPI and P_a is average annual CPI. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 35         in the research of Haddad and Hornuf. We insert this variable because we believe that it is a good proxy to indicate strong economies. Furthermore to evaluate the development of the venture capital markets the measure VC availability is used as mediator. The variable is measured by the World  Economic  Forums     Global  Competitiveness  Index  and  answers  the  question     In  your country  how  easy  is  it  for  entrepreneurs  with  innovative  but  risky  projects  to  find  venture capital?    [1 = extremely difficult; 7 = extremely easy]. Thereafter the natural logarithm of GDP per  capita  measures  the  prosperity  in  a  certain  country  and  is  collected  from  the  World Development Indicators database. According to research from Durham (2002) higher levels of GDP per capita should lead to more growing capital markets. Furthermore Haidar (2008) proves that  the  level  of  investor  protection  matters  for  economic  growth.  Countries  with  better protection tend to grow faster than those with poor investor protection. To control for this effect we included the variable investor protection in the analysis. By using the World Economic Forum   s Global Competitiveness Index the strength of the investor safeguard in each country for each year is measured on a 010 scale. The impact of the soundness of the crossnational financial sectors is proxied by the variable ease of access to loans. The availability to external financing can indicate the frailty of the financial system. Schwaab Koopman and Lucas (2011) interpret variation in credit supply and changes in ease of credit access as warning signals for financial frailty by demonstrating that these variables were a prior indicator for financial distress in the past. The variable is measured from the survey of  the  World  Economic  Forum   s  Global  Competitiveness  report.  In  this  survey  the  following question was asked    In your country how easy is it to obtain a bank loan with only a good business plan and no collateral?    [1 = extremely difficult; 7 = extremely easy].  The effect of the availability of the latest technology on fintech startups is measured by the logtransformation of the variables secure internet servers mobile subscriptions and availability of latest technologies. The first variable measures the number of distinct publiclytrusted servers using encryption technology per one million people. It is composed by information from the Netcraft Secure Server Survey and population data from the World Bank. The mediator mobile subscriptions shows  how  mobile cellular subscriptions  (per 100 people) vary by country.  The indicator includes the number of postpaid subscriptions and active prepaid accounts (i.e. that Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 36        have been used during the last three months) and applies to all mobile cellular subscriptions that offer voice communications. It is retrieved from the World Telecommunication/ICT Development report  and  database  of  the  International  Telecommunication  Union.  The  third  variable availability  of  latest  technologies  is  constructed  by  answers  from  the  survey  question  in  the Global Competitiveness Report of the World Bank    In your country to what extent are the latest technologies available?    [1 = not at all; 7 = to a great extent].   Furthermore we need to check for the effect of market regulations and labour force on fintech startup formations. The variables credit market regulations labour market regulations business regulations  and  strength  of  legal  rights  represent  the  market  regulations  for  a  country  in  a specific year. The first three variables are collected from the Fraser Institute database and give a score of zero to ten. A high rating indicates that countries have less control over market forces and allow the market  to determine e.g. interest rates in a private banking system (credit market) hiring and firing regulations or minimum wages (labour market) or licensing restrictions and rules about starting up a business (business regulations). Moreover the strength of legal rights index measures the degree to which collateral and bankruptcy laws protect the rights of borrowers and lenders and thus facilitate lending. The index ranges from 0 to 12 with higher scores indicating that these laws are better designed to expand access to credit. This data is collected from the Doing Business Project of the World Bank. Finally the labour force variable is measured by using the  World  Development  Indicators  database  and  transformed  to  its  natural  logarithm.  It comprises the total of people from at least 15 years of age who supply labour for the production of goods and services during a specified period. The variable includes people who are currently employed but also people who are unemployed but seeking work and firsttime jobseekers are included.  The general efficiency of the legal system in a country may affect entrepreneurship. For this reason we introduce the variable rule of law. This measure provides a perception of the extent to which agents have confidence in and will abide by the rules of society and particularly the quality  of  contract  enforcement  property  rights  the  police  and  the  courts  as  well  as  the likelihood of crime and violence. Higher values indicate better legal systems. The Worldwide Governance Indicators project of the World Bank has collected this data. Haddad and Hornuf also Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 37         control  for  entrepreneurial  environment  (total  number  of  new  startup  formations)  in  their research. As indicated in literature we assume that the cultural dimensions can be used as a proxy for this variable and for this reason we don   t insert this variable in our research.  Model II For the mediators in model II we inserted variables that coincide with those used in the work of Frese  Rauch  and  Zhao  (2012)  about  crosscountry  differences  in  entrepreneurial  activity.  It concerns two variables that have been discussed in the above outline of model I. The first one GDP per capita is used as a proxy for national wealth in the different countries. Secondly the variable business regulations is inserted as an institutional variable controlling the presence and goodnatured strictness of entrepreneurial laws in a particular country.  All variables of both models are explained and referenced to its source in appendix Table 2. 5.  Descriptives 5.1  Summary statistics Concerning the summary statistics of the dependent variables it is remarkable that over all 765 observations on average around twentythree fintech startups per country are launched during the period of 20092017 and that on average approximately eight of these twentythree fintech startups are backed by venture capitalists. This proves that the fintech startup market is highly financed through VCfunds. The importance of VC investing in fintechs becomes clear in KPMG   s biannual analysis of investment in fintech sectors. This report shows that the growing global popularity of private equity venture investing into fintech enterprises is showing an upwards trend in invested capital from 2013 until 2018 (KPMG 2019).4  Table 3 describes the new fintech startups and VCbacked startups in detail. Several ratios are calculated to interpret the importance of the fintech startups over the entire or VCbacked                                                         4 Includes seed capital and investments by BA early and late VC   s Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 38         startup market. Panel A considers the number of fintechs per year. Panel B certifies the twenty largest fintech suppliers and panel C summarizes the sample per continent.  Panel A notices an increasing trend of fintech startup formations from 2009 until 2014. This corresponds with the analysis of Haddad and Hornuf in which they declare an upsurge of fintech formations after the 2008 financial crisis. From 2015 onwards the number of fintech formations decreased until 2017. In 2017 38.65% less fintech startups were founded in comparison with 2014 which was the period with the maximum financial technology startup formations. The same evolution  is  recognized  for  the  total  startup  formations  over  the  sample  period.  The  only difference is that total number of startups started decreasing from 2013 and not 2014. However deducted from the ratio of the fintech with the total startup market the presence of the fintech industry  is  the  largest  in  2017  when  14.60%  of  the  startup  market  consisted  of  fintech corporations. The reason for this is a proportional higher decline of the total startup companies when  compared  to  the  indicated  decrease  in  the  aggregated  amount  of  fintech  companies. Furthermore the VC activity in fintech startups is investigated. Important to mention is that according  to  research  by  KPMG  (2018)  and  Innovate  Finance  (2018)  both  VC  deals  and  VC invested funds in fintech startups are still increasing every year with China The United States and The  United  Kingdom  as  the  most  important  countries  (measured  by  invested  capital).  The collected data about VC financing only takes into account companies that are backed from early to late growth stage and disregards whether they are financed by one or more VC   s in one or multiple financing rounds and neither the size of the deal is taken into account. Using these variables it is possible to measure how many companies have financed their project with VC capital  during  the  startup  phase.  This  ratio  of  VCbacked  fintech  startups  over  total  fintech startups does not vary much over the entire sample period. However the highest percentage dates from 2014 and 2015 when venture capitalists backed approximately 38% of all launched fintechs. The proportion of the VCbacked fintechs over all VCbacked corporation   s is the most noticeable in 2017 (16.58%). In general over the period of 20092017 9% of all collected startups are fintech firms 10.76% of all VCbacked startups are active in the fintech sector and 34.61% of all reported fintech firms are financed with venture capital. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 39         Panel B of table 3 provides statistics for the different continents per year. All 85 countries were distributed over the different geographic regions by using the method developed by the Statistics Division of the United Nations. However this is for statistical convenience and does not imply any assumption regarding political or other affiliation of countries or territories (United Nations 2019). Fintech startups also the count of those financed by venture capitalists are most present in NorthAmerica followed by Europe and Asia. Nevertheless the ratio of fintechs over the total startup market is the highest in CentralLatin America with Mexico as main driver where almost one fifth of all collected startups are fintechs. The market share of VCbacked fintech startups over the total number of fintech startups is the largest in Europe and NorthAmerica because of dominant presence of VC   s in the UK and US fintech startup market.  To further analyse the crossnational differences we report the twenty most important suppliers in the fintech industry. Panel C makes clear that the United States is the largest fintech supplier with almost five times as much fintechs as the United Kingdom and nine times more than India. Almost half (45.52%) of all fintech startups collected at Dealroom are launched in the United States. According to a report from S&P (2018) startups in the US fintech industry have grown rapidly during the postcrisis economic expansion strong credit quality and bull markets. Their ability to grow successfully is not only because of their own developed tools but also because of financial  institution  their  partner  with.  These  US  partners  offer  reliable  funding  are  wellestablished  brands  and  have  experience  in  navigating  in  changing  economic  circumstances (Darden  Dixit  &  Mason  2018).  Nevertheless  based  on  the  fintech  penetration  in  the  total startup market only 8.33% of all reported startups in the US are fintechs. This is relatively higher in countries like Singapore (20.93%) Mexico (17.72%) or China (15.43%). About the VC activity half of the backed fintechs are from the USA (48.45%) and is again followed by the UK (10.30%) and India (4.10%). In line with the general startup market the same conclusion can be made for the ratio of the fintech over the general VC market. Singapore (26.28%) Mexico (20.78%) and China   s (14.85%) penetration ratio is higher than the one of the USA (10.14%). This indicates that VC   s in the US will also invest in various other niches aside from the fintech sector. Relatively China  Sweden  and  Russia  report  the  most  VCbacked  fintechs  within  their  fintech  startup Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 40         market. In these countries more than half of the fintech startups is cofinanced by a venture capitalist.  Table 3 Description of the fintech startups per year and country. These tables represent descriptive statistics of the dependent variables over the entire sample retrieved from the Dealroom database.

Panel A documents a cross tabulation of the cultural dimensions. Panel B combines the lower and upper scales of the dimensions with the figures and ratios of the dependent variables. Panel A shows data over all seventy countries from which data about the cultural dimensions was available. It   s clear that the average scale for the cultural dimension   s masculinity and longterm orientation is somewhat in the middle scales. The crosscountry mean is more tending towards collectivism and a higher than average level of power distance is present. The latter confirms that the majority of  the  sample  has  to  comply  with  societies  where  hierarchical  order  with  an  unequally distribution  of  power  is  more  common.  However  the  uncertainty  avoidance  dimension  in approximately 70% of the countries results in a noticeable higher scale. Hofstede G. Hofstede G. J. and Minkov (2010) declare that the average person in Central Europe Latin America Japan SouthKorea Russia MiddleEast and Pakistan  which considers the majority of our sample  is more neurotic and less agreeable than in an uncertainty tolerant culture (Hofstede and Hofstede 2005; Hofstede and McCrae 2004). On the other hand    easy travellers    are China SouthEast Asia Scandinavia Anglo countries5 and India (Hofstede Hofstede & Minkov 2005). Table  4  Description  of  the  five  cultural  dimensions  of  Hofstede.  These  tables  represent  descriptive statistics  of  the  independent  variables  over  the  entire  sample  retrieved  from  the  Hofstede  Insights database and data from Geert Hofstede. Panel A reports a cross table over the different dimensions. Panel B (in appendix) shows the countries with the lower and upper scores in the Hofstede cultural dimensions combined with data about the fintech startups and VCbacked fintech startups of these countries.  Panel A Cross tabulation of cultural dimensions. The different columns represent the five Hofstede cultural dimensions. The scale is divided over four categories.    Low    represents the countries with a score of lower or equal to 25.    Mediumlow    typifies the scores over 25 until 50.    Mediumhigh    describes the countries with a score below and equal to 75.    High    shows all scores over 75 with a maximum of 100.                                                             5 Which includes United States of America United Kingdom Canada Australia New Zealand  Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 43        Count % of total Count % of total Count % of total Count % of total   Low  Mediumlow  Mediumhigh  High  Total  PDI 4 5.71% 21 30.00% 31 44.29% 14 20.00% 70 IND 22 31.43% 19 27.14% 21 30.00% 8 11.43% 70 MAS 8 11.43% 32 45.71% 26 37.14% 4 5.71% 70 UA 2 2.86% 19 27.14% 20 28.57% 29 41.43% 70  LTO 15 21.43% 24 34.29% 20 28.57% 11 15.71% 70 Panel B (in appendix) of table 4 analyses data of the Hofstede dimensions and the fintech startup market with the intention to distract trends between the independent and dependent variables. Entrepreneurship in the fintech sector is compared between the lower (025) and upper (75100) scales  within  each  cultural  factor.  However  we  recognize  that  several  other  mediators  will impact the number of crossnational fintech startups and that countries in the mediumlow and mediumhigh segment of the dimensions could have a possible significant effect towards fintech entrepreneurship. The assumed main and moderating effects of culture will be analysed later in this work. Nevertheless we want to research the impact of the most extreme cases on the fintech startup market and its financing. After the absolute number of fintech startups we introduced two ratios which control for the differences in country   s size.  In 2017 for example Brazil has more than 210 million inhabitants and Sweden around 10 million but the amount of fintechs raised is on average similar in both countries. As a result the fintech startups are a    hotter industry    in Sweden with 2.54 fintechs per 1 million inhabitants than Brazil where the average is only 0.12 fintechs. Population data per country (divided by one million) is retrieved from the World Bank to check for this effect. The first section about the power distance index shows that fintech startup formations mainly occur in countries with the lowest scores by which on average 219 fintechs are founded with 3.24 fintech startups per million capita. This is remarkably higher than highest quarter scores which report averages of 118 fintechs and only 0.17 fintech per million capita. The main driver of the lowPDI score sample is Israel where approximately 9 fintech companies are set up per one million people. According to Hofstede Insights (2019) Israelis strongly believe in decentralized Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 44         power with independency equal rights accessible superiors and empowerment as core values. A  report  of  Deloitte  (2018)  describes  Israel   s  fintech  landscape  and  concludes  that  Israel  is becoming a fintech hub in line with Silicon Valley Singapore and London. The core reasons are the  innovative  disruptive  entrepreneurial  culture  which  encourages  experimentation  and embraces  failure  and  substantial  government  support  (Deloitte  2018).    Furthermore  the absolute VC fintech activity is somewhat similar between the country split. However VCbacked fintech startup companies per 1 million inhabitants are more common in low PDI countries. The individualism cultural factor places the majority of countries in the low side of this dimension. Although comparing the fintech activity in both categories it is obvious that fintech startup formations are more widespread in individualistic countries with an average of 1 248 fintechs (against 53 fintechs) and if controlled for size 1.58 fintech per 1 million people (against 0.46). The US and UK are responsible for the largest effect. Children in the UK are taught from an early age to think for themselves and how they can uniquely contribute to society. The US society is also loosely knit in which people look after themselves. Americans are accustomed to do business with people they do not know and display initiative in the corporate world (Hofstede Insights 2019). Together with Australia Canada the Netherlands and Italy six out of the twenty largest fintech suppliers are represented in the individualism dimension   s upper level. Also it seems that VCbacked fintech startups can be found in more selfreliant societies. Furthermore the third section is about the masculinity dimension. Only a small part of the total sample shows high masculine or feminine scores. The average number of financial technology startups  in  absolute  figures  and  per  million  capita  is  higher  in  more  feminine  countries. Noticeable is that the highest ratio per 1 million inhabitants is for Lithuania a small Eastern European country with only 3 million inhabitants has 3.32 fintech per million capita. It knows a tender culture where standing out of the crowd is not admirable and where people are motivated because they just do what they like to do. The presence of venture capitalists in the fintech markets are slightly higher in the low masculinity countries. If controlled for population 42% of all fintech startups are financed by private equity players in countries low on masculinity against 39% for countries high on masculinity scores. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 45        About uncertainty avoidance only two countries have a remarkable low value for this dimension. The average of the fintech startups in these countries Singapore and Denmark is about four fintechs  per  one  million  people  higher  than  the  average  in  the  risk  averse  countries.  Both countries  are  wellknown  as  societies  of  risk  takers  that  prefer  changes  and  challenges. Furthermore it seems that VCbacked fintechs are also more present in these low uncertainty avoidance countries.  The last caption of table 4  panel B describes the longterm orientation dimension. It can be deducted that fintech entrepreneurship is more common in pragmatic countries. These countries like Germany and China report a high number of fintech startup formations but these are both countries with an enormous population. When controlled for number of fintech startups per one million people another EastEuropean country Estonia reports 6.49 fintechs during 20092017. According to Hofstede Insights (2019) Estonians show ability to adapt easily to other conditions and  have  a  tenacity  in  achieving  results.  For  example  the  longterm  vision  in  the  country becomes  clear  by  the  eEstonia6  services  offered  by  the  government.  The  amount  of  fintech startups financed by venture capitalists is highest for the LTorientated countries. On average and  controlled  for  population  almost  four  out  of  ten  fintech  startups  had  a  venture  capital injection in comparison with 25% for countries that report the lowest scores in this dimension. Moreover Table 5 in appendix describes the univariate statistics of the variables after listwise deletion of missing data points. 5.2  Bivariate statistics Table 6 (in appendix) describes the Pearson correlations of the data set. 7 We recognize that this simple  empirical  relation  between  dependent  and  independent  variables  does  not  directly indicate  the  concept  of  causation.  Extraneous  variables  called  spurious  factors  may  also intervene in the relationship between the dependent and independent variables. The effect of                                                         6 Refers to an Estonian governmental organization that facilitates citizen interactions (such as government services voting taxes education) through the use of electronic solutions. For example voting is done with an application.  7 As a robustness check the Spearman   s rho is obtained for measuring covariation between variables with an ordinal distribution and the scale dependent variable. Similar correlations were found.  Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 46         the most plausible factors based on prior research and the particular context of fintech startups is researched in the following chapter. However several patterns in the correlations are worth mentioning. Furthermore the lagged variables and the cultural factors which are rooted from country related traditions satisfy the condition of temporal precedence (Van de Ven 2007). The covariations between the dependent and independent variables are all significant. First of all  power  distance  index  is  negatively  correlated  (0.354)  with  the  new  fintech  startups formations. This is in line with the assumption in hypothesis 1 that nations with low scores on the PDI stand for more ownership and thus by following Knight   s theory more fintech startups. Moreover  a  strong  positive  relationship  (0.605)  between  individualism  and  the  number  of fintechs  is  recognized.  As  a  result  a  higher  level  of  individualism  might  lead  to  an  upwards tendency  of  fintech  startup  formations.  This  may  support  our  second  hypothesis  in  which  is assumed that the positive influence of individualism on entrepreneurial traits motivations and innovation will upwards affect the number of fintech startup formations. Hypothesis 3 suggests that neither lower nor higher values on the masculinity dimension are linked with the dependent variable. This may not be affirmed by the correlation matrix in which is shown that this cultural dimension relates positively (0.107) however weak with the dependent variable. Concerning the fourth hypothesis uncertainty avoidance is negatively (0.226) correlated with the number of fintech startups. In line with Bogatyreva et al. (2019) this may elucidate that entrepreneurs starting in a technology related sector need to be more comfortable in unstructured situations. For the longterm orientation dimension the Pearson correlation coefficient shows a positive relationship (0.285). As stated in the last hypotheses about the main effects it can be suggested that longterm working values may stimulate entrepreneurs to start fintech ventures.  Interesting to mention is that different findings can also be encountered with respect to our own correlations and those in the work of Haddad and Hornuf. For the replicated variables that will be  used  in  model  I  we  compared  both  correlation  matrices  while  acknowledging  the aforementioned limitations about correlation and causation. In line with their findings we find that the variables describing the development of the economy and capital markets are positively correlated with the dependent variable. For the ease of access to loans variable measuring the effect of the soundness of the financial system a positive correlation in both samples can be Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 47         found. Considering the availability of the latest technologies and infrastructure it can be said that  the  variables  secure  internet  servers  and  availability  of  latest  technologies  are  in  both samples positively correlated with the number of fintech startups. A difference can be found for the variable mobile telephone subscriptions. But with a very weak and insignificant correlation it can  be  concluded  that  this  variable  does  not  covariate  with  the  number  of  fintech  startup formations in both cases. Moreover the measures describing the impact of market regulations and labour force on the fintech startups show similar and so positive correlations in our research and that of Haddad and Hornuf. Overall it can thus be concluded that analogous covariations for the  corresponding  measures  between  both  samples  were  found  and  that  those  bivariate relationships are in line with three out of four hypotheses in the paper of Haddad and Hornuf (about the welldeveloped capital markets; latest technologies and infrastructure; regulation and labour  market).  Although  the  variable  ease  of  access  to  loans  shows  a  correlation  which  is opposite to the assumption that fintech startups occur more in countries with a more fragile financial  sector.  This  might  indicate  that  fintech  and  traditional  financial  services  can  be complements (Haddad & Hornuf 2018).  Both control variables that will be applied in model II show significant and positive correlations with the number of fintech startup formations. This may indicate that countries with a higher GDP  that  provide  a  richer  environment for  ventures  embrace  more  highquality entrepreneurship than countries with a medium or lowGDP. Moreover the higher value of the variable  business  regulation  may  point  out  that  countries  with  more  adaptive  institutional conditions may support entrepreneurial activities (Frese Rauch & Zhao 2012).      Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 48        Cultural determinants of fintech startups 6.  In  order  to  analyse  the  impact  of  cultural  dimensions  on  the  number  of  fintech  startup formations  we  implemented  a  multivariate  analysis  on  our  longitudinal  data  for  the  two aforementioned  models.  This  chapter  will  test  the  hypotheses  and  so  determine  whether culture  has  an  impact  on  fintech  startup  formations.  We  therefore  specify  six  different regressions  for  both  models.  The  first  five  regressions  research  the  main  effect  of  each dimension separately on the amount of fintech startups. The integral and thus sixth model includes all cultural dimensions along with the specified interaction terms of the independent variables. As mentioned in the methodology this study proposes the following random effects regression  in  which  i  indicates  the  separate  countries  (63  countries  after  listwise  deletion covering 14 452 fintechs) and t specifies the years (20092017) in our research MODEL I !"\\t("%&\\t\'(")%*+)=\\t    \\t+\\t01   34567\\t89;<=>6\\t9=86?@B\\t(1)+0D   9=89E98F<G9H@B(2)+0J   H<>FG9=9;K@B(3) +\\t0M   F=>67;<9=;K\\t<E498<=>6@B(4)+\\t0O   G4=P\\t;67H\\t4796=;<;94=\\t@B(5)+\\t0R   S=(86349;9\\t;4\\tTUV)@BW1 +\\t0X   YZ\\t<E<9G<[9G9;K@BW1+\\t0\\\\   S=\\t(TUV\\t367\\t><39;<)@BW1+\\t0]   \\t9=E6;47\\t374;6>;94=@BW1 +\\t01^   6<6\\t4_\\t<>>6\\t;4\\tG4<=@BW1+\\t011   S=\\t(6>F76\\t9=;67=6;\\t67E67)@BW1 +\\t01D   S=\\t(H4[9G6\\tF[>793;94=)@BW1\\t+\\t01J   <E<9G<[9G9;K\\t4_\\tG<;6;\\t;6>   =4G4PK@BW1\\t+\\t01M   >7689;\\tH<7a6;\\t76PFG<;94=@BW1+\\t01O   G<[4F7\\tH<7a6;\\t76PFG<;94=@BW1 +\\t01R   [F9=6\\t76PFG<;94=@BW1+\\t01X   ;76=P;   \\t4_\\tG6P<G\\t79P   ;@BW1 +\\t\\t01\\\\   \\tS=(G<[47\\t_47>6)@BW1+01]   7FG6\\t4_\\tG<5@BW1 +\\t0   b>FG;F76\\t9=;67<>;94=\\t6_6>;\\t(6)+\\t;9H6\\t6__6>;\\t+\\tF@+6@B Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 49        MODEL II !"\\t("%&\\t\'(")%*+)=    \\t+\\t01   34567\\t89;<=>6\\t9=86?@B\\t(1)+0D   9=89E98F<G9H@B(2)+0J   H<>FG9=9;K@B(3) +\\t0M   F=>67;<9=;K\\t<E498<=>6@B(4)+\\t0O   G4=P\\t;67H\\t4796=;<;94=\\t@B(5) +\\t0R   S=\\t(TUV\\t367\\t><39;<)@BW1+\\t\\t0X   [F9=6\\t76PFG<;94=@BW1 +\\t0   b>FG;F76\\t9=;67<>;94=\\t6_6>;\\t(6)+\\t;9H6\\t6__6>;\\t+\\tF@+6@B          Regression 1 main effect of power distance index (PDI) (1)  ; Regression 2 main effect of individualism (IND) (2) Regression 3 main effect of masculinity (MASC) (3) ; Regression 4 main effect of uncertainty avoidance (UA) (4) Regression 5 main effect of longterm orientation (LTO) (5); Regression 6 main effect of all cultural dimensions (15) plus associated interaction term (6) (FULL) The six regressions indicate generalized least square estimations and are thus robust against autocorrelation  and  heteroskedasticity  patterns  in  the  error  term.  Furthermore  the  panel structure of our data set alleviates multicollinearity through linking variation across countries with variation over time (Kennedy 2003).8 Random country effects ui and time dummies are inserted to clarify country or time effects that are not included in the regression. The existence of these effects is tested by the Lagrange multiplier test and indicates that the random effect is able to deal with the heterogeneity better than a pooled OLS model (Breusch & Pagan 1980). The  Hausman  test  evaluates  whether  or  not  the  individual  effect  ui is  correlated  with  other regressors in the model. As a result the random effects model is not the Best Linear Unbiased Estimate (BLUE) if such a correlation is present (Hausman 1978). Moreover we acknowledge that the fixed effects model with demeaned variables is not applicable for this study because of the timeinvariant character of the independent variables. In what follows the regression results are discussed for both models. We also test and report the Lagrange multiplier test called the BreuschPagan  test  and  Hausman  test  to  prove  that  the  random  effects  regression  is  an                                                         8 As a robustness check for multicollinearity the variance inflation factors for the independent and control variables were calculated. All values are below 10 and indicate no collinearity problems.  Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 50        adequate fit for our statistical analyses. The robustness of the results is checked by replicating both models with the dependent variable new VCbacked fintech. 6.1  Model I  The first model including all six regressions is reported in Table 7     Panel A (with Panel B as robustness check in the appendix). In order to research the first five hypotheses the main effect of the individual cultural dimensions is investigated. The last regression includes two interaction terms testing hypotheses 6 and 7. All regressions indicate that the use of a random effects model is appropriate. In general the results of all six regressions show a relatively uniform picture. It displays  that  the  majority  of  Hofstede   s  cultural  dimensions  are  not  direct  predictors  of  the prevalence  of  fintech  startup  formations  in  a  society  taken  into  account  socalled  spurious factors that are significant according to Haddad and Hornuf. Regarding PDI we find no significant relationship between the power distance index and the number  of  fintech  startup  formations.  This  does  not  support  hypothesis  1  which  assumes  a negative  relationship  between  these  variables  because  of  the     Ownership  Theory     and  the relation between power distance and extraversion. For individualism Table 7 shows that the relation between this dimension and the number of fintech startups is positive and significant (p < 0.05). This is in line with the expected combined effect of individualism on entrepreneurial traits intention and innovation described in hypothesis 2. The result therefore indicates that more fintech startup formation emerge in the 63 countries during the sample period if they are proven to be more individualistic and extravert (this Big Five trait was strongly correlated with the individualism dimension). Furthermore we find no evidence that more or less masculine values should lead to an increase of decrease fintech formations. This is in line with hypothesis 2 in which we argue that either values linked to the masculine and feminine pole of the dimensions can  be  advantages  for  startup  creation.  Moreover  uncertainty  avoidance  is  not  statistically related to the number of fintech formation during the period of 20092017. The assumption of hypothesis 4 that fewer fintech formations emerge due to smaller supply of entrepreneurs in high UAcountries therefore does not hold. Similar results were found for the LTO dimension. Although high scale values indicate a pragmatic society we cannot confirm hypothesis 5. Thus Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 51        the positive effect that the application of modern knowledge as a way to prepare for the future should  have  on  the  number  of  new  fintech  ventures  stays  out.  Finally  the  effect  of  both interaction terms in the column    FULL    is also not significant indicating that the combination of being more individualistic and less riskaverse or more pragmatic does not indicate that a country will know an upsurge in its number of fintech startup ventures.   Comparing  our  results  with  those  of  Haddad  and  Hornuf  we  find  some  conflicting  results. Overall we also discover a positive significant link between GDP per capita and fintech startup formations in the following year (p < 0.05). In addition a higher investor protection index is positively related with LN (new fintech startup) in the next year (p < 0.01). A country with this kind  of  optimized  legal  protection  which  is  present  in  financial  hubs  such  as  Silicon  Valley London  or  Singapore  leads  logically  towards  more  investors  which  can  explain  the  positive relation between both variables knowing that nowadays private equity players invest a large amount in fintech ventures. Though as indicated we use this variable as a proxy for the welldeveloped economies trying to find support for the assumption that fintech startups occur more if a country has a welldeveloped economy and capital markets. Both variables are in line with the  results  of  Haddad  and  Hornuf  and  indicate  that  fintech  formations  take  place  in  welldeveloped economies. However Haddad and Hornuf report a strong and positive relationship between VC financing and the dependent variable but we don   t find direct statistical support between our variable VC availability and the number of fintech startup formations. This result may be explained because the variable in our research measures the availability of VC capital as an answer on an ordinal scale in a crossnational survey. The measure in the work of Haddad and Hornuf gauges the total amount of VC funding of all startups (excluding the fintech startups) while our measure does not take into account the absolute amount of venture capital available over all startup ventures. For example high values for our variable VC availability are found for Hong Kong and Malaysia but the invested amount is certainly higher in the US and UK compared to the former mentioned regions. Hong Kong and Malaysia also don   t immediately show a high number of fintech startups when compared to the US and UK.  Consequently  our  sample  shows  no  evidence  that  the  presence  of  new  technologies  or supporting infrastructure should impact the number of startup formations in the fintech industry. Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 52         This is not in line with Haddad and Hornuf that find support that more fintech formations are launched in countries were secure internet servers mobile telephone subscriptions or the latest technologies are emphatically more available. Concerning their hypothesis about the frailty of the  financial  system  Haddad  and  Hornuf  included  several  variables  like     the  soundness  of banks   ;    investment profile    and the    ease of access to loans   . The latter is found to be significant and thus included in our research.9 Comparing our results with theirs no negative relationship between the dependent and this variable is found in this multivariate analysis. So easier access to corporate credits in yeart1 linked to a less frail financial system leads not directly towards an upward trend of fintech startup formations in yeart. As assumed by Haddad and Hornuf a larger and  more  varied  supply  of  labour  signalling  a  probable  higher  number  of  talent  and entrepreneurship is significant and positively related to the number of fintech startups in the following year (p < 0.01). The regulation index is in our sample in contradiction with Haddad and Hornuf split into three variables for our sample. Table 7 shows that higher a credit market index is positively related to the number of new beginning fintech ventures in the next year (p < 0.10). Accordingly  Haddad  and  Hornuf  demonstrate  that  individuals  are  more  likely  to  have entrepreneurial ambitions with a supportive regulatory regime. In this case benevolent credit markets should lead to more entrepreneurial activity in the fintech sector. Both variables are in line  with  the  hypothesis  of  Haddad  and  Hornuf  indicating  that  fintech  startups  occur  more frequently in countries with a benevolent regulation and a larger labour market. The  robustness  check  (Panel  B  in  appendix)  shows  that  the  individualism  dimension  has  no statistical positive impact anymore when the dependent variables is filtered for fintech startups that  are  or  were  VCbacked.  The  presence  of  venture  capitalists  in  a  country  takes  thus  the feature of being more entrepreneurial through individualism away. This can be explained by the fact that in large financial ecosystems a lot of private equity players provide a huge amount of capital but these financial ecosystems indicate that a higher amount of backed fintech startups is not naturally linked with a high individualism dimension. Concerning the mediators similar                                                         9 The variable    soundness of banks    measures the health of banks on a 1 (need to recapitalize)     7 (healthy) scale. The other variable    investment profile    signals the risk of investment that is not linked towards any political economic or financial risk component on a 0 (very high risk)     4 (very low risk).  Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 53         results were found when compared with the sample of panel A (with exception of the credit market regulations index).  Table 7     Panel A Regression output of model I about impact of culture on fintech startups.  This table represents a random effect regression model. Columns (1)(5) describe the main effect of the separate Hofstede dimensions on the number of new fintech startups with all significant mediators according to Haddad and Hornuf. Column (6) describes the effect of all cultural dimensions and two additional interaction terms on the dependent variable. The variables are defined in Table 2.

In order to research the first five hypotheses the main effect of the individual cultural dimensions is investigated. The last regression includes two interaction terms testing hypotheses 6 and 7. All regressions indicate that the use of a random effects model is appropriate. In contrast with model I we use the mediators (GDP per capita and business regulations) of culture suggested by Frese Rauch and Zhao.  Generally the output of all six regressions show relatively similar results as in model I in which we find that the majority of the cultural dimensions of Hofstede are not direct predictors of fintech startups. Concerning culture the results find statistical support for hypothesis 2 (IND) and hypothesis 3 (MASC) on the one hand but reject hypothesis 1 (PDI); hypothesis 4 (UA); hypothesis 5 (LTO) and hypotheses 67 (interactions) on the other hand. Even if we use mediators important to predict earlystage or highinnovation entrepreneurship we cannot find any evidence that all mentioned cultural dimensions of Hofstede are linked with more entrepreneurship in the fintech sector. This can be explained by Hofstede   s conclusion that if GNP (or GDP in our sample) per capita variable predicts  a  phenomenon  better  than  culture  the  explanation  from  cultural  dimensions  is considered to be redundant. As mentioned in literature Hofstede proved this in his sample with only GNP per capita as mediator. Individualism is the sole exception with a strong significant impact on the number of fintech startups (p < 0.01). So the assumption that the population of Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 55         individualistic  cultures  may  thus  be  more  motivated  to  pursue  the  creation  of  innovative ventures still holds. Also in line with hypothesis 3 we find no link that either high masculine or feminine values should lead to a change in the amount of fintech startup formations. The first mediator GDP per capita is used as a proxy for national wealth in the different countries. A significant positive relationship seconds the expectation of Frese Rauch and Zhao that highgrowth  and  highinnovation  entrepreneurship  is  stronger  in  highGDP  countries  (p  <  0.01). Secondly the variable business regulations is inserted as an institutional variable controlling the presence and benevolent strictness of business laws in a particular country. One should think that better corporate regulations and legislations determine individuals    choices leading towards more entrepreneurship but no empirical evidence is found for this relationship with regard to the fintech industry. The robustness check (Panel B in appendix) shows results that are mainly in line with those of Panel A. There can be deducted that the individualism dimension still has a statistical positive impact when the dependent variable is filtered for fintech startups that are or were VCbacked (p < 0.05). Checking for VCbacked companies only also indicates a significant negative impact of UA on the amount of startups in the fintech sector. This result supports the assumed negative relationship between uncertainty avoidance and VCinvestment and can be explained by the lower openness of VC towards risk taking and new ideas in high UA countries. Without including all mediators according to Haddad and Hornuf the general effect of culture over the number fintech can be calculated because the appropriate variables which control for factors other than culture national wealth and legislation are incorporated.

Within nations there may be considerable different cultures and associated institutions between groups or regions. By using nation scores of cultural dimensions variance of culture and other variables may be eliminated. Consequently a potential present impact of culture may not have been found due to the nature of the data. Secondly it is possible that cultural dimensions interact with other variables that are not present in the data set. High education levels could for example provide individuals with more knowledge that  can  be  applied  to  develop  fintech  services.  This  variable  could  interact  with  longterm orientation  and  lead  to  more  wellthought  out  business  plans  with  a  viable  innovative technology.  Another  example  is  the  presence  of  sandboxes  which  stimulate  the  creation  of fintech startups. This variable was omitted in the models of this study and should preferably be included in future research. Another  limitation  that  may  hide  the  impact  of  culture  on  the  startup  rates  is  the  dataset. Although we add as many countries as possible there are few countries included that score low on power distance masculinity or uncertainty avoidance. For these dimensions the amount of countries in the    low    category represent less than 12% of all nations. This indicates that the variance of these cultural dimensions may be low and reduces the possibility to use them as explaining  variables.  Particularly  power  distance  and  uncertainty  avoidance  illustrate  how concentrated  the  values  on  some  cultural  dimensions  can  be.  The  aggregated  proportion  of nations scoring mediumlow and mediumhigh for these dimensions amounts to over 74% and 82% respectively.Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 58            Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 59        Conclusion 7.  The  prevalence  of  fintech  activity  varies  strongly  between  countries  and  is  definitely  more present in financial centres. However fintech is globally recognized as a strong emerging market and belongs to the top three sectors in which is invested in 2018. The main scope of this paper is to discover the impact of Hofstede   s cultural dimensions on fintech startup rates during 20092017 over a crosscountry sample. Using two models we find limited support for this because only the main effect of individualism seems to be a robust positive predictor of the startups. The individualism  dimension  may  explain  the  higher  rates  through its  association  with entrepreneurial  intention  entrepreneurial  traits  such  as  extraversion  and  adaptation  of innovations. Furthermore our research also shows that the genderrelated cultural dimension masculinity shows no impact on fintech formations and is in line with the inconclusive literature about masculinity and entrepreneurship. The other cultural dimensions did not show a significant coefficient resulting in the rejection of their corresponding hypotheses. The sole exception was a  significant  negative  effect  of  uncertainty  avoidance  over  the  sample  of  VCbacked  fintech formations. This conclusion is in line with those of Li and Zahra (2012) or Cumming et al. (2016). Moreover the tested moderating effects between individualism and uncertainty avoidance or longterm  orientation  seems  to  have  no  effect  on  fintech  startup  rates.  In  general  we  can conclude that culture thus appear to play a role in explaining startup rates in the fintech sector. The structure of the study also allowed to partly replicate the model of Haddad and Hornuf (2018) and to confirm their findings. Our results are mostly in line with their results and show a positive impact of welldeveloped economies larger labour market and benevolent regulation on the amount of fintech startups. We could however not find support that the appearance of fintech startups is more common in countries that dispose of the newest technologies and associated supporting infrastructure available. Consequently our sample cannot confirm the hypothesis that the frailty of the financial sector influences fintech startup rates.    Germonpr   Toon & Lefevre Jenten 60        8.

This table describes all countries that have a    low    or    high    score on the cultural dimensions combined with data over the fintech startups and its VC financing activity. The column    new fintech startups per 1M capita    describes the amount of fintech startups per one million inhabitants in a country over the entire nineyear sample period.    New VCbacked fintech startups per 1M capita    is calculated by applying the same methodology but for the VCbacked fintech startups. Both ratios are computed by dividing the fintech startup data from Dealroom with population figures per one million people. The population data is retrieved from the  World  Bank   s  World  Development  Indicators  database.  The     ratio  VCbacked  fintech  startups  over  fintech startups per 1M capita    in column (6) is calculated by dividing the aforementioned computed variables. The column (2) and (4) are described under panel A of table 3 but are here calculated for the separate countries with the lower (025) or upper (75100) score of the power distance/individualism/masculinity/longterm orientation or uncertainty avoidance dimensions.
