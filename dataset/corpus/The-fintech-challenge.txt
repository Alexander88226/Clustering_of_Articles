They  are  the  so  called  11  BCEE  countries.  One  of  the  core  issues  of  Europeanization (Sig  r 2008) is whether the EU serves as an anchor during the transformation process of the postcommunist countries i.e. whether the EU is able to be the point of reference and  to  catalyze  the  process  of  changes.  The  socialist  economic  past is  dominant  in  the countries of the  BCCEregion. Communism lasted for more  than seventy years in the 3 Baltic states and approximately for forty years in Central and EasternEuropean states. After having gained independence from the Soviet Union the 3 Baltic states lost half of their  GDP  the  rapid  growth  thereafter  made  up  for  these  losses.  BCEE  region  reaches one fourth of EU   s territory and one fifth of the EUs total population (see Table 1).                                                   1 This paper was presented at the conference    Firm Behavior in Central and Eastern Europe Productivity Innovation  and  Trade     Summer  Academy  Akademie  f  r  Politische  Bildung  Tutzing  on  Lake  Starnberg Germany June 1113 2018. 2 junior research fellow Centre for Economic and Regional Studies of the Hungarian Academy of Sciences Institute  of  World  Economics  T  th  K  lm  n  str.  4  H1097  Budapest  Hungary.

During less than two decades the private sector share in GDP has increased from 30% to 75% in Poland from 25% to 80% in Hungary and from 10% to 80% in Estonia (EBRD 2015 Estrin et al. 2009). Before the change of system  the  BCEEcountries  were  slow  to  adopt  (or  steal)  revolutionary  innovations from the capitalist world. After the change of system the rate of adoption in the region accelerated  rapidly.  The  transformation  of  the  former  communist  countries  has  been unique however the glass is half full because the transformation took place successfully peacefully and was an astonishingly fast process towards a western mode of economic development  but  the  glass  was  half  empty  also  because  on  the  other  hand  it  was characterized  by  deep  economic  troubles  such  us  corruption  (Kornai  2006)4.  Since joining to the European Union CEE and Baltic countries experienced a historically neverexperienced capital inflow due to the EUfunds.                                                  4  Kornai  recently  decided  to  revisit  the  transformation  topic  thoroughly  by  a  systematic  comparative model focusing to every 48 former socialistic countries (Kornai 2016b).   3    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries    Macroeconomy in the BCEE11 region In  this  section  the  most  important  economic  trends  of  the  BCEE11  countries  are presented  in  a  comprehensive  way.  First  I  compare  the  GDP  growth  second  the Convergence  process  of  the  region  (GKI  2013)  third  I  present  how  the  cohesion  and structural funds received from the EU have been used this region.  Growth The global financial and economic crisis started in late summer 2007 in the subprime real estate market of the US and spilled over to the real economy. It led to a sovereign debt crisis in 2009.  Let   s  compare  the  GDP  the  15  earlier  EU  members  with  the  11  new  postsocialist members after the transformation began and in the recent past. Before the crisis the unweighted average of GDP was growing much faster in BCEE than in EU15. Comparing the values if the GDP in 2010 was 100% GDP was 78 percent in the EU15 and 623 percent in the BCEE11 in 1996 but 1054 percent in the EU15 and 1023 in the BCEE in 2007 and but 1095 percent in the EU15 and 1202 percent in the BCEE11 in 2016 (Figure 1).

Note  The  figures  of  the  individual  country  groups  are  unweighted  averages. Hightechnology exports are products with high R&D intensity such as in aerospace computers pharmaceuticals scientific instruments and electrical machinery.   4    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   Recession  took  place  in  2009  in  the  EU.  The  BCEE11  countries  were  relatively resilient  to  the  crisis  until  September  2008  when  the  US  investment  bank  Lehman Brothers collapsed. The reason for this  was that banks in BCEE countries did not have toxic financial assets in their portfolio. After the default of Lehman Brothers the global financial and economic crisis intensified globally and in the BCEE region also. The major reasons why BCEE11 countries were seriously affected by the global crisis included  dependence  on  external  financing  the  high  role  of  export  in  their  economies and  the  existing  macroeconomic  imbalances.  Increasing  risk  aversion  of  foreign investors  generally  and  especially  towards  the  region  the  contraction  of  external demand  and  deleveraging  by  financial  institutions  had  a  more  adverse  impact  on  the BCEE11 economies than on the developed industrial ones. Otherwise the substantially lower level of public debt relative to GDP of the BCEE11 countries compared to the EU average was an important advantage for them. As far as the  impact  of  the  crisis  is  concerned  Poland  was  the  single  country  not  only  in  the BCEE11 but in the whole EU as well that has recorded positive GDP growth rates in each year  since  2008.  In  spite  of  the  sharp  contraction  in  2009  Bulgaria  and  Romania reached slightly positive annual average growth rates later Slovakia even a more robust one. The first contraction of GDP was roughly the same in the Czech Republic Hungary and Slovenia but in these countries recession took place not only in 2009 but in 2012 as well. On the other hand in the Baltic region recession started in early 2008 well before the collapse of the Lehman Brothers and they suffered doubledigit fall of GDP in 2009. Nonetheless they rebounded quite quickly in the subsequent years although their GDP has not reached precrisis levels. Before the crisis the Baltic countries grew rapidly even at unsustainable rates their economies were overheated; this was not the case in most of  the  other  BCEE11  countries  except  Bulgaria  and  Romania.  The  recession  was  more prolonged and thereby deeper in Croatia than in rest of the BCEE11 region (GKI 2013).   5    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   Convergence  Europe  has  invented  a  Convergence  Machine  which  functions  so  that  the  EU welcomes  poor  countries  and  helps  them  to  become  highincome  economies  (Harrold and  Hahm  2012.  The     Convergence  Machine     is  certainly  an  opportunity  but  not  a guarantee.  The  EU  is  powerless  even  regarding  its  own  member  states  when  the requirements  did  not  reflect  the  domestic  political  and  social  convictions  but  they appear only as external expectations (Gy  rffy 2008). There is certain evidence that in case of BCEE countries the EU served as an anchor during  their  transformation  process.  These  economies  had  a  point  of  orientation  all across the years of their systemic change. The European Commission tried to maximize its  leverage  following  from  the  broad  mandate  it  had  as  well  as  from  its  being  the conductor of the accession negotiations. Signaling and screening were widely used both in  formal  and  informal  matters.  Beyond  the  formal  pressure  the  informal     beauty contest     among  the  accession  countries  in  Baltic  and  Central  and  Eastern  Europe  did help sustain the reformist momentum in otherwise sensitive areas (Sig  r 2018). It is important to note that in historic terms the BCEE11 countries had set to integrate into  the  EU  in  the  late  1980s  and  early  1990s  and  simultaneously  to  this  the convergence  to  the  development  level  inter  alia  in  terms  of  per  capita  GDP  of  the  EU started their dependence on external sources and their rather huge imbalances were a natural consequence of this process. Before the global financial and economic crisis the convergence process of the BCEE region in terms of GDP growth was remarkable (Figure 2).  The  rate  of  convergence  was  the  fastest  at  Baltic  countries  from  1995  until  2004 than Romania and Bulgaria gains momentum. Cohesion  policy  was  introduced  after  the  Mediterranean  enlargement  (1988).  Its main goal was supporting regional convergence. After the Eastern enlargement between 2007  and  2013  the  main  goal  was  also  convergence  by  supporting  growth  and employment in the less developed regions. It had the following eligibility criteria       Regions GDP/capita less than 75% of EU average     Individual countries GNI/capita less than 90% of EU average    6    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   The  second  goal  of  EU  funds  was  to  strengthen  the  competitiveness.  During  this period Baltic states and Hungary were the biggest beneficiaries. In Hungary 3% of GDP per annum (to comparison Marshall plan reached 2% after WWII in Western European countries  and  lasted  only  for  a  couple  of  years)  and  57%  of  public  investments  was supported by EU Funds. Figure 2. Volume indices of real expenditure per capita in PPS (EU15=100) Source Eurostat 2018b  We might ask if according to the standard growth model is slower convergence only the result of the higher starting point? The answer is no (Figure 3). Figure 3. Volume indices of real expenditure per capita in PPS (EU15=100) Source Eurostat 2018b author   s calculation    7    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   We can note that the initial level only partly explains the differences between the rate of  convergence.  If  we  compare  GDP  per  capita  in  PPS  change  in  percentage  points between  20162004  (EU15=100)  the  correlation is  not  high  but  taking into consideration the labor productivity we can find a much higher correlation (see Figure 456).

From 2008  to  2012  the  convergence  process  came  to  a  halt  in  the  Baltic  countries  Croatia Slovenia and Hungary. It  slowed  down  significantly in the  rest of the  BCEE11 with the exception of Poland where it continued at the same speed. Convergence continued but at  a  slower  rate.  There  were  significant  differences  among  countries.  Countryspecific differences  may  reflect  the  differences  in  the  effectiveness  of  Eufund  absorption.  Real convergence remains far from being complete. EUfunds will remain available between 2014 and 2020 where 40% of all funds goes to the Visegrad countries. A more efficient usage of EU funds is key. The  QUESTmodel  is  developed  by  the  Directorate  General  for  Economic  and Financial Affairs of the European Commission. The model simulates the impact of policy interventions  on  a  large  number  of  economic  variables  relevant  to  cohesion  and  rural development  policies  such  as  GDP  employment  wages  productivity  or  investment from  the  private  sector.  The  model  belongs  to  the  class  of  NewKeynesian  dynamic general  equilibrium  (DGE)  models  that  are  now  widely  used  in  economic  policy institutions.  The  model  describes  fully  the  dynamics  of  the  system  in  a  general equilibrium  framework  where  changes  in  the  conditions  for  a  particular  block  are transmitted  to  the  other  blocks  through  various  market  interactions.  The  model  is regularly used for the analysis of key fiscal and monetary policy scenarios for assessing the impact of the structural reforms for contributing to the economic projections of DG ECFIN. This type of approach allows to examine the outcome of various policy scenarios taking  into  consideration  the  manner  in  which  interventions  affect  the  allocation  of resources  throughout  the  economy  thus  enabling  an  analysis  of  policy  impacts  at  the macroeconomic  level.  The  model  provides  a  fully  microfounded  integrated  and optimizationbased representation of the economies of the Member States. Cohesion and rural  development  support  is  a  major  opportunity  but  the  way  in  which  it  is  used  is being debated. The impact of the EU\'s cohesion and rural development resources in the 20072013  budget  period  is  difficult  to  take  into  account.  The  analysis  based  on  the Quest model contributes to the understanding of the macroeconomic potential impacts of the cohesion and rural funds invested in 27 Member States during the period 20072015.   10    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   QUEST  is  structured  around  building  blocks  which  represent  the  behavior  of fundamental economic agents and interactions. However a recently published analysis shows the impacts on GDP TFP Wages Investments and trade balance of cohesion and rural development policies deviation from baseline (DG REGIO 2016). In the short term it  was  Hungary  which  optimized  the  funds  but  in  a  longer  term  Poland  shows  better results (Table 2.)  Table 2.

The model features two main types of firms producers of  intermediate  and  final  goods  and  services  and  R&D  producers  of  patents.  Firms  produce  goods  and services  by  combining  technology  physical  capital  and  labor.  The  production  technology  is  enhanced  by acquiring  new  processes  from  the  R&D  sector  which  generates  innovation  by  mobilizing  resources (primarily highly skilled labor). This in turn increases the productivity of producers of goods and services. The  main  challenge  is  how  avoid  the  middle  income  trap  (Golonka  et  al  2015)  in BCEE countries. The precrisis growth models are not sustainable any more. The earlier engines of GDP and productivity gains are fading due to       demographical challenges      lower FDI inflows      weaker global demand     the 4th industrial revolution   11    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries    Let   s compare some indicators of the 15 earlier EU members with the 11 new postsocialist members after transformation began and in the recent past. High tech exports as a proportion of the manufactured were 16 percent in the EU15 and 5 percent in the BCEE11 in 1996 but 14 percent in the EU15 and 10 percent in the BCEE11 in 2016. The proportions of internet users in the population was 5 percent in the EU15 and 2 percent in  the  BCEE11  in  1996  but  85  percent  in  the  EU15  and  74  percent  in  the  BCEE11  in 2016.  Mobile  telephone  penetration  was  12  percent  in  the  EU15  and  2  percent  in  the BCEE11 in 1996 but 124 percent in the EU15 and 129 percent in the BCEE11 in 2016. The  postsocialist  countries  initially  far  behind  in  their  use  of  modern  means  of communication  have  now  more  or  less  overtaken     traditional     capitalist  countries  in this respect (see Figures 789).

If  we  focus  on  the  Competitiveness  Index  relevant  pillar  we  can  see  a  stagnation (Figure 10).   13    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   Figure 10. Competitiveness Index 8th pillar Financial market development  Source WEF (2018) An efficient financial sector allocates the resources saved by a nation   s population as well as those entering the economy from abroad to the entrepreneurial or investment projects  with  the  highest  expected  rates  of  return  rather  than  to  the  politically connected. Business investment is critical to productivity. Therefore economies require sophisticated  financial  markets  that  can  make  capital  available  for  privatesector investment  from  such  sources  as  loans  from  a  sound  banking  sector  wellregulated securities exchanges venture capital and other financial products. In order to fulfill all those  functions  the  banking  sector  needs  to  be  trustworthy  and  transparent  and   as has  been  made  so  clear  recently   financial  markets  need  appropriate  regulation  to protect investors and other actors in the economy at large (WEF 2018). The Digital Economy and Society Index (DESI) is a composite index that summarizes some 30 relevant indicators on Europe   s digital performance and tracks the evolution of EU  Member  States  across  five  main  dimensions  Connectivity  Human  Capital  Use  of Internet Integration of Digital Technology Digital Public Services. According to the last composite index in the BCEE region the Baltic states Slovenia and Estonia are the front runners while Bulgaria Romania Poland and Hungary are lagging behind (Figure 11.)   14    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries  Figure 11. Digital Economy and Society Index (2018)  Source European Commission Digital Scoreboard (2018)   The role of innovations Joseph  Schumpeter  defined  the  innovation  phenomenon  (Schumpeter  1912).  He described  it  as  the  critical  dimension  of  economic  change.  Innovation  is  preceded  by invention.  The  first  step  is  made  by  the  inventor  the  professional  or  amateur researcher the academic scholar or the company   s engineer is the one to whom the new idea occurs. However the originality of the idea its novelty and its ingenuity are not at all  enough.  In  the  second  step  the  invention  becomes  an  innovation;  the  practical marketlaunch begins that is the organization of production and the diffusion of the new product or the application of a new organizational form. In capitalism the entrepreneur plays a  distinguished role. Innovative entrepreneurship is a  function a  role which can be fulfilled by an individual alone or by teaming up with one or more partners or with the support of a small firm. However even a large firm can function as an entrepreneur. The main point is that the entrepreneur is the one who matches together the necessary financial  and  personal  conditions  that  the  innovation  requests  for  in  other  words  the human  resources the physical  instruments and the  financial resources essential to the activity (Kornai 2010 pp. 711). In some cases it might occur that the inventors and the innovators are the same persons. The  process  of  innovation  and  the  dynamics  of  firms     entry  and  exit  are  closely associated. Schumpeter coined the notion    creative destruction    for the latter concisely and precisely describing the two inseparable sides of fast technical progress. It is easy to appreciate happy arrivals in the business world especially if they appear in the form of   15    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   successful  innovators.  But  there  is  no  fast  progress  without  the  sad  events  of bankruptcies business failure exits and the accompanying bitter phenomena of layoffs and  unemployment  (Kornai  2010  pp.  2526).  Indeed  there  have  appeared  albeit sporadically in parts of the postsocialist region innovations that count as revolutionary in global  scale (e. g. Graphisoft  innovations  in architectural design  or those of Prezi in teaching and business presentations) (Kornai 2016a). Prezi  has more than 100 million user. Technical progress is accelerating. The empirical observation known as Moore   s Law states  that  technical  development  or  certain  partial  processes  within  it  can  be described  by  a  high  exponential  growth  path  (Brock  2006)  Kurzweil  2006).  The  most dynamic area of change is occurring in a sphere variously termed the high tech sector the  computer  world  or  the  sphere  of  digital  technologies.  Think  back  to  the  earliest central  computers.  Kurzweil  an  outstanding  innovator  in  the  hitech  sector  recalls (Kurzweil  2006  p.  102)  the  type  7094  IBM  computer  in  use  in  1967  on  which  he himself worked as a student at MIT. Kurzweil compares its parameters with those of a 2004  notebook.  A  decade  later  the  comparison  can  be  made  with  a  smartphone.  The    prehistoric    machine occupied a whole room whereas a smartphone fits in the palm of a  hand.  The  earlier  machine  sold  at  a  horrific  price  expressed  as  $11  million  at  2003 prices  whereas  an  outstanding  smartphone  again  at  2003  prices  cost  $400  i.  e.  less than 0.004 percent of the earlier one (Table 3).

The    60s computer could be used only for calculations. Today   s smartphone can be used  for  many  other  functions.  Meanwhile  performance  underwent incredible   16    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   development.  Processor  speed  improved  extremely.  The  steepness  of  the  high  tech sector   s  exponential  development  can  also  be  conveyed  in  another  form  the  average period  of  performancedoubling  in  many  processes  over  a  lengthy  period  has  been around  two  years.  Processor  performance  for  instance  doubles  every  1.8  years.  The effect of technical development occurring in the information/communications sector is not  confined  to  the  two  spheres  (family  life  and  recreation)  given  as  an  illustration.  It extends  to  all  dimensions  of  human  activity  and  interhuman  relations.  It  transforms production  turnover  and  consumption  the  technical  processes  of  income  and  wealth movements  as  well  as  teaching  scientific  research  and  health  care.  New  forms  of contact are appearing in retail (etrade). Technical progress and the globalization closely associated  with it  have  vastly  accelerated  financial  transactions  and  radically transformed  the  activity  of  the  financial  sector.  Radical  changes  have  occurred  in  all social  activity  military  attack  and  national  defense  crime  and  law  enforcement acquisition  of  political  power  and  protest  against  it  culture  and  cultural  garbage  the spread of noble ideas and of falsehoods     the list could be continued far longer Kornai (2016a).  Innovations in financial services  While in the biotechnology or pharmaceutical industries innovation functions are at focus  point  of  their  competitive  advantage  financial  services  have  neither  the  culture nor  the  experience  of  setting  up  innovation  functions  and  absorbing  their  products (Sonea 2016 p. 176). Almost a century ago John M. Keynes described the belle  poque as the follows    the inhabitant  of  London  could  order  by  telephone  sipping  his  morning  tea  in  bed  the various products of the whole earth in such quantity as he might see fit and reasonably expect their early delivery upon his doorstep; he could at the same moment and by the same means adventure his wealth in the natural resources and new enterprises of any quarter of the world and share without exertion or even  trouble in their prospective fruits and advantages; or he could decide to couple the security of his fortunes with the good faith of the townspeople of any substantial municipality in any continent that fancy   17    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   or  information  might  recommend     (Keynes  1919).     If  we  replace     telephone     with  a    tablet    we have not the start of the Twentieth Century but the Twenty First a century in which  opportunities  are  no  longer  limited  to  men  of  the  City.  Nonetheless  finance continues  to  be  arranged  around  a  series  of  hubs  like  brokers  clearing  houses  and exchanges;  whereas in  other  domains  people form  connections  directly instantaneously  and  openly  and  this  is  revolutionizing  how  they  consume  work  and communicate.  The  extent  to  which  finance  continues  democratizing  and  transforming depends  on  superficially  arcane  but  fundamentally  vital  enabling  technologies.  The emergence  of  mobile  telephony  the  ubiquity  of  the  internet  availability  of  highspeed computing  advances  in  cryptography  and  innovations  in  machine  learning  could combine  to  enable  rapid  changes  in  finance       just  as  they  have  in  other  areas  of  the economy    (Carney 2016 p. 3). Nowdays innovation is on the rise in financial services. Banks have invested heavily in their  customers  and  many  are  building  compelling  experiences  that  will  meet customers     needs  as  never  before.  (McKinsey  2018).  Today  the  mobile  internet transport data. The information once a prized possession in the hands of a select few is now at the fingertips of anyone who wants to use it and act upon it. The trouble today is that  there  is  too  much  information  coming  from  many  different  sources.  This  making sense  of  it  all  correlating  and  putting  it  to  a  good  use  has  become  an  art       not  the information gathering process itself. (   ) Physical store locations are threatened and are becoming a burden and a liability. Pure play digital merchants of goods and services are slowly  creating  a  perception  that  it  is  the  only  way  to  go  and  bricksandmortar enterprises could soon become extinct (Huljev 2016). Financial institutions increased their use of IT in their internal operations gradually replacing  most  forms  of  paperbased  mechanisms  by  the  1980s  as  computerization proceeded  and  risk  management  technology  developed  to  manage  internal  risks.  One early  example  of  a  form  of  financial  technological  innovation  is  very  familiar  today  to financial professionals. Michael Bloomberg started Innovation Market Solutions in 1981 after leaving Solomon Brothers where he had designed inhouse computer systems. By 1984  Bloomberg  terminals  were  in  everincreasing  usage  among  financial  institutions (Arner et al. 2015 p. 10)   18    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   Until  the  Lehmancrisis  the  world   s  major  retail  banks  dominated  the  financial services  landscape  they  enjoyed  a  high  degree  of  public  trust.  All  have  changed afterwards. Financial  innovation  financial  engineering  or  securitization  is  one  of  the  decisive factors  that  has  greatly  contributed  to  the  financial  shock.  Financial  innovation  or financial engineering refers to the ongoing development of financial products designed to achieve particular client objectives. Examples of objectives sought by those financial products include assisting in obtaining finance through diverse funding instruments and offsetting  a  particular  risk  exposure  such  as  the  default  of  a  borrower.  The  financial products  relevant  to  the  current  financial  crisis  are  the  AdjustableRate  Mortgages (ADR)  the  bundling  of  subprime  mortgages  into  MortgageBased  Securities  (MBS)  or Collateralized  Debt  Obligations  (CDO)  for  sale  to  investors  and  Credit  Default  Swaps (CDS)  which  is  a  form  of  credit  insurance.  The  usage  of  these  products  expanded dramatically  in  the  years  leading  up  to  the  crisis.  Such  financial  innovation  enabled financial  institutions  to  obtain  investor  funds  to  finance  lending  including  subprime mortgages hence contributing to the housing bubble and spreading the losses to a larger investment base. (Hussein 2013 p. 3) Did financial innovations play a role in the Financial Crisis of 20072008? No doubt. By  the  time  of  the  financial  crisis  some  financial  innovations  were  sufficiently widespread that the financial difficulties were bound to touch them and have additional effects because of them. (Dwyer 2011 p. 10). The (mis)use of certain financial innovations such as collateralized debt obligations (CDOs) has been regarded as a contributor to the crisis by detaching the credit risk of the underlying loan from the loan originator. If traditional financial service providers reposition themselves as    infrastructure    or banks of service behind new trusted nonfinancial brands they may no longer need to fight to remain costly retail brands. But is this going to happen? The early signs suggest yes and the pace of change is fast. In the same one year Facebook launched free friendtofriend  payment  Atom  launched  its  appbased  challenger  bank  Alibaba  opened  the   19    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   online Mybank and Amazon offered loans to SMEs which sell through its platform (Kleij 2016) David Nicholson who might be the father of the Peertopeer lending   s idea said that    I started thinking about (   ) what   s a bank for what does a bank really do and therefore what  opportunities  are  there  to  think  about  how  that  could  change  and  what   s  really important to a bank. Obviously banks do a huge number of things but for a retail bank a lot of it   s quite simple. It   s about matching up deposits with loans and actually acting as an  intermediary  between  somebody  with  a  deposit  and  somebody  with  a  loan   But actually that sort of got me starting to think around well what if there are other places that could act as that intermediary? Why does it have to be a bank that sits inbetween depositors  and  people  who  are  borrowing  money?  I  sort  of  was  building  a  deeper understanding of what   s really going on here and what   s really going on in a bank (   ) why banks have been the institutions that have been capable of doing those because you wind back 100 or 200 years you didn   t have any of the information or the systems or the  technology  that  would  enable  anybody  else  to  do  that  intermediary  function    (Bholat & Atz 2016). Let us take the example of Renaud Laplanche   s famous inspiration that he got when started asking himself why it was in the modern technology age that if he put money in the bank he got two percent and if he tried to take money he tried to borrow money from  the  bank  on  his  credit  card  he  paid  17  percent  and  this  was  in  the  era  of computers.  Since  Renaud  Laplanche  had  that  insight  spreads  administers  of  costs  in mainstream banks have risen not fallen (Summers 2015). The emergence of FinTech phenomenon Competition in the FinTech space is developing at the global level. As it often happens in innovative markets the key for success lies in a large domestic market which allows successful companies to achieve a scale enabling them to aim at global leadership. In the long  term  European  FinTech  players  would  be  at  a  significant  disadvantage  vis  vis their  US  and  Chinese  competitors  if  the  European  markets  remain  segmented  along national  borders  with  different  sets  of  rules  and  uncoordinated  actions  by  local authorities    (Enria 2018 p. 3).    20    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   Financial  Technology  is  one  of  the  most  innovative  increasingly  important  and potentially the most rapid change in financial services revolutionizing the way financial services  firms  operate  and  transforming  debt  and  equity  markets  payments  credit assessment regulatory compliance personal finance and many other facets of financial services. The Golden Age of FinTech has come according to FinTech Evangelists on the other hand current hype about FinTech is not due to the alleged revolutionary character of the technologies but to their better visibility.  Examples  of  FinTech  include  digital  ledger  technology  roboadvice  RegTech (technologies that can be used for compliance and reporting requirements) and virtual currencies.  Today  a  financial  conference  would  not  meet  the  expectations  of  the mainstream  if  it  missed  an  item  on  the  agenda  if  the  word  "FinTech  "  would  not  be present.  A  group  of  researchers  define  the  FinTech  phenomenon  as  technologyenabled financial solutions (Arner et al. 2015). In their reading the FinTech phenomenon is not limited to certain banking activities (e.g. financing) or business models (e.g. peertopeer lending  applications)  but  encompasses  the  kinds  of  products  and  services  that  have traditionally been provided by banks to their customers. Others (McAuley 2015 Kim et al. 2016) interpret the phenomenon more broadly defining it as an economic industry composed  of  companies  that  use  technology  to  make  financial  systems  more  efficient. The ECB   s position is that    FinTech    is an umbrella term encompassing a wide variety of business  models.  In  line  with  the  ECB   s  responsibilities  a  guide  has  been  produced relating to technologysupported banking products and services (ECB 2017). According to  McKinsey  FinTechs  are  financial  technology  firms/technology  innovations  in  the financial  sector  originating  from  startups  banks  and  nonbank  players  (McKinsey 2018). The  level  of  FinTech  financing  is  booming.  FinTech  companies  for  the  past  decade have  moved  quickly  forcing  incumbents  to  rethink  their  core  business  models  and embrace digital innovations. Globally at last count nearly $ 165 billion of venture capital and growth equity has been deployed to FinTechs over the decade and this number is growing quickly (see Table 4 and Figure 12).    21    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries    Table 1.

Now  the  FinTech  industry  is  itself  maturing  and  entering  a  period  of  rapid  change (Dietz  et  al.  2016).  The  total  estimated  number  of  FinTech  firms  established  in  each jurisdiction  and  anticipated  growth  trends  (EBA  2017).  The     borderless     nature  of FinTech and the continued trend towards disintermediation in the provision of financial services  (EBA  2018  p.  11).  In  developed  markets  consumers  have  historically gravitated  toward  the  established  and  enduring  brands  in  banking  and  insurance  that were seen as bulwarks of stability even in times of turbulence (McKinsey 2016). FinTech sector in China has been developing rapidly and is world leading by several measures. The country   s digital payments account for almost half the global volume and online peertopeer (P2P) lending accounts for three quarters of the global total. China   s   22    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   FinTech sector is now at a critical juncture. The Chinese government   s attitude towards FinTech  has  become  progressively  more  complex  as  risks  have  piled  up  around  P2P platforms  and  the  number  of  underground  fund  raising  and  financing  activities  have grown.  The  authorities  remain  generally  supportive  despite  some  recent  tightening measures (PWC China 2017). China\'s  commercial  banks  and  some  large  internet  enterprises  had  stayed  ahead  in the international market in terms of financial technology practice. They should take the advantage  to  integrate  related  technologies  and  make  these  technologies  their  patents and  use  these  patent  advantages  to  change  the  process  of  international  financial industry  form  new  industrial  standards  and  enhance  the  core  competitiveness  of China\'s banking industry (Ker  nyiM  ller 2018a). The  Chinese  government  gave  players  a  free  hand  to  experiment.  Lighttouch   or more  accurately  late   regulation  of  digital  activities  and  players  in  China  has encouraged  entrepreneurship  and  experimentation.  While  the  response  of  regulators lagged behind market developments China   s internet giants were relatively free to test and  commercialize  products  and  services  and  to  gain  critical  mass.  For  example regulators took 11 years after Alipay introduced online money transfers in 2005 to set a cap on the value of the transfers. It was five years after Alipay introduced barcodebased payment  solutions  that  Chinese  regulators  produced  an  official  standard  on management requirements (McKinsey 2017).  In the European Union the importance of digital technology has been realized and it is  considered  an  issue  of  paramount  strategic  economic  and  social  importance.  The European Commission declared that the new digital technology will be a key element in the future competitive edge of the EU. As a consequence to this development since May 2015 the European Union has been delivering on an ambitious and comprehensive Digital Single Market Strategy which was accomplished by midSeptember 2017. The DSM Strategy is built around (i) improving access to goods services and content; (ii) creating the appropriate legal framework for digital networks and services and (iii) reaping the benefits of a databased economy. It has  been  estimated  that  the  Strategy  could  contribute     415  billion  per  year  to  the  EU   23    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   economy and create hundreds of thousands of new jobs consequently it would be hard to understate the importance of timely implementation (European Commission 2017). Having the strategic aim to build a more competitive and innovative financial market on March 8 2018 the European Commission unveiled a FinTech Action Plan on how to harness  the  opportunities  presented  by  technologyenabled  innovation  in  financial services.    Europe  should  become  a  global  hub  for  FinTech  with  EU  businesses  and  investors able  to  make  most  of  the  advantages  offered  by  the  Single  Market  in  this  fastmoving sector.  As  a  first  major  deliverable  the  Commission  is  also  putting  forward  new  rules that will help crowdfunding platforms to grow across the EU\'s single market. Action Plan envisages  to  enable  the  financial  sector  to  make  use  of  the  rapid  advances  in  new technologies  such  as  blockchain  artificial  intelligence  and  cloud  services.  At  the  same time  it  seeks  to  make  markets  safer  and  easier  to  access  for  new  players.  This  will benefit  consumers  investors  banks  and  new  market  players  alike.  In  addition  the Commission is proposing a panEuropean label for platforms so that a platform licensed in one  country can operate  across the  EU. The Action Plan  is  part of the  Commission\'s efforts  to  build  a  Capital  Markets  Union  (CMU)  and  a  true  single  market  for  consumer financial  services.  It  is  also  part  of  its  drive  to  create  a  Digital  Single  Market.  The Commission  aims  to  make  EU  rules  more  futureoriented  and  aligned  with  the  rapid advance of technological development    (European Commission 2018). The  FinTech  Roadmap  is  an  important  summary  of  the  necessary  and  envisaged regulatory  approach  related  to  the  services  provided  by  the  incumbent  banks  and FinTech  startups  (EBA  2018).  In  general  this  pragmatic  attitude  revolves  around  a tiered regulatory structure with differentiated regulatory requirements according to the risks  for  the  firms  their  customers  the  financial  sector  and  the  economy  at  large.  In principle  the  objective  is  to  deliver     same  risk       same  rules     outcomes.     The  EBA\'s FinTech  Roadmap  describes  its  priorities  for  2018/2019  and  provides  an  indicative timeline for the completion of these tasks. The priorities are      monitoring the regulatory  perimeter including assessing current authorization  and  licensing  approaches  to  FinTech  firms  and  analyzing   24    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   regulatory  sandboxes  and  innovation  hubs  in  order  to  identify  a  set  of  best practices to enhance consistency and facilitate supervisory coordination;      monitoring  emerging  trends  and  analyzing  the impact  on incumbent institutions\'  business  models  and  the  prudential  risks  and  opportunities arising from the use of FinTech       promoting  best  supervisory  practices  on  assessing  cybersecurity  and promoting a common cyber threat testing framework;      addressing consumer issues arising from FinTech  in particular in the areas of unclear  regulatory  status  of  FinTech  firms  and  related  disclosure  to consumers potential national barriers preventing FinTech firms from scaling up services to consumers across the single market and the appropriateness of the current regulatory framework for virtual currencies     identifying  and  assessing  money laundering/terrorist financing  risks associated  with  regulated  FinTech  firms  technology  providers  and  FinTech solutions (EBA 2018; Enria 2018). The  Basel  Committee   s  Financial  Stability  Board  on  February  19  2018  in  a  paper    Sound  Practices  on  the  implications  of  FinTech  developments  for  banks  and  bank supervisors     summarized     how  technologydriven  innovation  in  financial  services  or "FinTech " may affect the banking industry and the activities of supervisors in the near to medium term   . This  extensive  analyses  provides  an  excellent understanding  of  financial  technology developments  and  at  the  present  known  FinTech  business  models.     Against  this backdrop  current  observations  suggest  that  although  the  banking  industry  has undergone multiple innovations in the past the rapid adoption of enabling technologies and  emergence  of  new  business  models  pose  an  increasing  challenge  to  incumbent banks in almost all the banking industry scenarios considered   . From  latest  developments  it  is  obvious  that  the  decision  makers  in  the  European Union are aware of the importance and global competitive impact of the development of financial technology. The efforts are concentrated to strengthen the development of the European  Monetary  Union  and  the  European  Capital  Markets  Union.  On  the  one  hand   25    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   they  confirm  that  digital  applications  the  availability  of  FinTech  services  should  be supported but on the other they urge an improvement of supervisory risk assessment consumer  protection  and  strengthening  the  relevant  legal  framework.  It  is  strongly emphasized  that  the  level  playing  field  between  traditional  banks  and  FinTech  (TPP) service provider should be ensured. FinTechs in BCEE region  The majority of banks are foreignowned and the technology they use matches that deployed across their group at the time of investment (Figure 13). Figure 13. Banking groups in CEE Source Deloitte 2016     26    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   The  lack  of  exact  definition  most  probable  required  the  present  standpoint  of  the European Central Bank stating that the regulation and supervision of FinTech services should remain in national competence. Innovations for the banking sector provide the greatest share of FinTech solutions in all CEE countries. Such solutions are highly developed in virtually all countries (internet and  mobile  banking  and  contactless  cards  for  example).  Although  most  solutions  are developed  inhouse  or  provided  by  established  vendors  there  is  room  for  emerging FinTech  providers.  In  most  countries  innovation  in  insurance  is  still  far  behind  the banks. There is a focus on improving distribution channels (especially smartphone apps and  gamification)  and  launching  new  services  based  on  telematics.  The  asset management  sector  is  somewhat  conservative.  Most  financial  institutions  use  systems provided by traditional vendors. On the other hand specific opportunities exist to break down  the  dominance  of  these  players  by  offering  flexible  and  inexpensive  (Deloitte 2016). Table 5.

Note The figures of the individual country groups are unweighted averages. The percentage of respondents who report using mobile money a debit or credit card or a mobile phone  to  make  a  payment  from  an  account  or  report  using  the  internet  to  pay  bills  or  to  buy something online in the past 12 months. It also includes respondents who report paying bills or sending  remittances  directly  from  a  financial  institution  account  or  through  a  mobile  money account in the past 12 months. The  payments  area  is  a  hot  topic  due  to  the  launch  of  numerous  breakthrough solutions  particularly  those  relating  to  various  payment  methods  such  as  contactless   27    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   and  mobile  payments  host  card  emulation  and  cryptocurrency.  The  leadership  role belongs to Poland and the Czech Republic where sophisticated solutions include interbanking  mpayments  schemes  and  robots  are  employed  in  processing  payments.  The upcoming  implementation  of  the  Directive  on  Payment  Services  II  may  change  the payments  market  in  all  countries  however.  Capital  raising  and  personal  finance  is gaining momentum in all CEE countries except for Hungary where such services are the preserve of the banks. Consumers use personal finance management (PFM) tools based both on inhouse developed solutions and offtheshelf solutions delivered by startups. The  P2P  lending  market  is  quite  well  developed  both  for  individual  borrowers  and SMEs.  Organizations  tend  to  utilize  data  and  analytics  solutions  delivered  by  global players. However most markets are still at an early stage of development which spells opportunities  for  foreign  and  local  FinTechs  to  gain  market  share.  All  countries  are paying more and more attention to risks related to cybersecurity due to the increasing number  of  attacks.  To  date  this  area  of  IT  solutions  has  been  dominated  by  global players.  Small  and  medium  enterprises  are  increasingly  interested  in  automated  and cloudbased financial management solutions (Deloitte 2016). Key  barriers  to  market  entry  are  related  to  demand  regulation  and  competition. Launching FinTech solutions is usually acceptable to the financial authorities although special requirements or limitations might apply (such as the use of the cloud or the legal status of the financial entity). Generally speaking countries which are less economically developed and are characterized by limited domestic demand tend to be less attractive in terms of FinTech potential. A favorable business environment (with low tax rates and competitive labor force costs) might attract young companies seeking success in CEE. A vibrant  startup  community that facilitates the  matchmaking process between solution providers  and  the  demand  side  may  accelerate  the  progress  of  FinTech  development. Financial forums incubators and industry fairs are effective ways to spread knowledge of the latest innovations and bring FinTech on to the industry agenda (Deloitte 2016). According  to  recent  reports  the  estimated  size  of  the  FinTech  market  across  the  11 CEE  and  Baltic  postcommunist  EU  member  countries  is  more  than  2  billion  euros. Venture  capital  has  been  invested  in  Banking  Insurance  Capital  raising  and  personal finance  Cybersecurity  Data  and  analytics  Payments  and  Other  software  in  these   28    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   countries.  I  present  some  areas  where  CEE  and  Baltic  countries  lead  the  world  in FinTech  innovation;  in  some  other  areas  they  are  on  the  innovation  frontier;  but  in most  other  areas  they  still  lag  behind  the  most  advanced  countries.  The  European FinTech  market  is  one  of  the  most  mature  in  the  world.  While  the  UK  remained  the standout FinTech hub in the region during 2017 many other FinTech hubs continued to evolve.  2018  is  critical  as  FinTech  investors  in  Europe  evaluate  the  potential  for transformative change following PSD2 implementation. Europe  is  to  see  the  impact  that  the  implementation  of  PSD2  on  both  traditional banks  and  FinTechs.  Europe  has  seen  a  number  of  FinTechs  (e.g.  Klarna  Zopa  and Revolut)  apply  for  banking  licenses  in  order  to  expand  their  product  offerings  (KPMG 2018). FinTech in EMU member BCEE countries The  crisis  highlighted  the  structural  weaknesses  of  the  euro  zone.  The  arguments against early euro adoption remain valid       Monetary policy    one size fits all         No common fiscal policy       Problems in dealing with economic cycles especially in case of asymmetries      Unsustainable balance position internal devaluation is the only tool (see the experiences of the South)      External balance the approach remains    halfhearted    However recent challenges (such as Trump migration Brexit euor zone crisis) point to  a  more  integrated  and  reformed  Europe  (banking  union  fiscal  union).  The  risk  of    remaining out    is higher than the risks associated with the structural problems of the euro zone so there is a strong argument for adopting the euro. But! Euro zone entry will not save the countries from the consequences of irresponsible domestic policies. Estonia The  most  famous  FinTech  company   s  founders  are  Estonians.

Digital  bank  based  on  blockchain  technology  providing  deposit  loan payment and investment services. Slovak Republic The  Slovak  banking  sector  is  innovative  and  open  to  new  digital  solutions.  The reasons  are  twofold  on  the  one  hand  international  capital  groups  often  use  local subsidiaries to push technologies available in their home markets. On the other Slovak society seems ready to adopt such innovations which points to (much more important) internal  forces  driving  the  digital  transformation.  Tatra  banka  has  become  a  leader  of this transformation as confirmed by its haul of Best Consumer Digital Bank in Slovakia awards       13  so  far  the  most  recent  being  in  2015.  In  1998  the  bank  was  the  first  in Slovakia to launch internet banking. Today this service is used at least once a month by around  250000  users  (30%  of  the  bank   s  client  base).  The  share  of  electronic transactions exceeds 97%. What differentiates Tatra banka  from its competitors lies  is the detail of its service offering a tool that tracks spending; ATM withdrawal via mobile phone;  spending  reports;  online  applications  for  service  packages;  and  an  intuitive informative  webpage.  All  these  contribute  to  the  likeability  of  the  bank  as  seen  on Facebook. However what gives Tatra its competitive edge is not so small the launch of near  field  communication  (NFC)  payments  authentication  of  customers  through  voice biometrics  (currently  half  of  the  client  base  chooses  this  verification  method)  Google Glass  banking  and  an  app  for  smart  watches  all  help  to  position  the  bank  among European  rather  than  just  national  leaders  of  innovation  (Deloitte  2016  pp.  190).

Their offerings include popular innovative solutions such as contactless cards and einvoicing while  their  products  are  distributed  via  wellestablished  channels  (branch  online  and mobile).  Customers  have  access  to  native  mobile  banking  applications  with  commonly utilised  functions  that  include  reviewing  the  current  account  and  credit  cards  and making  payments.  In  general  banking  systems  for  ebanking  the  interbank  clearing system mobile payments CRM and BPM are developed by local players. Foreignowned banks tend to work with global systems providers. Despite the small size of the Slovene market  one  local  player  has  managed  to  succeed  in  the  sector  HRC  has  developed  a central banking system called Hibis modules of which are in some ten Slovenian banks as  well as  two banks in  Croatia. More  than 90% of Slovenian  companies can issue and receive invoices in electronic format through their ebanking systems (Deloitte 2016 pp. 206). The leading Slovenian FinTech startup is     Invoice  Exchange.  The  Invoice  Exchange  (Borza  Terjatev  in  Slovenian)  is  an organized marketplace for B2B receivables in Slovenia. FinTechs in nonEMU member BCEE countries Bulgaria The majority of banks are foreignowned and the technology they use matches that deployed across their group at the time of investment. Many of these systems are due for   33    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   upgrade by 2020. Organizations from a number of countries use Bulgaria as a back office and  technology  center  for  Europe  including  some  financial  institutions.  The  result  is that  their  Bulgarian  operations  can  be  used  as  pilot  locations  to  implement  new  core banking  systems  and  other  specialist  technology  products.  The  hightech  market  is dominated by the major global players with only a few niche competitors. This is partly due to the relatively low penetration of internet banking and even lower penetration of mobile  banking.  The  level  of  trust  in  the  local  banking  market  is  another  factor  in making  consumers  more  conservative  about  adopting  more  innovative  products particularly  from  relatively  unknown  companies.  However  there  are  Bulgarian companies  that  focus  on  specific  areas  of  the  financial  market  providing  solutions  in areas  such  as  consumer  loans  debt  collection  insurance  and  more.  A  number  of innovative  IT  companies  based  in  Bulgaria  mainly  focus  their  efforts  on  Western European and North American markets where the value return is much higher. Bulgaria has  the  second  lowest  ratio  of  banked  population  (63%)  of  all  CEE  countries  and  the second lowest penetration of online banking (5%). However almost all banks offer their customers  ebanking  systems.  It  seems  that  banks  are  aware  of  changing  customer needs and shifting preferences focusing mainly on digital channels just as in other CEE and  Western  European  countries.  On  the  one  hand  therefore  banks  are  constantly developing established financial technologies; on the other however they are starting to seek innovation  through the  use of emerging financial  technologies (Deloitte  2016 pp. 9495). Czech Republic The Czech banking sector can certainly be considered as one of the most innovative of all  CEE  countries.  One  example  is  contactless  cards  which  have  become  synonymous with  innovation  especially  in  CEE.  According  to  Visa  Europe  the  Czech  Republic  leads the  CEE region  with 3.3 transactions per month per capita. However those figures  are still below the scores being witnessed in Western European countries (such as the UK   s 30  transactions  per  month).  In  terms  of  value  Czechs  spend  on  average  EUR  64  per month per issued card more than in Spain (EUR 16). As the Czech banking sector is one of  the  most  innovative  in  the  CEE  region  many  globallyutilized  customerfacing products and services have been already implemented. Banks will probably start looking   34    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   for  new  business  opportunities  (also  outside  traditional  banking  segment)  in  cooperation with FinTech companies working as the facilitators of innovation. They might potentially  leverage  userfriendly  mobile  apps  handling  payments  services  personal finance management processes or outofthe box mobile wallets. Thanks to the open API of these solutions banks will be able to integrate them seamlessly with their IT systems and what is most important create new monetization strategies and open new sources of  revenue.  This  would  be  required  also by  the  implementation  of the  EU  Directive  on Payment Services (PSD2). (Deloitte 2016 pp. 121124). Leading Czech FinTech startups      SoNet.

Croatia Although  market  leaders  and  established  FSI  players  produce  most  FinTech innovations  and  their     mother  companies     have  significant  influence  more  and  more local  players  are  emerging  with  a  focus  on  the  market  who  are  more  than  capable  of delivering  inventive  FinTech  products.  In  Croatia  big  banks  and  insurance  companies tend  to  have  strong  IT  departments  and  considerable  internal  development  capability currently  mainly  focused  on  ebanking  and  mbanking  solutions  (such  as  online branches online credit requests and calculators and new functionalities for applications etc). This leaves considerable opportunity for emerging FinTech companies to offer their   35    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   servicer  or  solutions  to  smaller  players  on  the  market.  There  is  also  a  trend  in government  towards  enabling  users  with  tokens  or  accounts  from  ebanking  solutions to  use  such  credentials  to  log  into  government  services.  This  indicates  that  the government is ready to adopt technologies and services that help them opening a whole new  niche  market  for  FinTech  companies.  The  FinTech  market  in  Croatia  is  still  in  its early stages and while there are many possibilities for new and innovative ideas there are also many obstacles regarding legislation. Even in the age of the growing popularity of  online  banking  Croats  still  depend  on  bricksandmortar  banking  facilities.  Online banking  penetration  in  Croatia  fell  from  20%  to  18%  between  2010  and  2014.  Even though the numbers for Croatia are relatively low in comparison to other CEE countries banks  in  Croatia  should  consider  transforming  their  business  model  to  become  more digital (Deloitte 2016 pp. 105107).

Poland In  recent  years  Poland  has  become  a  regional  leader  in  technologically  advanced pioneering  solutions  in  the  banking  sector.  Mobile  is  emerging  as  an  essential  channel for  Polish  customers.  According  to  the  ING  International  Survey  2015  60%  of smartphone users have already used mobile banking or expect to use it. This is the third best score in Europe     right behind the Netherlands (67%) the UK (63%) and on a par with  Spain.  It  indicates  that  mobile  banking  services  have  enormous  potential  for growth  in  the  coming  years.  On  the  other  hand  38%  of  established  retail  banks  in Poland  still  do  not  offer  their  services  through  the  mobile  channel  neither  via  a dedicated  app  nor  a  website  based  on     lite     /  RWD  (responsive  web  design)   36    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   architecture. Another example of the high adoption of innovation in the Polish banking sector  is  the  use  of  contactless  functionality  in  debit  cards.  Almost  80%  of  all  cards already have this feature in Poland compared to 54% in the UK. Some banking experts admit  that     the  digital  maturity  of  Polish  banks  and  the  many  interesting  solutions offered to their clients may limit the development of nonbanking innovators   . Solutions that succeed on  this  challenging market will have to be top notch. As a  result FinTech startups  may  never  manage  to  build  a  dense  network  similar  to  the  one  that  may  be observed in the UK. Polish Finanteq has found its own way to collaborate with the banks in the area of digitalization. The company provides mobile finance applications such as mbanking smartwatch apps and super wallets. These last ones are the combination of banking payments and additional mcommerce services like remote bus tickets parking fees bill payments coupons or event tickets. As the company Marketing Manager Artur Ma  ek  says     We  work  closely  with  the  banks.  Cooperation  underlies  our  business model    (Deloitte 2016 pp. 152153).

Romania The  penetration  of  online  banking  in  Romania  is  currently  at  a  negligible  6% signifying a threefold growth during the past three years. As ecommerce is on the rise it is  expected  that  the  popularity  of  online  and  mobile  banking  will  be  aligned  with  this trend.  However  with  45%  of  Romanians  living  in  rural  areas  and  showing  limited interest in banking services the development of the sector might face a serious barrier.   37    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   It  is  also  to  be  noted  that  cloud  solutions  face  special  restrictions  when  applied  to  the financial sector. In most cases the deployment of a cloud computing solution will mean    outsourcing of significant  activities    thus becoming subject to the  obligation to notify the National Bank of Romania. Emerging FinTech players in the financial services arena are more likely to succeed if they choose to collaborate with an existing player or solve an issue  that is  particularly difficult to  tackle. Those  emerging service  providers in the fields of payments and P2P lending will have both to face regulatory restrictions similar to  those  imposed  on  Romania   s  banks  and  be  ready  to  compete  with  banks.  When entering such a highvolume lowmargin business it will be difficult for FinTech players to  gain  significant  market  share  and  be  profitable  without  offering  corporate  banking services that include salary disbursements. FinTech companies might therefore wish to enter partnerships with smaller banks in the market. These would benefit from FinTech companies    agility and innovation and would be likely to agree a profitsharing model in  the  absence  of  their  own  investment  budgets.  When  entering  consumer  finance FinTechs will compete with banks and other players in the area of customer experience and  those  risk  models  associated  with  specific  niche  segments.  Emerging  FinTechs might  also  have  a  significant  role  to  play  alongside  the  banking  sector  if  regulatory change  opens  access  to  banking  systems  (such  as  customer  accounts)  or  enables solutions  to  address  Romania   s  current  ecommerce  challenges  including  customer   s trust in merchants and the move from cashondelivery to noncash payments (Deloitte 2016 pp. 177178). Hungary In order to obtain a comprehensive overview of market needs in the summer of 2017 the  Hungarian  Central  Bank  (MNB)  launched  a  market  survey  on  FinTech  innovations and  their  potential  regulation.  Market  needs  were  surveyed  taking  into  account  the motivating  factors  underlying  FinTech  innovations  through  various  channels.  This section  introduces  the  result  of  the  consultation  document  (MNB  2017).  In  2017  the Central Bank of Hungary (MNB) launched a market survey on FinTech innovations and their potential regulation.  MNB  prepared  a  targeted  questionnaire  to  assess  the  attitude  and  proposals  of market  participants  developing  and  offering  FinTech  innovations.  According  to  this   38    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   survey  banks  believe  that  they  will  continue  to  play  a  central  role  in  financial intermediation.  On  the  other  hand  the  overwhelming  majority  of  FinTech  firms  are  in regular contact with banks or have turned to banks since their inception. This is due to the fact that in addition to financial support banks can also provide assistance through the  expertise  gained  during  their  operations.  Access  to  banks     extensive  datasets  is crucial for newly established FinTech firms and banks have thorough knowledge of the detailed  legal  requirements  pertaining  to  the  industry.  Banks     systemic  thinking  can probably  also  provide  more  accurate  guidance  on  potential  operational  and  financial risks.  Traditional  banking  actors  mainly  foresee  partnership  solutions  with  respect  to FinTech  innovations.  Banks     motivation  is  based  on  their  need  to  be  familiar  with efficient solutions and adopt them as soon as possible and the flexibility observed in the attitude  of  FinTech  firms  and  their  ability  to  make  decisions  quickly  may  facilitate technological progress. One major element of cooperation is the provision of a business model which is sustainable over the longer term. Banks believe that cooperation and the development of incubation programs can facilitate longterm thinking and as a result of that  innovations  can  become  part  of  the  traditional  banking  system.  For  several institutions  the  low  number  of  available  FinTech  solutions  in  Hungary  hinders  the utilization of the opportunities for cooperation and in some institutions the complexity and  lack  of  flexibility  of  core  systems  may  limit  the  complete  adoption  of  a  promising FinTech  solution.  Currently  few  innovative  products  are  integrated  into  banking operations but future plans are promising.    At present the focus on digitalization covers the development of online and mobile banking  platforms  and  thus  the  range  of  transactions  that  can  be  completed  via  these channels  is  continuously  expanding.  Several  banks  already  use  some  sort  of  mobile payment  solution  and  personal  finance  management  (PFM)  is  also  a  popular  product. Banks  have  started  preparing  for  the  introduction  of  PSD2 and  the  establishment  and development of the account information and payment initiation services is under way at most institutions. Based on the whole banking sample altcoins and crowdfunding seem to  have  the  least  perspective  which  is  mainly  due  to  banks     conservative  risk management policy. However the surveys have shown that if an appropriately defined Hungarian  regulatory  environment  is  established  there  would  be  demand  for  these   39    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   products as well. According to the surveys on the side of banks there is demand for the establishment  of  an  Innovation  Hub  and  a  Regulatory  Sandbox.  However  some uncertainty  also  surrounds  the  Regulatory  Sandbox  as  65  percent  of  the  institutions have  not  decided  whether  they  wish  to  participate  whereas  29  percent  of  the respondents  would  be  willing  and  able  to  launch  a  testing  phase  with  an  innovative product  or  service  even  within  a  short  period  of  time.  Most  FinTech  firms  already cooperate with traditional banking actors. FinTech firms typically do not feel rejected by banks. The market consultation confirmed that there are different types of cooperation. Over onethird of the Hungarian companies in the MNB   s sample indicated that they are in a partnership with a bank i.e. they are participating in a bank   s incubation program or acting as suppliers to a bank with an agency agreement. Banks obtain FinTechs    knowhow  through  acquisition  fairly  rarely.  Openness  on  the  part  of  the  FinTech  firms  will typically continue as half of the sample plan further cooperation. Complete rejection of cooperation was only indicated by three companies altogether    (MNB 2017).    Banks  believe  that  cooperation  and  the  development  of  incubation  programs  can facilitate longterm thinking and as a result of that innovations can become part of the traditional banking system. For several institutions the low number of available FinTech solutions in Hungary hinders the utilization of the opportunities for cooperation and in some  institutions  the  complexity  and  lack  of  flexibility  of  core  systems  may  limit  the complete adoption of a promising FinTech solution    (MNB 2017). Currently few innovative products are integrated into banking operations but future plans are promising (Figure 14).   40    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   Figure 14. Types of existing and planned FinTech innovations among banks Source MNB 2017  Most FinTech firms already cooperate with traditional banking actors.    FinTech firms typically do not feel rejected by banks. The market consultation confirmed that there are different types of cooperation. Over onethird of the Hungarian companies in the MNB   s sample indicated that they are in a partnership with a bank i.e. they are participating in a bank   s incubation program or acting as suppliers to a bank with an agency agreement.

Openness  on  the part  of  the  FinTech  firms  will  typically  continue  as  half  of  the  sample  plan  further cooperation. Complete rejection of cooperation was only indicated by three companies altogether    (MNB 2017).    In  the case  of FinTech firms  most  existing services  are linked to  different forms of digital  payments.  Hungarian  businesses  are  active  in  several  segments  and  their activities  may  affect  almost  the  entire  spectrum  of  the  financial  sector.  The overwhelming majority of developments implemented by the companies so far include various  digital  payment  solutions.  Innovations  providing  online  wealth  management services  (personal  finance  management       PFM)  used  for  optimizing  investment strategies  are  also  typical.  On  account  of  the  growing  retail  and  corporate  demand  for FinTech solutions FinTech firms are very open towards further developments. There is   41    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   also  considerable  interest  in  the  new  services  introduced  by  PSD2.  Over  20  percent  of the  respondents  participating  in  the  MNB   s  market  consultation  believed  that  account information and payment initiation services have a perspective. Social scoring solutions based on the digital footprint that assist credit ratings also form an important portion of the planned developments    (MNB 2017). FinTech firms are fundamentally open towards regulatory  initiatives  to  stimulate  innovation.  Most  FinTech  activity  in  Hungary  is concentrated in retail account management and payments (Figure 15). Figure 15. Hungarian FinTech landscape  Source McKinsey 2017       Shinrai. MrCoin.

Conclusion    The transition from a socialisttype economy to a market economy was successful in that  respect  there  is  now  no  noncapitalist  state  in  BCEE  region.  The  region\'s  growth exceeds  the  EU  average  but  the  gap  between  growth  rates  has  slowed  down considerably to precrisis levels.  Obviously  without  the  resources  of  the  European  Union  the  growth  of  the  BCEEregion  would  have  been  completely  different  but  in  the  last  13  years  their  use  far removed the economic policy and competitiveness that could have been expected of it.   43    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries   Since  joining  to  the  European  Union  CEE  and  Baltic  countries  experienced  a historically neverseen capital inflow due to the EUfunds. The convergence of the region towards  the  core  states     economic  development  is  impressive  in  countrygroup  and country level but in regional level the convergence process is taking part more slowly. The  lagging regions    key geographical characteristic is that they inhabit an area on the eastern fringe of the European Union. If the EU does not modify its policy towards the former socialist countries European values are very slowly integrated into the public\'s attitudes. The main conclusion of the study is that the postsocialist EU Member States    convergence  has  not  been  completed  despite  but  there  has  been  a  major  progress despite the crisis. Countryspecific differences reflect the differences in the effectiveness of EUfund absorption. One  of  the  core  issues  of  Europeanization  is  whether  the  EU  serves  as  an  anchor during the transformation process of the postcommunist countries i.e. whether the EU is  able  to  be  the  point  of  reference  and  to  catalyze  the  process  of  changes.  There  is certain evidence that in case of BCEE countries the EU served as an anchor during their transformation process. Innovation is the most significant advantage of capitalism over socialism. Mobile telephone penetration was 12 percent in the EU15 and 2 percent in the BCEE11 in 1996 but 124 percent in the EU15 and 129 percent in the BCEE11 in 2016. The  postsocialist  countries  initially  far  behind  in  their  use  of  modern  means  of communication  have  now  more  or  less  overtaken     traditional     capitalist  countries  in this respect. The  lack  of  exact  definition  most  probable  required  the  present  standpoint  of  the European Central Bank stating that the regulation and supervision of FinTech services should remain in national competence. The FinTech startups from in the BCEE region might be divided into banking and into insurance categories (Figure 16).    44    d  m Ker  nyi / The fintech challenge Digital innovations from postcommunist EU member countries  Figure 16. Breakdown of BCEE FinTechs Source Author   s own calculation  Within the bankrelated products there are four more subcategories (Figure 17).  Figure 17. Breakdown of BCEE FinTechs     banking products providers Source Author   s own calculation       As  we  can  see  the  most  popular  FinTech  solutions  from  BCEE  startups  focus  on payment  transactions  and  saving  and  investment.
