b'herein fileStudy of Financing Preferences and Capital Structure among Malaysian  SMEs Evidence from Enterprise 50 Award Winners  Shafie Mohamed Zabri Universiti Tun Hussein Onn Malaysia shafie@uthm.edu.my  ABSTRACT Increasing importance of economic contributions of small and medium sized enterprises (SMEs) around the  world  particularly  in  developing  countries necessitates  better  understanding  of financial practices  among  SMEs.  This  research  investigates the  financial  practices  among  SMEs  in  Malaysia among SMEs within the list of Enterprise 50 award winners  from  1998  to  2010  focuses  on  SMEs managers     level  of  financing  preferences  towards available  sources  of  financing  and  firm   s  capital structure. Electronic surveys were conducted with a response  rate  of  29.5%.  SMEs  managers  are  found to  have a  higher preference towards  debt financing from  banking  institutions.  Results  also  show  that the average debttoequity ratio among these SMEs is  57  to  43.  Factors  affecting  manager   s  financing preferences  and firm   s  capital  structure  are investigated  through  selected  manager   s  and  firm   s characteristics.  Focuses  are  on the  possible association  between these  characteristics  with managers    level of financing preferences and firm   s capital structure respectively. The analysis revealed that  manager   s business  ownership status and  level of  education  have  a  statistically  significant association  with financing preferences.  Nondebt  tax  shields  tangibility  of assets  and  firm   s  level  of  liquidity  on  the  other hand  were  found  to  have  a  statistically  significant relationship  with  firm   s  capital  structure.  This research  enhances  the  existing  body  of  knowledge of  financial  practices  of  SMEs  particularly  within the  context  Malaysian  SMEs  by  providing  the information  on  manager   s level  of  financing preferences and firm   s capital structure.   Keywords Structure; SMEs Malaysia  preferences;  Capital Financing level their of I INTRODUCTION in those to total  constitute  a SMEs are important to almost all  economies  in the in  developing world  but  especially countries.  SMEs large proportion of the  economic activity and considered to  be  an  engine  of  growth  in  both  developed  and developing  countries  (Boocock  and  Shariff  2005). In  developing  countries  concern  on  the  role  of SMEs  in  the  development  process  continues  to  be in  the  forefront  of  policy  debates  (Cook  2001)  as they comprise a majority of the business population in most countries and therefore play a crucial role in the  economy  (Mitchell  and  Reid  2000).    Mac  an Bhaird  (2010)  added  that  the  realization  of  the significant  economic  contribution  of  SMEs  has resulted in increased attention focused on the sector from  policy  makers  as  well  as  academics.  The economic  potential  of  the  SME  sector  makes  SME development  as  an  important  Government  agenda. Their  contribution  is  crucial  and  remains  as  an integral  part  of  economic  development  of  the country.  The in  promoting endogenous  sources  of  growth  and  strengthening the infrastructure for enhanced economic expansion and been acknowledged (Aris 2007).  role  of  SMEs in  Malaysia development has II SME FINANCING (2008)  on financing  with The  role  of  finance  has  been  viewed  as  a  critical element  for  the  development  of  SMEs  (Cook 2001).  As  is  widely  recognized  lack  of  sufficient finance and access to credit are often cited as major handicaps  to  the  development  of  SMEs  in  many parts  of  the  world  (UNDP  2007).    In  the  case  of Malaysia  SMEs  generally  face  difficulties  in obtaining lack  of  collateral insufficient  documents  to  support  loan  application and  lack  of  financial  track  record  being  the constraints  faced  by  Malaysian  SMEs  in  accessing financing  (Aris  2007).    Study  by  Ab.  Wahab  and financing  practices  and Buyong challenges  among  technology  based  SMEs in Malaysia  revealed  that  84.3%  of  respondent  had experienced  difficulties in  obtaining  external financing.    Within  this  figures  duration  of  loan offered  was  too  short  insufficient  amount  of finance  and  difficulty  in  providing  collateral  are among difficulties faced by Malaysian SMEs.    The availability of financing for Malaysian SMEs is not  an  issue  as  the  sources  of  finance  seems abundant  however the accessibility  and  adequacy  of  those  funds  which were found to be limited and fragmented (Abdullah and Ab. Manan 2009).   Accessibility to finance is a  major  factor  affecting  the  growth  and  success  of SMEs  (Hall  2003).  Consequently  adequate  access the  main issue is ASEAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONFERENCE 2012AEC2012131 to financing is critical to enable SMEs to contribute to  the  economic  development  of  the  nation  with initiatives  have  been  developed  in  addressing  the financing gaps (BNM Annual Report 2008). Given the  importance  of  finance  and  the  existence  of constraints related to the access to financing among Malaysian  SMEs  it  is  crucial  to  investigate  the financial practices among SMEs to increase a better understanding of their financing behavior.   Another concern that motivated the investigation on the  topic  of  financial  practices  among  SMEs particularly  in  Malaysia  is  the  paucity  of  research into  the  topic  of  financing  preferences  and  capital structure  among  SMEs.  General  studies  on  SME financing  were  primarily  conducted  by  related institutions  either  domestic  or  international  and focused  mainly  on  the  issues  of  provision  of  funds for  SMEs.  Mac  an  Bhaird  (2010)  indicates  that early  studies  investigating  SME  financing  are predominantly  comprised  governmentsponsored surveys and reports which concentrating  largely  on potential  deficiencies  and  obstacles to the sustainability and development of the sector.   Existing  literatures  on  Malaysian  SMEs  mainly captures development of SMEs in general (includes issue  and  challenges  faced  by  SMEs)  while  those which related to the financial practices  of SMEs in Malaysia  are  particularly  focuses  on  financing issues  and  sources  and  uses  of  funds  employed throughout  the  business  (see  Saleh  and  Ndubisi 2006; Aris 2007; Hassan 2008; Hall 2003; Rozali et  al  2006).      The  topic  of  financing  preferences and  capital  structure  among  SMEs  in  Malaysia  are still  understudied  and thus  open  up  for  an opportunity  to  gauge  into  this  area  which  will enhance  better  understanding  on topic consequently.   Cook  (2001)  point  out  that  the  theoretical  insights into  the  fields  of  finance  and  SMEs  have  largely been  confined  to  studies  undertaken  in  the  US  and the  UK.    Although  considerable  amount  is  known about the characteristics and behavior of SMEs this knowledge  continues  to  be  imperfect  and  a  large number of questions remain unanswered in relation to  finance  and  SME  development  in  developing countries.  He  added  that  in  developing  countries research on both the supply and demand for finance among  SMEs  has  been  empirically  based  and  preoccupied  with  gathering the characteristics  of  SMEs  and  lending  institutions rather  than  on  testing  theoretical  proportions  that information  on this 2. 3. would  improve  understanding  of  the  relationship between finance and SMEs.   Cook  (2001)  point  out  some  weaknesses  and  gaps in  knowledge  concerning  the  relation  between finance  and  SME  development  and  suggested  the followings  four  elements  of  research  into  SME financing to  a  better understanding  of  the  financing  needs  of  SMEs  and the ways to deliver financial services to them  1. that  will  contribute The  forms  of  finance  used  by  SMEs  and made  available  by  lending  institutions  and investors. The  relation  between  different  financial forms and firmlevel performance. The  behavior  of  SMEs  with  different  forms of finance. Supply side of finance investigations  would  also 4.  This  study  incorporates  two  of  his  suggestions  in contributing  to  a  better  understanding  of  SME financing behaviors. Focuses are on the behavior of SMEs with different forms of finance and the forms of  finance  used  by  SMEs.  These  two  areas  are studied  by  investigating  the  financing  preferences among SMEs managers toward different sources of financing  and  also  the  capital  structure  of  SMEs which  reflects  the  forms  of  finance  used  by  them.  These incorporated general  theory  on  SME  financing  and  selective financial theory relates to firm   s capital structure.   Greater  financial  accessibility  is  believed  to  be achieved  by  enhancing the  understanding  of financial  practices  among  SMEs.  This  will  ensure the  correct  measures  were  taken  in  strengthening the  existing  infrastructure  and  enabling  a  more effective  channeling  of  funds  to  SMEs.  In  addition to  that  it  is  also  hoped  to  improved  provision  of financial advisory support and enhancing awareness of  financial  products  and  assistance  programmes available to SMEs. Therefore  given the significant role of SMEs and the existence of financing gaps as well  as  gaps  in  the  literature  this  research  aims  to investigate  the  financial  practices  of  SMEs  in Malaysia particularly  within the scope  of financing preferences  and  capital  structure.   These  are believed  will  further  enhance  understanding  of financial  behavior  and  practices  among  SMEs  in Malaysia  which turn  will  provide  better channeling of funds. The financing gaps would then be  reduced  and  subsequently  will  increase  the accessibility  and  adequacy  of  financing  to  the SMEs.  in ASEAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONFERENCE 2012AEC2012132 Given the  existence of financingrelated challenges faced  among  SMEs  in  general  and  in  particular Malaysian  SMEs  there  is  an  avenue  for  further studies  on  financial  practices  among  SMEs  in Malaysia  to  enhance  better  understanding  of  their financial  behavior.  This  is  hoped  to  add  to  the existing  knowledge  on  financial  practices  among SMEs in  general and  especially  within the  context of Malaysia.   III FINANCING PREFERENCES AND CAPITAL STRUCTURE  A.  Financing Preferences Investigation  into  SMEs  financing  choices  often seeks  explanation  of  the  issue  in  term  of  firm characteristics  (firm  size  age  asset  structure profitability;  to  name  a  few)  without  considering one important  aspects  of  small  business  and entrepreneurship  which  is  the  role  of  SME  owner (Mac an Bhaird 2010). Norton (1991) often cited by those  researching  financing  behavior  of  SMEs (Coleman  2008;  Mac  an  Bhaird  2010;  Romano  et al  2000; Paul  et  al  2007)  to  include  the  important of  understanding  managerial  beliefs  and  its  relation to  firm   s  capital  structure.  Norton  (1991)  cited  by that     In  small Mac  an  Bhaird  (2010)  stated businesses  and  entrepreneurial  firms  managerial beliefs and desires will play an especially  important role in determining capital structure   .models must include the role of management preferences beliefs and  expectations  if  we  are  to  better  understand capital structure policy   .   The  important  managerial  role  primarily  one  that relates is fundamental  element in  this  study  concerning managerial  preferences  toward  various  sources  of financing.  Although  managerial  preferences  might not  precisely the  observed  capital structures information provided  will  offer evidence of  motivations  behind  the  financing  decision  (Mac an  Bhaird  2010).  He  also  point  out  that  there  are evidences  that  relative  paucity  of  published  papers employing  the  influence  of  firm  owners     business goal objectives and preferences on issues related to SME  financing.  Incorporating  managerial  elements in  improving  understanding  of  financial  practices among SMEs is then very much needed.   Mac  an  Bhaird  (2010)  outlined  two  approaches used  in  relation  to  owner  characteristics  examined into  owner   s  personal in  previous characteristics race  education studies (age  gender issue  of  financing  decision resemble the to experience)  and  owners     preferences  business goals  and  motivations.  Likewise  Low  and Mazzarol (2006) found that personal characteristics of  the  ownermanagers  play  a  significant  role  in determining their  financing  preference.  These characteristics  may  provide some  additional predictive  power  in  explaining  the  firm   s  capital structure  (Cassar  2004).  In  this  study  selecting managerial  characteristics  were  executed  through reviews  of past studies particularly  on the personal characteristics  of  SMEs  owner  or  manager.  The following table  summarizes  previous  studies concerning  financial  aspects  and  practices  of  firms which integrate managerial characteristics as one of the indicators  Table  1  Financial  practices  and  managerial characteristic previous studies Author Managerial characteristics  Vos Yeh et al.

Gender  age  education  experience and  business  ownership  are  example  of  indicators that often used in relation to understanding of firm   s financial  practices.  These  indicators  are  selected  to ASEAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONFERENCE 2012AEC2012133 be  used  in  this  study  to  investigate  the  managers    level  of  financing  preferences  towards  various sources  of  financing.  Summary  of  these  variables are presented as follows Table  2  Summary  of  selected  manager   s characteristics  Variable Indicator Gender Gender i.e. Male or Female Age Education Experience Business ownership Age. Classified into groups of ages. Level of education. Classified into groups of education levels. Experience. Classified into groups of experiences with regards to years of experience. Concerning ownership of business i.e. Own/ did not own the business  In summary manager   s personal characteristics are believed to be a good  indicator in regards to firm   s overall  capital  structure  decision.  Incorporating these  aspects  in  investigating  the  preference  of financing  among  SMEs  are  important  not  only  in providing  clear  and  better  understanding  on  SMEs capital structure but in improving  knowledge about how  these  aspects  influence  SMEs  in  their  capital structure decision.   B.  Capital Structure The  study  of  capital  structure  attempts  to  explain the mix of securities and financing sources used by corporations to finance real investment. Most of the research  on  capital  structure  has  focused  on  the proportions  of  debt  versus  equity  observed  on  the righthand  sides  of  corporations     balance  sheets (Myers  2001).  There  is  no  consensus  theory  that explains  a  firm   s  capital  structure  but  finance theory  offers  two  broad  competing  models  tradeoff  theory  and  pecking  order  theory  (Tong  and Green 2005) and these theories appear to have the most support (Seifert and Gonenc 2008).  Theories  of  optimal  capital  structure  differ  in  their relatives emphases on certain factors. The tradeoff theory  emphasizes  taxes  the  pecking  order  theory emphasizes differences in information and the free cash  flow  theory  emphasizes  agency  costs  (Myers 2001).  Empirically  distinguishing  between  these hypotheses has proven difficult (Booth Aivazian et al. 2001; Tong and Green 2005). In crosssectional tests  variables  that  describe  one  theory  can  be classified as others and vice versa (Booth Aivazian et al. 2001). Tradeoff  did better in  one  case  (large equity  issues  of  lowleverage  firms)  and  pecking order impact  of profitability on leverage) (Tong and Green 2005). the  other  (the  negative in  In  Tradeoff  Theory  (TOT  hereafter)  firms  seek debt  levels  that  balance  the  tax  advantages  of additional  debt  against the  costs  of  possible financial  distress  (Myers  2001).  Optimal  capital structure  is  achieved  by  balancing  the  benefits  of debt (tax and reduction of free cash flow problems) with the costs of debt (bankruptcy and agency costs between stockholders and bondholders) (Seifert and Gonenc  (2008).  Firm  is  viewed  as  setting  a  target debttoequity  ratio  and  gradually  moving  towards it.  This  implies  that  some  form  of  optimal  capital structure  exists  that  can  maximize  the  firm  value while simultaneously minimizing external claims to the  cash  flow  stream.  Such  claims  include  taxes bankruptcy  costs  and  agency  costs  (Kjellman  and Hansen  1995).  A  valuemaximizing  firm  will pursue  an  optimal  capital  structure  by  considering the  marginal  costs  and  benefits  of  each  additional unit  of  financing  and  then  choosing  the  form  of financing  that  equates  these  marginal  costs  and benefits.  Benefits  of  debt  include  its  tax  advantage and  the  reduced  agency  costs  of  free  cash  flow; costs include the increased risk of financial distress and  increased  monitoring  and  contracting  costs associated with higher debt levels (Tong and Green 2005).  Applicability  of  the  tradeoff  theory  to  the SME  has  been  the  focus  of  a  number  of  studies  as the debt tax shield is as relevant for SME as it is for publicly quoted firms (Mac an Bhaird 2010).  The  pecking  order  theory  or  hypothesis    of  capital structure  (POH  hereafter)  is  among  the  most influential theories of corporate leverage (Frank and Goyal 2003). It contrasts the static tradeoff theory with  a  competing  popular  story  based  on  a financing  pecking  order.  Firms  are  said  to  prefer internal to external financing and debt to equity if it issues  securities.  In  the  pure  pecking  order  theory the  firm  has  no  welldefined  target  debttovalue ratio  (Myers  1984).The  pecking  order  hypothesis describes  a  hierarchy  of  financial  choices  firms make.  According  to  the  pecking  order  hypothesis internally  generated  financing  is  preferred  first followed  by  debt  (safe  and  then  risky)  and  lastly outside equity (Seifert and Gonenc 2008). The firm will  borrow  rather  that  issuing  equity  when internal  cash  flow  is  not  sufficient  to  fund  capital expenditures.  Thus  the  amount  of  debt  will  reflect the  firm   s  cumulative  need  for  external  funds (Myers 2001).   A  fundamental  issue  in  corporate  finance  involves understanding  how  firms  choose their  capital (Seifert  and  Gonenc  2008).  What structure ASEAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONFERENCE 2012AEC2012134 determines  the  optimal  capital  structure  is  still  an ongoing  and  complex  matter  (Esparanca  Gama  et al.  2003).  Researchers  are  still  puzzled  by  how firms  choose  the  debt  equity  or  hybrid  securities they  issue  (Kjellman  and  Hansen  1995).  Theories of capital structure suggest how some of the factors might  be  correlated  with  leverage  (Rajan  and Zingales  1995).  There  have  been  many  empirical studies  attempting  to  test  the  explanatory  power  of capital  structure  models  on  corporate  behavior  in developed  countries  particular  in  a  U.S.  setting. Most  of  the  work  has  been  to identify  the determinants  of  capital  structure.  The  main determinants  of  capital  structure  tested  include profitability size  growth  opportunity  asset structure costs of financial distress and tax shields effects (Chen 2004).  incorporates In the case  of capital structure  however the  set  of features  one  must  include  in  such  a  general  model is  so  large  and  complicated  that  the  resulting structure  would  not  yield  clear  insights.  Based  on theoretical  capital  structure  studies  firm   s  capital structure emerges from three sources firm specific country  institutional  and  macroeconomic  factors. There  is  empirical  evidence  for  the  importance  of all three   firm institutional and macroeconomic   factors in  determining  firm  capital  structure. However  there  is  still  a  lack  of  studies  spanning  a large  number  of  countries  and  different  firm  types simultaneously (Joeveer 2005).  Previous  studies  among  large  firms     shows  some factors  that  seem  to  have  influences  on  capital structure  decisions  among  them.  This  particular study namely profitability  firm   s  size  asset  tangibility  firm   s growth  firm   s  age  nondebt  tax  shields  and liquidity.  Reviews  on  these  studies  are  used  to support the decision on selecting those factors to be tested  in  this  study.  Analysis  of  factors  used  in investigating into capital structure decisions among SMEs shows that factors selected in this study were among  the  factors  that  mostly  included  in  the previous  studies  concerning  the  determinants  of capital structure among SMEs. Interestingly firm   s size was included in all selected studies. This might be  an  important  factor  in  differentiating  financial practices among SMEs as most definitions of SME divided  SME  into  different  groups  such  as  micro small and  medium  enterprises. The  next  factor that usually included when studying the determinants of capital  structure  among  SMEs  is  firm   s  growth. Profitability  and  asset  tangibility  or  structure  were included  in  thirteen  studies  while  firm   s  age  nonfactors those debt tax shields and  liquidity  was included  in  nine five  and  two  studies  respectively.  In  summary indicator  used  for  each  explanatory  variable  is  as follows  Table  3  Summary  of  indicator  used  for  each explanatory variables Variable Indicator Profitability  Firm   s Size  Asset Tangibility  Firm   s Growth  Firm   s Age  NonDebt Tax Shield Liquidity  Return on Assets EBIT/Total Assets Gross Profit Margin Gross Profit/Net Sales Net Profit Margin Net Income/Sales Based on number of Fulltime employees or annual sales turnover which divided into 3 different groups which is Micro Small and Medium.

To  some  extent  the  value  of  those variables are differentiate either by taking the book value  or  the  market  value  of  leverage  or  equity.  Four  indicators  used  for  capital  structure  variables in this study are  1.  Debt Ratio (DR)=Total Liabilities/Total Assets 2.  Shortterm  Debt  Ratio (STDR)=Current Liabilities/Total Assets  3.  Longterm  Debt  Ratio  (LTDR)=Longterm Debt/Total Assets DebttoEquity Ratio  4.

These would enable clear views on the associations and  influences  between  these  characteristics  with managers     financing  preferences  and  firm   s  capital structure respectively.    ASEAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONFERENCE 2012AEC2012135 III RESEARCH METHODOLOGY  A.  Research objectives Desired  outcome  need  to  be  reflected  when  stating research  objectives.  It  is  viewed  as  the  starting point  of  rigorous  research  in  that  they  demonstrate the  potential  legitimacy  of  the  research  project  in far  stronger  terms  than  a  statement  of  the  research idea (Hair 2007). The objectives of this study are  1.  To investigate level  of the towards  different preferences financing  among  managers  of  SMEs Malaysia  financing sources  of in 2.  To  investigate  the  capital  structure  among SMEs in Malaysia and 3.  To  determine  if  there  are  any  significant associations  between selected  manager   s characteristics  with  their  level  of  financing sources  of preferences financing firm characteristics  with  the  firm   s  capital  structure among SMEs in Malaysia. towards  different and between selected  These specific objectives are accomplished through gathering of specific  data among chosen sample  of Enterprise  50  award  winners  to  gauge  the  issue  of financing  preferences  and  choice  of  capital structure and factors influencing their decisions on these two.   B.  Data collection response rate and analysis Accomplishing  of  the  research  objectives  was dependent  on  the  reliable  analysis  of  responses received  from  a  large  number  of  respondents. Therefore survey research was considered to be the suitable and appropriate  data collection  method for achieving  the  objectives  of  this  study.  Availability of  the  internet  in  recent  years  overcomes  some drawbacks  of  traditional  ways  of  postal  surveys especially  the  one  relating  to  cost  of  postal questionnaire.  For  that  reason  electronic  survey was  chose  to  be  the  appropriate  and  reliable instrument  in  supporting  the  accomplishment  of data  collection  process  not  only  for  increasing  the response rates but also increasing a reliable analysis and  findings  of  research  objectives.  This  method involves selfadministered electronic  surveys  through  email  the  World  Wide Web  Interactive  Voice  Response  and  touchtone data entry (Dillman 2000). Web survey is chose to be  used  in  this  study  as  this  particular  type  of electronic survey have more refined appearance and have  a  flexibility  to  provide  survey  capabilities  far dissemination of beyond  the  email  and  paper  surveys  (Dillman 2000; Hair et al. 2007).   As questionnaire is the sole survey instrument to be used  in  this  study  it  was  very  clear  that  detailed and  careful  planning  should  be  undertaken  to develop a reliable instrument. After considering the comments  and  suggestions  received  from  the  pretesting  and  pilot  testing  the  first  draft  of  the questionnaire the final version of the questionnaire was  constructed  involving  four  different  parts  and accessible  via    designated  link.  The  link  for  the final  version  of  the  questionnaire  was  sent  via  email to the selected sample upon satisfactory results of pilot testing. A list of Enterprise 50 winners from 1998  to  2010  were  formed  to  guides  the  overall process  of  data  collection.  SMEs  listed  on  the  list were classified based on alphabetical orders and the distributions  of  emails  were  made  on  the  basis  of completing  the  list.  Telephone  contacts  were  also made  in the  case  where  direct email contact is  not available  mainly  to  get  direct  email  address  of designated person in charge which in turn hoped to increase the response rate.   In  the  pilot  study  the  overall  contactable  SMEs were  47  (out  of  50  SMEs).  Two  SMEs  refuse  to participate and  excluded  in determining the  overall response rate of 28 % [13/ (5032)]. This rate was deemed  to  be  appropriate  as  the  average  response rate  for  surveys  among  SMEs  in  Malaysia  was 15.6%.  As  this  study  employ  an  email  surveys  it was  thought  that  this  instrument  was  yet  to  be tested  within  Malaysian  context  especially  among SMEs  and  anticipated  to  open  a  new  way  of researching  SMEs  in  Malaysia.  The  actual  surveys which took almost six  month to  complete resulting in  a  total  of  120  responses  received.  This  figure  is used  to  determining  the  response  rate  received  for this  survey.  A  total  of  423  SMEs  were  contactable and  out  of this 17 of them  were  not  interested and refused  to  participate.  After  all  these  were  taken into consideration the overall response rate for this study was determined as follows   Response rate = [120/ (4442117)] = 29.5%  Upon  satisfactory  of  responses  received  data analyses  were  performed  on  the  basis  of  120 responses.  Descriptive  bivariate  and  multivariate analyses  were  involved  to  accommodate  different functions mainly to achieve the research objectives. Parametric  and  nonparametric  analyses  were  used based  on  the  type  of  data  collected.  All  parametric assumptions  was  fulfilled  and  justified  before  the ASEAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONFERENCE 2012AEC2012136 parametric  analyses  were  used.  The  following section will discusses the results of these analyses.   Profile of respondents  Table 5 Profile of respondents IV RESULTS  A.

When  it  comes  to  external  funding banking trade/supplier  credit  and government  funds  were  found  to  be  the  most preferred  sources  of  financing.  Other  sources  of financing (DFIs cooperative financing leasing and factoring)  were  found  to  be  least  preferred  by  the SMEs  managers  with  equity  investments  being  the institutions ASEAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONFERENCE 2012AEC2012137 least  preferred  sources  of  financing.

By  comparing  both  descriptive for manager   s  level  of  financing  preference  toward different internal and external sources of financing conclusion  can  be  made  on  five  most  preferred sources of financing are presented as follows  Table 6 Five most preferred source of financing  results Rank Source of financing 1 2 3 4 5 Banking Institutions Retained Earnings  (Net Income Retained for Reinvestment) Shareholder   s Own Fund/Contribution Trade/Supplier Credit Government Funds/Schemes  Sources External Internal Internal External External  Table  above  indicates  that  the  most  preferred sources  of  financing  among  SMEs  managers  are  a mixed of external and internal sources of financing. This  list provides a clearer insight  into the level  of financing  preferences  towards  various  sources  and types  of  financing  available  for  small  business particularly  in  the  case  of  Malaysian  SMEs. Managers of SMEs appears to find external funding most  probably  from  banking  institutions  supplier and  also  from  the  Government.  Otherwise  they would  use  internally  sought  sources  of  financing from retained earnings or providing their own funds to accomplish the much needed funding.   SMEs capital structure Focus on the studies of firm   s capital structure was motivated  by  an  objective increase  an understanding  on  firm   s  capital  structure  used  by SMEs  in  Malaysia  within  the  chosen  sample  and issues related to it.  Descriptive results indicate that generally SMEs depends more on debt over equitysources  of  financing.  This is  proven  by  the descriptive  results  which  shows  that  overall  DebttoEquity to  be approximately  57  to  43.  This  figure  proves  that firms  mainly  seek  for  external  debtsources  of financing  over  internal  funds.  Proportion  of  debt financing  also  found  to  be  equally  divided  into short  and  longterm  debt  financing  which  shows that  firms  generally  use  both  types  of  debts  in financing their business activity.

These items are presented as follows  Table  7  Type  of  financing  with  the  highest proportion in the firm   s liability and equity Rank Type of financing 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 Account Payable Retained Earnings (Net Income Retained for Reinvestment) Shareholder   s Own Fund/Contribution Trade/Supplier Credit  Share Capital Capital Reserved Bank Overdraft Longterm Debt Types Debt Equity Equity  Debt  Equity Equity Debt Debt from funds  mainly  In  summary  SMEs  get  their  funding  from  debtsources of financing in the form of account payable trade/supplier  credit  bank  overdraft  and  longterm debt.  Other  form  of  debt  financings  were  found  to be  least  used  by  the  SMEs  which  support  the previous  results  on  manager   s  level  of  financing preferences  towards  various  sources  of  financing. Other  possible  ways  of  funding  comes  from internallysought retained earnings.   B.  Bivariate analysis This  analysis  seeks  to  investigate  statistically significant between  manager   s characteristics  and  managers     level  of  financing preferences  towards  different  sources  of  financing and  statistically  significant  associations  between firm   s  characteristics  and  firm   s  capital  structure. These  objectives  were  translated  into  two  main general alternative hypotheses as follows  H1  There statistically between significant are relationships manager   s characteristics  and  their  level  of  financing preferences towards  different  sources  of financing.  associations H2  There are statistically significant relationship between  firm   s  characteristics  and  firm   s capital structure   Data  transformations  were  performed  on  several variables  in  this  study.  These  variables  were assessed through few  indicators to  gauge the  much needed  data for the analysis. These indicators were then  grouped  and  reduced  into  a  smaller  group  of variables  to  simplify  the  analysis  and  increase  an understanding  of  the  data  more  easily  in  achieving research  objectives.  The  responses  given  were ASEAN ENTREPRENEURSHIP CONFERENCE 2012AEC2012138 involving combined  using  the  composite  score  where  all individual  items  scores  where  summated  together and  aggregated  for  hypotheses  testing.  The  data transformations  were  used  on  creating  summated scores for the level of financing preferences among managers  towards  Internal  Equity  Financing  (IEF) Debt Financing (DF) and External Equity Financing (EEF).  The  same  transformation  also  performed  in assessing the proportions  of firm   s capital structure which  includes  Shortterm  Financing  (STF)  Longterm  Financing  (LTF)  and  Equity  Financing  (EF) and  average  changes  on  firm   s  characteristicsvariables three  different  variables Liquidity  (LIQ)  Profitability  (PROF)  and  firm   s growth (GROWTH).  Determining appropriate tests Determination of the analysis for hypothesis testing generally  involves  two  broad  classes  of  inferential statistical tests  parametric  and nonparametric  test  (Cooper  and  Emory  1995; Saunders et al. 2009; Collis & Hussey 2009). The former tests  were used  with continuous  data which make  certain  assumptions  about  the  distributional characteristics of the population under investigation whilst the  latter are  designed to be used  when  data are  not  normally  distributed  and  often  used  with categorical  data.  Hence  in  order  to  determine whether the bivariate association test  for this study fall under parametric or nonparametric the type of data  used  are  analyzed  and  type  of  tests  to  be applied are then determined.

Summary of the results are presented as follows  Table  9  Summary  of  bivariate  correlation coefficient test results Dependent Variable Independent Variable Reject/ Accept H0 Manager   s preference on Internal Equity Financing (IEF) Manager   s preference on Debt Financing (DF) AGE (H11) EDU(H14) EXP (H17)  GENDER (H110)  OWN (H113) AGE(H12) EDU(H15) EXP(H18) GENDER(H111)  OWN(H114) AGE(H13) EXP(H19) GENDER(H112) Accept H0 Reject H0 Accept H0 Reject H0 Reject H0 Accept H0 positive EDU(H16)OWN(H115) relationship  with Manager   s preference on External Equity Financing (EEF)  In  summary  manager   s  preferences  towards  three different  sources  of  financing  did  not  have  a statistically  significant  relationship  with  their  age experience  and  gender.  This  indicates  that  their preferences  on  different  sources  of  financing  were not  related  to  these  three  variables.  Manager   s highest  level  of  education1  is  found  to  have  a statistically  significant  negative  relationship  with their preferences toward EEF and not with the other two  sources  of  financing.  Finally  manager   s ownership  status2  is  found  to  have  a  statistically significant their preferences towards all three sources of financing.   Associations between firm   s capital structure with firm   s characteristics The  analyses  are  executed  to  study  the  association between  selected  firm   s  characteristics  with  firm   s capital  structure  represented  by  firm   s  Debt  Ratio (DR)  Shortterm  Debt  Ratio  (STDR)  Longterm Debt  Ratio  (LTDR)  and  DebttoEquity  Ratio (DER).  The  analyses  are  separated  into  28  subhypotheses independent variables  and  four  different  capital  structurevariables  to  guide  the  hypothesis  testing  and involving types  of  bivariate association tests.

Tangibility  on  the other hand has statistically significant relationships only  with  firm   s  DR  and  DER  while  liquidity  is found to  have a statistically significant relationship with firm   s STDR.     V CONCLUSION SMEs  play  a  very  important  role  in  a  nation   s economy  and  become  one  aspect  of  the  national agenda where the government has embarked on the concerted effort to improve SME stages of business development.  Increased  understanding  on  financial practices  among  Malaysian  SMEs  would  create better  awareness  on  factors their financing  decisions.  Better  understanding  of financial practices of SMEs in Malaysia  may assist policymakers in  providing  enhanced  financing environment  to  the  SMEs  which  may  focuses  on accessible  and  adequacy  of  financing  which  will meet the demand side of SMEs with regards to the evidence  on  SMEs  financing  preferences  and capital structure.  influencing  REFERENCE  Ab.
