In  Buenos Aires  this  past  December  118  World Trade  Organization  members  and observers took the unprecedented step of supporting a Declaration on Women and Trade which sets out a twoyear time frame for action. This coalition has pledged among other commitments to address knowledge gaps and take steps towards supporting greater participation for women in trade. The ICTSD New Thinking on Trade and Gender project aims to increase understanding of the gender dimension of trade and investment policies and agreements in sectors and areas that are underresearched. This paper falls within that project and is part of a series of publications that will examine the gender dimension of global value chains as the structures of international production networks evolve towards higher intensity of standards digital transactions and services inputs.This paper authored by Kati Suominen CEO of Nextrade assesses the position of women engaged in ecommerce examines the regulatory challenges faced by small firms (including those run by women) in selected economies in Africa South Asia and Southeast Asia and provides a series of policy options to alleviate challenges for crossborder ecommerce firms led by women. The paper finds that there is no meaningful difference between women and maleled firms in terms of their ecommerce performance and that womenled firms face the same regulatory barriers as their male analogous. However the share of womenled firms engaged in ecommerce remains small and reflects the share of womenled firms in the overall economy. In  order  to  improve  the  opportunities  for  smaller  womenled  firms  engaged  in  crossborder ecommerce several potential policy options are available such as improving customs procedures for  ecommerce  imports  and  exports  reducing  logistics  costs  enhancing  the  regulatory environment in areas such as online intellectual property and legal liability and supporting access to finance including at the early stages of a firm   s lifecycle. We  hope  this  research  paper  will  help  inform  the  decisions  of  policymakers  businesses  and relevant  stakeholders  engaged  in  international  trade  as  they  work  to  advance  Sustainable Development Goal 5 on gender equality.Ricardo Mel  ndezOrtiz Chief Executive ICTSD viiEXECUTIVE SUMMARYPromoting women   s economic opportunities has become a major global development tenet that permeates the United Nations 2030 Sustainable Development Goals. The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the role of womenled firms and regulatory challenges in trade by focusing on the most rapidly growing area of world trade   crossborder ecommerce in goods and services. Drawing on insight from the authors    several surveys totalling over 7000 firms in developing countries and findings from a random sample of 779 small medium and large firms in 9 economies in Southeast Asia Africa and South Asia this paper finds no meaningful differences between women and menled firms in their use of ecommerce export performance or growth. There is also no difference in  the  severity  of  regulatory  challenges  facing  these  companies  after  controlling  for  variables that typically shape firms    performance. This may suggest that getting women into business and into selling online may help level the playing field between women and menled firms and it underscores the urgency to help women form formal businesses digitise and get online.Online smaller firms are uniformly less likely to export and more hampered in ecommerce and crossborder trade than large firms regardless of whether they are run by men or women. If the policy objective is to alleviate challenges to crossborder ecommerce among small firms led by women then a number of areas stand out across countries and regions as requiring improvements     customs procedures for ecommerce in both imports and exports;    logistics costs including in lastmile delivery that particularly impact more remote and rural sellers;     digital regulations such as online intellectual property and copyright rules legal liability for online sellers and platforms supporting them and data privacy and localisation rules; and     access to finance including earlystage financing fastdisbursing working capital and trade finance.By  addressing  these  areas  policymakers  inherently  also  help  menled  firms  given  that  the challenges of women and menled firms are very similar controlling for firm size and country. This paper offers several potential solutions for governments to implement such as (i) simplifying and digitising business registrations and regulatory and tax filings; (ii) securing and facilitating trade and revenue collection by using blockchain and predictive analytics that separate licit from illicit  shipments  efficiently;  (iii)  adopting  digital  regulations  and  programmes  that  encourage innovation  fuel  the  flow  of  data  promote  secure  online  identities  and  accelerate  firms     and consumers     access  to  secure  interoperable  digitised  payments;  and  (iv)  making  the  financial services ecosystem much more agile and responsive to small business needs through promotion of financial technologies open banking practices that enhance flows between banks and financial services  and  equity  crowdfunding  that  enables  investors  and  companies  looking  for  capital  to connect at scale. Many of these reforms can have a disproportionately positive impact on womenled firms.There is also an important research agenda in general samples of womenled firms are small and  generalisable  findings  are  scarce. There  is  a  great  deal  of  work  ahead  to  understand  how women  perform  as  online  sellers  and  online  exporters  and  importers  and  whether  and  which types of womenled firms   or any firms for that matter   grow faster create more jobs and reduce poverty among their employees and communities than firms that do not sell online.Inclusive Economic Transformation viiiIf the policy goal is to enable womenled businesses to engage in trade online then much more research needs to be done on three questions (i) what are the challenges facing womenled firms that seek to engage in ecommerce and crossborder ecommerce; (ii) what are the challenges facing  womenled  firms  before  they  start  selling  online  to  digitise  formalise  and  start  an online  business;  and  (iii)  what  are  the  impacts  of  business  success  online  on  women   s  lives their businesses    growth and jobcreation potential and their countries    economies? This paper addresses the first question.In  addition  donors  and  policymakers  need  to  be  careful  when  interpreting  data  on  gender differences and should not read too much into descriptive statistics when assessing them. Before deciding that women face higher hurdles or that womenled firms do better or worse than maleled firms it is important to control for the many other variables that shape firms    performance engagement in ecommerce export participation job creation and growth. The gender of the chief executive officer or management team may be one of the factors that makes a difference but it is hardly the only one and probably seldom the main one   and it may not matter at all. 11.  INTRODUCTIONPromoting women   s economic opportunities has become a major global development tenet that permeates  the  17  United  Nations  Sustainable Development  Goals  (SDGs).  It  has  also  become common  to  seek  to  promote  women in international  trade.  This  is  positive  on  at  least three levels.First while there are some studies on the impact of trade liberalisation by gender there are few data on how womenled firms do in international trade  as  exporters  and  importers  of  goods  and services.  Genderbased  reporting  and  data  are useful for understanding what if any differences exist  between  women  and  menled  firms  in their  participation  in  trade  export  and  import intensity  and  diversification  place  in  regional and global value chains and export survival   and how those differences if they do exist vary by country sector and so on.Second  women  are  becoming  more  prominent in  many  economies  as  employees  employers business  owners  consumers  families     main breadwinners  and  investors.  Since  women   s behaviours  choices  and  constraints  play  a growing  role  in  global  economic  activity  it  is useful to know more about them.Third  women   s  economic  empowerment is widely viewed as a means to optimise a society   s productive resources expand the tax base and improve  economic  growth  household  welfare and  intergenerational  wealth  transfer.  In  other words societies are more likely to thrive when women  thrive.  Thus  it  is  useful  to  know  more about  what  women  do  and  prefer  and  what challenges they face   including in trade.The purpose of this paper is to elucidate the role of womenled firms and regulatory challenges in trade  by  focusing  on  the  most  rapidly  growing area of world trade   crossborder ecommerce in goods and services.This paper takes a broad definition of ecommerce as  covering  both  physical  goods  ordered  online the (USAID) and  digital  goods  and  services  delivered  over internet  platforms.  The  paper  is  based  on insights from several surveys covering more than 7000 firms that Nextrade Group has run both on its own and in partnership with entities such as  the  United  States  Agency  for  International Development InterAmerican Development  Bank  (IADB)  and  the  World  Bank over  the  past  2  years  in  Latin  America  South Asia  Southeast  Asia  and  Africa  to  understand how  firms  in  developing  economies  engage  in ecommerce  and  build  a  global  database  and countrylevel index of the enabling environment for digital trade. The survey design and first pilot were carried out in late 2016 and early 2017 with the support of USAID. Data in this paper draw on a smaller random sample of 779 small mediumsized and large firms in 9 developing countries in Southeast Asia Africa and South Asia.1 The data are  from  two  surveys  carried  out  by  Nextrade Group   one in December 2016   January 2017 with support from USAID and another in August 2018.The  survey  work  has  not  been  motivated  by questions  about  gender;  rather  it  has  been aimed  at  understanding  how  different  firm types  engage  in  crossborder  ecommerce  and develop a global countrylevel database on the enabling environment for ecommerce. However the  surveys  do  capture  the  gender  of  firms    chief  executive  officers  (CEOs)  and  owners  and thus  lend  themselves  to  an  analysis  of  gender differences  if  any  in  firms     participation  in ecommerce and the barriers they face.Given  the  attention  on  women  in  trade  and development policy circles one might expect to find  enormous  differences  in  the  performance and  barriers  facing  womenled  firms  compared with  menled  firms  in  trade  or  ecommerce. In  several  recent  surveys  of  firms  a  striking finding  is  how  similar  the  online  sales  export and  growth  performance  of  womenled  firms  is compared  with  menled  firms  of  the  same  size and in the same country and how similarly male and female business leaders assess and rate their barriers  to  ecommerce.  In  short  there  appear 1  Bangladesh Ghana Indonesia Kenya Nigeria Pakistan the Philippines South Africa and Viet Nam.Inclusive Economic Transformation 2to  be  no  meaningful  differences  between  firms run by women and firms run by men in terms of participation  in  ecommerce  or  in  the  severity of regulatory challenges facing companies after controlling  for  other  variables  that  are  widely known  to  drive  firms     export  participation  and barriers to trade such as firm size and country. This  finding  may  in  and  of  itself  suggest  that getting  women  into  business  and  into  selling online may help to level the playing field between women and menled firms a notion that would be cemented by more comprehensive data that showed  that  female  owners  of  businesses  that are  not  digitised  and  that  do  not  have  online commercial  activities  do  notably  worse  than their male counterparts.Where there is a difference is between firms of various sizes and between firms in countries at different levels of development. Smaller firms whether  run  by  men  or  women  are  uniformly more hampered than large firms in ecommerce and crossborder trade. Firms in leastdeveloped countries (LDCs) are more hampered than firms in  emerging  markets.  Small  firms  uniformly see  the  various  elements  of  the  enabling environment for ecommerce such as logistics online payments and access to staff capabilities for  ecommerce  as  more  challenging  than do large  companies.  These  findings  are extraordinarily  consistent  across  countries  and regions and align with a large body of literature on firms    participation in trade. What is new of course is that ecommerce appears to alleviate the  fixed  costs  that  have  famously  kept  most small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) from exporting according to most surveys firms that engage in ecommerce whether led by women or  men  are  more  likely  to  export  and  import than offline sellers.Another finding is that there are markedly fewer womenled  firms  than  maleled  firms  in  any one  category  in  these  surveys   offline  buyers and  sellers  online  buyers  online  sellers  and online  buyer   sellers.  This  of  course  reflects the  significantly  smaller  share  of  womenled firms in the broader economy in most countries and  it  probably  also  reflects  various  challenges and  entry  costs  that  studies  suggest  women  in particular  face  in  becoming  business  owners acquiring  technology  and  capital  and  growing their  businesses.  The  question  then  is  how  to overcome these challenges and help women get into business and become active online.If the policy objective is to champion small womenled firms in developing countries in ecommerce then there are four major challenges to focus on across most regions     customs procedures for ecommerce imports and exports;    logistics costs including in lastmile delivery that  particularly  impact  the  more  remote and rural firms;     digital regulations such as online intellectual property  (IP)  and  copyright  rules  legal liability  for  online  sellers  and  platforms supporting  them  and  data  privacy  and localisation rules;     access  to  finance including  earlystage financing  fastdisbursing  working  capital and trade finance.In  poorer  countries  basic  internet  connectivity and  functioning  of  online  payments  are  also significant  challenges.  Helping  womenled  firms deal with these challenges would inherently help menled firms as well. The first four areas can be improved through regulatory reforms; the latter two  can  be  dealt  with  both  through  regulatory reforms  (such  as  liberalising  logistics  services or  passing  equity  crowdfunding  laws)  and  by specific  financing  programmes  public   private partnerships and tax incentives.Section  2  reviews  how  women  are  behaving online as business owners exporters consumers and borrowers in order to assess whether their economic  life  is  different  on  the  web  than offline  and  perhaps  to  justify  different  policy prescriptions  for  the  two  spheres.  Section  3 discusses  the  survey  results  on  the  regulatory challenges to doing ecommerce cited as most pressing by small businesses including womenled  firms  in  selected  economies  in  Southeast Asia  Africa  and  South  Asia.  Section  4  offers remedies  in  light  of  the  findings.  Section  5 concludes. 32.  WEB AND WOMEN IS BUSINESS DIFFERENT FOR WOMEN ONLINE?Women and ecommerce intersect in the same way that men and ecommerce intersect the opportunity  to  engage  in  ecommerce  shapes how  women  behave  as  business leaders exporters online service workers consumers and borrowers. It appears the web is making a particularly  notable  difference  for  women  in several areas discussed belowBusiness  owners  fewer  women  than  men run  and  own  companies  in  most  countries. According  to  the  World  Bank   s  Enterprise Surveys  data  from  2015  15  percent  of  Latin American  firms  13  percent  of  African  firms and  19  percent  of  Asian  firms  had  a  female CEO and women held slightly more than a third of  management  positions  in  firms  (Sekkat Szafarz and Tojerow 2015). In members of the Organisation  for  Economic  Cooperation  and Development  (OECD)  and  China  25  percent of  selfemployed  people  with  employees  are women  (Adema  et  al.  2014).  Online  these data  are  very  similar   largely  because  many companies  that  sell  online  are  the  same  as those that sell offline. Womenled firms in the sample represent about a quarter of all firms of all online sellers and of all exporters (Figure 1)   that is the online economy simply reflects what goes on in the broader market. Data are sparse for digital pureplays or    born digital    companies;  however  one  proxy  is  capital raised  by  tech  startups  which  in  advanced economies in 90 percent of cases are founded by men (OECD 2018).Figure  1  Distribution  of  surveyed  businesses  in  developing  countries  by  gender  of  chief executive officer by different firm categoriesOf total sampleOf online sellersOf exporters0%10%20%30%40%50%60%70%80%90%100%Maleled firms         Femaleled firmsSource Nextrade Group surveys of 779 firms in 9 developing economies in December 2016   January 2017 and August 2018. The first survey and original survey design was conducted with the support of the United States Agency for International Development.There  is  no  appreciable  difference  in  survey data  between  the  ratio  of  online  sellers  to offline  sellers  for  womenled  firms  and  maleled  firms  after  controlling  for  firm  size  and country.  Whether  womenled  firms  are  more or  less  likely  than  maleled  firms  to  start  to sell  online  can  be  tested  with  a  larger  set of  data.  Another  hypothesis  to  be  tested  is whether  online  sellers  employ  more  women than offline firms. A 2015 survey in the Pacific islands including Fiji and Samoa showed that businesses that are active online are newer and smaller  and  have  a  greater  concentration  of female executives under 45 years of age than    traditional    companies in the region (DiCaprio and  Suominen  2015).  These  women  reported a  preference  for  ecommerce  because  they can run their online businesses while handling Inclusive Economic Transformation 4household obligations and expand their market reach to countries such as Australia to bolster their earnings.A  survey  by  the  International  Trade  Centre suggests that while women offline sellers make up only a quarter of offline sellers they make up  half  of  online  sellers  (International  Trade Centre 2017). This is an interesting finding   but it is based on a sample that is not random and is prone to pick up more women than men. The reporting  also  does  not  appear  to  control  for the possibility that womenled firms are larger or  based  in  more  developed  countries  than maleled  firms   so  size  and  other  variables drive the difference. In the survey here as in other surveys the share of womenled firms in all surveyed firms of online sellers is not higher than  in  the  overall  sample  or  the  broader market.  Overall  whether  women  are  more likely to run or work in firms that sell goods and services online than offline is still a hypothesis to be explored.The  survey  data  explored  here  suggest  the distribution of womenled firms across different online activities is very similar to that of maleled  firms  across  the  various  categories.  While a  third  of  womenrun  small  firms  (of  150 employees)  and  31  percent  of  maleled  small firms  do  not  sell  or  buy  online  26  percent  of womenled  firms  and  28  percent  of  maleled firms  sell  online  and  23  percent  of  womenled firms and 26 percent of maleled firms sell and buy online   very small differences that are unlikely to be statistically significant (Figure 2).Figure 2 Online sales activity of small businesses in developing countries by gender%35302520151050Neither buy norBuy onlineSell onlinesell onlineBuy and sellonlineFemaleled firmsMaleled firmsSource Nextrade Group surveys of 779 firms in 9 developing economies in December 2016   January 2017 and August 2018. The first survey and original survey design was conducted with the support of the United States Agency for International Development.Exporters  much  policy  attention  has  been paid to women in trade. Do women need this attention  more  than  men?  Some  studies  have shown  that  female  employees  in  developing countries  can  be  impacted  more  heavily  by trade  liberalisation  than  men  because  of the  sectors  in  which  women  tend  to  work (AguayoTellez  Airola  and  Juhn  2010).  There is also some work on female workers in global value  chains  (Bamber  and  Staritz  2016). However  womenled  firms  are  not  found  to be significantly less engaged in trade or doing worse  as  exporters  than  menled  firms  other things  being  equal  (Parrotta  and  Smith  2013). A glance at the World Bank Enterprise Surveys suggests that 9.3 percent of firms with a female top  manager  export  compared  with  11.3 percent  of  firms  with  a  male  top  manager   a small  difference  that  will  probably  not  be statistically  significant  after  controlling  for variables that shape export participation rates such as firm size (World Bank 2018). 5Surveys  suggest  that  womenled  small  firms are  just  as  likely  as  and  in  many  cases more  likely  than  maleled  small  firms  to export  and  engage  in  domestic  and  crossborder  ecommerce.  Also  just  like  menled firms  womenled  firms  that  sell  online  are more  likely  to  export  than  womenled  firms that  do  not  sell  online  (Figure  3).  There  has barely  been  any  difference  in  the  export diversification of women and menled firms; in  fact  this  particular  sample  suggests  that womenled  small  firms  that  export  are  more diversified  than  menled  small  firms  (Figure 4).  Only  in  Latin  America  does  there  appear to be a small difference between womenled and  maleled  firms  in  export  diversification (but  not  in  export  participation)  but  this difference is very small and statistically almost insignificant after controlling for other factors that shape firms    export diversification such as firm size online sales activity and country. In  short  womenled  firms  seem  to  sell  and export  online  just  as  much  as  menled  firms across various regions.Figure  3  Export  participation  by  small  businesses  in  developing  countries  by  online  sales activity and gender of chief executive officer%6050403020100Neither buy norsell online andexportBuy online andSell onlineortBuy and sell onlineexportand exportFemaleled firmsMaleled firmsSource Nextrade Group surveys of 779 firms in 9 developing economies in December 2016   January 2017 and August 2018.

The first survey and original survey design was conducted with the support of the United States Agency for International Development.Inclusive Economic Transformation 6What drives differences in export participation is firm size? Of firms with 51 or more employees and that sell and buy online 71 percent of those run by women and 74 percent of those run by men  export  (Figure  5).  These  data  are  similar in survey after survey including when assessed more  granularly for  example  comparing microenterprises  and  small  firms  or  mediumsized  firms  and  larger  firms.  The  data  suggest that  ecommerce  helps  businesses  export (although a share of firms that do ecommerce already  exported  before  they  started  doing ecommerce) and also convey the familiar finding that trade economists have repeated for years smaller firms are less likely than large firms to export. Of course one might then reasonably ask whether a larger share of womenled firms are small firms   such that helping small firms would be about helping women in particular. In short surveys have not found significant differences in the  distribution  of  womenled  firms  and  menled firms across firmsize categories.Figure 5 Export participation of mediumsized and large businesses in developing countries by online sales and gender of chief executive officerFemaleled mediumsized and large firmsMaleled mediumsized and large firmsSource Nextrade Group surveys of 779 firms in 9 developing economies in December 2016   January 2017 and August 2018. The first survey and original survey design was conducted with the support of the United States Agency for International Development.This  is  not  to  say  that  promoting  women  as exporters would be futile or would not improve economic  and  social  outcomes  more  than promoting men as exporters   it well might. This is also not to say that there are no gender biases online. One study found that women selling on eBay get a lower number of online bids and make only  80  percent  of  what  men  do  when  selling the same new products and 97 percent of what men  do  when  selling  used  products   even  if women  are  perceived  to  be  more  honest  and reliable as sellers than men. The study suggests this  is  because  people  perceive  goods  owned by men to have more value especially if goods are army knives or car seat covers (KricheliKatz and Regev 2016).Online  service  providers  online  work  can  be particularly empowering for women in cultures where  they  are  expected  to  stay  at  home  and lack the professional networks and resources of men (World Bank 2016). Empirically there may be a difference in women   s job prospects online compared  with  offline  for  example  there  are proportionately many more women employed on the online platform Upwork (44 percent of total) than  there  are  in  the  offline  nonagricultural labour market (25 percent) (World Bank 2016). This may also reflect the flexibility that online work  can  provide  for  people  to  work.  Online work opportunities enable women in developing countries just like men in developed countries to live as    digital nomads   ; for example Indian 7born Upwork freelancer Radhika Basuthakur has provided  social  media  and  content  marketing services  online  whilst  living  and  working  in various  countries including  Colombia  and Thailand (Feltham 2016).Online  shoppers  women  hold  more  wealth than ever before in both absolute and relative terms. By 2020 women will have US$ 5 trillion in disposable income in China and India alone up from US$ 1 5 trillion in 2015 (Medaglio 2015). Accounting firm Ernst & Young believes women will hold 75 percent of the world   s discretionary spending power by 2028 (Ernst & Young 2013). This is to an extent because women also direct their  families     finances  offline  for  example Asian  women  control  household  spending  on groceries  clothing  and  cosmetics  in  70   80 percent  of  Asian  families  (The  Economist Intelligence  Unit  2014).  It  also  appears  that women are more voracious online shoppers than men according to market research compared with  men  women  spend  20  percent  more  of their  online  time  on  retail  spend  20  percent more in dollar terms online and spend about 40 percent  more  time  on  social  media  including interacting  with  brands (Febriana  2017). Studies  suggest  these  gender  differences  are specific  to  the  internet  compared  with  men women are more voracious as online shoppers but  rather  similarly  disposed  to  buying  in  the offline economy.Crossborder purchases show a different picture. Google   s  Consumer  Barometer  suggests  that while  young  men  are  still  the  most  voracious crossborder  shoppers  in  most  markets   for example in Mexico 65 percent of men in the age group  25   34  years  buy  from  overseas  at  least once a year compared with 50 percent of women in  the  same  age  category.  However  in  China Generation X and Y women are the most likely to  fill  their  virtual  shopping  carts  with  foreign products (Consumer Barometer n.d.). These are descriptive  statistics  that  do  not  account  for such  variables  as  buyers     income  levels   which may be more impactful to their online purchase patterns  than  their  gender.  Indeed  empirical work in the United States (US) finds that gender has  no  particular  explanatory  power  in  online buying  after  other  buyer  characteristics  such as  income  race  and  educational  level  are controlled for (Lieber and Syverson 2010). One interesting hypothesis is that the availability of online  shopping  and  services  such  as  grocery delivery and cleaning services enables women to save more time than they previously spent on household tasks and thus put in longer hours at work perhaps on their online businesses.2 Online  borrowers  and  fundraisers  academic studies  and  anecdotal  evidence suggest that  women  have  a  harder  time  than  men  in accessing  financing  whether  equity  from angels  or  venture  capital  funds  or  loans  from banks. This is partly because of gender biases among  investors  and  lenders  (Alesina  and Lotti  2013;  Calcagnini  Giombini  and  Lenti 2015;  Harkness  2016).  In  the  US  women  that successfully raise equity are found to get only 25  percent  of  the  funding  they  seek  while men get 50 percent (Teare 2017). Women are widely  found  to  be  less  likely  to  make  these requests  perhaps  because  they  do  not  want to raise money for their businesses or because they  selfcensor  believing  gender  biases  will lead their applications to be rejected.crowdfunding The internet may be changing this. PricewaterhouseCoopers  (2017)  finds  that  womenled rewardsbased campaigns (not  equity  crowdfunding  involving  sales  of securities) are 32 percent more successful than menled campaigns. However the study does not control for other variables that may affect these outcomes such as the type and size of organisation  led  by  women  compared  with those  led  by  men   we  do  not  know  whether women  seem  to  succeed  more  because  they are women or because of some other variable. Other studies have found that women have an easier time getting loans online from peertopeer platforms than in the offline world even if  they  tend  to  ask  for  less  money  than  men (Barasinska  and  Sch  fer  2014;  Marom  Robb and Sade 2014).2  Another hypothesis is that by accelerating job growth in warehousing and delivery ecommerce may be enabling bluecollar males to get back to work. I thank Michael Ferrantino for engaging discussions on these questions.Inclusive Economic Transformation 8It  is  not  entirely  clear  whether  success  is due  to  the  web  being  more  genderblind  or to  the  rise  of  women  as  online  lenders  and investors  and  womenfocused  platforms  such as Portfolia or to other factors (Brush et al. 2014). It is also not clear whether women do better  in  equity  crowdfunding  than  in  purely offline  raises   and  biases  may  seep  in  more easily  as  often  in  equity  requests  investors and  investees  still     kick  the  tyres     talk meet  discuss  and  take  things  offline  after meeting  online.  There  is  some  evidence to  the  contrary  in  banking  women  may  do worse  when  relationship  banking  is  replaced by  datadriven  banking.  A  study  in  Sweden found  that  bankers     analysis  of  a  borrower   s creditworthiness  based  on  data  and  papers had  a  greater  gender  bias  against  women than  when  the  bankers  met  the  borrower (Malmstrom and Wincent 2018).Overall  the  jury  is  still  out  on  whether  the online economy is bridging the distance between men   s  and  women   s  economic  opportunities. Yet whether women   s behaviours as shoppers businesses owners or exporters are different in the online economy than in the offline world is somewhat irrelevant. The point is that women use  the  internet  intensively  as  consumers producers  exporters  and investors  and thus  policies  and  regulations  that  shape  the online  economy  critically  shape  the  economic prospects  of  women.  And  to  the  extent  that women  are  more  active  online  than  men policies  and  regulations  that  shape  economic activity  on  the  internet  can  have  an  outsized impact on women.What  then  are  the  challenges  facing  women who  are  seeking  to  do  or  are  doing  crossborder ecommerce? 3.  CHALLENGES FACING WOMENLED FIRMS IN ECOMMERCE9technology For firms to engage in crossborder ecommerce there  must  be  an  enabling  environment with  (i)  excellent  internet  connectivity  and information (ii)  ecommerce logistics  (iii)  online  payment  facilities  (iv)  a skilled  workforce  and  (v)  an  accommodating regulatory  environment  including  digital  and payment  regulations  that  encourage  online transactions  and innovation  and  business access to data and digital services; regulations that  enable  and  incentivise  entrepreneurs  to open  formalise  and  run  a  business  online; and  regulations  that  facilitate  crossborder ecommerce such as market access regulations and  customs  procedures  at  home  or  abroad (Suominen  2017).  Firms in ecommerce and crossborder ecommerce also require various forms of capital   fastdisbursing working  capital  loans  needed  to  buy  supplies and  labour  to  fulfil  a  large  order  earlystage financing  to  set  up  an  ecommerce  business and trade finance to ensure foreign buyers will pay for the good shipped.that  engage Which  of  these  areas  should  policymakers prioritise  to  best  fuel  ecommerce?  And how  can  they  best  assist  smaller  womenled firms to engage in ecommerce? While useful existing  databases  in  areas  such  as  internet connectivity  or  logistics  performance  do  not yield answers specific to ecommerce they do not say anything about the central issues facing ecommerce sellers such as interoperability of sellers    and buyers    online payments systems cost of lastmile logistics or quality of online copyright  rules  and  consumer  protections. They also do not differentiate the severity of challenges  by  firm  size  or  type  which  limits policymakers    ability to target interventions to specific firm types. To answer these questions Nextrade Group has developed data based on business surveys carried out worldwide since 2016. The benefit of doing firmlevel surveys is  that  the  information  collected  is  specific not  only  to  a  country  but  also  to  different segments  of  business  enabling  policymakers to  focus  targeted  interventions  on  firms  in different sectors or size categories.There  are  six  major  results  all  of  which  are echoed by three other surveys coordinated by Nextrade Groupfirms     experience  of  barriers Challenges to doing ecommerce are steepest for small businesses whether run by men or women.  Firm  size  is  consistently  associated with to ecommerce (Figure 6). In all regions surveyed small  firms  give  the  various  elements  of the  enabling  environment  for  crossborder ecommerce an average score of 5 out of 10 a  sign  of  dissatisfaction  and  much  room  to improve. There are practically no differences in the scores given by womenled and menled firms;  if  anything  respondents  from  womenled  firms  give  better  scores  controlling for  firm  size  country  growth  and  exportorientation.  A  study  carried  out  by  Nextrade Group  for  USAID  in  2017  found  that  womenled small companies tend to report somewhat larger  gaps  in  access  to  capital  compared with  their  menled  counterparts  (Suominen 2017).  In  general  however  male  and  female CEOs report similar broad challenges of equal severity  controlling  for  company  size.  Thus the policy question is not how to help bridge gaps  between  women  and  menled  firms    performance  online  but  how  to  get  more women  into  the  formal  economy  and  selling online.Inclusive Economic Transformation 10Figure 6 Views of small and large exporters in developing countries on the components of the enabling environment for crossborder ecommerce by country and firm sizeConnectivity and IT infrastructureOnline paymentsEcommerce and digital regulationsEcommercerelated logisticsAccess to trade financeOverall regulatory environmentin other marketsMy team's capacity to engagein crossborder ecommerceFemaleled small firms                                  Maleled small firms1234567Femaleled mediumsized and large firms      Maleled mediumsized and large firmsNote 1 = very poor; 10 = extremely good.Source Nextrade Group surveys of 779 firms in 9 developing economies in December 2016   January 2017 and August 2018.

In this sample small Southeast Asian firms highlight connectivity and online payments as the main challenges. South Asian firms score digital regulations and online payments as lowest and African firms struggle with their own capabilities to do ecommerce crossborder  and  with  trade  finance  (Figure 7).  In  all  regions  these  challenges  affect firms both in crossborder ecommerce and in domestic  ecommerce.  The  overall  regional score  is  correlated  with  development  levels as  in  other  surveys.  Given  that  the  surveyed firms  are  in  lowincome  economies  internet connectivity is still an important impediment in  all  these  economies;  it  is  less  relevant  in regions such as South America.protection laws (Tables 1   3). Regulatory issues related  to  registering  a  business  accessing licences  and  permits  and  preparing  taxes are  of  secondary  concern  as  impediments  to ecommerce. It is not clear how sophisticated the surveytakers are about the actual underlying regulation  but  perceptions  are  essential  in that they shape whether a firm even tries to engage in ecommerce let alone crossborder ecommerce.  The  findings  also  highlight  the growing importance of digital regulations as a consideration  for  small  businesses  to  export alongside  the  traditional  themes  of  customs clearance  and  market  access.  Nonexporters are less concerned about the regulatory issues for crossborder trade; their primary concerns are the basic issues of accessing financing and lowcost logistics.Of  67  specific  challenges  that  shape  doing domestic  and crossborder  ecommerce topping  small  exporters     lists  are  access  to finance; costs and quality of logistics; customs procedures  for  ecommerce  exports  and imports; and in the area of digital regulations IP  and  copyright  rules  liability  rules  data privacy  and  localisation  rules  and  consumer Access  to  finance  and  alternative  finance solutions  is  a  major  and  universal  binding constraint to small firms including womenled firms  to  thrive  in  ecommerce.

For a small company to have to meet different  consumer  protection  copyright  data privacy and other digital regulations in each new market is excessively costly and can discourage export  diversification.  Divergent  product standards  or  rules  of  origin  have  discouraged export  diversification  for  years  in  the  offline economy  especially  among  small  firms  for which  the  fixed  costs  of  trade  compliance  are relatively higher than for larger firms with large production runs. Paradoxically small firms that are  empowered  by  ecommerce  to  sell  across many markets are also least likely to be able to shoulder the costs of complying with disparate national digital regulations in each new market.Firms that are still selling products or services offline tend to worry about the costs of starting to  sell  online  and  uncertainties  related  to the  return  on  investment.  Asked  to  highlight their  top  three  challenges  for  starting  to  sell online  more  than  40  percent  of  respondents from  womenled  firms  highlighted  concerns about the upfront costs. This result appears in survey  after  survey  for  both  men  and  women and  is  reflected  in  firms     highlighting  access to  earlystage  funding  as  a  key  impediment  to ecommerce  (Figure  8).  Also  access  to  basic Inclusive Economic Transformation 14internet  connectivity  ecommerce  logistics and questions about the return on investment in  online  sales  capabilities  hold  women  back. Men  are  more  likely  than  women  to  highlight small  domestic  market  and  logistics  issues  as impediments to starting to sell online.Figure  8  Percentage  of  small  offline  sellers  agreeing  an  area  is  among  their  top  three challenges to start to sell online by gender%It is big investment for me / mycompany to start selling onlinePoor connectivity and ITbackbone in my countryPoor or expensiveecommerce related logisticsThe return on investment to startselling online is not clear to meOur company does not haveenough IT equipmentComplicated to export to foreignmarkets it get international customersOur team   s capacity to engage in ecommerceSmall size of domestic ecommerce marketPoorly working online paymentsSource Nextrade Group survey of 245 firms in nine developing economies conducted in August 2018.0102030405060Femaleled firms       Maleled firmsIt  must  be  remembered  that  these  survey results are selfreported and based on perceptions. However the data behave as any trade economist  would  expect  the  severity  of challenges reported by online sellers is highly and systematically correlated with a country   s level of development and firm size a familiar predictor  of  firms     participation  in  trade. As  in  many  other  databases  good  things  go together  a  country  where  businesses  assign good  scores  in  one  area  tends  to  also  get good  scores  in  all  areas.  These  empirical regularities tend to hold survey after survey.Another  important  issue  to  keep  in  mind is  that  this  paper  surveys  mostly  people who  are  working  in  a  business  and  do  some ecommerce  as  they  are  the  people  who know  something  about  the  regulatory  issues associated  with  selling  and  exporting  online. Thus  this  paper  omits  a  large  set  of  people who  are  still  dealing  with  issues  related  to establishing a business getting networked to clients  and  partners  accessing  information technologies and so on   areas where studies suggest  women  in  many  countries  tend  to face more obstacles than men.This survey did not ask firms which ecommerce platforms they use; some respondents may well have  classified  themselves  as     online  sellers    even  if  they  use  a  social  media  platform  such as Facebook or Instagram to market online and then perform transactions offline based on those leads  using  cash  cheques  or  bank  transfers. Anecdotal  evidence  suggests  that  most  sellers in  developing  countries  are  indeed  Facebook and Instagram sellers (Suominen forthcoming b). In the study in the Pacific islands women were marketing  to  Australian  shoppers  on  Facebook until at some point they were able to set up their own  online  stores  and  proper  online  payment  15capabilities. A hypothesis to explore is whether social  media  platforms  such  as  Instagram  and Facebook  are  effective  incubators  of  online sellers who then graduate to transacting online after certain events occur such as securing a bank account  to  effect  online  payments  or  securing capabilities to create online stores. If this were the case then the path to an online seller with online payments could be shortened with donor support   or  by  Facebook  offering  transactional ecommerce capabilities. The data suggest that once womenled firms are in business and selling online  women  do  not  do  worse  than  men;  if anything they do better.Inclusive Economic Transformation 164.  POLICY IMPLICATIONS AND AGENDAEcommerce  is  opening  up  new  sales  and export and import opportunities for companies large  and  small  but  many  challenges especially  in  developing  countries  hamper both  women  and  menled  firms  from  taking advantage  of  online  commerce  for  exports and  imports.  Governments  and  donors  intent on  helping  womenled  small  online  sellers  to thrive sell more and export should improve market  access  customs  regulations  and  the range  of  digital  regulations  that  fuel  online transactions  and  provide  companies  with certainty that their IP is protected and their data  are  accessible  and  enhance  womenled  firms     access  to  earlystage  finance  and working  capital.  Specific  challenges  in  these areas vary by country but they are steepest for  small  businesses  and  nonexporters irrespective of whether they are run by men or  by  women.  Thus  improvements  in  these areas  will  help  businesses  run  by  either  men or women.There  are  a  number  of  specific  suggestions for helping small firms including those run by women to sell onlinein acquiring technology setting  up formal Promote  women businesses and starting  to  sell  online.  Studies  have  found several  barriers  facing  women  in  segments not  captured  by  this  survey   those  that  are seeking  to  establish  a  business  and  access technologies  financing  business  networks and talent. Meanwhile it seems that womenled  businesses  covered  in  this  survey   firms that are in the formal economy digitised and online   experience fewer if any gaps compared with  similar  menled  businesses.  While  much more  research  is  still  needed  there  is  no question  that  policy  attention  is  critical  to design  and  support  programmes  that  enable women  to  get  into  business  formalise  their companies  acquire  technologies  and  access financing.  These  aspects  should  be  the  first step  towards  building  an  economy  where there is a more equal share of womenled and menled firms offline and online and in trade.A  number  of  countries  have  created programmes  to  help  women  get  connected in  business  and  into  trade.  For  example  the United Kingdom (UK) has had a programme to enable  womenled  firms  to  access  superfast broadband  connections.  It  also  created  its Women in Innovation campaign to understand the challenges of being a female entrepreneur and  it  hosts  a  womenonly  competition  with awards  offering innovation  grant  funding and  mentoring  (Suominen  Forthcoming  a). A  number  of  countries  have  also  created exportpromotion  programmes  specifically  to women.  For  example  ProChile   s  programme Mujer  Exporta  is  aimed  at  helping  women   s companies to export. The programme offered training  during  2017  through  several  regional workshops  in  Chilean  cities.  The  Brazilian Agency  for  the  Promotion  of  Exports  and Investments  (ApexBrasil)  has  had  a  Women in  Export  project  held  seminars  for  women entrepreneurs  who  want the international  market  and  staged  meetings for  women  entrepreneurs  with  international buyers (Suominen Forthcoming a).to  enter Facilitate  and  digitise  customs  clearance  for ecommerce imports and exports. Online sellers are  almost  everywhere  in  the  developing world hampered by arcane customs procedures and  trade  compliance  rules.  The  solution is  regulatory  reform  and  technology.  For example countries can create a Trusted eTrader programme  so  that  frequent  and  compliant small  ecommerce  exporters  and  importers qualify  for  similar  benefits  as  participants in  Authorised  Economic  Operator  or  Trusted Trader  programmes  (Suominen  2015).  Customs in developing countries need to modernise risktargeting of exporters and importers and parcels through  predictive  analytics  and  machine learning  in  order  to  identify  illicit  shipments and  fraudulent  transactions  aimed  at  avoiding duties  while  accelerating  customs  clearance of  legitimate  trade  (Suominen  Forthcoming  a). Several  customs  authorities  are  experimenting with  blockchain  technology  including  in  Costa Rica Peru the Republic of Korea the UK and  17the  US.  In  January  2018  15  countries  in  east Africa  announced  the  launch  of  Digital  FTA  a web  of  blockchain  ledgers  that  enables  easy generation  of  certificates  of  origin.  Digitising customs  documents  and  clearance  can  be particularly useful for women in segments and countries where there is gender discrimination and  harassment  in  border  procedures  (USAID 2012).regulations that  enable Adopt  digital small  firms  in  ecommerce  to  interoperate across  countries.  Many  governments in developing  countries  have  yet  to  establish domestic  digital  regulations  in  areas  such  as liability  (and  safe  harbour  laws)  for  internet intermediaries  data  privacy consumer protection laws and systems and regulations surrounding  alternative  finance.  Adopting digital regulations  and  programmes  can encourage  innovation  fuel  crossborder  flow of  data  promote  secure  online  identities and  accelerate  firms     and  consumers     access to  secure  interoperable  digitised  payments (Suominen  Forthcoming  a).  In  addition  at  a time when countries are fashioning and revising their  digital  regulations  it  is  critical  that countries  work  regionally  and  multilaterally to ensure digital regulations interoperate and are  compatible  between  countries  in  order for  online  sellers  to  easily  sell  their  goods and services across markets without worrying about  complying  with  different  copyright consumer  protection  liability  and  data  laws in each market. Free trade agreements (FTAs) can  be  used  to  enhance  interoperability  and cooperation in digital regulations as has been done in the Chile   Uruguay and Chile   Argentina FTAs and in the Pacific Alliance.Promote financing of womenled firms. Many governments  in  developed  and  developing countries have created programmes to further financing of women entrepreneurs. In a USAIDsupported mapping of 40 countries    policies to fuel SME ecommerce 21 countries were found to have created specific financing programmes for  women  entrepreneurs.  Such  programmes are  typically  formed  to  overcome  what  the empirical literature  suggests  are  gender biases  among  lenders  and  investors  (Alesina and  Lotti  2013;  Calcagnini  Giombini  and Lenti 2015; and Harkness 2016). For example Business  Development  Canada   s  Women  in Technology Fund has had US$ 70 million under management to invest and coinvest in earlystage  womenled technology  companies. Mexico has a programme under which micro small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  with at  least  51  percent  female  ownership  are eligible  for  loans  from  Mex$  50000  to  Mex$ 5000000 (up to about US$ 500000) with 12   13  percent  interest  for  5  years  (Government of  Mexico  2017).  Many  governments  are  or have  recently  been  creating  venture  funds to  boost  earlystage  financing  especially  for technology  companies;  given  the  research on  gender  biases  in  financing  and  venture capital in particular it is advisable that these programmes  ensure  a  certain  portion  of  the funds are allocated to womenled firms.Open  banking  for  datadriven  lending.  The quickly  spreading  government  practices  to encourage  or  mandate     open  banking      datasharing  between  banks and  other players  in  the  finance  ecosystems  such  as payment  providers  and  online  lenders  through application  programming  interfaces  or  shared data  platforms   is  expected  to  expand  SMEs    access  to  fastdisbursing  loans.  The  European Union  has  been  particularly  proactive  driving open  banking  through  the  updated  version  of the  Payment  Services  Directive  2.  Developing countries could embrace this practice because it can make lending more datadriven open new opportunities for the long tail of less frequent and  smaller  borrowers  and  possibly  be  less susceptible to gender biases in lending decisions as  long  as  bankers  are  aware  of  their  biases when looking at data and use lending algorithms that are explicitly free of gender biases.the  environment Improve for  FinTechs including  through  a  regulatory  sandbox. FinTechs  are  helping  to  bring financial services  to  smaller  borrowers  and  some studies  suggest  help  women  entrepreneurs raise  capital.  Inspired  by  the  UK  many governments  especially  in  East  Asia  have Inclusive Economic Transformation 18pioneered lowering FinTechs    time and money to  market  with  the  sandbox  approach.  This allows  companies  to  bring  to  market  a  new financial product or service without the entire gamut of regulatory approvals and regulators can  watch  the  market  develop  and  regulate undesirable behaviours out. The approach has been found to help energise financial services and  innovation  and  a  number  of  countries have now adopted it. Some countries also see the  sandbox  approach  as  useful  for  financial inclusion (Jenik 2017).Adopt  legislation  for  crowdfunding.  Online sellers  uniformly  complain  about  access to  earlystage  and  growth  capital.  Studies suggest that women are facing fewer biases in securing  equity  financing  online  than  offline. Equity crowdfunding where companies can sell securities  online  to  investors  has  expanded dramatically in recent years and opened financing to  companies  that  may  not  have  extensive investor networks or that are run by women or minorities. Most developing countries in Africa and  Southeast  Asia  still  do  not  have  equity crowdfunding  laws.  Legislation  and  regulatory oversight  are  seen  as  important  means  to  fuel the  crowdfunding  market  and  keep  the  costs of  issuance  reasonable  while  lowering  the incidence of fraudulent practices and educating newer  investors  about  the  high  risks  inherent in  earlystage  deals  (Alibhai  Bell  and  Conner 2017). Women investors in developing countries can follow the footsteps of women investors in advanced  countries  who  have  started  angel funds  and  crowdfunding  platforms  focused exclusively on womenled firms.Understand what keeps firms from formalising and  thus  doing  online  business.  A  major problem in developing countries is informality. Womenled  companies  are  found  to  be particularly  likely  to  remain  informal.  This impedes  their  access  to  bank  accounts  and investors.  Companies  are  typically  informal because  it  is  a  rational  choice  the  costs  of being a formal business exceed the benefits. It would be useful for donors to take a deeper look  at  seller  journeys   the  steps  and  pain points  that  companies  especially  online sellers  in  different  countries  face  when formalising their companies and when making transactions  and  running  their  businesses (banking paying taxes filing for paperwork in customs and so on) and then determining how formalising  a  company  could  be  made  easier and  more  attractive  especially  for  online sellers  whose  success  critically  hinges  on financial  inclusion.  These  mappings  could  be disaggregated  by  gender  in  order  to  discover unique  biases  against  women  in  the  journey to becoming an online seller and operating an online business.ecommercerelated Collect  data  on  the  contents  and  impact of regulations disaggregated  by  gender.  Genderspecific data  in  international  trade  and  ecommerce are  very  nascent  and  yet  firmlevel  data disaggregated  by  gender  are  critical  for developing  programming  specific  for  women and  targeting  development  assistance  to  the hurdles  womenled  firms  face.  Governments have already made progress with some genderrelated  reporting  as  part  of  the  United Nations    semiannual paperless trade surveys. There  is  much  more  work  to  be  done  to classify and quantify the range of regulations that  impact  on  firms  doing  business  online and uncover best practices. One recent effort is  by  the  Alliance  of  eTrade  Development the  author  coordinated  with  USAID  King  & Spalding  Google  PayPal  and  eBay  which analysed 50 regulatory and policy areas across 40  countries  (Suominen  Forthcoming  a).  This work  also  analysed  countries     programmes aimed  at  women  such  as  helping  womenled  firms  use  highspeed  internet  or  access earlystage  funding.  This  type  of  regulatory mapping  appears  to  be  very  useful  for developing  countries  crafting  ecommerce strategies  or  developing  digital  regulatory frameworks.  It  needs  to  be  scaled  and  made on  a  regular  basis  for  the  policy  community to  keep  a  finger  on  the  pulse  of  the  critical regulatory  development  shaping  the  global digital trade and economy. The next step is to assess the impact of these various regulations on different firm types including women and menled firms. 19leading There  are  also  excellent  opportunities  for public   private  partnerships  to  support  women in ecommerce given many corporations    keen interest  in  empowering  womenled  firms  and meeting SDGs related to women. For example TCS  Holdings  Pakistan   s logistics company has been rolling out gender diversity initiatives aimed at increasing the participation of women in the workforce in Pakistan where women make up 49 percent of the population but only 25 percent of the workforce. TCS Holdings has  been  working  on  increasing  gender  parity within  its  ranks  through  a  series  of  women   s initiatives such as hiring women as ecommerce couriers to teach other women in remote villages how  to  use  ecommerce  on  mobile  phones  or tablets.  MasterCard  has  worked  with  the  IADB on  the  #100KChallenge  an  initiative  to  coach connect and certify more than 100000 women entrepreneurs in the Americas by 2021.Donors  can  use  social  impact  bonds  (also known  as  development  impact  bonds)  in which  the  private  sector  invests  first  and upon  achieving  metrics  of  interest  to  the donors  (such  as  some  percentage  point expansion  of  online  export  sales  or  number of online sellers) the donor    buys    successful projects and compensates the private investor for generating social impact (Suominen 2017).On  a  more  general  note  it  is  important  for governments  to  mainstream  trade  considerations  into  digital  regulations.  Regulations crafted by one agency can inadvertently have negative  implications  on  small  businesses seeking to do online commerce. For example consumer  protection  or  data  privacy  laws intended to protect consumers may be crafted in a way that makes it complicated and costly for small businesses to market or sell online. Data are still quite sparse on the trade effects of various digital regulations on trade but it is clear that these effects can be detrimental to  governments     other  objectives  such  as to  promote  digitisation  and  small  business exporters.  In  drafting  and  revising  digital or  other  regulations  that  impact  on  doing business  off  or  online  governments  need to  mainstream  digital  trade  considerations into the process of drafting digital and other business  regulations.  Regulatory  processes need to ask for example is this data regulation designed  to  enable  small  online  businesses? How  do  privacy  and  transfer  rules  limit  my country   s  companies     competitiveness  in  the global  digital  economy?  Does  this  consumer protection  law  or  financial  regulation  or internet  intermediary  liability  law  promote or  undermine  my  country   s  companies    and  consumers     abilities  to  do  crossborder ecommerce in goods and services?These questions can be extended to firms of different  segments  such  as  by  asking  how a  given  digital  regulation  might  impact  on womenled firms or rural firms or firms that are still informal.Inclusive Economic Transformation 205.  CONCLUSIONThis  paper  has  made  six  main  points  first women  do  no  worse  as  online  sellers  than do  men.  A  very  similar  share  of  womenled and  maleled  firms  sell  online  and  womenled  online  sellers  tend  to  export  to  just  as many  markets  as  do  maleled  firms.  Womenled  firms  that  sell  online  also  tend  not  to perceive higher barriers to doing ecommerce than  maleled  firms  of  the  same  size  from the  same  country.  However  the  share  of womenled firms in all firms that have online sales activity is still small and simply reflects the  share  of  womenled  firms  in  the  overall economy.  This  along  with  some  other  early evidence suggests that women may do better online than offline as business leaders.Second these data do not say that women do not  face  higher  hurdles  to  start  a  business make  it  profitable  secure  technology  and financing and so on compared with maleled firms. Studies suggest that in many countries women  wage  a  bigger  uphill  battle  in  these areas than men which may be one reason why most formal enterprises are run by men. The survey here tends not to capture people who are still trying to get into business; rather it is biased towards people who are digitised (as the surveys are in part fielded and thus taken online) are working as employees or business owners and often are using ecommerce to buy or sell online   because it is those people who have  something  meaningful  to  say  about  the challenges of selling online. In this particular set  of  people  there  are  few  differences between  men  and  women  in  performance as  business  leaders  size  of  business  export propensity  and  challenges  faced  in  selling online.  The  policy  question  is  not  how  to help  bridge  gaps  between  women  and  menled  firms     performance  online;  rather  the question is how  to  get more women into the formal economy and to sell online.Third  if  the  policy  goal  is  to  promote ecommerce by womenrun firms in developing countries then policies need to be tailored to the  country  and  the  type  of  firm  regulatory and  other  challenges  vary  significantly  and consistently  by  firms     country  size  and export status. The hurdles that for example a mediumsized company in El Salvador faces in doing ecommerce at home and across borders are different from those that a mediumsized company  in  Indonesia  faces  regardless  of whether the firms are run by men or women. Likewise  hurdles  faced  by  small  Indonesian firms are often different from those faced by large  Indonesian  firms  and  hurdles  faced  by small Indonesian exporters are different from those  faced  by  Indonesian  nonexporters whether  run  by  men  or  women.  Presumably other  characteristics  such  as  a  firm   s  sector or  the  gender  of  the  CEO  matter  far  less   if at all.Fourth small firms led by women (and by men) across markets face higher hurdles than large firms  to  doing  ecommerce  and  crossborder ecommerce they uniformly rate the elements of the enabling environment for ecommerce such  as  logistics  and  customs  procedures online  payments  access  to  finance  and access  to  staff  capabilities  for  ecommerce lower  than  do  large  companies.  They  also struggle  with  digital  regulations  such  as  IP and  copyright  rules  online;  legal  liability  for online sellers and platforms supporting them; and  data  privacy  and  localisation  rules.  The various traditional regulatory issues related to doing business such as registering a business handling  paperwork  filing  taxes  and  so  on appear  to  pose  fewer  obstacles  to  firms whether run by men or women to sell online than the regulatory issues related to customs clearance  market  access  and  copyright  and liability protections online.Fifth developing countries have yet to adopt the  range  of  regulations  that  would  enable their  companies  to  engage  in  crossborder ecommerce.  But  regulations  are  just  one piece of helping womenled firms trade more online. Policymakers should also focus on two other  leading  constraints  facing  womenled (and menled) firms in developing economies  21logistics  costs  and  access  to  finance.  Of course these areas can be improved through regulatory reforms (such as liberalising logistics services or passing equity crowdfunding laws) but  they  can  also  be  remedied  with  specific programmes public   private partnerships and tax incentives.owners.  Once  the  starting  points  in  these areas are the same the outcomes depend less on the entrepreneurs    environment or gender than  on  their  ability.  Empowering  women  is also  critical  because  of  the  central  perhaps outsized role of women in household welfare and intergenerational wealth transfer.Sixth there are several potential solutions (i) simplifying and digitising business registrations and regulatory and tax filings; (ii) securing and facilitating  trade  and  revenue  collection  by using blockchain and predictive analytics that separate licit from illicit shipments efficiently; and  (iii)  adopting  digital  regulations  and programmes that encourage innovation fuel the flow of data promote secure online identities and  accelerate  firms     and  consumers     access to  secure  interoperable  digitised  payments. It would also be helpful to make the financial services  ecosystem  much  more  agile  and responsive  to  the  needs  of  small  businesses through  promotion  of  FinTechs  open  banking practices  that  enhance  flows  between  banks and  financial  services  equity  crowdfunding that  enables  investors  and  companies  looking for capital to connect at scale and leveraging blockchain in  banking  to  run  knowyourcustomer checks and accelerate trade finance. All of these reforms help womenled businesses in  developing  countries  to  engage  in  online commerce;  many  of  them  may  help  women disproportionately  by  removing  gender  biases in  customs  banking  venture  capital  and marketing.Three  final  points  first  while  it  is  not  at all  clear  and  seems  unlikely  that  women  are severely  disadvantaged  when  selling  online or  in  trade   and  some  evidence  appears  to suggest  the  opposite   opening  opportunities for women and girls to get into business and learn about exporting is valuable particularly in  countries  where  women  have  less  access to  technology finance  knowledge  and networks and where they are seldom business Second  policymakers  need  to  be  careful  in interpreting data on gender differences and to not read too much into descriptive statistics. Before  deciding  that  women  face  higher hurdles  or  that  womenled  firms  do  better or worse than maleled firms it is important to  control  for  the  many  other  variables  that shape firms     performance  engagement in  ecommerce  export  participation  job creation  and  growth.  Gender  of  the  CEO  or management team may be one of the factors that  makes  a  difference  but  it  is  hardly  the only one and probably seldom the main one   and it may not matter at all.Third  research  is  only  incipient  samples  of womenled firms are small and generalisable findings are still scarce. There is a great deal of  work  ahead  to  understand  how  women perform as online sellers and online exporters and importers  and  whether  and  which types  of  womenled  firm   or  any  firms  for that  matter   grow  faster  create  more  jobs and  reduce  poverty  among  their  employees and  communities  than  firms  that  do  not  sell online. If the policy goal is to enable womenled businesses to engage in trade online then much  more  research  needs  to  be  done  on three  questions  (i)  what  are  the  challenges facing  womenled  firms  that  seek  to  engage in ecommerce and crossborder ecommerce; (ii) what are the challenges facing womenled firms before they start selling online to digitise formalise  and  start  an  online  business;  and (iii) what are the impacts of business success online  on  women   s  lives  their  businesses    growth  and  jobcreation  potential  and  their countries    economies?Inclusive Economic Transformation 22REFERENCESAdema  Willem  Nabil  Ali  Valerie  Frey  Hyunsook  Kim  Mariarosa  Lunati  Mario  Piacentini and  Monika  Queisser.  2014.
