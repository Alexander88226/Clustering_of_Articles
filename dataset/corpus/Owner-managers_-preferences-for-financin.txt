b'herein file   OwnerManagers    Preferences for Financing A Study of Singaporean SME By Charlton Low and Tim Mazzarol1  ___________________________________________ This paper examines the findings of a sample of small business ownermanagers from Singapore and their preferences for financing.  Using a conjoint design the study examined the personal characteristics of the ownermanagers their strategic intent and the characteristics of their firm and the trade offs they were prepared to make in relation to  control  risk  growth  exit  and  financial  return  when  seeking  a  particular  finance option  from  within  the     pecking  order  theory   .  Subsequent  cluster  and  discriminant analysis found three distinct subpopulations within the sample Group A (The Builders); Group B (Committed OwnerManagers) and Group C (Entrepreneurs).  The    Builders    were found to be most resistant to relinquishing control over their business but wanted an easy  exit  strategy and high  financial returns.   Such owners  tended to be older and more  likely  to  have  been  permanently  employed  prior  to  starting  their  venture.    The    Committed  OwnerManagers     were  equivocal  about  surrendering  equity  control  and had the least interest in exiting the business although they also hoped for high returns.  The    Entrepreneurs    were most willing to surrender equity and were generally willing to seek an exit strategy in order to secure high returns.  This last group was found to have an above average education level and were more likely to have worked within a larger firm prior to launching their own business venture. Although focused within Singapore the  study   s  findings  have  implications  for  both  ownermanagers  of  Small  to  Medium Enterprises (SME) and policy makers in most nations that seek to enhance the growth potential  among  small  businesses.    They  suggest  that  a  focus  on  entrepreneurial education may hold the key to unlocking the growth potential of many SME.  The paper concludes with recommendations for future research. ___________________________________________ Small businesses are well recognised and acknowledged as a vital and significant contributor  to  the  economies  of  almost  every  country.    The  small  business  sector represents a statistically significant proportion of the world economy (Morris & Brennan 2000).  In many countries the small enterprise sector is a major source of employment revenue  generation  and  technology  (Kotey  &  Meredith  1997).    Similarly  Singapore   s employment rate is relatively high compared to its other Asian counterparts.  It is noted that in some industries small enterprises are more effective and efficient at servicing than large  firms  (Kotey  &  Meredith  1997).    It  maybe  the  case  for  Singapore  which  had                                                  1  Dr  Charlton  Low  recently  completed  his  Doctor  of  Business  Administration  at  the  Graduate School of Management   s Centre for Entrepreneurial Management and Innovation (CEMI) at the University of Western Australia. Dr Tim Mazzarol is an Associate Professor at the Graduate School of Management and Director of the Centre for Entrepreneurial Management and Innovation (CEMI) at the University of Western Australia (UWA).    attracted  many  multi  national  companies  (MNC)  as  there  are  many  small  enterprises which are able to provided valueadded services. The small to medium enterprises (SME) sector within Singapore is a key source of  entrepreneurship  and  innovation  playing  a  vital  role  in  that  nation   s  economic development  (Lee  2002).   SME  comprise  around  92  percent  of  all  business establishments in Singapore employing 51 percent of the workforce and generating 34 percent of all GDP (MAS 2004).  This is a similar pattern to that found in Australia the United Kingdom and the United States.  For example in Australia the small firms sector is a major contributor to the national economy and an important source of employment (Commonwealth of Australia 1997).  However the productivity of Singapore   s SME is only  about  half  that  of  the  nonSME  establishments.    The  large  number  of  lowproductivity  SME  coexists  with  a  small  number  of  more  productive  large  local enterprises and foreign multinational companies (MNC).  The key economic challenge for Singapore is to manage this dualistic structure so that all enterprises can contribute to the growth of the economy.  This requires that a concerted effort be taken to assist SME to keep pace with the rest of the economy.  Within Singapore an SME is defined as a business with less than 200 employees annual sales turnover of below S$5 million fixed assets  of  less  than  S$15  million  and  with  at  least  30  percent  of  equity  owned  by Singaporeans (SPRING 2004). More recently the need for SME to venture overseas especially to countries like China and India has been emphasised.  Among the impediments to overseas expansion the most important appears to be the problem of raising finance.  Despite the existence of a  number  of  government  agencies  and  assistance  schemes  designed  to  assist  SMEs  in Singapore financing whether from public or private sources remains a major challenge to  small  firms  when  seeking  to  expand  their  operations  internationally.    For  example Berger and Udell (1998) reported that the primary sources of small business funding are the ownermanager trade creditors and commercial banks.  They present a life cycle for small  business  funding  that  begins  with  all  funding  from  the  ownermanager  and  that shifts  toward  funding  from  trade  credit  and  bank  loans  as  the  firm  grows  and  ages.  Berger  and  Udell  (1998)  noted  that  as  small  firms  access  external  debt  the  ownermanager  is  often  required  to  pledge  personal  assets  to  support  the  debt.    It  is  because small  firms     information  is  often  opaque  from  lenders     perspective.    Furthermore  the small business owners are usually the majority or only stakeholder in the company; as a result  their  entire  personal  and  business  wealth  may  be  entwined.    Therefore  it  is important  that  the  small  business  owner  understands  their  firm   s  gearing  level  and  its returns before applying for bank facilities The  aim  of  this  study  is  to  investigate  and  explore  the  preferences  ownermanagers within small firms have for various types of financing (e.g. venture capital debt retained profits or public listing).  The findings from this study will provide more accurate insights into how small business ownermanagers evaluate and select financing options for their firms. This research will assist in the development of enhanced policies within  private  and  government  agencies  involved  in  the  funding  of  small  to  medium enterprises.  The views of ownermanagers are highly valued and will assist other small firms in the Singapore business community in the future.       Background to SME Financing  The financing of small business has been the subject of enduring academic and political debate.  It has been a continuing tradition for research to focus on the efficiency of the supply of finance to small firms and the potential for credit rationing or finance gaps (Berger & Udell 1998; Wilson 1979).  There is comparatively little research on the demand for finance and its effect on small firms\' financial structures.  On this note for small firms these individual preferences or demand for finance may be a more powerful constraint on their growth than the supply of finance (Kotey 1999).  Policy measures that aim to improve the supply of finance to the small firms sector need to take account of firms\' demand for finance alongside supply (McMahon & Stanger 1995).  The financing decision  is  an  important  component  of  business  strategic  planning  as  it  deals  with  the means  of  acquiring  resources  needed  to  realise  the  strategy.    Factors  which  influence strategic choices in small firms also determine choices of financing.  The main sources of financing small entrepreneurial ventures are equity (supplied either by the owner or other  investors)  debt  (obtained  from  financial  institutions  and  secured  against  fixed assets) and/or retained profit (generated from cash flow). Some of this funding is used to finance  seed  or  startup  companies  while  others  are  used  for  expansion.    Startups are usually limited to the type of financing they can get like personal savings used as equity or personally secured subordinated debt.  On the other hand companies with a proven track record have a much larger choice of financing alternatives such as banks venture capital firms or public offerings. The  characteristics  of  small  business  have  strong  effects  on  the  ability  to  raise funds.  For instance the new startup SME usually seeks financing through the owner   s personal savings or borrowings from relatives and friends.  Furthermore those businesses that are technology based will tend to seek out funding from governmentsponsored funds and grants.  The SME has limitations and difficulties in sourcing finance because of the risk adverse nature of lenders as well as moral hazards or information asymmetry that arises  from  agency  conflicts  between  lenders  and  entrepreneurs.    A  survey  undertaken with  SME  in  Singapore  found  that  more  ownermanagers  were  concerned  that  banks were not extending credit as readily which could affect the firms    ability to service their loans (PSB 2002).  According to Hughes (1997) governments and private sector agencies have increased their supply of funds to the small business sector over the last decade to allow small businesses to take advantages of the opportunities.  Furthermore it was noted that the financial structure of small businesses indicates that the bulk of their funds are from  personal  savings  of  the  ownermanager  and  retained  profits  from  business operations (Thopmson Lighthouse & Co. 1996; Johns Dunlop & Sheenan 1989).  As small businesses develop their financing needs change.  Getting access to the most appropriate type of finance at key stages in their growth is crucial to the continuing success of the business.  While in the early stages of development many small businesses may  rely  on  internally  generated  financing  (e.g.  from  savings  family  friends  and retained earnings) continued growth and success invariably relies on access to external finance.    The  equity  finance  is  essential  to  start  up  businesses  or  to  assist  existing businesses to growth.  That is it is more likely to be important either at the very early stages of a business growth cycle or at key stages of expansion.  If a small business does   not have access to levels of equity finance they need to sustain their capital structure they will have problems accessing debt finance.  The equity finance can be sourced through friends family members private equity market business angels or seed funding.  Small businesses  tend  to  use  self  financing  combined  with  borrowing  against  family  home factoring and in some cases may have access to equity finance to support their business initiatives.  As for Debt finance it is lent by the provider for an arranged rate of return (Interest) and includes overdraft and term loans.  Debt will be an obligation of an entity to  pay  a  specific  amount  of  money  to  another  entity  (Peirson  et  al.  2003).    However some  ownermanagers  may  prefer  retained  profits  which  are  earning  retained  in  the business  after  dividends  to  shareholders  have  been  deducted  as  this  might  give  them better control over the company.  But they may have to tradeoff with lower growth.  It is a  view among  some  commentators that the vast  majority of  SME  ownermanagers are unwilling to raise external equity finance because of the perceived loss of ownership and control (Mason & Harrison 1996).  Overview of Pecking Order Theory   The     Pecking  Order  Theory     (POT)  of  capital  structure  states  that  firms  have  a preferred  hierarchy  for  financing  decisions.    The  highest  preference  is  to  use  internal financing (e.g. retained earnings and the effects of depreciation) before resorting to any form of external funds.  Internal funds incur no flotation costs and require no additional disclosure of proprietary financial information that could lead to more severe market discipline and a possible loss of competitive advantage.  If a firm must use external funds the preference is to use the following order of financing sources debt convertible securities preferred stock and common stock (Myers 1984).  This order reflects the motivations of the financial manager to retain control of the firm (since only common stock has a    voice    in management) reduce the agency costs of equity and avoid the seemingly inevitable negative market reaction to an announcement of a new equity issue (Hawawini & Viallet 1999). The  business  ownermanagers     choices  of  financial  acquisition  depend  on  their willingness to share ownership with investors and the status of the firms in an industry (i.e. startup  growth  or  stable).    These  two  determinants  are  correlated  because  for  instance startup firms are limited to seek external finance sources and the ownermanagers are the only ownership in the business; whereas growing firms may have more choices for external finance  because  potential  investors  and  lenders  can  foresee  potential  earnings  from  these growing  firms.    As  such  the  owners  of  these  firms  are  able  to  make  choices  of  capital acquisition based on whether they want to dilute their equity to investors or not.  As a result it is the owner   s decision that has to be weighed against the possibilities and potential tradeoffs.  The potential tradeoffs are categorised into five types namely control risk growth exit  and  return.    By  definition  control  is  emphasised  on  the  power  to  determine  financial ownership of a company.  Risk is defined as the possibility of losing raised capital to failure projects  or  business.  Growth  is  to  define  the  degree  of  business  progression  within  an industry.    Exit  is  to  determine  whether  to  sell  out  an  existing  business  by  merging  with another  company.    Return  is  defined  as  earnings  received  from  a  company   s  sales performance and investment. Demand for finance is expected to follow a pecking order of internal equity debt and  external  equity  (Myers  1984).    However  it  is  frequently  observed  that  a  large number of small firms are averse to using external equity (Berger & Udell 1998; Binks   1991; Hughes 1997; Hughes & Storey 1994).  Whereas those firms that are unwilling to use a source of finance the pecking order will be truncated at that point.  However if supply  conditions  restrict  a  firm\'s  ability  to  use  particular  sources  of  finance  then  the pecking order may operate in its entirely.  It should also be noted that the majority of SME are unlikely to be attractive to Venture Capital (VC).  They lack the key ingredients of intellectual property (IP) that can be protected and sufficient points of differentiation to  allow  them  to  return  to  the  investor  the  necessary  capital  gains.    Influences  on  an ownermanager   s  ability  and  willingness  to  move  down  the  pecking  order  are  to  be explored.    Therefore  this  study  examined  the  SME  ownermanager   s  perspective  on  their preferred finance options versus their potential tradeoffs. The Theoretical Framework  In every economy either old or the new they have one thing in common for small business  people.    All  require  access  to  capital  in  order  to  compete  and  exploit opportunities  in  the  global  market  place.    As  we  know  capital  access  is  the  largest problem for the development of minority businesses and poses potential challenges for small businesses wishing to grow.  Thus we need to have a deeper understanding of small business  financial  structure.    An  analysis of  the  financial  structure  of  small  businesses indicates that the bulk of their funds are from personal savings of the ownermanager and retained profits from business operations (Thompson Lighthouse & Co. 1996; Johns et al 1989).  Small businesses also rely heavily on shortterm credit (supplier   s credit credit cards and bank overdraft) which is renewed several times and used as longterm finance (Davidson & Dutia 1991; Thompson Lighthouse & Co. 1996 Johns et al 1989).   The  proportion  of  longterm  debt  in  the  financial  structure  of  small  firms  is relatively small with the bulk in the form of personal loans (Thompson Lighthouse & Co. 1996).  However there are limitations in using personal equity and shortterm debt as principal  sources  of  finance.    This  is  because  inflation  erodes  the  equity  base  of  the business over time and owner/ managers may not be able to provide additional funds to meet increases in working capital requirements even where growth is curtailed (Vickery 1987).  Hence the growth of the firm would be further complicated.  In addition to their relatively  high  cost  shortterm  funds  will  increase  the  financial  risk  of  the  firm  if  the earnings  from  business  assets  (particularly  noncurrent  assets  and  permanent  working capital)  are  not  properly  matched  with  interest  and  principal  payments  on  these  funds (Pierson  et  al  2003).    Liquidity  will  become  an  issue  and  may  eventually  lead  to insolvency.    Undercapitalisation  in  small  businesses  is  therefore  associated  with insufficient longterm funds (Finley 1984; Davidson & Dutia 1991).   The Research Model     OwnerManager Preferences for Financing  Figure 1 illustrates the research model used in this study.  Within the model the dependent  variable  is  the  finance  option  selected  within  the  POT  hierarchy.    The  key independent variables are the personal characteristics of the ownermanager the strategic intent of the ownermanager and the characteristics of the firm (Storey 1994).  With respect to the preferences for financing the key attributes are control risk growth exit and return.

These were Control Risk Growth Exit Returns and lastly Finance Options such as Debt Equity and Retained Profits.  The  Pecking  Order  Theory  (POT)  suggests  that  as  the  ownermanager  shifts  their  capital sourcing up the pecking order from retained earnings to IPO there could be a series of trade offs that they must undertake.  These may require changes to the levels of risk control and rate of growth.  For example a firm that chooses to achieve total control by the owners and grow  via  retained  earnings  will  experience  lower  risk  and  high  control  but  will  probably only realise modest growth levels.  In comparison the firm that seeks and secures external venture capital will trade off control for faster potential growth but will also face higher risk.  There are many different definitions of the above variables.  Everyone from young teenagers to adults with different levels of education background has a different understanding of the meaning of each defined term.  Hence the researcher   s definition helps to clarify and align the defined terms used.  Personal Characteristics  The  individual  characteristics  are  those  attributes  possessed  by  the  small  business ownermanager.  The primary demographic characteristics found to be important in previous research  are  age  education  and  experience  (Foley  1985;  Begley  &  Boyd  1986;  Lussier 1995; Steiner & Solem 1998).  An aim of this study was to analyse the relationship between                the characteristics of a firm   s ownersmanagers (tenure age formal education and function experience) and their preferred finance options. Firm Characteristics  The characteristics of small firms have an important impact on their ability to raise capital.  Factors such as the stage of product development risk availability of capital firm type ownership structure and sales history affect the sources and amounts of capital that are the  most  appropriate  to  pursue  (Timmons  1997).    In  addition  the  success  of  the  owner   s search  for  capital  will  be  jointly  determined  by  the  investment  preferences  of  the  capital providers.    Investment  considerations  of  the  capital  providers  include  level  of  investment type  of  firm  length  of  time  expected  return  on  investment  growth  potential  and  risk tolerance (Carter & Van Auken 1992).  Different investors often have different motivations for and expectations from their investments in small firms.  An objective of this study was to explore these issues from the perspective of the ownermanager.  Strategic Intent  A  business  exhibits  strategic  intent  when  it  relentlessly  pursues  an  ambitious strategic objective and concentrates its competitive actions and energies on achieving that objective  (McGrawHill  Online  Learning  Centre  2003).    Hamel  and  Prahalad  (1989) postulated that in order to achieve success a firm must reconcile its end to its means through its strategic intent.  Different strategic intent options can be followed such as the nearterm  buy  out  versus  longterm  growth  objectives  of  our  computer  entrepreneurs  will embrace  different  weighted  combinations  of  these  goals  and  objectives  (Hamel  & Prahalad 1989).  This study sought to understand the way ownermanagers make financing decisions  and  to  determine  if  growth  in  the  SME  sector  is  contingent  on  their  securing financing for their venture.  The ownermanager   s preference for financing the SME may be influenced by various factors (such as control risk growth etc.) and may follow the Pecking Order Theory.    The Research Questions  The present study sought to explore several research questions 1.  What is the level of control risk growth exit and return that the SME ownermanager is prepared to accept in the capital structure of their venture? 2.  If so to what extent is the SME ownermanager prepared to accept preferred financing options such as IPO M&A Debt financing and Equity Financing?  3.  What effect do the personal characteristics of the SME ownermanager have on decisions relating to the capital structure of the venture? 4.  What role does the firm   s strategic intent play in the capital structure of the SME and does it support the Pecking Order Theory? 5.  Do firm characteristics (e.g. size industry type) have any significant effect on the selection of financing options of the SME? 6.  What business practices do different types of ownermanagers (if any) adopt in their firm?    Methodology  The study employed a conjoint experimental design.  While the conjoint method requires greater information processing from respondents than do traditional surveys it offers  a  superior  means  of  evaluating  the  preferences  of  respondents  in  circumstances where there is a need for a trading off of different variables in a decision process (DSS 2005).  The key variables were identified through focus group and personal interviews and  were  used  to  develop  the  measure.    In  this  study  the  Statistical  Package  for  the Social  Sciences  (SPSS)  software  and  BrettonClark  Conjoint  Analyser  were  used  for building the questionnaires and data analysis.  The three methods of stimulus presentation most widely associated with conjoint analysis are the tradeoff fullprofile and pair wise comparison.  The choice between presentation methods focuses on the assumptions as to the extent of consumer processing being performed during the conjoint task and the type of estimation process being employed (Hair et al. 1998).  The fullprofile method was selected for this questionnaire presentation.  The fullprofile method is not flawless and faces  two  limitations.    First  if  the  number  of  factors  increases  the  possibility  of information may overload to the respondents.  Second the order of factors listed in the stimulus card may have an impact on the evaluation.  The researcher needs to rotate the factors  across  respondents  when  possible  to  minimise  order  effects.    The  fullprofile method  is  recommended  where  the  number  of  factors  is  six or  less  (Hair  et  al.  1998). Whereas in the study we had only 6 factors (Control Growth Exit Risk and Return) and rotation was done with sixteen profiles. The conjoint questionnaires presented to the participants had a series of financing options involving some tradeoff between such key variables as Control Risk Growth Exit and Return.  Each of these variables is briefly defined as follows      Control       the  level  of  ownership over  equity  in  the  business  (e.g.  less  than 50% or more than 50%);       Risk     small moderate or high risk of losing raised capital within the business;      Growth     using the industry average as a base whether the firm was growing at a slower or higher level than the average or whether it is about the average;      Exit     the ability and opportunity to retire or sellout from this business; and      Return     whether the respondent considered they had received good returns reasonable returns or poor returns for what was invested into the business. The participants    evaluation of the 16 profile designs was examined in a face to face  interview.    Each profile described a  set of combinations  of different  levels of the variables  of  Control  Risk  Growth  Exit  and  Return.    The  fullprofile  method accommodates both ranking and rating methods.  The rating method was selected using a 10point scale on which the respondents indicated the degree to which they were likely to choose that particular profile as their preferred finance options and tradeoffs if available.  A score of 1 for a profile showed that they would never contemplate choosing it.  A score of 10 indicated that they would definitely choose it if it existed.  Each ownermanager was interviewed on a confidential basis and provided additional background information to their responses to the conjoint questionnaire.  The questionnaire was pilot tested prior to  its  deployment  in  the  field  and  was  translated  into  English  Chinese  Indian  (Tamil language) and Malay.  It facilitated those participants who did not speak English as their first language.  The responses rates it was felt would be higher if not all questionnaires   were in English.  The development of this survey instrument involved the translation and backtranslation of the question items from English to these other languages and is within the capabilities of the author to do this.  It has been said that pilot studies are likely to be "under discussed underused and underreported" (Prescott & Soeken 1989 pp 60) and full reports of pilot studies are rare in the research literature (Lindquist 1991; Muoio et al. 1995  Teijlingen  et  al.  2001).    Different  data  collection  methodologies  were  used  to gather  data  such  as  by  conducting  a  focus  group  study  and  personal  interviews  with respondents  to  assist  in  developing  the  questionnaire  pretesting  of  construct  and measure.  Figure 2 illustrates a flow chart of the research procedures.   Figure 2 Research Procedure Flow Chart    Personal Interviews    Focus Group   Conjoint Questionnaire  Pilot Study(50 Respondents) Review for any difficulties in completion or unusual results   OK             Actual Study (Total 200 Respondents)  To conclude the research methodology started by conducting a pilot study before proceeding with the actual data set.  This allowed collected data sets to have validity and be  more  reliable.    There  was  total  of  three  research  methods  used.    These  were  i) Conjoint  ii)  Cluster  and  iii)  Discriminant  analysis.    The  SPSS  and  BrettonClark software were used in the research findings.  Sample Population and Data Collection  The target  respondents for  the  survey were drawn  from  the  ownermanagers of Singapore   s Top 1000 SME.  The definition of the ownermanager was that they were   the primary decision maker for the company with predominate control over equity.  They also  had  responsibility  for  the  daytoday  operations  of  the  business.    A  total  of  200 ownermanagers were interviewed for the study after having been contacted and agreeing to participate.  Interviews were undertaken over a period of three months by subcontract data collectors who were trained by the researchers. Each  respondent  was  asked  to  complete  a  short  paperbased  questionnaire  that collected demographic and other background data (i.e. such as personal demographics firm  characteristics  strategic  intent  and  the  16  profiles  that  are  used  for  the  analysis).  The  respondents  were  prenotified  and  appointments  arranged  for  the  interview.    The respondents  were  from  a  range  of  industry  sectors  including  retailing  wholesaling transportation construction finance and insurance services which are typical of the SME community found in Singapore. Upon formulating the first questionnaire pretesting was done on 50 respondents.  The  respondents  were  ownermanagers  of  Small  Medium  Enterprise  (SME).    The collected 50 questionnaires (pilot study) were coded and tested with the SPSS software and BrettonClark Conjoint Analyser software.  This was particularly important because pilot  studies  can  be  "timeconsuming  frustrating  and  fraught  with  unanticipated problems but it is better to deal with them before investing a great deal of time money and effort in the full study" (Mason & Zuercher 1995).  This was designed to note any errors and allow minor changes to be made on the questionnaires although ultimately no amendments  were  made.    The  field  survey  was  then  commenced;  data  was  collected coded and checked for any missing data and outliers.  There were a total of 24 cases with outliers adjusted or uncompleted questionnaires leaving a final useable sample of 176 for further analysis.    Data Analysis and Findings  The  main  part  of  statistical  analysis  was  done  by  Bretton  Clarke  Conjoint Analyser  while  the  background  data  was  analysed  using  SPSS  software.    With  the collected data of 176 samples the descriptive statistics of attributes levels had mean and standard  deviations  which  provided  useful  information  for  the  study.    It  is  then calculated  to  get  the  average  importance  of  the  GROUP  attribute  levels  and INDIVIDUAL attribute levels.  It allows us to view and investigate whether there is any need  to  analyse  by  clustering  the  data  sets  with  the  Variables  (Control  Risk  Growth Exit and Returns). This gives an overall preference set.  The Choicebased approach not only employs a unique form of presenting stimuli in sets rather than onebyone but it also differs in that it directly includes interactions and must be estimated at the aggregate level.    Many  times  the  research  objectives  create  situations  not  handled  well  by traditional  conjoint  analysis;  hence  these  alternative  methodologies  can  be  employed (Hair et al. 1998).  Hence Choice based conjoint technique was used in this study as to get an overall preferred set.  As for Clustering techniques these have been applied to a wide  variety  of  research  problems.  Researcher  Hartigan  (1975)  provides  an  excellent summary of the many published studies reporting the results of cluster analyses. Lastly discriminate  analysis  enables  the  splitting  of  a  set  of  observations  into  two  or  more groups.  It is used to distinguish between two or more predefined \'groups\'.  The analysis identifies those variables that contribute most to the differences between groups.   The BrettonClark Conjoint Analyser tested a total of 13 factors of 5 variables.  These variables are Control Risk Growth Exit and Return.  It was used to identify the preferred  variables.    The  results  from  Conjoint  Analyser  identified  five  key  factors consisting  mainly  of  LT50  (level  of  ownership  over  equity  control  less  than  50%); RETGOOD  (Returns  to  investment  good);  GROAV  (Growth  average  compared  to industry);  RISKHI  (Risk  higher  of  losing  raised  capital)  and  OUTEASE  (Ease  of  exit from  business).    The  Cluster  analysis  was  conducted  and  segmented  the  data  into  3 different groups.  Group A had 56 cases Group B had 68 cases and Group C had 52 cases out of the total 176 cases used in the final analysis.  This enabled the similarity groups with respective levels of variables to cluster together.  With the clustering of groups the discriminate analysis was further explored. The findings showed that the Group A profile was the least willing to surrender greater  than  50  percent  equity  control  was  seeking  a  relatively  easy  exit  from  the business and was most concerned over financial returns than the other two groups.  By comparison the Group B profile was average in its willingness to surrender greater than 50 percent equity control was the least interested in an easy exit and was seeking higher financial returns.  Lastly the Group C profile was more willing than the other two groups (A & B) to surrender greater than 50 percent control over equity was average on ease of exit and was seeking above average returns.  Hence all the 3 groups could be categorised as follows.  Group A were named as    Builders    due to their desire for high growth but unwillingness to relinquish control; Group B was named    Committed Owner Managers    due to their desire to remain within the firm and to be satisfied with modest growth and Group C was named as    Entrepreneurs    due to their willingness to take on more risk and relinquish  control  if  required.    The  groups  were  further  discriminated  using  the demographic  firm  characteristics  strategic  intent  and  business  practices  data.    The calculation of mean score of the various attributes and the total utility (TU) enabled us to get the overall preference choice of financing.  The Total Utility (TU) finding shows that IPO was the most preferred and Equity Financing the least preferred.  It will be discussed in greater detail in the following chapter. With  the  background  data  and  conjoint  findings  this  allowed  the  researcher  to have a deeper understanding of individual ownermanagers    preferences of financing and trade offs.  However these attributes in this study may lose some detail in order to get an overall picture.  Nevertheless this actual study allowed us to shed some insights of small business ownersmanagers of their preferred structure and finance options.  Discussion of Findings  The  results  are  illustrated  in  a  Figures  3  to  7  which  are  self  explanatory  with regard to the research questions.  Figure 3 shows the positioning of the various groups of ownermanagers    financing preferences in relation to their preferences for postdeal IPO VC M&A and Debt financing.  Figure 4 illustrates the position of groups in relation to the  demographic  profile  such  as  age  and  education  level.    Figure  5  illustrates  the respondent  groups  Strategic  Intent  and  Figure  6  illustrates  various  groups  of  ownermanagers  with  firm  characteristics.    Figure  7  illustrates  the  various  groups  of  ownermanager  with  respect  to  business  practices.  The  total  of  5  mapped  diagrams  show  the overall picture of the findings resulting from the statistical analysis.

Group A (Builders) are shown as seeking IPO funded growth  and  returns.    Group  B  (Committed  OwnerManagers)  are  quite  different  from Group  A  and  Group  C  in  their CHOICE  PREFERENCES.    This  is  not  surprising  and confirms  their labelling  as "Committed OwnerManagers".  These respondents want  to keep control and are happy to be funded more by DEBT than EQUITY.  By comparison the  other  two  groups  are  more  likely  to  be  growth  focused  and  willing  to  explore alternative funding models.  Group C (Entrepreneurs) are attracted by IPO growth and returns; however they might also seek debt financing options.  Analysis of the differences between  these  three  groups  using  discriminant  analysis  found  that  Group  B  (OwnerMangers)  was  significantly  different  from  the  other  two  groups  in  their  CHOICE preferences.  This was also reflected in the discriminant map of    SME Owner Profile 1 Financing Preferences   .  These different Groups have indicated the preference and tradeoffs over several variables compared to overall group preference. The findings illustrated in Figure 4 show that Group A (Builders) is older in age more  likely  to  be  ethnically  Chinese  and  have  been  permanently  employed  prior  to starting  their  venture.    The  Group  B  (Committed  OwnerManagers)  has  an  average profile with no specific differentiation.  However Group C (Entrepreneurs) has a better educational background with a higher proportion with postsecondary qualifications and is more likely to have worked for larger organisations.

The Group B (Committed Ownermanagers) is the odd one and most different from Group A and Group C in terms of Strategic Intent.  Group A (Builders) and Group C (Entrepreneurs) have similar strategic intents.  Both are more likely than Group B to seek either a change to current strategy or be satisfied with current strategy.  The researcher noted that this study is not in position to make a meaningful explanation for strategic intent as the goodness of fit to the model is weak.  More measures could be used together with current ones for future research.

Of  all  the  3  groups  Group  A  (Builders)  reported  more  profitability  than Group  C  (Entrepreneurs).    Group  B  (Committed  Ownermanagers)  was  more  closely affiliated  to  Group  A  than  Group  B  in  terms  of  firm  characteristics.    Group  C (Entrepreneurs) are reported to have more employees and assets than Group A and Group B.  This maybe the reason for Group C (Entrepreneurs) being less profitable as Group C could have invested in human capital and machine technology. Finally as illustrated in Figure 7 Group A (Builders) and Group B (Committed Ownermanagers) are positioned nearer to each other with respect to business practices.  They would likely have formal business planning partnering with other companies and will benchmark performance.  Group C (Entrepreneurs) differed from Group A & Group B in terms of Business Practices and would likely have a formal process for innovation or new product development as well as partnering with leading customers.

The Group A (Builders) profile is the least willing to surrender greater than 50 percent equity control was seeking a relatively easy exit from the business and is most concerned over returns  than  the  other  two  groups  of  B  and  C.    Whereas  Group  B (Committed  Owner Managers) profile is average in its willingness to surrender greater than 50 percent equity control  is  the  least  interested  in  easy  exit  and  is  seeking  higher  returns.    Lastly  the Group C profile is more willing than the other two groups (A & B) to surrender over 50 percent  control  over  equity  is  average  on  ease  of  exit  and  is  seeking  above  average returns.    Group  A  preferred  to  seek  IPO  funded  growth  and  returns.    They  were  also older more likely to be Chinese and have been permanently employed prior to starting their venture.  They were also more likely than Group B to seek either changes to the current strategy or be satisfied with current strategy.  In comparison with Group C Group A  reported  profitability  is  higher  and  uses  different  business  practices.    Group  A  was named as Builders as they build the firms from scratch.  However they may need to be educated  with  different  finance  options  to  increase  their  knowledge  of  market expectations and criteria of loans so as to make them realise obtaining funds do not come without  risk  involvement.  Therefore  they  should  be  more  flexible  and  have  realistic expectations  when  making  preferred  financing  decisions.    Table  1  summarises  these findings.

They are attracted by IPO growth and returns and might also seek a debt financing option.  They are most different in terms of its strategic intent to Groups A & C.  As for firm characteristics they are more like Group A than Group C.  However their business practices are different from Group C.  Group C are better educated with a higher proportion with postsecondary education and are more likely to have worked for larger organisations.  They are least interested in IPO growth and returns.  However they are  most  concerned  over  loss  of  control  and  seek  debt  financing.    As  for  the  firm characteristics they are reported to have more employees and assets than Group A and Group B.  This Group is more likely than Group B to seek either changes to the current strategy or be satisfied with current strategy.  In terms of business practices this group is   different from Group A and Group B.  Most small firms and ownermanagers will never be able to raise all the funding they would like from their respective banks and financial institutions or their choices of preferred finance options.  In this crude sense there will always be deficiencies in the funding sector which are equal to the differences between the needs and wants for funding.  Conclusions  This research has revealed three promising areas of study.  First a contribution to theory suggested by the findings that personal characteristic shows a relationship with the critical attributes of Control Risk Growth Exit and Return.  However it should be noted that the  goodness  of  fit for  Strategic  Intent was weak  and  as  noted  in  this  study other additional  measures  could  be  used  together  with  the  current  ones.    Also  firm characteristic results reveal that the goodness of fit is just above average.  Both were not taken into consideration for the conjoint analysis.  It probably not a good control variable to  be  used  in  this  study.    Evidence  from  the  literature  review  suggested  that  ownermanagers make decisions with respect to tradeoffs and Pecking Order Theory which is largely emphasised in larger firms whereas most firms in this study are of micro to small and medium enterprises.  More advanced research tools such as Entrepreneurial Oriented Assessment  (EQA)  could  be  used  in  future  research  for  screening  purposes  of  owner   managers that are identified in this study. However  with  the  background  data  and  conjoint  findings  this  allowed  the researcher to have a deeper understanding of individual ownermanagers    preferences of financing and its trade offs.  However these attributes in this study may lose some details in order to get an overall picture.  Nevertheless this actual study allowed us to shed some insights  of  small  business  ownersmanagers  of  their  preferred  structure  and  finance options.  Second the finding suggested that small business owners have several clusters within  its  group.    Each  particular  group  has  a  different  demographic  background  and different preferences of financing.  Most SME don   t grow due less to a lack of capital as to a decision by the ownermanager/ entrepreneur NOT to grow.  It was noted especially in  the  Group  A  that  they  should  be  more  flexible  and  have  a  realistic  expectation  in making preferred financing decisions.  Group A may need to educate itself with different finance options so as to enable them to understand market expectations and the criteria used  to  establish  loans.  Group  A  of  ownermanagers  will  not  be  able  get  all  the    Goodies     and  avoid  the     baddies   .    Third  the  findings  suggest  that  ownermanagers preferences for financing may be a function of personal characteristics to a large extent.  Those with above average education and a background that allowed them to be exposed to how larger firms work were more likely to fall into the    entrepreneur    group.  This has policy implications for Government and its policy makers.  It suggests that the best way to  enhance  the  growth  of  SME  might  be  to  invest  in  management  education  and  by raising more awareness among SME owners that growth must be associated with realistic control risk and return trade offs.  SME  are  so  crucial  that  the  Singapore  government  has  initiated  SME21  a  tenyear  strategic  plan  to  create  vibrant  and  resilient  SME  that  will  enhance  Singapore\'s competitiveness  and  economic  growth  (SPRING  2004).  Despite  Singapore\'s  economic success and its tremendous interest in its local enterprises no study has been conducted   to examine the ownermanager   s preference for financing.  Hence this study of ownermanagers in Singapore SME can provide valuable insights and information for other local and foreign SME. Group  B  (Committed  Ownermanagers)  may  perhaps  be  the  most  difficult  and hardest to push and shift their thoughts as they are basically only interested in daytoday operations.    If  we  want  to  grow  small  business  at  faster  pace  we  should  identify  the members of group C (Entrepreneurs) with their interests and support them with various schemes.    Further  the  need  exists  for  a  real  tool  that  will  explore  to  what  extent  this group is willing to give up control for various tradeoffs before proceeding to institute educational changes.  Hence the Government may want to emphasise more research for screening purposes and introduce additional education tools which promote more training or management seminars to ownermanagers of specific cluster in each SME sector. This realistically allows owner manager to have better choices in financing decision making especially to those lacking work experience in large firms.  Another possible limitation of research is the number of attributes examined in the conjoint analysis.  These research attributes may not be as comprehensive.  Nevertheless when  conducting  the  focus  group  and  in  the  research  process  the  researcher  and  the focus  group  of  ownermanagers  felt  strongly  that  the  variables  used  are  the  most appropriate.  Hence there might have been    minor    factors left out in order to get a better picture.  But it seems unlikely that there are other factors that are more important than the toprating factors found in this present research.  Nevertheless the researcher has done his best wherever he could within his abilities. The research sample or population of interest shown in this research represented a fraction  of  industrial  sectors  in  Singapore.    It  could  have  focused  further to  produce  a more specific group but the greatest challenge for this research would then have been to identify  and  contact  the  population  of  interest.    Previous  research  studies  have  not examined financial companies such as venture capital etc and bankers    preference (tradeoffs)  mode  of  lending  to  borrowers  through  a  conjoint  study.    It  would  add  to  our understanding  of  what  is  the  lenders     perspective  and  which  of  the  above  market segments meet their criteria.  The research area of scope could be extended beyond the shores of Singapore if time permits.  It will be interesting to extend the research study to other Asian countries and conduct a comparative study between various SouthEast Asia countries such as Malaysia Indonesia Philippines and Thailand. To conclude it is proposed that if small businesses are to fulfil the potential as identified by Mazzarol et al. (1999) policy and resources need to realign to maximise the social and economic contributions of progrowth businesses.  Hence together with this research  study  we  hope  the  findings  will  enable  us  to  have  deeper  understanding  and insights of the ownermanager   s mind in their preferred finance decision making.  The different tradeoffs and individual preferences of some ownermanager to be realign to the  actual  overall  market.    From  this  study  it  is  suggested  that  the  ownermanagers    preferred financing may be unfulfilled as shown in the findings especially for Group A.  Education policy maybe the area for government policy makers to emphasis further and assist them by providing more courses for these ownermanagers in small business with better market knowledge in order to compete globally.     pp. 63.
