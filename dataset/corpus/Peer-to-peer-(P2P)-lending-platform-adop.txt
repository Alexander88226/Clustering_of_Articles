International Journal of Accounting Finance and Business (IJAFB) 3(10) 114. __________________________________________________________________________________________  Abstract Peer to Peer (P2P) Lending platform has been alternative financing which minimized the barriers occurred in credit transaction by traditional banks and financial institutions. This platform should have been a solution for Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) with limited access  to  finance  due  to  their  complex  characteristics.  However  the  number  of  loan transaction incurred in P2P lending platforms in Indonesia is still considered low compared to the number of SMEs scattered around Indonesia. Thus this study is conducted to determine the  factors  affect  the  adoption  of  P2P  lending  as  perceived  by  SMEs  along  with  the relationships. The factors that are considered to be SMEs preferences in finding the source of finance through P2P lending are Loan Process Interest Rate Process Cost Amount of Loan and  Loan  Application  Flexibility  (Saini  2011).  These  five  factors  will  then  be  used  as independent variables to assess the adoption of P2P Lending Platform using Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT).The results of this study will be useful as the information  to  generate  recommendations  for  the  P2P  companies  for  their  future implementation and also the government related to the regulations to optimize the use of the P2P lending platform to support the development of SMEs in Indonesia.  Keywords P2P Lending SMEs loan UTAUT Technology Adoption Awareness ___________________________________________________________________________  Introductions   Throughout these years Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs) in Indonesia have been giving a significant role towards Indonesia's economic development. The vital contribution of SMEs in the economic sector is not only caused by their broad dispersion throughout the rural area but mainly because of their ability to absorb a considerable amount of labor force (Tambunan 2006).  The data of labor force employed by SMEs from Ministry of Cooperative and SMEs (2013) reveals that SMEs can both dominate and absorb employment more than 9999% of the market segment.   1             Furthermore SMEs are considered to be more flexible to sudden shock as to what happened during  the  economic  crisis  in  2008.  According  to  the  data  of  Micro  Small  and  Medium Enterprises  (MSMEs)  20082009  from  Ministry  of  Cooperative  and  SMEs  (2009)  the increasing number of SMEs along with the employment indicates that SMEs have higher ability to bear the impact of 2008 crisis whereas the Large Enterprises showing a decreasing number and  employment.  One  of  the  reason  is  that  the  characteristics  of  SMEs  that  tend  to  be  less reliant on formal credits (Berry et al. 2001). This phenomenon indicates that the potential of SMEs  that  could  be  explored  to  maximize  their  contribution  towards  Indonesia's  economic development.  However the potential of SMEs in Indonesia is not yet supported by an adequate source of financing. The survey result of Manufacturing Industry in 2011 published by National Agency of Statistics indicates that the majority of SMEs are experiencing capital problems (Tambunan 2011). Even though the loans from financing institutions are available for SMEs the only small proportion  who  able  to  earn  the  loan  credit  and  they  use  their  savings  instead.  The  risks calculation of SMEs are considered to be more complex; thus it is not entirely suitable to be adopted using the approaches of microfinancing institutions (Tambunan 2011). Consequently SMEs themselves are struggling with preparing the risk assessment documents as well as the business plan.   Driven up by previous constraints current development has come up with a technology that is capable of minimizing the barriers occurs on the process of the financial transaction by which using the Financial Technology (FinTech) model (Klafft 2008). One of the products generated from the fintech model is peer to peer lending.  Peertopeer lending is a platform for consumer loans by which connecting the borrower and the lender through the internet. The borrowers provide the information related to their personal and financial conditions while the lenders assess the risk of the enterprise by themselves which later given the opportunity to choose their preferenced to be fund (Galloway 2009).  Hence financial institutions as an intermediary between the borrowers and the lenders are not needed (Berger & Gleisner 2009). The minimized barriers have increased the popularity of peertopeer  lending  as  efinance  increases.  In  fact  the  peertopeer  lending  model  has  emerged  to financial markets since 2005 with Lending Club Prosper as some of the pioneers.  Currently  in  Indonesia  there  is  32  P2P  company  have  been  legalized  by  Otoritas  Jasa Keuangan (OJK 2018). As for the users according to Daily Social (2017) in August 2017  there are 48.034 people contributed as the lenders on P2P lending while the total numbers P2P lending borrowers reached 120.174 dominated by borrowers in Java by 9479% with 113.912 borrowers. Whereas the number of SMEs scattered around Indonesia according to National Agency of Statistics (2013) has reached 57 million units. Hence compared to the high number of SMEs this indicates the low adoption of the P2P platform by SMEs in Indonesia.  This study is conducted  to identify the factors contribute to  P2P lending platforms adoption perceived by SMEs as well as the level of importance of the factors that affect the behavioral usage of P2P lending. The findings of this study are expected to be useful as the information to generate recommendations for the P2P companies for their future implementation and also the government related to the regulations to optimize the use of the P2P lending platform to support the development of SMEs in Indonesia. The results of this study also may change in  2             the future. Therefore the future research about this topic would be encouraged to guarantee the accuracy and achieve the research's objectives.  Research Methodology  This preliminary study begins with problem identification followed by  determining research questions  and  research  objective  that  would  like  to  be  achieved  in  a  defined  scope  and limitation. After defining the research objective previous works of literature are reviewed not only support the research but also to provide explanations regarding the terms mentioned in this  study.  Secondary  data  which  collected  from  journals  publications  textbook  official websites  to  later  being  analyzed.  At  last  conclusion  and  recommendation  are  derived regarding the result generated in the study.  Literature Review   Definition of Small and Medium Enterprises (SMEs)  According  to  Law  of  Small  Enterprises  Number  9/1995  a  business  is  classified  as  Small Enterprises (SE) if it owns a total asset less than Rp 200 million in which excludes land and buildings with annual sales less than Rp 1billion that is including microenterprises or MIEs. While  Medium  enterprises  (MEs)  defined  as  a  business  unit  that  owns  asset  between  Rp 200million up to Rp 10billion with annual sales ranged between Rp 1billion to Rp 50billion (Department of Finance 2018).  National Agency of Statistic (BPS) on the other hand defines SMEs based on the number of employees  in  which  Micro  Enterprises  (MIEs)  are  business  unit  that  employs  14  workers included  unpaid  family  members.  As  for  Small  enterprises  is  a  business  unit  employs  519 workers. While Medium enterprises employ 2099 workers (Tambunan 2011).  Moreover on July 4th 2008 Indonesia set the Law of Republic Indonesia Number 20/2008 regarding Small and Medium Enterprises in which classifies the business units according to their Net Asset Owned (excluding land and buildings) and Annual Sales Income. Those are Microenterprises or MIEs defined by its total asset of maximum Rp 50million with annual sale income of  maximum Rp 300million. As for Small enterprises  classified by its net capital of more than Rp50million up to Rp500million  and annual sales more than Rp300million up to Rp25 billion. While medium enterprises (MEs) is a business unit with net asset of more than Rp  500million  up  to  a  maximum  of  Rp  10billion  with  the  annual  income  of  more  than Rp2.5billion up to a maximum of Rp 50billion (Bank of Indonesia 2018).   Table 1 SMEs according to Law of Republic Indonesia Number 20/2008 (Bank of Indonesia 2018)         Despite the difference in classification of the size of the business according to the definition stated by several sources of agency explained above it indicates the same level of maximum 3              asset  owned  and  annual  income  earned  by  medium  enterprises.  Thus  the  differences  occur only  between  the  sizes  of  the  business  of  SMEs.  Besides  for  the  importance  of  this  study according to the previous study of Tambunan (2009) micro enterprises are included in small enterprises. Hence the term SMEs in this study refers to Small Enterprises (which includes micro enterprises) and Medium Enterprises.    Previous Studies of SMEs  Previous studies related to SMEs are presented as follows Table 2 Previous Studies of SMEs  Author/Year  Objectives Tulus Tambunan (2006) To  examine development SMEs Indonesia. the of in Result      SMEs in Indonesia dominate  more than 90 percent of total business run in the country and have a high ability to absorb employment and thus  they  hold  a  crucial  role  towards  Indonesia's  economic development.       SMEs contributes high performance regarding the GDP mainly due to their massive amount of dispersion if compared to large enterprises not because of the productivity      SMEs  dispersed  across  the  rural  area  indicates  that  SMEs  has successfully triggered the entrepreneurship potential of villagers.      Limited  working  capital  and  difficulties  in  marketing  become  the significant barrier experienced by SMEs.       SMEs  as  one  of  the  dominant  factors  in  lowering  the  countries' unemployment rate.      SMEs' ability to quickly adapt to unstable conditions is due to their characteristic of innovative and dynamic. of      SMEs  competitiveness  in  the  market  occurs  as  the  result  of  their product and services innovations that are easily applied and rapidly introduced to their customers.      SMEs  are  eligible  subject  to  be  exposed  to  technology  for  their industrial needs. Therefore increasing the dispersion of SMEs could trigger the technology diffusion to boost the country's economy  in global competition.      Their  financial  access  to  banks  and  investors  are hampered  due  to several reasons 1.  SMEs  risky  characteristic  concerning  inadequate  assets  low 2. capitalization and its response to market change. Information  asymmetry  as  the  result  of  insufficient  financial records that affects the creditworthiness assessment done by the banks.      Financing constraints of small enterprises affect the  business grew nearly twice as the large enterprises financing constraints do (Beck Demirg    Kunt and Maksimovic 2005)      A finding from Banerjee and Duflo (2004) indicates the increase in sales as the result of the additional credit obtained by SMEs       Investment  Climate  Surveys  across  SMEs  in  developing  countries indicates that majority of small and medium enterprises funds their investment  through  internal  funds  and  less  likely  to  fund  the investment through bank compared to large enterprises.      Barriers  to  competition  access  to  finance  worsen  by  the  price  of energy become the three constraints mainly chosen by SMEs      The  constraints  related  to  capital  which  are  access  to  finance  and price  of  energy  are  the  main  factors  that  hampered  their  business growth. 4  Ahliman Abbasov Tahmasib Alizada (2016) the owned in the SMEs To  discuss potential by stimulating economic development transition countries.

Limited access to credit financing of SMEs from commercial banks is caused by information asymmetry which leads to further financing difficulties.      SMEs access to credit financing is determined regarding the firm   s characteristic  financial  information  loan  characteristic  and  loan repayment capacity      Firm characteristic includes size and operating period.      Owner characteristics include age and educational background.      Loan characteristics which cover interest rate repayment period.      Loan repayment capacity in which collateral and owner   s equity.  According to Marketeers (2018) the data from OJK shows that currently there are only 41% of financial institutions could fulfill the credit needs of SMEs. This condition would hamper not only for the development of SMEs but also for the economy of the country. Even if there are plenty of governmentsponsored loans and credit provided by formal financial institutions SMEs in Indonesia tend to rely on their financing relatives or from the informal institution (Tambunan 2008).    These  problems  related  to  SMEs  financing  ability  shows  how  financial  institutions  in  the country  is  underdeveloped  and  undoubtedly  affects  the  development  of  the  business  itself (Tambunan 2011).  Peer to Peer Lending Platform  Peer to peer lending is a financing platform that directly connects the lenders and borrowers using  online  intermediaries  with  no  financial  institutions  needed  (Chen  et  al.  2014).  The lenders can be individual or a firm and so are the borrowers based on the P2P specification (Galloway 2009). The P2P lending procedure is illustrated in the figure as follows  At first both potential borrower and lender are obligated to create an account on a specific P2P platform in which requires the user's data which includes name address phone numbers and bank  account.  The  platform  will then  rate  the  borrowers  for the credit  ratings  regarding  the information  provided.  However  the  credit  rating  process  is  different  and  less  complicated compared  to  the  traditional  bank  by  which  incorporate  Big  Data  and  Rating  Agency Information in doing survey and evaluation (Wang et al. 2015).   Secondly  the  accepted  creditworthy  of  borrowers  are  then  allowed  to  create  their  loan application consists of the loan amount maximum interest rate and loan purpose and other borrower's preferences. These loan requests are presented on the platform as the choices for the  potential  investors.  The  investors  as  the  lender  will  use  their  assessment  regarding  the information provided by the borrowers. Eventually unlike conventional banks the investors are the one who has to bear the credit risk not the P2P lending platform (Stern et al. 2017).   5             Lastly the approved lending will be transferred from the lenders' to the borrowers' account. As for the payback the borrowers will transfer the amount back to the lenders on the due date (Chen et al. 2014).  Peer  to  peer  lending  platform  has  been  emerging  since  2015.  The  first  P2P  website  was established in U.K named Zopa. There are several platforms of P2P scattered around the world such as Lending Club and Prosper.  In  Indonesia  P2P  lending  has  been  emerging  since  2016  with  KoinWorks  as  the  first  P2P lending platform in Indonesia. There are several leading P2P platforms legalized by OJK some of which are Modalku Amartha Investree and Koinworks. According to Daily Social (2018) the data from OJK in 2017 shows that the amount funded through P2P lending has reached Rp 144 trillion.   Table 3 Funding in Fintech Lending in August 2017 (Daily Social 2018)  Borrowing Factors  According to Saini (2016) there are five factors considered by SMEs in obtaining a loan in the P2P platform which are 1.  loan process 2.  interest rate 3.  process cost  4.  the lowest amount of loan and 5.  the flexibility of loan application.  Thus  further  discussion  regarding  the  factors  considered in  borrowing  from  P2P  lending  is presented  in  previous  studies  along  with  the  illustration  of  real  application  of  P2P  by Indonesia   s biggest P2P companies that focus on funding SMEs in particular some of which are  Koinworks  (Koinworks.com)  Investree  (Investree.com)  Modalku  (Modalku.com)  and Amartha (Amartha.com).  Loan Process   Loan process in P2P lending does not require any paperwork and can be conducted using the internet.  By  applying  the  fintech  technology  the  loan  process  on  P2P  lending  can  be conducted  relatively  faster  than  conventional  banks  (Wei  2016).  As  stated  in  the  P2P companies    website the loan process in which includes admission filling approval process and funding process may vary on the company. (Modalku 2018; Koinworks 2018).   Moreover according to a Namvar (2013) loans in P2P lending does not collateralize by any asset which could increase the risk of defaults on the loans. Collateral as mentioned in a study  6             by Nkundabanyanga (2014) is borrower   s assurance given to the lender to guarantee the loan repayment in the future (Atieno 2001).  This finding might be another solution to answer the difficulties of SMEs in obtaining the loan from commercial banks due to their inadequate collateral (Abe et al. 2015). Thus to minimize the risk companies like Koinworks (2018) and Modalku (2018) require personal guarantees for the loan application to take full responsibility in case of default.

SMEs  have  a  higher  inability  in  providing  collateral compared to large enterprises.      SMEs are less likely to apply for credit loan if they fail to understand the necessity to provide collateral.       Banks  tend  to  offer  a  more  substantial  amount  of  loan more extended loan repayment period and lower interest rates to borrowers with collateral (Safavian et al. 2006).      Borrowers that unable to provide required collateral have loan lower  probability  of  obtaining  credit  with a characteristic as mentioned.

To discuss the potential owned  by  SMEs in stimulating the economic  development of transition countries.       Accessibility to credit loan from banks is affected by the value of collateral provided by the borrowers.      Accessibility to formal credit will increase 17% for every one unit of collateral size increased.      Guarantee program is aimed to minimize lending cost.       Despite the low number of successful guarantee programs due to the inability of the guarantors to make the payment on  time  it  has  been  proven  to  gain  SMEs  alternative source of finance.  Interest Rate   Nkumbanyanga (2014) in his previous study mentioned that interest rate concerning lending is the rate that the borrower must pay subject to the use of money  (Cowling and  Westhead 1996) also used to adjust the risk taken by the banks (Smith and Smith 2000).   Website of Koinworks (2018) states that interest rate offered by P2P lending companies are more competitive compared to the rate offered by conventional banks. As stated by Investree (2018)  the  interest  rate  given  to  the  borrower  is  determined  from  the  credit  scoring  done previously and not to mention for Koinworks (2018) which also determine the interest rate based  on  the  grading  system  to  show  the  borrower's  ability  to  pay  the  loan.  The  lower  the borrowers    grade the higher the interest rate due to higher risk the lender must bear (Emekter et  al.  2015).  Overall  every  company  has  different  consideration  in  determining  borrower's interest rate. 7             Previous Studies of Interest Rate  Previous studies related to Interest Rate are presented as follows Table 5 Previous Studies of Interest Rate   Author/Year Objectives Result  Stephen Korutaro Nkundabanyanga Denis Kasozi and Irene Nalukenge (2014) To examine the relationship of banks lending terms and financial literacy to SMEs accessibility in obtaining credit loan.

SMEs are less likely to apply for formal credit when they are exposed to the loan with interest rates that considered too high for them. (Aryeetey et al. 1994 Stiglitz and Weiss 1981)      Interest rates that are considered as attractive become one the essential factors towards credit accessibility.      The banks put highinterest rate for SMEs due to risks that occur from the borrowers provided information (Hossain 1988).       According to the survey SMEs in Bhutan are charged with highinterest rates from the banks.      The SMEs perceive the highinterest rates as a burden for their access to finance.      The higher the interest rates the riskier the borrower and thus increase the possibility of default.      The higher interest rates will then increase the return for the lender at a decreasing rate.  Process Cost   Peer  to  peer  lending  does  not  require  conventional  financial  institutions  as  an  intermediary between lenders and borrowers. Moreover its application is also made in the online platform. These  conditions  allow  P2P  companies  to  be  able  to  cut  off  any  excess  cost  required  in conventional banks (Klafft & Michael 2008).  For  instance  the  cost  could  be  in  the  form  of  loan  approval  cost  (Modalku  2018)  or administration  cost  Other  additional  costs  in  which  consists  of  interest  cost  and  guarantee binding fees are occurring in Investree (2018). Koinworks charges life insurance and also late payment fees and loan collection fees in case the borrower is unable to pay for the loan (2018). Also Early Repayment Fee is commonly not charged to the borrowers if they want to pay the loan before maturity date (Koinworks 2018 Modalku 2018)  Previous Studies of Process Costs  Previous studies related to Process Costs are presented as follows Table 6 Previous Studies of Process Costs  Author/Year Beck T.H.L. (2007) Objectives To discuss  SMEs' empirical evidence concerning  constraints and way of financing.  Result      Fixed transaction cost occurs in credit assessment processing and monitoring activity of commercial banks.      The existence of fixed transaction cost causes the unit costs to decrease for every loan amount increased.      SMEs opaque characteristics drive up costs of assessment and monitoring.      As transaction cost increases the lending cost exposed to the borrower increases 8              Ahliman Abbasov Tahmasib Alizada (2016) Hongbo Duan Xiaojie Han & Hongbo Yang (2009) To discuss the potential owned by SMEs in stimulating the economic development of transition countries.  To discuss the reason for SMEs' constraints in financing.      High lending costs lead to a higher barrier for the borrower in paying back the loan thus increasing the possibility of default.      Banks consider lending small sizedloan is not so profitable for them concerning costs due to more administrative costs that occur.      A risk premium is added and also the controlling costs resulting in increased costs for both banks and borrower.      SMEs perceive more burden in financing compared to large firms due to high transaction costs.      The unit transitions costs get higher as the loan amount gets smaller as bank loan follows the economic scale.      SMEs are given similar complex procedures as large firms which require five times higher management costs for SMEs than for large firms. Therefore Banks tend to offer loans for large forms to maximize the profit.  The Loan Amount   The study of Herzenstein et al. (2008) states that the success of P2P lending is defined whether the loan request is fully funded or not. According to Koinworks (2018) there is a probability that a loan request could be fully funded; however Koinworks does not guarantee the success of it. Should the loan request funding does not reach the target in a certain period there will be further discussion between the company and the borrowers (Modalku 2018). In other words the request is unsuccessful thus the collected fund will be returned to the investors (Koinworks 2018). Moreover to increase the probability of loan success the actual implementation of P2P requires  the  lenders  to  invest  a  minimum  amount  of  money  in  overcoming  the  companies' limited total funds amount (Guo 2016).   Previous Studies of Loan Amount  Previous studies related to Loan Amount are presented as follows Table 7 Previous Studies of Loan Amount  Author/Year Dario Czira  ky Sanja Tis  ma Anamarija Pisarovic (2005) Michal Herzenstein Rick L. Andrews Utpal M. Dholakia Evgeny Lyandres  (2008) Objectives  To examine the factors that determine credit approval and consistency of credit assessment. To analyze the determinants concerning borrowers and loan listing that affect the funding success in P2P Lending.   Result      Smaller loan amount has higher possibility to be approved compared to larger one in the US (Edelstein 1975).      In practice more massive loans that approved perform a better repayment ability.      In Croatian SB2000 loan programme banks' preference towards smaller loan may cause by the riskaverse characteristic of the banks.       Borrowers characteristics have positive relationship towards loan amount applied.      Those who own children and show similar indicator to hamper their payment ability tend to apply for lower amounts.      Males and those with unprovided information regarding their gender tend to apply for higher loan amounts compared to women.      P2P lenders    preference in bidding small loans is due to risk dispersion.      The bigger the loans the more lender needed to fund the loan which will lead to a lower possibility of funding success.  9             The flexibility of Loan Application  Saini (2016) states that flexibility of loan application is considered by SMEs in obtaining the loan. In this study the terms refer to the borrowers' ability to choose from whom to borrow the rate of the loans and the tenor she/he desires.  Loan repayment period as mentioned by Atieno (2001) is the period given to the borrower to pay back the loan. The borrowers are free to choose loan repayment period or tenor offered by P2P companies in which are three months six months nine months 12 months 18months and 24 months (Modalku 2018).   However the ability to choose the lender and the interest rate is not provided by those P2P companies. Companies like Investree (2018) and Amartha (2018) display the approved loan in a system called marketplace to later be funded by willing investors while the interest rate is determined from the credit rating classification.

Technology Adoption  Study of Straub (2009) explains that adoption theory analyzes how an individual makes choices related  to  acceptance  or  rejection  towards  particular  innovation.  This  finding  has  been  a concern for researchers to address the acceptance of technology of the consumers (Lai 2007). Straub (2009) also mentions seeing the complex inherently social and the advanced process of technology adoption  several factors may be taken into account to illustrate the process and how fast the adoption of the consumers towards technology some of which are time and social pressures.  Conceptual Framework  The proposed conceptual framework for this study is presented in the figure below to illustrate the relationship between all variables 10             Figure 6 Modified UTAUT Study of Saini (2011)   From  the  conceptual  framework  above  we  could  see  how  the  adoption  of  P2P  lending  as perceived  by  SMEs  in  Indonesia  is  affected  by  specific  factor  that  is  considered  as  SMEs' preferences in obtaining loan mentioned by Saini (2011) in which are Loan Process; Interest Rate; Process Cost; Loan Amount; and Loan Application Flexibility. Referring to the UTAUT model  (Venkatesh  et  al.  2003)  these  independent  variables  will  then  be  tested  using  the hypotheses  respectively  H1  H2  H3  H4  and  H5  to  determine  the  relationship  towards Behavioral Intention to Use as intervening variables followed by testing the hypothesis of H6 to determine relationship of behavioral intention toward the actual use of P2P platform as the dependent variable. Using this study's conceptual frameworks we can determine the level of importance of each factor to know which factor of SMEs preference contributes the highest in choosing their source of financing.  Discussions and Analysis  This study is conducted based on modified Venkatesh et al.(2003) model of Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (UTAUT) in which uses the factors mentioned in study of Saini  (2011)    as  the  determinants  towards  the  usage  behavioral  which  are  Loan  Process Interest Rate Process Cost Loan Amount and Loan Application Flexibility. These five factors are considered to be SMEs' preferences particularly in finding the source of finance offered by P2P Lending (Saini 2011) considering that according to previous studies we have discussed these factors may hamper the SMEs in obtaining formal credit from commercial banks due to their opaque characteristics Beck (2007). Hence this study is aimed to find the relationship of all of these factors as independent variables towards Behavioral Intention to Use P2P Platform along with Actual Use of P2P platform with hypothesis are presented as follows  a.  Loan Process H1 Loan process has positive relationship towards Behavioral Intention to Use the P2P platform b.  Interest Rate H2 Interest rate has positive relationship towards Behavioral Intention to Use the P2P platform c.  Process Cost H3 Process cost has positive relationship towards Behavioral Intention to Use the P2P platform   11             d.  Loan Amount H4 Loan Amount has positive relationship towards Behavioral Intention to Use P2P  e.  Loan Flexibility H5 Loan flexibility has positive relationship towards Behavioral Intention to Use P2P f.  Behavioral Intention to Use P2P Platform H6  Behavioural  Intention  has  positive  relationship  towards  Actual  Use  of  the  P2P platform  Conclusions   Peer to Peer Lending as the source of finance has eliminated barriers that hampered SMEs around  Indonesia  in  obtaining  their  access  to  finance.  Whereas  previous  studies  show  that SMEs got potential in supporting Indonesia's economic development. Looking at the number of P2P lending users the total users are still low compared to the number of SMEs scattered whether around Bandung or Indonesia. Driven up by this condition the study is conducted to analyze the awareness level as well as the adoption of P2P lending as the solution of SMEs' source of finance. Modified UTAUT model (Venkatesh et al. 2003) using the factors from the study  of  Saini  (2011)  will  be  used  to  examines  which  factors  of  the  P2P  lending  that  have significant  roles  for  SMEs  to  use the  platform.  The  factors  adopted  from the  study  of  Saini (2011) that are considered to be SMEs preferences in finding the source of finance through P2P lending are Loan Process Interest Rate Process Cost Amount of Loan and Loan Application Flexibility.  These  five  factors  will  then  be  used  as  independent  variables  to  assess  the Behavioral Intention from UTAUT as well as the Actual Use of P2P Lending Platform.  Future Research  Future research of this continuous study will be using the attributes generated from the factors presented on the conceptual frameworks. The attributes will be used as the references of how the questionnaire would be conducted to be later analyzed using quantitative approach.    In the future the result of this study can be used as further research to be applied not only in Bandung City but also in other areas around Indonesia. As the society is developing the study in the following years might generate a different result by using the same model.  References   Abbasov A. & Alizada T. (2016).
