Boot Jeroen E. Ligterink and Jens K. Martin                                                    ISBN 9789077859179     2018 Amsterdam Center for Corporate Finance   All rights reserved  PREFACE  In front of you is the 26th issue of the ACCF Topics in Corporate Finance series dedicated to two key issues in finance the impact of fintech on banking and the role that private equity plays in the economy.   The  first  chapter  focuses  on  fintech.  The  main  ingredient  are  developments  in  information technology  that  play  a  leading  role  in  the  transformation  of  banking.  The  recent  focus  on  fintech      basically new technologydriven players entering the financial services industry     is the latest manifestation of the impact of information technology on the  industry. The  focus  is  on the  structure  of  the  banking industry  going  forward.  The  author  concludes  that  much  uncertainty  remains  as  fintech  will  lead  to  a disaggregation of the value chain and will challenge the bankcustomer interface at the core. The sector will need agility and flexibility to deal with the challenges ahead. The  second  chapter  is  dedicated  to  the  advantages  and  disadvantages  of  private  equity.  How should private equity be viewed? Does it play a valuable role in the economy? And what is its impact on the various stakeholders? The study focuses on buyouts. These are takeovers of mature companies (or parts of companies) by investors financed with considerable leverage (debt). Debates on this topic are often  heated. The  picture  that  emerges  is  a  nuanced  one.  Broadly speaking  the  authors  conclude  that private  equity  plays  a  positive  role  and  is  associated  with  value  creation  but  excesses  do  occur.  Some policy  measures  are  suggested.  The  chapter  is  based  on  an  extensive  study  recently  conducted  by  the authors for the Dutch Ministry of Finance into the role of private equity specifically in the Netherlands.1   As Amsterdam Center for Corporate Finance we hope that you enjoy reading this contribution to  the  Topics  in  Corporate  Finance  series  and  that  it  may  help  foster  a  healthy  public  debate  on  these important issues.

Boot  1.1  INTRODUCTION The financial services industry is undergoing massive changes. Information technology is key in this process of change. The recent focus on fintech     basically new technologyoriented players entering the financial services industry     is possibly the most visible manifestation of the impact that information technology has on the industry. This chapter will focus on the structure of the banking industry going forward. We will try to draw lessons from the (older) literature on scale and scope economies in banking and relate these insights to the    modern    world of information technology and fintech. Fintech is widely seen as a disruptive force in the banking industry. New information technologyfocused entrants including large data and platformoriented IT firms like Google and Apple are seen as a potential threat to the position of banks. While banks appear still in the lead information technology and fintech are changing the competitive landscape. Empowering customers is one of the effects. Customers have  easier  access  to  multiple  providers  and  potentially  more  transparent  product  offerings.  The traditional  bankcustomer  relationship  is  at  risk. The  digitalization  of  the  industry is  also  changing  the operational processes of banks. A massive transformation of banks is on the way. While  the  impact  of  information  technology  on  the  operations  of  banks  and  the  customer interface  is  a  relatively  recent  phenomenon  information  technology  has  been  changing  the  word  of finance  already  for  some  time.  The  impact  of  the proliferation of  information  technology  on  financial markets  has  perhaps  been  most  noticeable.  It  has  deepened  financial  markets  and  via  changes  in  the business models of banks strengthened the link between markets and financial institutions.2 The latter runs  for  example  via  securitization  and  other  forms  of  asset  sales  that  remove  assets  from  a  bank   s balance sheet allowing those assets to become tradeable. This intertwines markets and institutions and     as we have seen in the financial crisis     could amplify the impact of financial market conditions on banks (see Shin 2009).  Apart from providing all kinds of benefits (e.g. diversification liquidity) a more negative view is that  the  enhanced  opportunities  to  trade  assets  invite     excessive  changeability     and  possibly  more opportunistic behavior in banks that could undermine their stability. The linkages to the financial market facilitate a proliferation of transactionoriented banking (trading and financial market) activities possibly at the expense of more traditional relationship banking activities (Boot and Ratnovski 2016). Before delving into fintech developments we will discuss the implications of this more    fluid    and transactionoriented world of finance (see section 1.2.).                                                              2 See the contribution of Boot and Thakor (2018) in the Oxford Handbook of Banking 3rd edition forthcoming 2018. 1  In  this  context  also  the  ownership  structure  of  banks  might  be  important.  For  example  the traditional partnership model in investment banking may have contained opportunistic behavior in that partners had their personal wealth tied up in the business and could not easily leave and liquefy their ownership claims. In a sense the marketability of their own involvement (human capital) was severely constrained  which  may  have  countered  the  fluidity  of  banking  activities  itself.  Also  here  information technology and the deepening of financial markets may have been instrumental in creating a more fluid ownership structure based on a stock market listing. We  will  discuss  these  developments  and  subsequently  address  the  more  recent  fintech phenomenon or     what The Economist has called     the fintech revolution.3 In trying to assess the potential impact of fintech on the structure of banks we will seek to draw insights from the extensive literature on scale and scope economies in banking. We will argue that only limited insights are available. While recent empirical  work  identifies  some  scale  economies  it  faces  difficulties  in  identifying  true  scope  advantages. What is particularly missing in the literature is the impact that information technology may have on the industry. Information technology and fintech considerations have not been part of this literature. The  organization  of  this  chapter  is  as  follows.  In  section  1.2  we  focus  on  the  impact  of information technology and the deepening of financial markets on the transaction versus relationshiporientation  of  banks.  Section  1.3  discusses  ownership  structure  issues.  Scale  and  scope  economies  are discussed  in  Section  1.4.  Section  1.5  focuses  on  the  impact  of  fintech  on  the  banking  industry.  In particular we focus there on how fintech might disaggregate the value chain (and may put the customer interface at risk for banks) and to what extent banks will hookup to fin tech players and/or become fintech players themselves. Concluding observations are made in Section 1.6.  1.2  An arguably not much contested observation is that banks have become more transaction oriented. As The Economist put it over twenty years ago in the context of the experience of securities firms    Perhaps the worst feature of the 1980s     which has subsequently returned to haunt the securities firms     was the abandonment by most of them of the old relationships with their customers. [...]    The aim was to do a deal any deal    remembers one manager who prefers not to be named    (The Economist April 15 1995 Special Section A Survey of Wall Street p. 13). INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY AND TRANSACTION ORIENTATION4 While  this  quote  was  made  over  twenty  years  ago  it  is  interesting  to  note  that  when  financial markets prosper they appear to push financial institutions away from their relationship banking franchise. As  the  consultancy  BCG  puts  it  (explaining  the  surge  in  transaction  oriented  activities  in  20042007)    [   ] Amid surging economies low loan losses and readily available cheap capital it did not really matter                                                            3    The Fintech Revolution    The Economist May 9th 2015. 4 This section follows in part Boot (2011); see also Boot and Ratnovski (2016). 2  whether  a  bank  had  top  or  bottomquartile  capabilities  [   ].  All  that  mattered  were  workable  sales processes    (BCG 2010).  The  modern  world  of  information  technology  and  deepening  of  financial  markets  has  clearly induced banks to become more heavily exposed to the financial markets. Doing transactions has become easier  and  hence  marketlinked  activities  like  securitization  and  proprietary  trading  have  become  more prominent.  At  a  more  fundamental  level  what  this  points  at  is  the  scalability  of  transactionoriented activities.  Subject  to  available  capital  banks  can  quickly  increase  their  exposure  to  those  activities. Relationshipbased  activities  are  more  constrained  as  they  depend  on  employing  human  capital  and engaging  with  potential  clients.  Thus  transactionoriented  banking  is  not  only  more  susceptible  to  a sudden spur in momentum but also the feasibility of financial institutions to quickly mobilize resources and give in to such opportunities seems greater than for relationship banking activities. The competitive dynamics play an important role. When financial markets are exuberant banks that  abstain  from  for  example  trading  activities       one  of  the  financial  market  activities  that  can  be expanded quickly     may look less profitable and might feel    left behind    in the earnings game vis  vis other banks. This is precisely what happened with UBS one of the bigger victims in the 20072009 crisis. An internal investigation in 2008     following massive losses on subprime investments     discovered that its troublesome subprime investments were undertaken following pressure from external consultants that pointed at its fixed income activities that were lagging those of competitors. To fill this gap UBS was advised     to  close  key  product  gaps     which  explicitly  referred  to  subprime  investment  vehicles  (UBS 2008 page 11).   A more subtle concern is that opportunistic trading may undermine relationship banking. Boot and Ratnovski (2016) show that banks may allocate too much capital to transactionoriented activities and in doing so have insufficient riskbearing capacity for relationship banking. Banks may also underestimate the risks  involved  and  implicitly  subsidize  the  transactionoriented  activities  at  the  expense  of  relationshiporiented  activities.  More  specifically  by  insufficiently  recognizing  its  divergent  risk  profile  proprietary trading might be granted an artificially low cost of capital. Other     mainly relationshiporiented activities     are  then  implicitly  taxed  and  appear  less  profitable  than  they  really  are.  Thus  proprietary  trading  could undermine a bank   s competitive edge in its relationship banking business.  A related mechanism is that such transactionoriented activities initially appear very profitable (as long as the boom lasts) and that during that time those departments     and the individuals involved in them     will gain power. What this might do is that power shifts from people engaged in more prudent relationship  banking  activities  to  those  engaged  in  transaction  activities.  This  may  affect  the  overall balance of power in an institution via promotions in the corporate hierarchy and may tilt power away from its relationship banking franchise. As a consequence relationship banking may suffer.5                                                            5  These     power    considerations  deserve  more  attention  in  research. Much  of  the focus  has  been  on  remuneration  contracts  while  incentives running via promotion opportunities and power might arguably be as important or even more important. A direct link could also exist with the pricing  of  risk  in  financial  markets.  If  risks  in     booming     times  are  underpriced  (or  underestimated)  this  would  further  push  banks  in  such euphoric times toward transactions like trading activities (Boot 2014). 3  The  extensive  work  in  the  field  of  financial  intermediation  points  at  the  distinct  value  of relationship banking. Importantly however much of this research predates developments in information technology that have facilitated    more distant    banking operations. While we continue to believe in the importance of relationship banking information technology     particularly the way information can be obtained from data analysis (Big Data) and for example the proliferation of interactions via social media      will  have  an  impact  on  how  relationship  banking  can  add  value.  In  particular payment  systems  and distribution channels are changing rapidly and this will affect the business of banking and the competitive positioning of banks as distinct financial institutions. We will come back to this when we discuss fintech and particularly the disaggregation of the value chain that it may entail.   OWNERSHIP STRUCTURE PARTNERSHIPS AND STABILITY 1.3  As  stated  the  deepening  of  financial  markets  and  information  technology  in  general  may  have  caused excessive    changeability    and tradability in the industry. We pointed at the opportunistic behavior that this may unleash. An important link can be made to the ownership structure and stability of investment banks versus commercial (relationshiporiented) banks.  Traditional relationshiporiented banks seem incentivized to build up institutional franchise value. Individuals are part of the organization as an entity and the continuity of the organization and lasting relationships  with  its  clientele  define  its  value.  The  value  cannot  be  transferred  and  cannot  readily  be assigned  to  individual  stars.  In  other  words  the  value  created  is  an  integral  part  of  the  organizational entity (i.e.    franchise value   ) and not portable as part of individuals. Investment banks on the other hand particularly their trading and transaction activities6 seem more based on the individual star concept with high marketability of individuals. As a consequence less institutional franchise value is built up; individual franchise values dominate. If this is the only difference (relationship  banking with franchise  value  investment banking  less  so)  Keeley   s  (1990)  analysis  would suggest that an investment bank would take lots of risk while the franchise value of a commercial bank would help curtail its risk taking. Historically  investment  banks  could  contain  the     marketability     issue  and  the  potential  problems associated with the potential lack of institutional franchise value by having partnerships. The partnership structure  has  two  dimensions  that  could  help  jointly  resolve  the  marketability  problem  and  related opportunistic risky behavior (and star phenomenon)   a partnership means that bankers have their personal wealth tied up in the business. They own the equity claim of the business; the partnership structure is such that the equity is not (optimally) marketable.                                                            6 Activities of investment banks have relationshipbased components as well. More recently though trading dominates which is not relationship based  but  solely  transactional.  In  recent  times  traders  appear  to  have  gained  power  within  investment  banks  e.g.  more  recent  leaders  of Goldman Sachs came from the trading side. In any case we do not see the distinction between commercial banking and investment banking as an absolute dichotomy.  4   The  latter  implies  that     stars     cannot  take  their  money  out  or  only  at  a  reduced  value.  Implicitly  this means  that  nonportable  franchise  value  is  created  and  this  value  is  transferred  over  time  to  future partners. As an additional argument partnerships ensured a relatively high capitalization which directly augmented the franchise value at risk. Interesting examples exist where institutions have made changes that have destroyed this structure. For example with a gopublic transformation (converting a partnership in  a  listed  shareholder  owned  company)  the  current  partners  effectively  expropriate  all  franchise  value that  has  been  built  up  over  time.7  Even  worse  once  the  partnership  is  gone  stars  may  no  longer  be    under control.    Their financial interest is no longer tied to the firm. This may elevate risk and reduce stability.8 In commercial banking the enhanced marketability     and with it transaction focus     may have opened the door for some type of star phenomenon as well. In a sense it may have brought commercial banking  closer  to  investment  banking  and  similar  issues  might  be  at  play.  This  may  have  induced opportunistic behavior particularly because partnership structures in commercial banking never have been very common.  In  any  case  partnerships  among  major  financial  institutions  are  rare.  The  important  point however is that via enhancing marketability the demise of partnerships could have undermined stability. As  a  caveat  all  this  does  not  mean  that  there  might  not  be  distinct  benefits  associated  with  these developments  as  well.  What  we  have  stressed  is  the  potential  downside.  We  are  however  prepared  to conclude that the financial crisis has made us look more favorably at alternative ownership structures like mutuals  cooperative  banks  (e.g.  Credit  Agricole  in  France)  and  indeed  partnerships.  Also  having diversity in ownership structures might have become more appreciated. After all one of the problems of the increasing intertwined nature of banks and markets is that it might make banks look more alike and that could induce systemic risk. Diversity in ownership structures might help counter this. A question is also  what  impact  fintech  will  have  on  ownership  structures  and  on  the  structure  of  the  industry  in general.  Following  a  discussion  of  the  literature  on  scale  and  scope  economies  we  will  turn  to  these questions.                                                                   7 Morrison and Wilhelm (2007; 2008) analyze the decision of major US investment banks to go public. Investment banks were initially organized as partnerships. The opacity of partnerships and illiquidity of their shares allowed for successful mentoring and training in tacit noncontractible human  skills  such  as  building  relationships  negotiating  M&A  deals  and  advising  clients.  They  argue  that  IT  technology  necessitated  heavy investments and that that necessitated investment banks to go public. Potentially confirming this is that wholesaleoriented investment banks such  as  Morgan  Stanley       for  which  tacit  human  capital  was  more  important  than  IT  technology       went  public  later  than  retailoriented investment banks such as Merrill Lynch. Schellhorn (2011) emphasizes the (unlimited) liability of partners as stabilizing factor and recommends a private partnership form for investment banks. See also Berger et al. (2008). 8 Publicly listed firms sometimes use restricted stock to create some fixity in the ownership structure and to ensure continued loyalty of key personnel.  5  SCALE AND SCOPE ECONOMIES IN BANKING 1.4  What drives financial players in choosing their scale and scope of operations? This question is important because  the  size  and  particularly  the  complexity  of  financial  institutions  is  a  concern  to  regulators  and supervisors. More recently the question is what impact fintech and information technology will have on bank business models and the scale and scope of banks. Research on scale and scope economies remains rather inconclusive; in the words of Richardson Smith and Walter (2010)    Indeed the recent studies mirror the findings [   ] some 15 years earlier [   ] there was no predominance of evidence either for or against economies of scale in the financial sector.    Nevertheless the literature on scale and scope has come to some insights. In this section we will discuss the extant literature. Subsequently we will seek to use these insights when discussing fintech developments.  1.4.1 A casual observation of real world banking suggests that banks like to combine many different activities. This distinguishes banks from many of their competitors e.g. nonbanking financial institutions like mutual funds and  finance  companies.  The  latter  often  choose  to  specialize  and  therefore  are  often  more  transparent. Banks generally choose to diversify their activities. Although few would readily deny that some degree of diversification is necessary banks seem to engage in a very broad variety of activities. Sources of Scale and Scope Economies Particularly  in  Continental  Europe  the  size  (and  scope)  of  banks  is  typically  enormous.  One explanation could be that implicit or explicit government guarantees and toobigtofail (TBTF) concerns give  artificial  competitive  advantages  to  size  (see  Feldman  2010).  Universal  banks  while  often  not particularly efficient might in that way have sufficient    protected    revenues to compete with more focused players.9 Scale  and  scope  economies  are  often  cited  as  rationale  for  why  financial  institutions  tend  to growth  in  size  and  complexity  (scope)  over  time.  But  are  scale  and  scope  economies  truly  present? Sources  of  scale  and  scope  economies  include  (see  Boot  2003;  and  Walter  2003)  i.  informationtechnology  related  economies;  ii.  reputation  and  marketing/brand  name  related  benefits;  iii.  (financial) innovation related economies; and iv. diversification benefits. Information technology related economies particularly  refer  to  back  office  efficiencies  and  distributionnetwork  related  benefits.  Transaction processing  offers  distinct  scale  economies.  And  information  technology  developments  facilitate  an increasing array of financial products and services to be offered through the same distribution network and thus allow for cross selling. Reputation and brand name/marketing related economies may be present in the joint marketing of products to customers. Brand image is partially marketing related but is also                                                            9 Indeed this is one of the complaints of more focused investment banking institutions. Universal banks can leverage their balance sheet (read cross subsidize) to secure investment banking business (e.g. Financial Times March 21 2011 page 17    US banks face fresh scrutiny on lending   ). Some evidence exist on TBTF benefits. Jagtiani and Brewer (2013) find that investors are willing to pay a premium when an acquisition would create a bank with assets over $100 billion. Rime (2005) finds that banks above some threshold tend to have higher credit ratings and Baker and McArthur (2009) show that banks that have more than $100 billion in assets have lower costs of capital. Beccalli Anolli and Borello (2015) show that scale economies are larger for banks that are designated as systemically relevant by the European Commission. 6  related to the notions of    trust    and    reputation.    (Financial) innovation related economies point at benefits that large(r) institutions may have in exploiting innovations; specifically they might be in a better position to recoup the fixed costs of those innovations.  Diversification benefits are (at first sight) more controversial. In many cases conglomeration may lead to a valuation discount which could point at (anticipated) inefficiencies. This is in line with corporate finance theory that tells us that investors can choose to diversify and that this does not need to be done at the firm level. However key to the business of banking is risk processing and absorption. And confidence in  a  bank requires  it to  be safe.  Diversification  is  then  needed  to be  able  to  absorb  risks  and be  safe. Observe  also  that  several  bank  activities  benefit  from  a  better  credit  rating  which  suggests  that diversification at the level of the bank has value.10  1.4.2  Evidence on Scale and Scope Economies Scale  and  scope  economies  in  banking  have  been  studied  extensively.  In  a  18  year  old  survey  paper Berger  Demsetz  and  Strahan  (1999)  conclude  that  in  general  the  empirical  evidence  cannot  readily identify substantial economies of scale or scope. Illustrative is also Saunders (2000). He cites 27 studies 13 of which found diseconomies of scope 6 found economies of scope and 8 were neutral.  An important caveat is that this research mainly involves U.S. studies using data from the 70s and 80s.  Apart  from  also  potential  methodological  shortcomings  the  results  therefore  do  not  capture  the dramatic structural and technological changes in banking that have taken place since then. Furthermore they reflect the historic fragmentation of the U.S. banking industry due to severe regulatory constraints on the type of banking (banks could engage in commercial banking or investment banking but not both) and the geographic reach of activities (limits on interstate banking) that were present till the deregulation in the 90s (see Calomiris and Karceski 1998).  Subsequent studies examine the existence of a diversification discount for financial institutions. Laeven  and  Levine  (2007)  confirm  the  existence  of  a  diversification  discount  in  banks  that  combine lending and nonlending financial services and suggest that the potential economies of scope in financial conglomerates  are  not  large  enough  to  compensate  for  potential  agency  problems  and  inefficiencies associated with crosssubsidies.11 Rajan Servaes and Zingales (2000) nuance this picture. They emphasize that even though conglomerates trade at a discount on average 39.3% of the conglomerates trade at a premium.  They  show  that  the  interrelation  between  activities  within  the  conglomerate  is  of  crucial importance.  Diversified  firms  can  trade  at  a  premium  if  the  dispersion  between activities  is  low.  High dispersion  induces  inefficiencies  which  point  at  the  importance  of  focus  within  the  conglomerate.  In                                                            10 For many guarantees or contracts and activities that involve recourse the credit standing of the guarantor is crucial for the credibility of the contract. Mester (2008) emphasizes that bank production decisions affect bank risk. Scale and scope related decisions have via diversification an effect on risk and that in turn may affect choices about risk exposure. Goetz Laeven and Levine (2016) show the existence of diversification of risk benefits in domestic geographic expansion of U.S. bank holding companies. 11 Schmid and Walter (2009) confirm the Laeven and Levine (2007) results and confirm that this discount is indeed caused by diversification and not  by  inefficiencies  that  already  existed  prior  to  the diversification  (e.g.  prior  to  an  initial  diversifying  merger). Chevalier  (2004)  shows  that controlling for the preconglomeration performance of businesses is important inefficiencies measured after a merger often already existed prior to the merger. 7  particular  one  should  look at  what  type  of  mergers  and  acquisitions  involve  scale  and  scope  benefits. Research  suggests  that  mergers  with  both  a  geographic  and  activity  focus  are  most  value  enhancing. Similarly in analyzing scope and scale issues one should focus on the type of activities. What are the scale economies in each activity? And what productmix offers true scope economies? DeLong (2001) looked at the shareholder gains     more specifically the immediate announcement effect  on share prices      from  focused  versus  diversifying  bank  mergers  in  the  U.S.  between  1988  and 1995.  She  found  that  focused  mergers  both  on  the  level  of  activity  and  geography  have  positive announcement effects. Moreover focus in activities was shown to be more important than geographical focus albeit the latter was important as well. Activitydiversifying mergers had no positive announcement effects. These results point at the presence of scale rather than scope economies.  The typical result in these earlier studies was however that even scale economies are exhausted at relatively small bank sizes. Later evidence points at more persistent scale economies. Wheelock and Wilson  (2009)  and  Feng  and  Serletis  (2010)  find  increasing  returns  to  scale  and  Elsas  Hackethal  and Holzh  user (2010) find increasing returns to scope also for larger financial institutions. Substantial scale economies are found when it comes to backoffice activities and payments.12 Apart from methodological issues (see Mester 2010) this could be driven by informationtechnology developments that might only have showed up in more recent data. In this spirit researchers have looked at whether there are scale economies in investments in IT as suggested by Boot (2003) and Walter (2003). The evidence is somewhat mixed. Erber and Madlener (2009) find no significant relationship between IT capital investments and bank productivity at the country level. Beccalli (2007) even finds a negative relationship between bank efficiency and investment in hardware and software but a positive relationship between bank efficiency and countrylevel bank spending on IT consulting services. Koetter and Noth (2013) find that merely increasing IT investment does not lead to higher profitability but that the efficiency in employing IT matters.  The impact of IT on bank business models has so far not really been empirically investigated. One  could  envision  that  on  the  demand  side  the  proliferation  of  savings  products  and  their  link  to pensions mutual funds and life insurance clearly pushes for joint distribution and suggests economies of scope  in  distribution.  IT  developments  might  have  made  it  possible  to  better  exploit  potential  scope economies with multiple product offerings to a particular customer group using new direct distribution channels with relatively easy access to (formerly) distant customers.  All  this  might  also  invite  new  competition  as  physical  presence  in  local  markets  might  have become  less  important  as  various  data  sources  become  available  (e.g.  Big  Data  and  data  analytics  as alternative to    standard    relationship banking data collection). As a consequence (as we will see next) the value chain may break up. Some players may for example specialize in distribution others in back office                                                            12 See Hughes and Mester (2015) Davies and Tracey (2012) and DeYoung (2010). 8  THE IMPACT OF FINTECH ON THE BANKING INDUSTRY services or product development. Various scale and scope economies could then possibly be attained in a more targeted way. The term    fintech    is associated with this development.  1.5  A key manifestation is that fintech might lead to the disaggregation of the value chain. Interfaces     online platforms in particular     may come about that help bundle the product offerings of different providers thereby becoming the direct point of contact for customers. The distribution related economies that we alluded to may actually lead to such disaggregation of the value chain.  1.5.1  Online Platforms and Disaggregation13 Online platforms could be disruptive to existing financial institutions. Particularly a disaggregation of the value  chain  could  follow  from  online  platforms  becoming  the  preferred  customer  interface.  Online platforms  could  offer  a supermarket  type  model  facilitating  access to  various  products  and  services  of disparate providers along with record keeping. A financial services platform might act as a market place where people interact directly and financial institutions serve the limited role of an advisor or broker. P2P lending  could  have  parties  transacting  directly  without  the  benefit  of  a  financial  intermediary  (except possibly for back office services). Technology firms such as Google Facebook Amazon or Apple may use a payments solution (such as Apple Pay) as a platform and gain direct customer interface for related products and services. Legacy financial institutions then might be relegated to serving as the back office to the platform. There is no reason why a platform should be limited to offering only financial services. A lifestyle oriented focus could integrate financial and nonfinancial offerings.14 The disruptive forces affecting banking     information technology and fintech in particular     may also offer new opportunities for other businesses that have tried to enter banking. For example Tesco a large UK supermarket chain provides banking services to its customers under its own brand.  New specialized lenders have arisen that seek to replace relationship lenders and traditional credit scoring with sophisticated algorithms based on Big Data mining (data analytics). While still in its infancy such  analysis  predicts  creditworthiness  by  analyzing  buying  habits  memberships  reading  proclivities lifestyle choices and all manner of opportunistic demographic correlates. Similarly the growing availability of information  allows  for  public  certification  of  creditworthiness  similar  to  the trustworthiness  scores  on  eBay  or  the  client  satisfaction  scores  on  TripAdvisor.  One  could  envision similar  developments  enabling  P2P  lending  as  well.  Whether  society  will  accept  the  widespread  use  of these data is a different matter. In any event more and more potentially sensitive personal information inexpensive                                                            13 The observations follow in part Greenbaum et al. (2016). 14 McKinsey (2017) talks about    a seamless customer experience    with banking and thirdparty services and refers to the Tencent   s Wechat platform that includes mobility travel and dining services. 9  can already be obtained with a few mouse clicks. Big Data may also facilitate crowdfunding another form of direct lending involving multiple lenders and a singular borrower.  At the customer level we might see a (re)emergence of more community oriented arrangements. As  P2P  lending  and  crowdfunding  suggest  customers  may  take  matters  in  their  own  hands; empowerment thus. Local arrangements may emerge where communities organize their financial affairs directly among themselves. Information technology therefore may not only invite an increase in scale but might  also  facilitate  more  tailormade  local  arrangements.  The  latter  would  fit  the  empowerment  that customers  may  increasingly  desire.  This  point  is  more  general.  Many  of  the  recent  fintech  related developments may put customers in the driving seat. For example the platforms would give them easier access to a variety of providers.15 The consultancy McKinsey talks about platforms creating    a customercentric unified value proposition that goes beyond what users could previously obtain [   ]    and is    often more  central  in  the  customer  journeys  [   ]     (McKinsey  2017).  This  points  at  empowerment  by customers and simultaneously could cast doubts on whether banks will be able to continue to control the customer interface.  1.5.2  Reach of Fintech in Payments An area which seems most open to fintech is payments and particularly retailrelated payments. This core area  of  banking  is  being  coveted  by  technology  firms  and  payment  specialists  like  Google  Apple  and PayPal. Thus far banks have maintained their central role in payments. Also the payments innovators are not typically independent of banks but have developed in joint ventures or other types of alliances with traditional  banks.  In  some  countries  banks  themselves  have  managed  to  offer  the  leading  online payments solution.16 While retail payments were the initial point of entry of fintech players getting into payment solutions for corporates might be a next step. Regulatory  developments  like  PSD2  in  the  EU  may  further  elevate  competition  in  this  area. PSD2 forces banks to share payment information with others on the request of their customers. This is designed to encourage competition in the payment sphere. In this context also the blockchain technology should be mentioned. This decentralized system of record keeping and transactions promises to have an impact on the banking industry. It might undermine the  centricity  of  banks  in  the  financial  system.  Cryptocurrencies  like  Bitcoin  that  use  the  blockchain technology could offer an alternative payment infrastructure that bypasses the banking system. However these  developments  are  still  at  their  infancy  and  highly  unpredictable.17  Also  banks  may  choose  to                                                            15 See also a report on fintech by the consultancy Accenture (Accenture 2014 page 10). 16 Wyman (2014) and BIS (2014). 17 The World Economic Forum rightfully states    DLT (distributed ledger technology     blockchain AB) is not a panacea; instead it should be viewed as one of many technologies that will form the foundation of next generation financial services infrastructure    (WEF 2016). I will not speculate on its most wellknown application cryptocurrencies. Digital currencies might play an important role in the future. Whether private ones (like bitcoin see Nakamoto 2008) become important is unknown. One could also envision central bank issued digital currencies gaining the upper hand (Bank of England 2014). 10  Banks and Fintech embrace these developments and be part of it. The response of banks and the more general threat (or opportunity) of fintech for the banking industry we will discuss next.  1.5.3 What role will banks play in these developments? They may face challenges. As Hirt and Milmott (2014) put it    Digitization often lowers entry barriers causing longestablished boundaries between sectors to tumble. At the same time the    plug and play    nature of digital assets causes value chains to disaggregate creating openings for focused fastmoving competitors. New market entrants often scale up rapidly at lower cost than legacy players can and returns may grow rapidly as more customers join the network.    In particular banks lose some of their competitive advantages in overcoming information problems may no longer  enjoy  privileged  access  to  a  stable  customer  base  and  feel  an  erosion  in  their  access  to  cheap deposits (Vives 2017).   Banks Doomed? This  does  not  mean  that  banks  are  doomed.  In  the  past  banking  institutions  have  shown  remarkable resilience despite questions about their viability. As far back as 1994 economists John Boyd and Mark Gertler commented on the predicted demise of banks in a wellknown study titled    Are Banks Dead? Or Are  the  Reports  Greatly  Exaggerated?   .18  At  that  point  the  discussion  was  about  the  banks     role  in lending.  In  particular  the  question  was  whether  securitization  would  undermine  the  banks     lending franchise.  They  concluded  that  while  securitization  would  make  banks  less  important  for  the  actual funding of loans the core functions of banks in the lending process     origination (including screening) servicing  and  monitoring       would  be  preserved  as  would  the  centrality  of  banks.  Also  banks  would typically play a role in the securitization vehicles by providing backup lines of credit and guarantees on the refinancing of the commercial paper that funds many of the vehicles.  The message of that article undoubtedly has relevance today. Banks will respond and try to be players in the fintech world themselves. They may also set up platforms and in this way hold on to the customer  interface.  Moreover  fintech  often  is  facilitating  and  thus  a  way  to  improve  operations  and existing processes within banks. Big Data and data analytics could for example help improve the lending processes of banks.  Banks and P2P Banks  also  play  a  role  in  P2P  lending.  P2P  is  not  (just)  an  innovation  that  develops  independently  of banks and/or without involvement of banks. Like in securitization banks may serve essential functions in that lending process like compliance screening and funding. Banks together with institutional investors                                                            18 Boyd and Gertler (1994) and Samolyk (2004). 11  are important providers of funding to P2P platforms.19 A bank may also have setup the platform. All this points at complementarities between banks and fintech players.  Another issue is to what extent the market served by P2P overlaps with that of banks. So far P2P typically  targets consumer lending. In some countries (contrary to the U.S.) banks are not key players in this  market  and  hence  competitive  effects  would  be  limited.  For  the  U.S.  Demyanyk  Loutskina  and Kolliner  (2017)  find  that  P2P  primarily  serves  a  predatorytype  segment  causing  excess  borrowing  by often  vulnerable  consumers.  Given  that  this  segment  is  not  a  primary  banking  segment  the  overlap would be limited.20 Buchak et al. (2017) point at competitive effects in the U.S. residential lending market. They show that shadow banks (including fintech) grow strongly in the more risky yet guaranteed segment (via government sponsored enterprises     GSE) where banks retreat for regulatory compliance reasons. The prospects for P2P in corporate lending are more difficult to assess. Banking skills might be indispensable for example those needed to deal with controlling risk (moral hazard) and distressed assets. Again this could point at a role of banks on P2P platforms. More risky informationsensitive corporate loans do not seem a good fit for brokeroriented P2P platform (Dermine 2017).   Partner or Perish? Increasingly  partnering  is  seen  as  crucial  for  banks.  In  a  recent  study  the  World  Economic  Forum concludes that    all financial institutions will need to find ways to partner with large techs without losing their  core  value  proposition     (WEF  2017).  Agility  and  flexibility  in  setting  up  and  finding  value enhancing  partnerships  are  seen  as  distinct  skills.21  In  doing  so  banks  may  face  dilemmas.  When  is partnering with fintech optimal and when is it not desirable? Such dilemma could play for example in partnering with Apple or Google in payments. Will banks continue to be important for such partnership or only in the beginning and redundant subsequently? Banks however have some competitive advantages. Banks benefit from the anxiety of people about the safety of their liquid wealth. The financial crisis of 20072009 may have created anxiety about the stability of banks but banks are still seen as the place where money is safe.22 Whatever the popularity of  Apple  will  people  trust  technology  companies  in  safeguarding  their  money?  Being  a  bank  with  a license  and  an  implicit  guarantee  from  the  government  has  value.  Banks  may  also  have  valuable compliance expertise and having extensive customer data is a distinct competitive advantage as well.                                                             19 While peertopeer suggests lending by individuals to individuals this is often not the case. As stated banks and institutional investors are important providers of funds. 20 In analyzing Lending Club (a wellknown U.S. P2P platform) Jagtiani and Lemieux (2017) find that relatively high risk consumers are being served (compared to those by banks). They also see some    inclusion    benefits by pointing to P2Ps role in providing credit to areas that could benefit  from  additional  credit  supply.  The  latter  contrasts  with  Demyanyk Loutskina  and  Kolliner  (2017)  who  do  not  find  that  P2P  covers markets underserved by traditional banks hence they are skeptical about P2P improving financial inclusion. 21 For a strong stand on partnering with the motto    Partner or perish    see a report by the consultancy EY (EY 2017). It also argues that the major risk for a bank does not come from fintech players but from banks that are better at partnering. See also McKinsey (2017) and WEF (2015) for  similar  points  of  view.  The  Economist  notes  that  banks  and  fintech  become  increasingly  collaborative  (The  Economist  Special  Report International  Banking  May  6th  2017  page  12)  a  point  echoed  as  well  by  the  World  Economic  Forum     Many  fintechs  [   ]  have  shifted to building partnerships as they struggle with scale and customer adoption    (WEF 2017). 22 Vatanasombut et al. (2008) highlight that trust plays a key role in the retention of customers with online banking. They also find that perceived security reinforces trust. 12  These comments also point at potential artificial (and undesirable) competitive advantages that banks  have.  Particularly  as  alluded  to  above  the  implicit  guarantee  that  banks  have  from  their governments  may  give  them  an  edge  over  new  entrants  including  possibly  fintech  players.  Indeed safeguarding fair opportunities for new players is a challenge when strong and highly politically connected incumbents are present.23  It is fair to say that the future of the industry and its structure in particular are highly uncertain. Developments in technology have inherently a level of unpredictability. The financial services industry is in the middle of it. Some banks may play a leading role in the new universe perhaps by becoming fintechs themselves and providers of leading platforms. What seems clear is that banks will need to become agile and  flexible  to  deal  with  the  challenges  and  uncertainties  ahead.  Nevertheless  there  are  reasons  to envision a potential decline. New competitors and the disaggregation of the value chain will put pressure on existing players.24  1.6  Information  technology  plays  a  leading  role  in  the  transformation  of  banking.  Developments  in information  technology  and  the  related  deepening  of  financial  markets  have  pushed  banks  to  more transactionoriented  activities  including  trading  at  the  expense  of  relationship  banking.  Banking  has become more fluid and possibly opportunistic as a result. Financial markets also facilitated investment banks in moving away from the more stable partnership model to a more fluid shareholder owned public listing. These changes have put pressure on banks and regulators (stability concerns!) alike. CONCLUSIONS The latest incarnation of information technology has led to a    fintech revolution    where banks face new competitors with different     more specialized     business models forcing a disaggregation of the value  chain.  With  technologydriven  solutions  they  offer  alternatives  to  key  banking  services  including payments  and  lending.  An  important  question  is  to  what  extent  existing  financial  institutions  can  be leading. Can they be at the forefront of new developments for example by absorbing fintech players and their innovations? Will banks and fintech be complementary and collaborative? Or will banks fade away with  new  technologylinked  players  assuming  prominence  in  the  financial  sector?  While  we  have commented on the resilience of banks only time will tell. Many questions few answers.                                                             23  As  Philippon  (2016)  puts  it     What  we  do  know  however  is  that  a  combination  of  restrictive  regulations  and  powerful  incumbents  can certainly prevent entry.    On the importance of political connections in banking see Calomiris and Haber (2014). Observe also that banks that embrace fintech developments may do this to neutralize innovations and protect their existing ways of operating. A potentially relevant historic example is Moody   s (the rating agency) acquisition of KMV in 2002. KMV had developed a novel approach for assessing credit risk that arguably Moody   s saw as a threat.. More recently some consortia of banks are setting up blockchain systems that are closed for others and thus possibly frustrate  the  open  architecture  that  blockchain  is  based  on.  An  example  is  ING   s  participation  in  a     blockchainbased  platform  for  energy commodities    which involves a limited number of participants; see ING press release November 6 2017    ING joins forces on blockchainbased platform [   ]   . To be fair ING states in the same press release that its intention is to open it up to others    The technology is intended to be made available to all market participants and service providers in the energy trading sector.    24 The Dutch Central Bank lists three possible configurations for the industry    i. banks manage to absorb the fintech revolution and manage to continue to be in the lead; ii. a more dispersed landscape comes about with new players in conjunction with (more traditional) banks and iii. new players take the lead possibly with high levels of concentration in the hands of the new giants e.g. Google Facebook etc.    (DNB 2017). See McKinsey (2017) for other insights on the potential different roles of banks going forward. 13  Also from a financial stability point of view the fintech revolution is challenging. The Bank of England  has  formulated  the  question  whether     [   ]  the  distress  or  failure  of  a  technologyenabled alternative finance provider have implications for financial stability?    (Bank of England 2015). We just do not know. The Dutch central bank has identified not just risks in the (new) fintech type operations and players but also stability risks coming from existing institutions that could lose out in the technology race (DNB 2016). But stability benefits are also alluded to. Fintech developments may increase diversity in the financial  sector.  Whether  this  will  benefit  or  weaken  the  resilience  of  the  system  time  will  tell.  For example  roboadvice  and  risk  management  algorithms  could  lead  to  more  uniformity  and  induce herding  and  thus  have  potentially  destabilizing  procyclical  effects.25  Again  many  questions  and  few answers. A challenging research agenda lies ahead of us.                                                             25 See Carney (2017) and DNB (2017) for further insights on the implications of fintech for financial stability. 14  REFERENCES  Accenture (2014).

Ligterink and Jens K. Martin  2.1  Private equity continues to be in the news. Proponents emphasize the positive effects it can have. They refer to the advantages of private equity as an alternative source of financing as vehicle that provides expertise and access to a network of industry experts as a governance model that leads to better company performance and to the added value of private equity as an asset class. Critics on the other hand argue that no value creation occurs rather the return for private equity investors is just a redistribution of value at the expense of other stakeholders such as employees creditors suppliers and tax authorities. They also point to the dangers of an excessive use of debt financing and the higher insolvency risks this is thought to entail. They claim that as a consequence costs are passed on to society for example through layoffs of employees following insolvency. Critics also point to the possibility of an excessive focus on the short term by private equity investors. Private  equity  is  riskbearing  capital  invested  by  private  equity  funds  into  what  is  ultimately  a nonlisted  company.  The  two  most  important  forms  are  buyouts  and  venture  capital.  A  buyout  is  a takeover  of  a  mature  company  in  which  the  private  equity  fund  generally  obtains  a  majority  stake  in exchange  for  injecting  equity  primarily  raised  from  institutional  investors.  The  equity  investment  goes hand in hand with substantial debt financing. The ownership model of private equity is temporary; an exit is usually planned after four to seven years. In the case of venture capital equity is invested into startups or emerging companies. The Nederlandse Vereniging van Participatiemaatschappijen (NVP) the Dutch trade association for private equity and venture capital firms reports that in 2015 348 Dutch companies attracted a total of 3.3 billion euros from private equity funds nearly 2 billion of which came from foreign private equity funds. Dutch private equity firms raised a record amount of 3.2 billion euros in 2015 for making new investments of which 268 million consisted of venture capital.2 NVP also reports that 1400 companies in  the  Netherlands  (employing  around  380000  people  in  total)  have  a  private  equity  investor  as  a shareholder. The focus of the study reported in this chapter is on buyouts (which are also central to the public debate). The research questions are                                                            1 We thank Ludovic Phalippou and Kees Cools for their contributions to the original study underlying this report (Ligterink et al. 2017). We also would like to thank Maureen Wouters and Janelle Zoutkamp for outstanding research assistance and Sidonie Rademaker and Lorena Zevedei for their editorial work. 2 Source NVP website http//www.nvp.nl/pagina/ondernemend%20vermogen/.  21    What are the advantages and disadvantages of this form of financing and ownership?   What is the importance of private equity in the Dutch economy during the period 20072015? Does private equity contribute to economic growth? If so how?   What is the effect of private equity on the companies in which it has invested? What is the added value  and  what  effects  does  private  equity  have  on  the  stakeholders  in  these  companies including  the  tax  authorities?  How  do  these  effects  differ  from  those  of  other  sources  of financing?   The study analyzes how private equity operates how it can create value and where excesses might occur. It also contains an empirical study into the effects of private equity in the Netherlands. The study builds upon previous research conducted by De Jong et al. (2007) and Boot and Cools (2007).  The structure of this chapter is as follows Section 2.2 describes how private equity works and how  a  return  is  made  on  the  companies  in  which  a  private  equity  fund  invests.  Section  2.3  provides insights into how private equity can create value not only for investors but also for society as a whole and discusses findings of international empirical studies. The impact of debt financing (leverage) on the return and compensation of private equity investors is discussed in section 2.4. The source of returns is not  necessarily  value  creation  but  could  also  be  associated  with  redistribution  of  value  from  other stakeholders  to  the  private  equity  investors.  This  is  the  subject  of  section  2.5.  Section  2.6  traces  the development  of  private  equity  and  buyouts  in  the  Netherlands  and  provides  the key  insights  from  an empirical study of the effects of private equity investments in the Dutch market.3 Section 2.7 concludes.  WHAT DOES PRIVATE EQUITY DO? 2.2  How does private equity work? A private equity firm creates an investment fund from which investments are made. The investment fund is    filled    with an injection of capital by the private equity firm itself acting as general partner.4 Meanwhile capital is also obtained from limited partners. These limited partners are institutional investors such as pension funds but may also be wealthy private investors. Under the general partner   s leadership the fund invests in multiple buyouts of companies. Besides capital from the general and limited partners a considerable amount of debt is used.  Financing with debt offers tax benefits as interest payments are partially deductible. Leverage also enhances  the  reward  for  accomplishing  improvements  in  the  business.  The  return  on  equity  becomes (even  more)  sensitive  to  the  target  company   s  performance.  As  an  illustration  financing  a  company valued at 100 with 90% debt implies an equity investment of 10. Increasing the company   s value by 5 then gives a 50% increase in the value of the equity claim; i.e. it increases from 10 to 15.                                                            3 All details about the study into the effects of private equity in the Netherlands can be found in Ligterink et al. (2017). 4 The general partner   s contribution to the fund   s capital is typically around 1%. 22  As such providers of private equity have strong incentives to actually improve the performance of  the  companies  in  which  they  invest.  Additionally  the  high  leverage  ensures  discipline  and  a  strong sense of urgency. The high debt load is after all also subject to default risk. In section 2.4 we examine the importance  of  leverage  in  greater  detail.  Heavy  use  is  also  made  of  performancelinked  compensation both  within  the  private  equity  investment  fund  and  within  the  target  company.  This  encourages engagement in the target company. How  does  a  private  equity  fund  generate  a  return  on  its  investment?  The  investment  fund   s return often comes from a combination of the following sources    Operational improvements implementation of measures that make the company more efficient (for example more efficient use of the means of production in the company selection of a better management team better management information systems improvements in logistical planning betterfocused R&D etc.);   Revised  strategic  focus  implementation  of  a  new/improved  strategy  including  better  use  of growth  opportunities  and  optimization  of  the  corporate  scope  (for  example  a  buyandbuild strategy5 disposal of noncore activities etc.);   Governance  structure  enhancements  aligning  the  financial interests  of  the  company   s management more closely with those of the shareholder (for example by making management a coshareholder)  increased  supervision  and  oversight  (via  stronger  incentives  and  more  direct access  to  information  for  the  shareholders  etc.)  changes  in  the  supervisory  board  (more expertise  more  direct  involvement  forging  relevant  networks)  stronger  incentives  through optimization of leverage (increasing pressure and incentives through more debt financing).   Financial  engineering  optimal  use  of  tax  benefits  (interest  expenses  may  be  partially  deducted from corporate tax). Because of its specific expertise and experience the private equity firm may better know how to organize the company   s capital structure in such a way that it can be financed with a relatively high amount of debt without facing a corresponding increase in insolvency risk. Investment selection and market timing if private equity investors are in a position to buy up undervalued  companies  and  then  subsequently  resell  them  they  can  generate  returns  for themselves. Arbitrage may result from a greater ability to predict developments on the market (market expertise) access to better information about the company and/or superior dealmaking capabilities (negotiation skills and better access to deals).   The most important conclusion from the points listed above is that a company   s business affairs intensify the moment private equity enters the picture. Whether this is actually the same as value creation     and if so for whom     is the main topic of the chapter ahead.                                                             5 With a buyandbuild strategy the private equity firm grows the target company through mergers and acquisitions. 23  PRIVATE EQUITY AND VALUE CREATION 2.3  Private equity is a temporary ownership and governance structure that creates a strong financial incentive for action. Its central focus is to achieve a return for the investors. Yet how are these returns created? And how does private equity impact the insolvency risk of companies in which it is invested? To start with we discuss the valuecreation potential of private equity as a governance model. What can it do that other  governance  structures  cannot?  Subsequently  we  take  a  closer  look  at  statistical  problems  in measuring  the  performance  of  private  equity.  Afterwards  we  turn  to  insights  from  the  international empirical literature on the performance of private equity including the effect on insolvency risk.   2.3.1  A Closer Look at the Potential for Value Creation Private equity addresses an important concern related to public equity how to discipline management. Private equity involves a small group of shareholders the general partner(s)     often young welleducated and active     with direct access to management and the latest information. This makes it easier to maintain a  steady  focus  and  strategy  with  optimal  coordination  between  management  and  shareholders.  Within listed companies the distance between management and shareholders is often greater and the dispersion of shareholdings can lead to socalled    freerider    problems. This refers to shareholders    looking to one another    which begs the question who is keeping watch over management? Each individual shareholder would be happy if someone else would put in the effort but if everyone assumes that someone else is doing it ultimately nobody will. The combination of maximal codetermination and minimal information asymmetry reduces the typical agency problems characteristic of public equity. Another feature of private equity is the very strong alignment  of  interests  of  shareholders  (i.e.  the  private  equity  fund)  and  management  through  a compensation contract with powerful financial incentives often including an obligation for management to buy shares in the company. Such an obligation ensures that management not only profits when things go  well  but  also  faces  consequences  when  things  go  badly.  Normally  management  cannot  sell  its investment  before  an  exit  takes  place.  This  illiquidity  eliminates  for  example  the  incentive  for management to manipulate shortterm results (see Kaplan and Str  mberg 2009 p. 131). The horizon is the moment of exit which lies a few years in the future. Private equity funds also have no qualms about replacing poorly performing management at an early stage (see Acharya et al. 2013). Another aspect of private equity which contributes to higher returns is a possibly more remote and  clinical  view  which  could  make  reorganizations  easier.  Furthermore  private  equity  can  help companies  achieve  a  change  in  strategic  focus  by  injecting  funds  expertise  and  access  to  an  external network.  Private  equity  funds  (i.e.  the  general  partners)  often  seek  the  advice  of  external  experts  with specialized knowledge on various aspects of the company   s activities.  24  This execution is often accompanied by a disposal of activities that are determined not to be part of the company   s core business as well as additional takeovers to strengthen the company   s actual core activities.  The  corporate  scope  (and  adjustments  made  to  it)  are  a  primary  focus  of  private  equity investors. The picture sketched above indicates that private equity has an added value and thus can have advantages as a form of ownership compared with other ownership structures. This should be expressed in an improved operational performance and stronger growth in the companies financed by private equity compared with similar companies that are not financed with private equity. Additionally this suggests that private equity investors can achieve higher riskadjusted returns compared for example to public equity.6  Box 1 Statistical Problems in Quantification What happens to the company after the buyout? What changes do occur? In empirical studies the greatest problem is that it remains unknown what would have happened to the company if it had not been bought out by private equity. In other words the  socalled  counterfactual  is  unknown.  To  approximate  this  counterfactual  researchers  look  for  the  most  relevant benchmark for comparison. Sometimes they choose to compare with the sector or with a collection of companies from the same sector  with  similar  characteristics  to  the  target  company.  This  can  already  lead  to  an  initial  problem  of  selection  bias; companies financed by private equity are not randomly chosen but may precisely be those with the greatest potential for improvement  opportunities  for  growth  etc.  Furthermore  the  company   s  management  and  shareholders  must  be  open  to private equity. That means there may also be a selection bias here. Companies that are open to private equity are possibly different even if adjustments are made for obvious differences. This makes it difficult to compare the two groups (companies financed by private equity versus those without private equity financing) or draw conclusions about the effects of private equity. Another problem in empirical research on the effects of private equity is that many of the necessary data are not (fully) available at least in public databases. This is especially the case for nonlisted companies taken over by private equity. The lack of data for private companies creates also a potential problem in choosing the correct sample of comparable firms. Publicly listed companies are often chosen for this because of the availability of data. But these are typically relatively large companies whereas private equity investments are usually smaller in size. Therefore it remains unclear whether the findings of these studies can be generalized to provide insights into the often smaller buyout companies.  2.3.2  Returns for Private Equity Investors (Limited Partners) Empirical studies show that historically speaking the net return for the limited partners of private equity funds is higher than that of a diversified stock portfolio (a valueweighted stock market index). This is true even after the deduction of costs and (considerable) fees. However the spread in returns is large                                                            6 Due to leverage private equity investors automatically achieve higher returns on average but this goes handinhand with greater risk. Higher riskadjusted returns that are not caused by undervaluation at the moment of investment should be an indicator of the company   s improved performance (unless these higher returns are caused by tax benefits associated with leverage). 25  and when adjusted for disadvantageous factors such as reduced liquidity and higher risk compared to the benchmark there appears to be essentially no outperformance for the limited partners.  The  general  partners  charge  substantial  fees.  Metrick  and  Yasuda  (2010)  estimate  based  on  a simulation that the present value of these fees is approximately 17% of the committed capital.  It  is  important  to  emphasize  that  the  higher  return  on  private  equity  is  based  on  an  average. There  is significant  variation  over  time  and  among  different funds.  Selecting  the right funds  and  fund managers appears to be very important. Not every institutional investor has equal access to private equity funds.  Particularly  large  institutional  investors  with  a  strong  reputation  will  be  invited  by  the  most successful  private  equity  firms  to  participate  in  their  funds.  On  top  of  that  these  larger  institutional investors may have the inhouse expertise to select the right funds and know how to keep costs in check. A smaller less professional pension fund will have greater difficulty achieving comparable high returns.  Yet  even  if  these  high  returns  are  actually  achieved  this  does  not  necessarily  mean outperformance.  It  can  be  a  compensation  for  extra  risk.  The  risk  profile  of  a  private  equity  fund  is different than that of a welldiversified stock portfolio. The fund often contains smaller companies with a relatively low market value compared to their book value and lowerliquidity investments are also typical. If adjustments are made for these extra risk factors various studies find that the higher return is largely eliminated  (i.e.  it  is  attributable  to  these  factors).  That  means  there  is  no  such  thing  as  a  significant outperformance for limited partners the extra return is a compensation for exposure to these factors.  2.3.3  Operational Performance and Insolvency Risk  Based  on  existing  international  research  we  can  cautiously  conclude  that  private  equity  has  a  positive effect on average on the operating performance and growth of companies in which it is invested. Most studies find that companies achieve a higher EBITDA margin and higher revenues on average. At the same time recent studies conclude that these advantages have declined over time (see for example Guo Hotchkiss and Song 2011). Important disclaimers must be applied here. In the first place it is unclear to what extent the positive effects are caused by the selection of underperforming companies. This would indicate  a  selection  effect  rather  than  an  outright  positive  contribution  of  private  equity.  Secondly takeovers  and  divestments  of  parts  of  companies  (which  often  go  together  with  private  equity investments) can lead to the creation of entirely different companies that have little to do with the original benchmark.  Studies  find  that  the  return  often  consists  of  three  primary  components  operational improvements and growth; market timing and selection; and advantages of high leverage. Acharya et al. (2013) find that in a sample of 395 European buyout transactions operational improvements and growth account for 35% of the return market timing and selection for 15% and advantages of higher leverage for 50%.  Another  important  element  of  the  performance  of  private  equity  is  its  influence  on  risk particularly insolvency risk. Research on the United States shows that insolvency risk slightly rises due to 26  the increased leverage under private equity. This rise is however limited. Work by Hotchkiss Smith and Str  mberg  (2014)  on  the  US  is  probably  the  most  extensive  study  of  the  impact  of  private  equity  on insolvency risk. This study examines more than 2000 companies from 1997 to 2007 and finds a 4.9% chance  of  insolvency  among  private  equity  supported  companies  compared  to  a  3.6%  chance  among companies without private equity support. European studies such as Tykov   and Borell (2012) covering a sample of European private equity companies and Wright et al. (2014) covering a group of companies in the United Kingdom find no differences in the probabilities of insolvency. Furthermore Harford and Kolasinski (2013) find that refinancing activities used to pay out dividends have no discernible impact on a private equitybacked company   s chances of insolvency.  Consequently studies show that the risk of insolvency in a company financed by private equity is hardly higher on average than that of similar companies without private equity backing.7 This suggests that private equity funds are apparently capable of managing the high degree of leverage.8 Private equity investors aim to decrease the leverage (through the cash flows generated by the portfolio company) to a lower level before they exit the company. As the median holding period is 4 years the high leverage of the portfolio company is more pronounced in the early years.  Since  the  chances  of  insolvency  are  only  slightly  higher  the  expected  societal  costs  (layoffs value destruction during insolvency proceedings etc.) are limited. THE IMPORTANCE OF LEVERAGE Additionally  private  equity  funds  act  as  buyers  of  (parts  of)  bankrupt  companies  potentially enabling bankruptcies to be resolved more efficiently. This makes it easier for example to keep viable parts of a bankrupt company afloat.9 Private equity also plays a significant role in the takeover market by facilitating the transfer of companies through restructuring and rationalization of operational activities. In the process it creates liquidity in the takeover market in places where it would otherwise be less available.  2.4  We  shall  illustrate  how  financing  with  debt  influences  the  expected  return  and  risk  of  private  equity investments before turning to its impact on the general partner   s compensation (the carried interest).  2.4.1 The effect of leverage on returns can best be explained using a simulated example. Suppose the value of a company that a private equity fund seeks to acquire is 100. In the first scenario this investment is 100% financed by the fund with equity; in the second scenario 50% of the investment is financed with equity and the rest is external debt; and in the third scenario equity accounts only for 10% of the investment                                                            7 The studies are not unequivocal. Some studies find an increase where others find no change in the chances of insolvency compared with a group of companies that are not financed by private equity. 8 An alternative explanation is that lowcovenant loan agreements give private equity players a strong position with regard to their creditors who in turn are quicker to make concessions in case problems arise.  9 Private equity could enable viable parts of companies to be salvaged from insolvency (Imtech for example) or prevent insolvency through welltimed reorganizations. The Influence of Leverage on Investment Risks and Returns 27  with  the  remaining  being  external  debt.10  Suppose  the  private  equity  fund  succeeds  in  increasing  the target company   s value by 15% (i.e. the value becomes 115) through operational improvements or organic growth. What would be the return for the private equity fund in each of the three financing scenarios? Considering that the value increase goes to those who have provided equity (the private equity fund) the return on an investment consisting entirely (100%) of equity is 15%. In the scenario where 50% of the investment is made up of debt and the fund   s own equity makes up the other 50% the return rises to 30% (i.e. (15/50) x 100%); in the scenario where debt makes up 90% of the investment the return on the fund   s equity investment increases all the way to 150% (see Table 1). 11  Table 1 Development of the Shareholder   s Return in Case of Value Creation of 15           Company Value     Equity    Debt          Value Creation Return as % of Equity Invested       Value Increase of 15 100% Equity 100 100 0 50% Equity 100 50 50  15 15%    15 30%     10%  Equity 100 10 90  15 150%                        Additionally  it  is  important  to  emphasize  that  greater  leverage  also  increases  the  spread  (and therefore the risk) of the private equity investor   s return. Suppose there are two possible scenarios the value added is 15 (as above) or there is a decrease in value of 5. How is the return on the invested capital affected for the private equity fund in case of a decrease in value of 5? Assuming once again that the fund   s equity accounts for 100% 50% or 10% of the investment the return on equity is 5% 10% and 50% respectively (see Table 2). In other words the higher the leverage the higher the positive returns but also the more negative the negative returns on the fund   s equity. This applies generally for returns on investments  in  the  financial  markets.  In  the  case  of  active  private  equity  involvement  the  returns  are effort related and are basically a reward (i.e. extra returns) for the restructuring or new growth strategies. And that reward can be boosted by leverage.12                                                              10 We have chosen for rather extreme values of the financing ratios in order to clearly illustrate the effect of debt financing on the return on equity of the private equity fund. 11 For the sake of simplicity we abstract from the cost of debt in these examples. If this is put at 5% and the (onetime) 15% value creation is achieved in a single year this leads to a return on the fund   s own investment of equity equal to 15% 25% (i.e. [(152.5)/50] x 100%)) and 105% (i.e. [(154.5)/10] x 100%)) respectively. 12 Leverage thus increases the reward (but also the loss if it does not work out). Note that this is different from the focus of the famous work of Modigliani and Miller that looks at returns that investors require for holding stocks bonds or other assets. Those returns do typically not reflect any skill or action but are a compensation for time preference and risk. With leverage those returns need to be on average higher (i.e. higher expected returns) to compensate investors for extra risk. 28  Table 2 Effect of (Operational) Value Decrease of 5 on the Return on Equity           Company Value     Equity    Debt          Value Creation Return as % of Equity Invested       Value Decrease of 5 100% Equity 100 100 0 50% Equity 100 50 50  5 5%    5 10%      10% Equity 100 10 90  5 50%                        The Effect of Leverage on the Compensation of the General Partner 2.4.2 The general partner of the private equity fund is compensated in the form of a management fee and a fee related to the fund   s performance (the carried interest). In this section we demonstrate how the buyout as a means of financing influences the general partner   s carried interest. Suppose the agreement contains apart from the 20% carried interest a    hurdle    of 8%. This means that the general partner only receives the carried interest once the limited partners achieve at least an 8% return on their investment. Once this 8% return is achieved the general partner receives a followup return until it reaches a return of 20% (this is  known  as  a  catch  up).  Any  additional  return  achieved  is  then  distributed  at  a  ratio  of  80%  (for  the limited  partners)  to  20%  (for  the  general  partner).  The  total  of  this  performancebased  variable compensation for the general partner is known as the carried interest. To  illustrate  the  effect  of  leverage  on  the  carried  interest  we  return  to  the  example  used  in section 2.4.1. (i.e. 15 in value creation). Assume a 20% carried interest on the return achieved above the 8% hurdle. Although in reality the carried interest is usually calculated based at the fund level we will assume here for the sake of simplicity that only one investment has been made from the fund and that all value is created within a single year. We assume a total operational value creation within the company of 15 on top of a company value of 100. We will show the carried interest for the three scenarios in which the fund   s investment of equity amounts to 100% 50% and 10% respectively.13  In  the  first  financing  scenario  the  fund   s  equity  accounts  for  100%  of  its  investment.  In  that case  the  limited partners  first  receive  a return  of  8% on  their  investment (i.e.  108).  Then  the  general partner receives an amount equal to 20% of the return paid out thus far. This is 25% of 8 which equals 2. The rest (15     8     2 = 5) is distributed among the general partner and limited partners according to the 20/80  rule.  Therefore  the  general  partner  receives  an  additional  0.2  x  5  =  1  from  this.  In  total  the general partner receives a carried interest (performancebased compensation) of 3 in this scenario. If we                                                            13 For the sake of simplicity we do not take management fees into consideration in this example.  29  carry out these calculations for each of the three financing scenarios we see that in each case the general partner receives 3 (see Table 3). This seems to suggest that the general partner is indifferent with regard to  the  financing  proportion  but  that  is  only  the  case  if  we  look  at  a  single  investment.  In  fact  by financing  with  more  debt  the  general  partner  can  finance  more  projects  considering  the  size  of  the investment  fund  and  thus  increase  the  total  compensation  across  all  projects  combined.  Suppose  the general partner   s fund has a size of 100. In that case the general partner can make a single investment in which equity amounts to 100. If the fund invests with 50% debt it has 200 to invest (100 equity and 100 debt) thus enabling it to take on two projects of 100 each and thus receiving twice the carried interest. If the fund invests with 90% debt even 10 such projects can be taken on each contributing to the general partner   s carried interest. In other words the total carried interest increases proportionally to an increase in leverage.14 It is important to note that the carried interest is calculated at the fund level so that if one investment fails to deliver a good return it comes at the expense of the total carried interest.  Abstaining from problems associated with default of insolvency the preceding analysis implies that the general partner of the private equity fund has an interest in financing investments using debt to the greatest extent possible.

It makes it possible to do    more    with a limited amount of  equity  thus  increasing  a  fund   s  clout  (multiple  buyouts  can be  done  by  adding  debt  to  the available  funds).  It  enables  more  concentrated  shareholdings  (fewer  additional  shareholders  needed) improving  engagement  and  reducing  free  rider  problems.  Leverage  increases  the  return  on  the  private                                                            14 In the example in Table 3 we assume that the cash flow is high enough to pay out the hurdle as well as the catch up.  30  equity  investors     efforts  and  the  performancesensitivity  of  the  general  partner   s  compensation  (the carried interest). It further could enforce greater discipline and urgency. Additionally it could offer tax benefits as stated.  Private equity funds can raise the leverage even more by providing loans themselves (so called shareholder  loans).  The  interest  rate  on  these  loans  is  usually  high  and  could  further  increase  the  tax savings.  Depending  on  the  selected  structure  the  private  equity  fund   s  interest  income  is  either  nontaxable or taxed at a relatively low rate. The tax benefits associated with leverage have been scaled back by recent legislation in several jurisdictions. In 2012 the Netherlands began limiting the taxdeductibility of interest payments. In the tax plan for 2017 the deductibility of interest on shareholder loans was abolished through an amendment to Article 10a of the Dutch Corporate Tax Act.  The high degree of leverage is often seen as undesirable by critics because it reduces taxes for the government and might expose the company and its investors to a high level of insolvency risk. Critics also claim it can be used as a means of    pillaging    a company by having it pay out a superdividend with the cash from newly issued debt. This may result in greater insolvency risks and it may impact the company   s future prospects.  However general partners of private equity funds seem capable of managing the risks of greater leverage. They work closely with the company and contribute their own knowledge and expertise. This makes them better capable of promptly evaluating the desirability and necessity of additional injections of capital  as  soon  as  problems  arise.  They  also  often  have  a  relatively  strong  negotiating  position  when dealing with creditors (e.g. banks). Additionally they may care about their reputation because investors need to be found for new funds that they may establish in the future. This argument expands to creditors of the firm as well as management. Since private equity firms also want to fund future investments with relatively high debt levels they have an additional incentive not to default on their debt. Management will prefer a private equity investor with a good track record as they often invest alongside the private equity investor and thus has    skin in the game   .  REDISTRIBUTION AND POSSIBLE EXCESSES 2.5  Besides    real    value creation the return that private equity investors earn can point to a redistribution at the  expense  of  other  stakeholders.  Employees  may  lose  their  jobs  or  face  pressure  to  accept  lower salaries  suppliers  may  be  forced  to  make  concessions  and  creditors  may  be  pressured  to  lower  their claims. If private equity raises the company   s risk profile a heightened insolvency risk may inflict damage on other stakeholders.  In the section below we first discuss possible negative aspects of private equity specifically the oftenbemoaned  shortterm  focus  and  aggressive     asset  stripping     (i.e.  selling  a  company   s  underlying 31  assets following the buyout). Then we turn to possible redistribution effects. We discuss redistribution effects towards the government (tax arbitrage) the possibility of favoritism towards management at the expense  of  existing  (   old   )  shareholders  redistributions  that  put  employees  at  a  disadvantage  and redistributions between the general and limited partners. Finally we examine the possible spillover effects of private equity on the sector in which the target firm operates and externalities vis  vis the economy as a whole.  Investments ShortTerm Bias and Asset Stripping  2.5.1 Does private equity lead to a heavier focus on the short term in the sense of damaging the longterm prospects  of  the target  company? The  notion  of  a  stronger  shortterm  mentality  among  private  equity companies  (compared  to  similar  nonprivate  equityfunded  companies)  is  only  in  a  very  limited  way supported by findings in the international research. Studies on the effects of private equity in the 1980s found that private equityfinanced companies invest less. This could be characterized as a stronger focus on the short term. However at that time private equity focused primarily on inefficient conglomerates in need of restructuring. This would naturally lead to reductions in scope and limits on wasteful investments. To  characterize  this  as  an  undue  bias  in  favor  of  the  short  term  is  somewhat  misleading.  In  recent decades private equity is more focused on growth with typically no decrease in investments throughout its ownership. Recent studies show that the level of investments in R&D does not decrease under private equity but does become more focused. A median holding period of 4 years would also suggest a more medium term rather than shortterm focus. Another  (related)  criticism  focusses  on     asset  stripping     and  superdividends;  basically  selling assets  at  the  expense  of  future  opportunities  of  the  firm  in  order  to  increase  profit  distributions. However asset stripping and the issuing of superdividends are not structural occurrences in companies taken  over  by  private  equity.  Although  superdividends  have  been  observed  in  some  cases  and  may indicate that the company in question is being pillaged research by Cohn Mills and Towery (2014) finds that even for businesses in the 90th percentile of highest dividend payouts dividend accounts for only 0.1% of the transaction value in the first year and 1.7% in the second year. This means that dividends were even lower than before the buyout. The study does find that companies (buyouts) with low cash flows tend to pay slightly higher dividends and vice versa. However the effect on the economy as a whole is very limited. Furthermore  the  possibilities  of  paying  superdividends  have  been  somewhat  limited  by government policy. Around the world legislative measures have been enacted to prevent excessive profit distributions  and     asset  stripping     in  its  purest  form.15  In  the  Netherlands  this  falls  under  directors    liability (Article 2216 of the Dutch Civil Code) and the AIFM directive which is enshrined in law (Article 437v  of  the  Dutch  Financial  Supervision  Act  (Wft)).  Under  Article  2216  of  the  Dutch  Civil  Code                                                            15    The purest form    refers to selling assets so that superdividends can then be paid out leaving creditors and employees with a    hollowedout    company. 32  directors must act in the company   s interest when carrying out planned profit distributions. They must test on the basis of realistic prognoses whether the distribution may result in continuity problems for the company. In the event of insolvency the directors can be held personally liable if this testing was not carried out or was carried out inadequately. If shareholders have received dividends and the company goes  bankrupt  the  creditors  can  claim  and  recover  the  wrongfully  paid  out  amount  from  the shareholders. The AIFM directive (Article 30) contains a measure to counter asset stripping; among other things it requires the private equity fund with a controlling interest in a company to abstain for the first 24 months from supporting actions that affect the assets of the company in question. This is intended to prevent a private equity fund from selling off valuable assets and redirecting the profits to themselves by paying dividends. Another source of concern is that excessive leverage places too much pressure on management tempting them to    cut corners   . There is some evidence that high leverage pushes management to increase shortterm cash flows in order to help deal with the debt burden. This could lead to a degradation in the quality of products. Matsa (2011) shows that this can indeed occur. He found that concessions were made with regard to the quality of products in heavily debt financed private equity transactions in the American supermarket sector. This does seem to indicate a shortterm focus in the longer term a similar strategy would probably cost the company clientele and revenue. This research is however too limited to draw broader conclusions. Overall one could say that there is no reason to assume that desirable investments decline. R&D investments are however more focused under private equity.16 Only in isolated cases are superdividends paid out at an early stage. However absolute conclusions cannot be drawn. Concerns can be raised about limitations  in  the  empirical  studies  including  selection  biases.  Also  as  mentioned  previously  research focuses  primarily  on  relatively  large  companies  because  more  data  on  these  companies  are  publicly available.17   2.5.2  Market Timing and Selection  An alternative (partial) explanation for the positive return for private equity investors is the possibility of timing as well as selection. If a private equity fund is good at selecting undervalued companies that it later sells for a higher price this is    merely    a transfer of value from the shareholders of the target company to those of the private equity fund. In that case the returns reflect the elimination of undervaluation rather than value creation. This can also apply to the buyout of a company with undervalued assets which are then sold off in parts (asset stripping).                                                            16 Lerner et al. (2011) argues that patents of LBO firms seem to have a higher economic impact; they are more cited.   17 The study by Cohn et al. (2014) is an exception. Cohn et al. base their research on tax returns thus incorporating data from smaller more comparable companies. 33  Exposing the undervaluation can actually have real effects. Achieving an accurate valuation can enable assets to be allocated more optimally. It sends a better signal about where opportunities are and thus can result in a better allocation of resources.  Strategies focusing on market timing and asset stripping were particularly popular in the 1980s when breaking up conglomerates was common. In those years not only was undervaluation an issue but typically  also  underperformance  of  the  different  parts.  Within  the  conglomerate  the  different  pieces could  hide  their  shortcomings.  Breaking  up  these  conglomerates  allowed  a  more  focused  response offering possibilities for real value creation.  2.5.3  Redistribution Effects  In  this  section  we  discuss  how  private  equity  can  lead  to  redistributions  of  value  among  the  various stakeholders and private equity investors.  Government and Tax Arbitrage Private equity goes hand in hand with a relatively high level of debt. This produces tax savings through the deductibility of interest payments. As a result the government loses out on tax revenues. This has led many  countries  to  develop regulations  to  limit  tax  deductions  for  leveraged  buyouts.  In Germany  for example  the  deduction  is  capped  at  30%  of  EBITDA.  The  Netherlands  has  set  limits  on  the  interest deduction with its    acquisition holdings    decision of 2012. Article 15Ad of the Dutch Corporate Tax Act of  1969  specifies  that  effective  1  January  2012  only  the  interest  paid  on  the  healthy  part  of  the acquisition debt is deductible. The healthy part is set at 60% of the acquisition price. This is lowered by five percentage points each year for a period of seven years after the buyout until it reaches 25%. The deduction limit includes a SME franchise of 1 million euro interest per year.18 Tax  arbitrage  can  also  take  place  by  charging  management  fees  at  the  company  level.  These management fees are (partially) taxdeductible. Depending on where management fees fall they may be taxed at a lower rate or not at all. The  tax  advantages  of  leverage  are  significant.  Knauer  et  al.  (2014)  find  that  tax  savings  in Germany for example amount to between 16% and 20% of company value. This results in lower tax revenues for the government. The benefit comes with higher prices that are paid during a buyout and thus seem at least in part to be transferred to the boughtout shareholders of the companies being taken over (see Jenkinson and Stucke 2011). As  indicated  tax  benefits  are  by  no  means  the  only  reason  why  private  equity  transactions involve  leverage.  They  are  simply  part  of  a  broader  set  of  forces  including  the  impact  of  leverage  on incentives.  The  (further)  elimination  of  tax  benefits  will  therefore  not  make  the  relatively  high  use  of leverage in private equity disappear but may moderate it.                                                            18 For further analysis of the fiscal aspects of private equity see Van de Streek (2015). With the recent Dutch Tax Plan of 2017 interest deduction for shareholder loans has been abolished. 34  Redistribution Through Favoritism Towards Management A  less  flattering  example  of  private  equity  transactions  is  whenever  the  deal  is  consciously  created  to achieve more lucrative rewards at the expense of existing shareholders. In particular management of the target company might be susceptible to pressure or promises from the private equity fund. Management may have been approached in the runup to the buyout and based on promises made with regard to its role in the buyout already be acting in the interest of the private equity fund instead of in the interest of existing shareholders or other stakeholders.  Some evidence of this is found in the study by Mao and Renneboog (2015) which shows that in management buyouts (MBOs) more downward earningsmanipulation takes place in the year leading up to the transaction. It may imply that existing management tries to negatively influence the value of the company in order to bring down the purchase price for the private equity fund. This creates a greater potential  to  increase  the  company   s  value  after  the  transaction.  Management  might  benefit  if  it  is promised a role postbuyout particularly when it gets shares. In any case this calls for an active role on the part of nonexecutive directors (the supervisory board) of the target company; its management might be  compromised.  In  Box  2  the  (failed)  buyout  of  Qantas  by  a  consortium  of  private  equity  parties  is discussed illuminating some of these issues.  Box 2 Conflicts of Interest Between Shareholders and Management at Qantas19 In early 2007 a consortium of private equity funds (referred to here as APA a group which included Macquarie and TPG) made a bid 33% above the latest share price on shares in the listed Australian airline company Qantas. In March of that year Qantas released its annual report which showed earnings that were 30% to 40% higher than had been expected. APA did not increase its bid based on this information and on 12 April amended the bid so it would be conditional on backing from 70% of Qantas shareholders. Yet by the 7th of May of that year not even 50% of the shares were offered prompting APA to withdraw its bid.  The  most  important  reason  why  the  buyout  fell  through  was  that  investors  considered  the  bid  to  be  too  low. However  in  addition  to  that  a  conflict  of  interest  between  management/board  and  shareholders  may  have  played  a significant role. Qantas chairwoman Margareth Jackson had been a strong proponent of the deal. The fact that no increase in the bid  was  requested  despite  the  company   s  reported  earnings  being  higher than  expected  contributed  to  the  perception  that management at Qantas was eager to make a deal that played into the private equity fund   s hand rather than putting the interests of the    old    shareholders first. Qantas announced that its management would acquire 1% of shares in the privatized company (a value of around 110 million dollars). Later it was revealed that this stake might increase to as much as 4.5%. These revelations reduced confidence in both management and board and ultimately contributed to the shareholders    decision                                                            19 This case study is based primarily on a study by the Melbourne Centre for Financial Studies (2009). 35  to turn against them. The Qantas case raised much attention and concern in Australia and other countries over conflicts of interests in private equity buyouts.  There  are  several  other  ways  in  which  management  might  be  compromised  for  example  exorbitant severance packages might be offered for members of management who consent to the buyout. Again this would tempt existing management to advise shareholders to sell the company too quickly and at a price that is too low.20 This puts existing shareholders at a disadvantage and calls for a vigilant role of nonexecutive directors.  Redistribution and Employees The  impact  of  private  equity  on  the  size  of  the  workforce  within  a  company  is  on  average  negative during the first year after the buyout; however the workforce generally recovers in the years after that (see Cressy Munari and Malipiero 2007; Wilson et al. 2012; Boucly Sraer and Thesmar 2011). In private equity transactions focused on restructuring a more permanent negative impact of private equity on the number  of  employees  can  be  expected.  However  also  here  understanding  the  counterfactual  is important what would the prospects of employees have been if the restructuring would not have taken place?   Also  Schumpeter   s     creative  destruction     argument  should  be  taken  into  account.  What opportunities come about by restructuring or downsizing a bloated incumbent or by enforcing a strategic reorientation? The company itself might ultimately grow again based on the strategic reorientation (with possible subsequent mergers and takeovers by the company).21 The most extensive study of the effects of private equity financing on employment in companies is Davis et al. (2014). That study analyzes a very broad dataset from 3200 buyout companies during the period 19802005 concluding that buyouts lead to a limited net loss of jobs (less than 1%) but result in significant gross job creation. While a considerable number of jobs are eliminated a large number of new jobs are created (resulting in only minor net job losses).  With regard to salaries per employee the picture is less clear. Some international studies find a slight decrease while others identify an average increase. Although identifying the exact reasons for such ambiguous findings remains anyone   s guess to a certain extent there are two effects which seem to play a part. Private equity exerts downward pressure on salary levels in general but at the same time there is a possible shift towards more higherlevel job positions.22 Studies show that other forces and arrangements that surround employees (union membership occupational safety records career perspectives complaints                                                            20 This conflict of interest also may occur in nonprivate equity initiated takeovers (see for example Mannesmann where management received a very favorable retirement package). 21 Note that the process of shrinking and growing again will not be without pain nor without costs to society. Whenever a mass outpouring of older workers occurs they may not all be able to reenter the labor market and substantial costs are passed on to society even in the long(er) term. 22 A possible mechanism for this is that financing with large amounts of debt and the resulting pressure on the company does weaken the negotiating position of employees; for a thorough theoretical discussion of this topic see Perotti and Spier (1993). 36  procedures internal promotions etc.) do not fundamentally change.23 In that sense there seems to be no systematic evidence of indirect transfers of value from employees to investors.  Redistribution from Limited Partners to General Partners The general partner   s compensation contract (with management fee and carried interest) should seek to align  the  interests  of  the  general  partner  with  those  of  the  limited  partners.  Nonetheless  conflicts  of interest  may  still  arise.  These  are  primarily  related  to  the  fact  that  the  general  partners  place  great importance in the size of the fund (see also our analysis of the carried interest) whereas limited partners are primarily concerned with the return on their investments. The urge to see the size of the fund (and that of subsequent funds) as objective can lead the general partner to undertake less optimal investments particularly at the end of a fund   s lifetime. The general partner   s reputation and strong screening measures by  the  limited  partners  of  private  equity  funds  are  intended  to  keep  this  behavior  under  control. Furthermore the general partner can charge all kinds of other fees for example a management fee to be paid by the company. Nowadays limited partners usually try to define such fees in their contracts with the  fund  or  negotiate  that  these  fees  will  be  deducted  from  the  amount  of  carried  interest  paid. Nonetheless transparency towards smaller investors in particular remains a concern. Market forces could prompt some discipline. Currently however a relative surplus of capital has given rise to a    demander   s market    giving general partners greater power and putting market discipline under pressure.  2.5.4 Two  recent  studies  (see  Bernstein  et  al.  2010;  and  Lubbers  Von  Eije  and  Westerman  2015)  have examined the impact of private equity on the meso (i.e. sectoral) level. Bernstein et al. (2010) find that sectors in which private equity funds have been active in the last five years experienced relatively more growth in employment as well as more investment. This may point to spillover effects onto competitors in the sector due to the presence of private equity funds. For example if private equity involvement via    creative destruction    elevates competition that competition could stimulate nonprivate equityfinanced companies to increase their productivity and improve operational processes. Spillover Effects of Private Equity It is too soon to draw strong conclusions based on these studies. They are simply too sporadic for that. It is clear however that there is a real possibility that the presence of private equity financing has positive effects on other companies in the same sector. Research on this topic is still in the early stages.  DEVELOPMENTS IN THE PRIVATE EQUITY MARKET IN THE NETHERLANDS 2.6  The market for private equity investments reached its high point in 2007 both worldwide as well as in the Netherlands.  Aside  from  the  overheating  at  that  point  and  the  correction  that  followed  during  the                                                            23 See for example the survey by EVCA/CMBOR (2008). 37  financial crisis (especially in 2009) the volume of private equity has increased steadily over the last three decades. However the market develops in waves which are strongly influenced by the degree to which debt is available at any given time as well as how easy it is to make an exit. The latter depends strongly on the stock market. Private Equity in the Netherlands In  this  section  we  first  provide  general  information  about  the  Dutch  private  equity  market. Subsequently we present empirical insights from an analysis of buyouts in the Netherlands during the period 20072015.  2.6.1 Because of relatively high returns in the past     at least compared with a welldiversified equity index     private equity has become a popular asset class for institutional investors. The pension fund ABP for example has invested approximately 5% of its total portfolio in private equity. The increasing supply of capital for private equity is also a result of the relatively high number of exits by earlier private equity funds which frees up capital for reinvestment. As a consequence there are currently many funds on the market with relatively high amounts of capital that is committed but not yet invested (also known as    dry powder   ).  In  such  a  market  the  suppliers  of  capital  may  have  a  relatively  weak  bargaining  position compared to the demand side (i.e. the private equity funds). Annual  private  equity  investments  in  the  Netherlands  from  2007  to  2015  amounted  to approximately 2 Billion euro 0.3% of GDP (see Figure 1).24  The greatest portion (62%) of private equity investments falls in the category midmarket with investments between 15 and 150 million euros; 22% are smaller deals and the remaining 15% are large transactions (see Figure 2). For the period from 2007 to 2015 46% of the total investment volume on average was initiated by foreign private equity firms. Syndication in which multiple private equity parties are involved occurs regularly (29% of the time on average for the 20072015 period).                                                                24 Because of the relatively high degree of debt financing the clout of private equity is greater than its own contribution of capital (including any shareholder loans). This is reflected in the higher leverage on average after a buyout. Following the crisis around 60% of the capital in private equityheld companies is debt which is somewhat below the average amount of debt before the crisis. This refers to the allin leverage (i.e. the leverage on the level of the buyout holding as well as within the company). 38  Figure 1 Overview of the Development of Buyout Investments in the Netherlands by Private Equity Funds (European PE Funds); in Billions of Euros   soruenoilli B000510152025303540200720082009201020112012201320142015 Source Invest Europe country tables 20072015 (Table 26)  Figure 2 Classification by Size of Financing in Buyouts by Private Equity Funds; Averages (20072015) 49% 109% 219% 623% Small (<    15m) Midmarket (   15  150m) Large (   150  300m) Mega (>    300m) Source Invest Europe country tables 20072015  Private equity funds maintain their investment for approximately five years on average. For the period from 2007 to 2015 selling to a strategic party (an operating company) was the most commonly used  method  of  exit  (33%  of  all  cases).  Reselling  to  another  private  equity  fund  (secondary  buyouts) 39  accounted for 20% of exits while 12% of cases ended with an exit through a public listing. Secondary buyouts are becoming increasingly important not only in the Netherlands but worldwide. The increase in secondary buyouts is explained in part by private equity funds that still need to invest despite reaching the end of their investment period (usually the first five years of a fund) or by funds that need to get rid of their  investments  at  the  end  of  the  fund   s  lifetime.  Secondary  buyouts  can  be  optimal  from  a  valuecreation point of view when successive buyouts build on complementary skills; for example through a restructuring in the first round towards a growth strategy afterwards.

This is even more so for the private equity model. Private equity as a governance model has very few fundamental differences across the world. Dutch funds invest in the Netherlands  and  abroad  and  the same  goes for  their fundraising. There  are  also many  foreign  private equity funds active in the Netherlands. As a result the insights from the international empirical studies mentioned in section 2.3 are undoubtedly also relevant for the Netherlands. In addition to taking stock of these insights we have specifically looked at the Netherlands (see Ligterink  et  al.  2017  for  details).  Based  on  two  complementary  samples  an  attempt  is  made  to  gain insights  into  the  effects  of  private  equity  buyouts  in  the  Netherlands.  The  first  sample  comes  from  a 40  public database (Zephyr by Bureau van Dijk referred to here as BvD). Based on this 595 private equity buyouts were identified over the period from 2007 to 2015. The results of these buyouts are compared with two control groups. One control group contains ten Dutch companies which are comparable in size and  sector  and  the  other  consists  of  ten  similarly  comparable  European  companies.  We  examine  the development  of  certain  figures  from  one  year  before  the  buyout  until  three  years  afterwards  or  the moment of exit. Because the availability of data for these companies is often limited the final sample is considerably  smaller  than  595  and  the  number  of  companies  varies  depending  on  the  aspect  being examined. As such less than 5% of the original sample remains for certain figures related to revenue debt  number  of  employees  and  taxes.  This  may  impact  how  representative  the  ultimate  sample  is implying that the results should be interpreted with caution.  The  second  much  smaller  sample  (31  buyouts)  contains  more  detailed  information  making further  analyses  possible.  We  refer  to  this  database  as  the  PE  database  (alongside  the  aforementioned BvD  database).  The  PE  database  contains  information  on  the  size  of  the  investments  and  the characteristics of the companies involved and that for the year in which the buyout occurred until the exit (in so far exit had already taken place). The most important insights are discussed below.  Holding Period and Deal Characteristics The median holding period for both samples is four years for the companies that realized an exit during the period 20072016. This is comparable to the European median. Furthermore only 192 of the 595 companies had realized an exit. This is most likely related to the influence of the crisis. This means that the actual period a company is held by private equity on average is longer.  In most cases private equity funds buy a majority stake (90.3% in the PE database). In 16% of cases coinvestors are involved     investors who invest along with the private equity fund     and in nearly 10% of cases multiple private equity funds participate in a single deal. In terms of the initial investment private equity funds buy from a strategic seller in 33% of cases; in 42% of cases they buy from other private equity funds; and in 25% of cases they buy directly from company owners or their families. When realizing an exit private equity funds choose a strategic buyer 33% of the time. Alternatively they sell to a different private equity fund (39%) undertake an Initial Public Offering (3%) or sell to a family private investor or company management (3%). In 18% of cases the company is written off.  Effect on the Company The BvD database shows higher median growth of total assets and earnings for companies during the first three years under private equity compared with the control groups. This suggests that private equity funds are capable of either selecting fastgrowing companies or speeding up the growth of the companies they  invest  in.  It  is  important  to  recall  earlier  disclaimers.  Selection  effects  might  be  present.  Also acquisitions and disposals by these companies (which often go together with private equity investments) 41  can  lead  to  the  creation  of  entirely  different  companies  that  have  little  more  to  do  with  the  original benchmark.  The  importance  of  this  can  be  seen  in  the  BvD  database  where  57%  of  the  portfolio companies were involved in mergers and buyout activities in the period under private equity ownership.  Compared  with  the  year  before  the  buyout  private  equity  companies  have  more  debt.25  This decreases  at  the  end  of  the  lifetime  for  those  companies  that  subsequently  have  had  an  exit.  Other findings show how important it is to correct with a control group. For instance the performance of the private equity companies shows a negative trend but relative to the control groups it is positive. Thus companies with private equity as an investor perform better. Furthermore it appears that companies that have had an earlier exit are the    problem children    their growth rate is negative compared with that of the control groups.26  The Employee   s Perspective In terms of the number of employees we see an increase for the companies in the large BvD database from one year prior to three years after the buyout. The control groups however show an even stronger increase. The difference in employee growth rates between the private equity companies and the control group  companies  is  not  significant.  Also  for  companies  with  an  exit  the  increase  in  the  number  of employees is not significantly different from that of the control groups. The number of observations here is however very limited.27  The  cautious  conclusion  to  be  drawn  from  this  is  that  private  equity  does  in  fact  maintain employment levels but ultimately shows less growth in employment numbers than the control groups when the full threeyear period is taken into consideration. Combined with the aforementioned higher growth  in  total  assets  and  earnings  compared  with  the  control  groups  this  means  that  private  equity succeeds in growing companies without a corresponding growth in employment.   The Investor   s Perspective We only have information about the returns achieved by investors for the small PE database. The median return  (IRR)  amounts  to  24%  for  all  companies  combined;  for  the  companies  with  an  exit  the  IRR amounted to 22%. These returns are not adjusted for fees charged by the private equity fund.  Taxes In the large BvD database we witness a decrease in taxes paid by companies in the period from one year prior to the buyout until three years after the buyout or until the moment of exit. The decrease in taxes                                                            25 The amount of debt is probably still underestimated considering that a portion of the debt often remains in the buyout holding. This cannot be ascertained in the figures from the database.  26 For the PE database we see strong growth in earnings and an increasing  company value. In addition to this there is a slight decrease in EBITDA and debt compared with the year in which the buyout itself takes place (information for the year prior to the buyout is not available). 27 In the small PE database we also witness an increase in the number of workers measured three years after the buyout or alternatively at the moment an earlier exit takes place (actually in case of the latter we look at the first year after the buyout; information for the year prior to the buyout is not available). 42  paid is however not as large as among the control groups. This decrease in part might be explained by the financial crisis.  CONCLUSIONS As mentioned earlier the aforementioned findings are based on a small number of observations. Furthermore  major  changes  often  occurred  in  the  composition  of  the  companies  involved  (see  the disclaimers). It is therefore essential that these findings be interpreted and used with due caution.  2.7  Much  like  in  the  rest  of  the  world  investments  by  private  equity  funds  in  the  Netherlands  increased strongly in the runup to the financial crisis fueled in part by favorable market conditions (low interest rates advantageous credit conditions and good opportunities for selling companies). In the period after the  crisis  a  downward  correction  took  place  but  recovery  quickly  set  in.  Overall  one  observes  a continued growth of private equity over time.  The study supports the view that private equity has an added value as an ownership structure. It is  not  particularly  shortterm  oriented  with  a  horizon  typically  of  four  to  seven  years.  Due  to  strong financial  incentives  (in  part  because  of  leverage)  private  equity  adds  urgency  to  accomplishing improvements in target companies. Private equity involvement brings financial clout expertise and access to an external network. Via concentrated ownership it also mitigates freerider problems associated with public (i.e. exchange listed) ownership. In historical terms private equity has generated a return for its investors (limited partners) which is above that of a welldiversified equity portfolio even after deducting costs and the considerable fees. We are referring here to limited partners who participate as investors from the outside. This history is also the most important reason why these investors are eager to participate in private equity. However the spread  in  returns  is  large  and  when  it  its  adjusted  for  unfavorable  factors  like  reduced  liquidity  and higher  risk  compared  with  the  benchmark  there  seems  to  be  no  significant  outperformance  for  the limited partners.  Our  own  analysis  and  the  international  literature  show  that  private  equity  investment  has  a slightly positive effect on a company   s performance in general. Private equityfinanced companies in our Dutch sample grow somewhat faster and are slightly more profitable than comparable companies in the control  group.  The  impact  on  employment  is  slightly  negative  compared  to  the  control  group. International  evidence  points  at  a  marginal  net  loss  of  employment  (to  be  expected  particularly  in restructurings) but going hand in hand with gross employment creation.  The return that private equity funds achieve on their investments in target companies stem from a number of sources      operational improvements including adjusting the strategic focus and facilitating growth;  43  improving the governance structure by aligning interests and strengthening oversight;          benefits associated with higher leverage;      investment selection and market timing; a private equity firm   s ability to track down undervalued buyout candidates (and take advantage of that by reselling them later at a higher price).   There are concerns however. The return for the private equity investor is not always true value creation  but  could  be  based  on  redistribution  effects  at  the  expense  of  other  stakeholders  inside  and outside the company. This is an important area of concern in discussions on private equity and points at possible conflicts of interest. The most important potential conflicts of interest between a private equity fund and other stakeholders are      an incentive to push heavily for fastpaced reorganizations too much focused on cash payouts (high dividends) at the expense of investments in the business. More generally taking an (overly) opportunistic approach. This can result in burdens for the company   s employees suppliers and customers;      an incentive to significantly increase leverage to arbitrate (i.e. reduce) taxes paid and create via insolvency  risk  an  undue  burden  on  creditors  suppliers  (including  a  deterioration  of  payment terms) and ultimately employees and customers.   Our conclusion is that these conflicts undoubtedly do arise but that excesses have occurred only in isolated incidents. Also the likelihood of insolvency is only slightly higher than in companies with no private equity involvement. Reasons for this include the proximity of private equity to the companies in which they invest the ability to inject capital when needed and the stronger negotiating position with regard  to  creditors.  We  also  find  no  systematic  evidence  of  harmful  effects  of  private  equity  on employment and other stakeholders.  A more rigorous understanding of the forces leading to leverage is important given its presence in  private  equity  investments  and  the  controversy  associated  with  it  in  the  public  debate.  An  obvious reason for  leverage  are the tax  savings because  of the possibility  of  deducting  interest  payments.  Why such stimulus needs to be provided is not clear. In many countries     like the Netherlands     limits are being introduced. However private equity investors have also other reasons for financing buyouts with relatively large amounts of debt. Debt makes the fund   s return on its equity investment more sensitive to performance;  i.e.  it  provides  extra  rewards  for  return  enhancing  actions.  Debt  also  creates  a  sense  of urgency.  The  high  leverage     demands     action  which  is  particularly  important  when  a  restructuring  is needed.  It  also  enables more  investments to  be made  with  a  set  amount of  equity  (this  has  a  positive impact  on  for  example  the  private  equity  general  partner   s  compensation).  Finally  it  can  help  the company in pushing for concessions from other stakeholders (e.g. due to the burden of leverage they may  be  more  prepared  to make  concessions). Particularly  the  latter  but  also  the  tax  benefits point  at 44  advantages gained at the expense of other parties and thus are based on redistribution of value rather than  a     real     increase  in  the  value  of  the  company.  Overall  one  may  conclude  that  leverage  exists  for several reasons and just limiting or even abolishing tax benefits will not have it disappear but might help contain it. Conflicts of interest may also arise between the general and limited partners in a private equity fund. The general partner often has an interest in the size of the fund and therefore may have different concerns than the limited partners. The fee structure can also result in conflicts of interest between the general and limited partners. General partners are closer to the company in which the fund invests and extract considerable fees. Although general partners benefit from having a good reputation among limited partners     they will need to find limited partners in the future too     ultimately there remains a potential for conflict. The danger of conflicts of interest must not be understated. More pressure from the limited partners  would  be  a  welcome  development  and  transparency  in  limited  partnership  agreements  could help bring this about. The recent guidelines developed by the Dutch pension fund PGGM push in this direction but it is unclear how effective they are and to what extent they apply to the sector as a whole. Appropriate  governance  both  within  the  buyout  companies  and  the  organizations  that  the  limited partners  belong  to  (specifically  institutional  investors)  is  crucial.  As  these  are  business  transactions involving large institutions the scope for government interference is limited; in the end these are business decisions and responsibilities.  Nevertheless  it  is  legitimate  to  have  concerns.  International  standards  might  offer  little protection  and  transparency  is  limited.  Institutional  investors  (e.g.  pension  funds  as  limited  partners) might not be able to offer sufficient counterweight vis  vis the general partners in private equity funds. Also the transaction process leading up to a buyout deserves attention. Prior to a buyout management of a target company might be in a conflicting situation. In particular private equity investors have an interest in acquiring shares in the target company for as little as possible. Because the company   s management might be enticed with the promise of a postbuyout role (including equitybased compensation) it may have an interest in driving down the share price prior to the transaction. This is damaging to the existing (   old   )  shareholders  and  relates  to  the  more  general  topic  of  protecting  the  interests  of  minority shareholders. It is essential for the company   s board (particularly its nonexecutive directors) to take the right  position  and  keep  its  management   s  own  interests  in  check  and  thus  protecting  existing shareholders.28 Another  area  of  attention  is  shareholder  loans.  These  are  considered  legitimate  sources  of financing in their own right. The question is whether these loans should not be treated as equity which would therefore make them subordinated to other creditors    claims. This may prevent abuse.29                                                            28 Also the effectiveness of current regulations (see for example legislation in the area of directors    liability the Dutch AIFM directive and the interaction with insolvency legislation) needs to be regularly assessed. 29 Tax deductibility for the interest paid on these loans is undesirable to the extent that it still exists. Not only is it worrisome because of the burden it imposes on other taxpayers it is primarily problematic for the improper conduct it entices. Interest deductibility on these loans has been abolished in the Dutch Tax Plan for 2017. 45  To conclude further work on understanding the impact of private equity is important. Private equity  plays  a  legitimate  role  but  more  is  needed  to  shed  light  on  its  operations.  Particularly  for  the Netherlands significant data problems need to be resolved. Access to data is limited. This is not just a problem  for  empirical  analyses  like  in  this  study  but  also  limits  public  acceptance  of  private  equity. Therefore it is critical that more comprehensive databases will be created.30                                                             30 The Nederlandse Vereniging van Participatiemaatschappijen (NVP) could improve this situation for example by following in the footsteps of an initiative by the British Venture Capital Association (BVCA) to create a representative database. In an attempt to increase transparency and reporting in the area of private equity the BVCA reports annually on the effects of a representative sample (see BVCA 2015). 46  REFERENCES  Acharya V.V. O.
