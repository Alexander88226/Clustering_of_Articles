Awareness and Perception Analysis of Small Medium Enterprise and Startup Towards FinTech Instruments  Crowdfunding and PeertoPeer Lending in Malaysia. International Journal of Finance and Banking Research.   Vol. 4 No. 1 2018 pp. 1324. doi 10.11648/j.ijfbr.20180401.12 Received January 31 2018; Accepted February 16 2018; Published March 19 2018     Abstract This study aims to analyze the awareness and perception of Malaysian Small Medium Enterprises and startups on the existence of alternatives financing channels such as PeertoPeer lending and crowdfunding in supporting the growth and expansion of  their business in the  future. Results indicate that at present the level of awareness of  most respondents is still insufficient on PeertoPeer lending and crowdfunding as alternative financing instruments. However based on the perception results a majority of them have a slightly positive response or perception to the development of FinTech. These results suggest that  there  is  a  need  and  opportunity  to  raise  awareness  among  Small  Medium  Enterprises  and  startups  by  authorized government related body. Keywords Awareness Perception FinTech Alternative Financing Instrument SME Malaysia 1. Introduction Small and mediumsized enterprises (SMEs) and startups play  a  significant  role  as  the  primary  driver  for  economic growth and a force in job creation. However these SMEs and startups  have  difficulty  in  securing  proper  financing  to prosper.  The  global  financial  crisis  which  was  occurred  in 20072008  coupled  with  stricter  regulation  for  loans  to SMEs  and  startups  has  made  it  even  more  difficult  for SMEs  and  startups  to  secure  financing.  Reasons  for  this issue  are  varied  the  finances  of  SMEs  and  startups  are characterized  by  high  risk  yet  are  low  scale.  As  for traditional lenders such as banks due to smallsized of a loan lending credit to small businesses is often too costly and give a  little  return.  Driven  further  by  regulation  banks  have reduced their exposure to smaller companies in recent years. In  addition  to  this  small  businesses  also  often  lack  the knowledge  skills  capabilities  and  resources  to  manage finance  in  a  sophisticated  manner  and  to  conduct  systematic fundraising.  However  the  global  financial  crisis  and  the obstacle  to  getting  a  loan  from  banks  have  also  created  disruptors  in  the  FinTech  (the  use  of  technology  and innovative  business  models  in  financial  services)  area  who with  their  creative  ways  have  provided  alternative  ways  for SMEs  to  secure  funding  for  their  growth.  Examples  of alternative financing instruments are shown in Table 1.   Of  the  alternatives  financing  instruments  the  two  most common  alternative  financing  channels  are  peerto  peer (P2P)  lending  and  crowdfunding.  P2P  lending  or  social lending is the practice of matching borrowers and lenders via online  platforms.  Borrowers  are  generally  able  to  obtain funds quickly and typically at the same or lower interest rates than  traditional  financial  intermediaries.  Meanwhile  the crowdfunding model is the practice of raising small amounts of  money large  potentially geographically  distributed  a  pool  of  people  or  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccrowd." This  practice  is  typically  achieved  using  the  internet  as  an online  platform.  Crowdfunding  exists  in  different  forms based on the benefits afforded to funders. The most common types of crowdfunding are donation and equity crowdfunding. The  donation  crowdfunding  is  often  used  when  there  is  a need  to  raise  money  to  help  people  in  need\\xe2\\x80\\x93  wherein  the for  a  project from  a \\x0c14 Nasrul Hakim Ghazali and Takashi Yasuoka    Awareness and Perception Analysis of Small Medium Enterprise and Start  up    Towards FinTech Instruments  Crowdfunding and PeertoPeer Lending in Malaysia funder  receives  no  explicit  compensation  for  their  financial support.  The  Equity  Crowdfunding  model is  more straightforward and similar to traditional investment models. Funders  who  provide  financial  support  obtain  a  beneficial interest  in  the  form  of  a  shareholding  or  equity  in  the company  in  return  for  their  investment.  Alternative  finance funding undeniable channels  such  as  P2P  and  crowdfunding  are  potential  to generate growth opportunities  for  SMEs  and  startups.  However  they  also face  challenges  in  both  demand  and  supply  side  due  to limited awareness of their existence and an uncertain FinTech regulatory framework in many countries. support and Table 1.

Access to Financing In  the  recent  The  Global  Economic  Competitiveness Report 2017\\xe2\\x80\\x932018 published by The World Economic Forum (WEF)  on  26  September  2017  Malaysia  has  successfully moved up one place to the 23rd position from the 24th spot in the  20162017  report.  The  report  indicated  that  economy  of Malaysia  and  its  financial  market  development  had  grown steadily ever since the oil price crisis in 2011 and one of the most  competitive  emerging  economies  in  the  Asia  region. However  also  shown  in  the  report  was  that  one  of  the significant  challenges  for  Malaysia  to  increase  business activity in the country is the access to financing as illustrated in Figure 1 below. Realizing  the  fact  that  these  new  innovative  finance  of FinTech can benefit SMEs and startups in Malaysia as well as  the  disruptive  risk  it  brings  to  the  traditional  financial institution  the  Malaysian  Government  through  its  Central Bank of Malaysia has taken a positive approach to managing and adapting to the emerging risk emanating from these new solutions.  P2P  lending  and  Crowdfunding  which  are  part  of Fintech have been officially    recognized    by the Malaysian Access to Financing12.5Foreign Currency RegulationsInefficient  Government BureaucracyInflationTax RatesCorruptionInadequately  Educated WorkforceGovernment Instability  / CoupsPoor Work Etchic in National Labor ForceRestrictive  Labor Regulations9.28.98.57.97.47.06.46.15.9Source The Global Economic Competitiveness Report 20162017 World Economic Forum (2018) Figure 1.

Government  since  October  2016  through  the  introduction  of Fintech  Regulatory  Sandbox  Framework.  This  step  makes Malaysia become the first Asia Pacific nation to regulate for equity  crowdfunding  in  its  drive  to  develop  the  FinTech agenda.  Later  in  November  2016  Securities  Commission  of Malaysia  (SC)  announced  six  P2P  Financing  Operators  in Malaysia  to  widen  financing  options  for  small  and  medium enterprises (SMEs).     Apart  from  Malaysia  other  countries  such  as  United Kingdom (UK) Hong Kong and Singapore are also adopting regulatory  sandbox  to  provide  flexible  regulations  for  the FinTech  companies  to  test  their  innovative  product  and services.  However  the  regulatory  sandbox  in  Malaysia  is  a little bit different from the others. For example in Malaysia only  authorized  firms  with  a  track  records  can participate  in the  sandbox  while the  UK  both  authorized  and unauthorized firms may apply for the participation. in 2.2. Challenges in Alternative Financial Market As  mentioned  in  the  above  paragraph  this  new  forms  of innovative finance such as P2P lending and crowdfunding are supposed  to  increase  the  financing  options  available  to  the SMEs  and  startups.  However  there  are  challenges  from demandside  such  as  the  lack  of  financial  knowledge  or awareness  of  many  entrepreneurs  and  business  owners  on this  alternative  financing  instruments.  Most  of  them  are unaware of the existence of alternatives to bank lending and even if they are are often unable or unwilling to comply with the  requirements  of  professional  investors.  Consequently prevents  SMEs  and  startups the instruments that are most suited to their needs.   from  seeking  out 3. Research Objective   Given  the  importance  of  the  SMEs  to  the  growth  of  the economy of Malaysia and the recent development of FinTech market in Malaysia this study aims to measure the awareness and  perception  of  Malaysian  SMEs  and  startups  on  the existence  of  P2P  lending  and  crowdfunding  as  a  funding support for their business. In addition to that this study also aims  to  find  out  what  kind  of  factor  or  element  that  would increase  the  interest  of  SMEs  and  startups  in  utilizing instruments  available  in  FinTech  as  one  of  the  solutions  for their financial need. \\x0c16 Nasrul Hakim Ghazali and Takashi Yasuoka    Awareness and Perception Analysis of Small Medium Enterprise and Start  up    Towards FinTech Instruments  Crowdfunding and PeertoPeer Lending in Malaysia 4. Research Methodology 4.1. Literature Review Study  on  awareness  of  FinTech  has  been  carried  out  in many  countries  such  as  United  Kingdom  (UK)  Latvia Finland  and  many  more.  Saksonova  and  KuzminaMerlino\\xef\\xbc\\x882017\\xef\\xbc\\x89reported  that  consumers  were  unaware  of  FinTech services  in  Latvia  and  their  associated  innovations  and  new financial  product.  In  the  UK  Baeck  et  al.\\xef\\xbc\\x882014\\xef\\xbc\\x89  reported that  the  level  of  awareness  as  well  as  the  nuances  of perception  about  alternative  finance  among  consumers  and SMEs in the UK was very low. As for the countries in Asia no  specific  journal  was  found  on  the  survey  of  awareness particularly  between  SMEs  and  FinTech  in  each  country. However there was a report from Ernst and Young (2017) as shown  in  Table  2  regarding  FinTech  Adoption  Index  in  for Asia  countries  such  as  China  Japan  India  Singapore  and Hong  Kong  but  still  no  data  was  highlighted  for  Malaysia. As  there  is  a  limited  reference  to  the  awareness  survey  on FinTech in Asia Saksanova (2017) and Baeck et al.\\xef\\xbc\\x882014\\xef\\xbc\\x89 were  used  as  the  main  reference  in  this  study.  For  the construction  of  questionnaire  a  survey  by  the  World  Bank (2014)  on  the  provision  of  financial  services  in  particular financial  services  provided  to  small  and  medium  enterprises (SMEs) is taken as a reference. Apart from that the concept of AIDA Model regarding attention (awareness) interest and desire  (perception)  of  SMEs  and  startups  towards  FinTech service is also utilized during the construction of the survey. taken  as  a  reference  in  this  study.  Before  2000  the  Chinese financial  industry  was  lagging  behind  those  of  many  other countries  and  the  financial  infrastructure  was  insufficient and commercerelated fraud was commonplace (Yongowoon &  DongHee  2015).  However  since  the  establishment  of Alibaba in 1999 now is the largest ecommerce company in China  the  contribution  of  FinTech  to  the  growth  of  SMEs and economy of China has started to be noticed. In 2014 following the government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s approval a total of 250 companies in China received  a payment license including  90 for  online  payment  and  37  for  mobile  phone  payment  with Alibaba  as  the  frontrunner.  As  for  July  2015  China\'s peertopeer  (P2P)  lending  platforms  counted  2136  with settlements  of  about  RMB82.5  billion  transactions  in  that single  month  making  it  the  country  with  the  most  P2P platforms  in  the  world.  It  is  further  reported  the  platform  has delivered directly to the public and SMEs more than RMB251 billions of credit in 2014 (Douglas and Janos 2015). As cited by Asaba et al. (2016) based on China case study there  are  three  conditions  observed  to  be  important  as essential  success  factors  for  the  FinTech  industry  to  support the  growth  of  the  SMEs  the  digital  technology  adoption level  of  the  SMEs  the  financial  literacy  skills  and  the regulatory frameworks. A simple comparison study as shown in Table 3 on above factors was also done between China and Malaysia  to  see  the  readiness  of  FinTech  industry  in Malaysia in supporting SMEs and startups.

Survey Construction and AIDA Model A  total  of  28  questions  have  been  constructed  for  this survey. The questions in the survey were divided into 3 part Part A general questions Part B awarenessbased questions and  Part  C  perception  based  questions.  The  contents  of  the survey  are  presented in  Table  4.  The  objective  of awarenessbased  the  question  is  to  find  out  whether  the development  of  FinTech  has  caught  the  attention  of  SMEs and  startups  in  Malaysia.  As  for  the  perceptionbased question it was designed to find out the interest and desire of SMEs  and  startups  from  the  development  of  FinTech  in Malaysia.  These  questions  were  design  based  on  AIDA Model Framework (Attention Interest Desire and Action) as shown in Figure 5 below. Figure 5. AIDA Model Framework based Survey. Table 4.

Part B Awareness Based Questions 5.2.1. SMEs and Startups Experience in FinTech In  Q7  and  Q8  of  the  second  section  of  the  questionnaire the  respondents  were  asked  about  experience  in  using technological  innovation  in  FinTech  such  as  PayPal  and Crowdfunding.  The  results  indicate  that  a  majority  of respondents  did  not  have  experience  in  using  PayPal  and crowdfunding  as  summarized  in  a  mean  (m )  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  standard deviation (s ) chart (Figure 11). 5.2.2. FinTech Familiarity Among SMEs and Startups From the Q9 we found that 73.3% or 22 respondents were familiar  and  aware  of  the  recent  technological  development in  financial  system  such  as  online  money  transfer/payment (60%)  saving  or  online  banking  (6.7%)  investment  and  car insurance (3.3% respectively). While 26.7% or 8 respondents answered  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnone  of  the  above."  The  results  from  Q7Q9 show  that  most  of  the  respondents  have  limited  knowledge and  awareness  of  the  FinTech  services  provided  by  the nonbank financial institution. 5.2.3. Consideration on FinTech in the Future Also in the second section of the questionnaire respondents were  explicitly  asked  their  experience  in  using  P2P  lending and  crowdfunding  and  whether  they  would  consider  using these  new  instruments  in  the  future.  A  scale  from  one  to  five was  used  in  this  question  where  one  "I  do  not  want  to consider" and five "I do want to consider". As shown in above Table 3 descriptive analysis through SPSS software indicated that  a  majority  of  respondents  did  not  have  an  experience  on both P2P lending (a mean of 1.17) and crowdfunding (a mean of  1.27).  However  as  for  the  consideration  question  on utilizing P2P lending and crowdfunding in the future the result shows that most respondents are neutral to use P2P lending (a mean of 3.27) and crowdfunding (a mean of 3.13). Results are as  shown  in  Figure  12  (m  chart).  5.3.  Part  C  Perception Based Questions 5.3.1. Perception on Current Financing Services Provided by Banks In  the  third  section  of  the  questionnaire  respondents were  asked  their  opinion  and  perception  of  the  current services  provided  by  traditional  financing  specifically  the bank  lending.  Issues  listed  in  the  Table  6  were  identified from  various  sources  such  as  newspaper  articles  and journals  pertaining  issues  on  loan  services  rendered  by  the bank  to  the  SMEs  and  startups.  Based  on  the  multiple response data analysis through SPSS interest rates or price too  high  too  much  paperwork  is  involved  and  insufficient collateral  or  guarantee  when  borrowing  are  the  top  three issues  identified.  The  general  perception  of  respondents concerning  FinTech  (P2P  lending  crowdfunding  and  other instruments)  as  the  best  alternative  way  of  getting  their business  funded  was  ranked  on  a  scale  from  1  "Strongly Disagree"  to  5  "Strongly  Agree."  As  shown  in  Figure  13 (m  chart)  a  mean  of  3.63  is  obtained  showing  that  most people  agree  that  FinTech  is  the  best  alternative  way  to getting their business funded. Table 6.

Perception of SMEs and StartUps on Fintech as Alternative Financing As  shown  in  Figure  14  (m  chart)  respondents  were asked  what  kind  of  element  that  they  would  consider  when choosing  P2P  lending  or  crowdfunding  as  their  source  of financing. In this question six elements were prepared based on  the  quality  of  current  financial  services  and  were  ranked on  a  scale  from  1  "Strongly  Will  Not  Consider\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  to  5 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrongly  Will  Consider."  The  result  shows  that  element \\xe2\\x80\\x98Approved  by  the  Government\\xe2\\x80\\x99  is  the  most  considered element  with  a  mean  of  4.03  followed  by  Transparency  (a mean  of  3.87)  Convenience  (a  mean  of  3.83)  and  Security and Fraud Protection (a mean of 3.80).

Respondents\\xe2\\x80\\x99 Distribution in the Expectation of Fintech Development in Malaysia.  Apart from asking element of consideration when selecting FinTech  as  alternative  financing  respondents  were  also asked their expectation and hope from FinTech development in  Malaysia.  List  of  expectations  is  collected  from  a preliminary study which was conducted in July 2017 and was ranked on a scale from 1 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrongly Disagree\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to 5 \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStrongly Agree."  Most  of  the  respondents  with  a  mean  of  4.17  agree that  development  of  FinTech  would  further  stimulate business activities in Malaysia. Other than that a majority of respondents also expect that application to apply for this new alternative instrument would be eased (with a mean 3.90) and hoping  that  it  would  become  an  alternative  source  of financing  for  SMEs  and  startups  in  various  sectors  (with  a mean 3.90). Details of analysis results are shown in Figure 15 (m chart). 6. Conclusion One  year  after  the  introduction  of  Fintech  Regulatory Sandbox Framework in October 2016 by the Central Bank of Malaysia  and  approval  of  six  P2P  Financing  Operators (November  2016)  by  Securities  Commissions  in  Malaysia the  awareness  and  understanding  of  Malaysia  SMEs  and startups  on  the  existence  of  FinTech  (P2P  lending  and crowdfunding) were measured. 6.1. Awareness   In brief based on answers from Q7 to Q9 and from Figure 11  we  discovered  that  the  level  of  awareness  of  most respondents  is  still  very  limited  especially  on  P2P  lending crowdfunding as well as other FinTech services provided by nonbank financial institutions. 6.2. Perception and Expectation However based on the perception results from  Figure 12 and  13  a  majority  of  respondents  have  a  slightly  positive response and perception to the development of FinTech. This result  reflects  a  good  sign  regarding  the  acceptance  of  new financing  options  in  Malaysia.  Furthermore  the  finding  in Figure  14  suggests  that  new  alternative  financing  channels with  approval  from  the  Malaysia  Government  and  with proper  regulations  might  accelerate the  acceptance  of alternative  financing  instruments  in  Malaysia.  From  Figure 14  and  15  we  found  that  a  majority  of  the  respondents  are hoping  that  FinTech  would  be  the  best  alternative  financing option  apart  from  traditional  financing  avenue  and  FinTech development  would  further  stimulate  business  activities  in Malaysia soon. 6.3. Recommendations The finding suggests that The Malaysian Government and related  authorities  need  to  put  more  effort  not  only  in increasing  the  awareness  and  knowledge  of  SMEs  and startups  on  alternative  financing  instruments  but  also  how these alternatives can benefit  them to  move forward. One of the  efforts  which  can  be  made  is  to  further  increase  the financial  literacy  among  Malaysian  SMEs  and  startup especially  in  FinTech  as  this  financial  knowledge  would affect  in  increase  firm  total  sources  of  financing.  Besides there  were  also  evidences  that  show  a  positive  relationship between the entrepreneurs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 success and financial literacy. At  the  grassroots  level  especially  at  the  university  level Business  Model  Competition  (BMC)  based  upon  latest technology  is  proposed  to  be  organized  more  often  to increase  awareness  and  interest  of  young  people  in  FinTech and entrepreneurship. In terms of digital technology adoption among  SMEs  and  startups  there  is  a  need  and  proper initiatives to increase the level of technology adoption among SMEs and startups to a higher level and change the various aspects  of  business  practices  to  encourage  SMEs  to  move \\xe2\\x80\\x93s\\x0c International Journal of Finance and Banking Research 2018; 2018; 4(1) 1324 23  into the digital space. Other than that it is obvious that a level of confidence put by  most  SMEs  and  startups  on  the  financial  services provided  by  nonbanks  is  still  very  low.  Therefore  better promotion  and  guidance  through  mass  and  social  media should  frequently  be  implemented  by  authorized  bodies  to promote  the  potential  of  alternative  financial  option  in helping  and  supporting  SMEs  and  startups.
