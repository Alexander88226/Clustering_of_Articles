It  was  thought  that  this  situation  would  damage  the  EU  economy  since SMEs  which  are  known  to  be  the  most  important  source  of  growth  and employment  creation  in  the  EU  already  suffer  from  financing  problems. These  concerns  were  partially  assuaged  when  the  Basel  Committee introduced a more favourable treatment of SME portfolios under pillar 1 based  on  empirical  evidence  suggesting  that  SMEs  have  a  lower  default correlation  than  large  enterprises.  This  finding  in  turn  suggests  that  the lower the default correlation among SMEs the fewer the number of firms in this sector that are affected by the same macroeconomic factors and the more  the  default  is  related  to  idiosyncratic  or  firmspecific  risks. Nevertheless  the  more  risksensitive  pricing  introduced  by  the  internal ratingsbased  approaches  under  pillar  1  of  Basel  II  will  certainly  entail variation in capital adequacy depending upon the individual quality of the SME.  Indeed  a  poorquality  (lowrated)  SME  will  force  the  bank  to  hold more  regulatory  capital  compared  to  a  highquality  (highly  rated)  SME. This situation does not curtail loan financing for SMEs but it does make its availability conditional on the enterprise   s financial strength and ability to provide relevant quantitative and qualitative information.  This  study  discusses  the  main  characteristics  of  the  SME  sector  in Europe and provides an informative analysis about what Basel II means for SMEs and its impact on their credit financing conditions. It also presents a | i  ii | RYM AYADI detailed  analysis  of  how  banks  formulate  an  internal  rating  system  and illustrates how this system works in practice. Finally it concludes with the key  measures  that  should  be  taken  by  banks  SMEs  and  public  policymakers  to  improve  SME  financing  in  the  new  rating  culture.  The conclusions of the study are summarised below.  1.  The evolution of SME financing by banks Despite the slowdown of the overall growth rate in bank lending to SMEs in  the  past  few  years       reflecting  the  weak  economic  cycle  reduced demand  and  more  selective  lending       banks  in  Europe  seem  to  see  real growth opportunities in the SME lending sector. In parallel although SMEs have  access  to  a  variety  of  financing  sources  including  leasing  factoring and trade credit they rely heavily on bank financing. Nevertheless several constraints  continue  to  hinder  SME  financing  in  line  with  firms     natural growth cycle. According to banks the lack of equity the high credit risk the paucity of collateral and poor information about the firms constitute the main obstacles to granting finance to SMEs. Other constraints that play a role  in  the  assessment  of  loan  applications  such  as  poor  entrepreneurial capacity business performance and uncertain development prospects are felt to be equally important.  their them  and Today  bank  financing  requires  a  large  amount  of  financial  and strategic  information  that  ought  to  be  provided  by  SMEs  to  reduce  the information  deficit  between lenders.  Faced  with implementing the requirements of Basel II worldwide and the new Capital Requirements  Directive  (CRD)  in  the  EU  banks  are  expected  to  require even more and better quality information. The new regulatory rules have introduced more stringent requirements to counter the growing concern of risks at the EU and global levels. This step does not imply credit rationing. Instead it requires banks to view their business in a more sophisticated and risksensitive  manner. As  a  consequence  SMEs  need  to  understand  these regulatory  changes  as  they  will  impact  their  financing  conditions  to  a certain  degree       not  necessarily  by  reducing  their  credit  facilities  but  by rendering the whole process more risksensitive and contingent upon the individual quality of the borrowers.  2.  The future shape of decisionmaking for bank credit Banks derive a credit rating and thus the probability of default associated with the borrower through four stages    THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | iii i) ii) iii) iv) the gathering of historical quantitative and qualitative information;  an analysis of the individual factors;  the specification and estimation of the model; and the  determination  of  the  rating  and  the  associated  probability  of default.  In  the  first  stage  accurate  and  relevant  quantitative  and  qualitative data  are  collected.  The  quantitative  data  (mainly  extracted  from  financial statements)  include  performance  leverage  debt  coverage  liquidity growth productivity size and other macroeconomic and political factors as well as a detailed and precise business plan. The qualitative data include the profile of the enterprise the development prospects of the industry the reputation/experience/ability of the entrepreneur and his/her past credit history the ownership and governance structure the management quality of accounts receivable and the availability of collateral and guarantees etc.  These data are traditionally required when SMEs ask for loans under the current Basel regulation (the 1988 Accord). With the implementation of Basel II and the transposition of the CRD into national laws from the end of 2006  banks  will  ask  for  even  more  information.  This  information  must  be clear focused complete more structured and timely. The decision to grant credit will be highly conditional on the individual quality of the borrower.  Formally the new banking regulation will have more impact on the second  third  and  fourth  stages  of  deriving  a  rating.  Indeed  the information  submitted  will  be  interpreted  using  statistical  models  that extract  more  decisionrelevant  information  for  rating  and  probability  of default.  This  enhances  the  bank   s  ability  to  identify  potential  future defaults.  Crosssubsidisation  between  highquality  and  poorquality borrowers  will  no  longer  be  allowed.  In  addition  it  is  expected  that  the current trend towards collateralised lending as a means to mitigate credit risk and to allow the calculation of recovery rates is likely to rise. 3.  Practical effects of Basel II and the CRD on SME financing  The new banking capital rules will directly affect three components of the cost of credit to SMEs as follows      The administrative/operational costs resulting from processes to initiate and manage loan portfolios may increase owing to the use of more sophisticated require  a  greater investment in human resources and infrastructure (to undertake data  riskmanagement tools that  iv | RYM AYADI     collection  database  maintenance  and  adequate  modelling  for example).  The rules will also have an impact on the cost of risk composed of the cost of capital which is the opportunity cost resulting from the fact that banks need regulatory and risk capital to cover loan exposures. Finally there will be an effect on the risk premium which is linked to the probability of default of the borrower the exposure at default and the lossgiven default.  The  impact  of  the  new  banking  regulatory  rules  on  the  cost  of  risk and the risk premium is not straightforward since it will largely depend on the risk characteristics of the borrowers.     The more risksensitive pricing introduced by the new rules through the  internal  ratingsbased  approaches  will  entail  a  certain  variation  in capital  adequacy  which  is  ultimately  related  to  the  individual  quality  of the borrowers. A poorquality borrower will force its lender to hold more regulatory capital compared with a betterquality borrower but this does not reduce loan financing. 4.  The role of banks and the key success factors for a better financing relationship between banks and SMEs Enhanced transparency structured dialogue openness and communication are the cornerstones of an effective cooperation between banks and SMEs. These principles will ensure a successful financing relationship.  Banks should not hesitate to play their role and increase transparency with  their  customers  by  showing  them  how  ratings  impact  their  credit terms.  Communication  should  not  be  limited  to  the  reasons  for  not granting  bank  loans  or  withdrawing  existing  lines  of  credit.  Rather  it should  be  built  upon  mutual  trust  between  banks  and  SMEs.  Bank procedures  including  individual  rating  risk  assessment  and  factors  for downgrading or upgrading credit risk need to be more transparent to SMEs.  Disclosing  the  key  elements  of  the  risk  assessment  process  is necessary to allow loan applicants to understand bank decisions (rejection acceptance  improved  or  worsening  financing  conditions  etc.).  In  the meantime explaining the overall detailed riskassessment process should not create an extra burden for the bank since the extra cost of mobilising additional human resources could be passed on to the SMEs.    THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | v It  is  notable  however  that  as  the  application  of  different  internal rating methodologies (the foundation versus the advanced internal ratings approaches) will imply different ratings for the same quality of borrower the  disclosure  of  individual  ratings  to  loan  applicants  may  result  in  a competitive  disadvantage  for  those  banks  that  should  normally  be rewarded  for  their  use  of  the  most  sophisticated  internal  models  to  rate credit risk and detect potentially bad borrowers.  Although the key elements disclosed should be clearly defined it is not necessary at this stage to explicitly regulate the disclosure of ratings to loan  applicants.  A  nonlegislative  code  of  conduct  between  banks  and SMEs should suffice to  establish a framework that sets out the principles for ratingprocess disclosure for banking and SME associations.  5.  The  role  of  SMEs  and  the  practical  actions  they  can  take  to  improve  their financing conditions  The steps that SMEs need to take are obviously expected to be even greater than banks. SMEs need to be aware of the changing banking environment. Indeed this awareness will increase their ability to identify better financing options.  When  applying  for  a  loan  from  an  internal  ratingsbased  bank  an enterprise needs to signal its creditworthiness by providing clear focused complete  wellstructured  and timely  quantitative  and  qualitative information.  This  information  is  the  key  to  running  the  internal  ratings system properly. Companies that are wellmanaged adequately leveraged (equity  ratio)  and  that  provide  such  information  will  be  in  a  position  to obtain a good rating and consequently better credit conditions.  In practice SMEs must     provide timely relevant and precise financial data and demonstrate financial  performance  needed  by  lenders  to  assign  yearly  ratings. Delayed submission of financial and performance data is seen to be a warning  signal  by  many  banks     internal  rating  systems.  It  usually leads  to  a  downgrading  of  creditworthiness  and  therefore  price increases in loan offers or the refusal of new loans;  improve the factors that are considered to be important in the ratings process such as o  cashflow stabilisation and generation; o  company accounting control and management methods;        vi | RYM AYADI o the  equity  base  by  giving  preference  to  retained  earnings  over distributed profits;  o  consolidation of the business development strategy;  o  strategic thinking among managers in terms of business prospects and market/sector/activity analyses; o  external communications with stakeholders;  o  provision of adequate guarantees and collaterals;  o  attention  given  to  some  aspects  of  the  business  that  may  have been neglected so far;         o  establishment of recovery procedures in case of distress scenarios; take more active measures to increase equity finance; and  consider  alternative  financing  sources  to  banks  such  as  leasing factoring or other means that could offer a good response to SMEs.  6.  The role of public policymakers to intervene when necessary It is important to continue improving the relationship between banks and SMEs  in  terms  of  a  better  rating  culture  by  developing  a  nonlegislative framework that sets out the principles to define the minimum criteria for ratings disclosure. Moreover since a stronger equity base is an indicator of better  creditworthiness  it  is  important  to  ensure  greater  access  to  equity finance and to offer more tax incentives to use retained earnings to increase the  equity  base.  Finally  the  legislative  efforts  to  combat  habitual  late payments and thus stabilise cash flows should continue and be reinforced.          INTRODUCTION It is widely accepted that the SME sector plays a central role in promoting employment  growth  and  innovation  in  Europe.  Therefore  it  is  very important to ensure that financing conditions for SMEs are not overly tight because  of  more  stringent  capital  rules  particularly  when  they  already have difficulties in accessing finance in capital markets given their limited size and reputation.  SMEs in a number of EU countries have expressed concerns about the likely  impact  that  the  European  version  of  the  new  Basel  Capital  Accord (Basel  II)  and  the  Capital  Requirements  Directive  (CRD)  could  have  on their  access  to  credit  and  the  related  costs  that  this  may  entail.  In  this context  it  is  useful  to  start  with  a  brief  history  of  the  treatment  of  SME financing under Basel II.  In  July  2002  the  Basel  Committee  agreed  to  grant  loans  to  SMEs under  a  special  and  more  favourable  treatment  framework.  According  to the current Basel II and CRD proposals SME funding by the banks using either  the  standardised  or  internal  ratingsbased  (IRB)  approach  will  in general be given a lower capital requirement than loans to larger firms. The capital savings which may be as high as 20% result from the application of a reduction mechanism (discount factor) that corrects the asset risk weights on  the  basis  of  the  borrower   s  size.1  By  allowing  this  special  regime  the Basel Committee finally put an end to the long and heated debate that had flared  up  particularly  across  Europe  after  the  release  of  the  second consultation paper in January 2001.                                                        1 The firmsize adjustment factor is an algorithm that modifies the asset correlation in reverse proportion to the SME   s size. | 1  2 | RYM AYADI In  theory  the  SMEs     concerns  should  have  disappeared  after  they were  accorded  this  preferential  regulatory  capital  treatment.  In  practice however  the  new  Capital  Accord  has  introduced  a  very  riskselective approach indeed the more risk a borrower entails the higher the capital charge will be. In other words an SME that has a good business plan but inadequate  equity  and  volatile  cashflows  will  accrue  a  higher  cost  of credit. These  concerns  still  have  some  foundation  as  little  is  known  about the  immediate  implications  of  new  regulations  when  they  are  first introduced.  These  concerns  may  be  alleviated  however  by  becoming informed about the new regulation its likely implications and the way in which  banks  will  use to  assess  SME creditworthiness.  rating  systems internal This  study  discusses  the  main  characteristics  of  the  SME  sector  in Europe and provides an analysis of what Basel II means for SMEs and its impact on their credit financing conditions. It also presents a detailed look at how banks formulate an internal rating system and illustrates how this system works in practice. Finally it concludes with the key measures that should be taken by banks SMEs and public policymakers to improve SME financing in the new rating culture. Some recommendations are also given in the course of the analysis not only for SMEs to accommodate the new rating  culture  but  also  addressed  to  the  competent  authorities  to  ensure that  the  new  rules  do  not  jeopardise  the  SME  sector  and  in  turn  the European economy.  1.  An overview of the SME sector in Europe  SMEs play a key role in the European economy they are an essential source of  jobs  and  they  foster  innovation  and  growth.  Therefore  it  is  crucial  to ensure  that  they  have  access  to  credit.  Several  financing  sources  are available  to  them  but  banking  credit  has  traditionally  been  and  will continue  to  be  the  chief  source  of  their  funding.  Nevertheless  SMEs continue to suffer from a position of weakness when applying for a loan. 1.1  A European definition of an SME In  1990  the  European  Commission  began  to  develop  an  EU  definition  of SME.  The  demand  for  a  harmonised  definition  was  initiated  by  the Industry Council to  overcome the limitations of varying  SME definitions   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 3 that had been used in the past. The Commission   s definition was released in May 2003 and took effect in January 2005. It is based on four criteria as outlined below (see also Table 1).  1) Staff  headcounts  or  number  of  employees  which  are  established  in annual work units (AWU). Anyone who worked fulltime within the enterprise or on its behalf during the entire reference year counts as one  unit.  Parttime  staff  seasonal  workers  and  those  who  did  not work the full year are treated as parttime staff i.e. as fractions of one unit. The staff headcounts cover      employees;       other persons working for the enterprise who are subordinate to it and considered to be employees under national law;       ownermanagers;       partners  who  are  engaged  in  a  regular  activity  in  the  enterprise and who benefit from financial advantages arising from it. 4) 3) 2)  Annual turnover which is determined by calculating the income that the enterprise earned during the year in question from its sales and services  after  any  rebates  have  been  paid  out.  Turnover  should  not include value added taxes (VAT) or other indirect taxes. Balance  sheet  total  along  with  reference  to  the  value  of  the company   s assets. Independence  which is  another  criterion  to  complement  the definition  of  an  independent  (autonomous)  or  partner  or  linked micro small or mediumsized enterprise. This is defined in terms of capital  and  voting  rights.  An  enterprise  is  considered  to  be independent when the influence of a single shareholder is limited. It is  also  considered  independent  if  it  has  no  participation  in  other enterprises  and  no  enterprise  has  participation  in  it  or  if  the enterprise  has  a  holding  of  less  than  25%  of  the  capital  or  voting rights in one or more other enterprises and/or outsiders do not have a  stake  of  more  than  25%  of  the  capital  or  voting  rights  in  it.  This criterion permits calculations in the cases of independent partner or linked enterprises and will ultimately determine whether or not the enterprise in question meets the various thresholds established in the SME definition.2                                                       2 For more details see European Commission (2005a).    4 | RYM AYADI Table 1. EU definition of an SME Category Staff headcounts (annual work units     AWU) Annual  turnover Micro Small  Mediumsized Source European Commission (2003c). <10 <50 <250     2 million     10 million     50 million Annual balance sheet total       2 million     10 million     43 million Independence Given by <25% of capital shares held by a third party An enterprise should compare its data with the thresholds introduced in the four criteria to enable it to identify itself among one of the three subcategories  in  the  SME  sector  micro  small  or  mediumsized.3  As  Table  1 shows  micro  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  consist  of  those  that employ  fewer  than  250  persons  and  have  either  an  annual  turnover  not exceeding     50  million  or  an  annual  balancesheet  total  not  exceeding     43 million.  Under  the  established  categories  mediumsized  enterprises  are defined as those that employ more than 50 but fewer than 250 persons and whose annual turnover is more than    10 million but less than or equal to    50  million  or  whose  annual  balancesheet  total  is  more  than     10  million but does not exceed    43 million. Small enterprises are defined as those that employ  fewer  than  50  persons  and  whose  annual  turnover  or  annual balancesheet  total  does  not  exceed     10  million.  Microenterprises  are defined  as  those  that  employ  fewer  than  10  persons  and  whose  annual turnover or annual balancesheet total does not exceed    2 million.  It is important to note that while it is compulsory to respect the staff headcount thresholds an SME may choose to meet either the turnover or balancesheet ceiling. It does not need to satisfy both and may exceed one of them without losing its status.                                                        3 If the enterprise exceeds the headcounts or financial thresholds during the course of the reference year its status will not be affected. The enterprise will retain the SME status with which it began that year. It will lose the status however if it goes above  the  thresholds  over  two  consecutive  accounting  periods.  Conversely  an enterprise  could gain SME  status  if it  was  previously a  large  enterprise  but  falls below the thresholds for two consecutive accounting periods.      THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 5 1.2  The importance of the SME sector in Europe  SMEs  play  a  central  role  in  employment  in  Europe.  According  to  the Observatory  of  European  SMEs4  (European  Commission  2002  and  2003) SMEs account for 99% of all companies and provide jobs for more than 90 million  persons  in  the  EU195  accounting  for  about  twothirds  of  total employment (Table 2). Among SMEs the major share of jobs is in microenterprises  which  employ  fewer  than  10  employees.  This  trend  has continued since 2000 (see Table 3).  Nevertheless the size of companies measured in terms of the average number  of  employees  differs  considerably  among  countries.  Table  3 provides an indication of the dominant size class of firms by country in the EU in 2003. The average company size seems to be very small particularly in southern Mediterranean countries such as Greece and Italy. This reflects the  large  percentage  of  small  familyowned  firms  in  these  countries.  By contrast  Austria  Ireland  Luxembourg  and  the  Netherlands  have  the largest average number of employees per firm.  Table 2.

According to the ENSR7 surveys conducted for the European Observatory of SMEs in 20028 among 7669 SMEs in 19 European countries the  lack  of  skilled  labour  and  poor  access  to  finance  are  major  problems. The same survey in 2003 showed that the paucity of customer purchasing power  has  also  put  the  brake  on  SME  business  growth  alongside  the constraints  listed  in  2002.  While  the  low  level  of  customer  purchasing power  is  a  direct  result  of  the  unfavourable  economic  climate  the  core issues of access to skilled labour and finance are persistent factors.

At  country  level  business  services  are  particularly  relevant  in Sweden  (more  than  30%  of  SMEs)  as  well  as  in  the  Netherlands Luxembourg and Germany (more than 20%). Retail trade is important for SMEs in Greece (about 50%) Portugal (30%) Belgium and Spain (more than 20%) (see Table 5). 1.3  Sources of SME financing  Financing an SME generally depends on its sector of activity and its growth cycle.9 In order to grow a firm needs to be able to rely on equity and debt. Thus  SMEs  have  a  financial  growth  cycle  in  which  financial  needs  and options change as the business grows and becomes more transparent.  Figure 1 shows this cycle in a stylised fashion whereby firms lie on a size/age/information continuum. It seeks to give a general idea of which sources  of  finance  become  important  at  different  stages  in  the  financial growth cycle and the points in the cycle at which different types of funding are shown to begin and end.  At  the  beginning  of  the  growth  cycle  the  financing  of  smaller  and younger firms is heavily dependent on initial insider finance (equity) and external investors through for example angel financing.10 (At this stage these firms are an unknown quantity because they do not yet have a track record  and  therefore  have  much  difficulty  in  accessing  intermediated external finance.) Insider finance or equity is defined as funds provided by the  startup  team  family  or  friends  prior  to  and  at  the  time  of  the  firm   s inception.  Angel  financing  is  an  informal  nonintermediated  market  for direct  finance  where     angels     who  are  by  definition  high  networth individuals invest directly in small companies through an equity contract typically  common  stock.  Angels  sometimes  work  as  a  small  investment group  in  which  they  coordinate  their  investment  activities.11  Sometimes this is done in conjunction with lawyers and accountants who bring deal flair to the group and help structure the contracts.                                                       9 See Berger & Udell (1998). 10 See Sahlman (1990) and Wetzel (1994). 11 See Prowse (1998).   10 | RYM AYADI Figure 1.

THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 11 As  firms  grow  they  gain  access  to  intermediated  finance  on  the equity  side  through  venture  capital  for  example  and  on  the  debt  side through  financial  institutions  and  supplier  credit.  Venture  capital  (and trade  credit)  could  typically  come  after  the  product  or  service  has  been successfully  tested  by  the  market  and  may  be  used  to  finance  fullscale marketing and production. Eventually if the firms survive and grow they may access public equity and debt markets.  Trade (or supplier) credit is the credit the supplier gives to his client in a businesstobusiness relationship. Instead of paying for the goods and services rapidly in cash the firm makes delayed payments to its suppliers which creates the equivalent of a loan from the suppliers to the firm. The use  of  supplier  credit  depends  on  the  length  of  payment  period  the availability of the supplier   s own funds and also access to bank loans.  Suppliers  are  generally  reluctant  to  grant  trade  credit  to  startups because of the lack of information about the firm and the higher probability of default. When companies grow and show stable cashflows trade credit becomes a viable and frequently used source of financing.  As firms continue to grow and achieve a level of production whereby their balance sheets reflect substantial tangible business assets that could be  pledged  as  collaterals  and  guarantees  they  can  tap  other  sources  to obtain  debt  financing.  Commercial  cooperative  and  savings  banks specialised  finance  companies  and  other  financial  institutions  together provide most of the external debt finance. Financial institutions provide two types of credit to SMEs i) credit cards and credit lines12 and ii) mortgage loans13 equipment loans motor vehicle  loans  capital  leases14  and  other  types  of  loans.  The  former  are typically used to finance working capital needs and are often collateralised by  assets  unrelated  to  the  use  of  the  credit  line.  Indeed  they  could  be guaranteed  by  one  or  more  insider  owners  which  gives  the  financial                                                       12  The  credit  lines  represent  a  loan  commitment  by  the  financial  institution  to provide future credit (these commitments may include shortterm credit including overdrafts and longterm credit).  13 Mortgages include both commercial and residential mortgages if the funds were used for business purposes. They may be secured by either commercial property or the personal property of the owner. 14 For most equipment loans motor vehicle loans and capital leases the proceeds of the loan or lease are used to purchase the assets pledged as collateral.   12 | RYM AYADI institution the possibility of recourse to the personal wealth of the owners in the event the loan is not repaid. In many cases the personal assets of the owners are explicitly pledged as collateral to back the loans (see Box 1). The latter are typically used to finance specific assets and are collateralised by the  assets  being  financed  (commonly  known  as     assetbased  financing   ) such as accounts receivable inventory and equipment.  Box 1. Differences between collaterals and guarantees Collaterals  and  guarantees  are  powerful  tools  that  allow  the  financial institutions to offer credit on favourable terms (since the collateral itself reduces the  risk  of  the  loan)  and  also  to  proceed  to  recovery  in  the  event  that  the borrower is defaulting on his or her payments. Indeed providing collateral or a guarantee is not only a pledge against default for the financial institution but it is also a tool to reduce the informational opacity of small businesses. The lack of information  might  result  in  credit  rationing  or  the  extension  of  credit  only  on relatively unfavourable terms.  There  are  two  types  of  collateral  the  collateral  that  involves  pledged assets  owned  by  the  firms  (these  may  include  accounts  receivable  and/or inventory  referred  to  as     assetbased  lending   )  and  the  collateral  that  involve pledging assets owned outside the firm typically assets belonging to the firm   s owners. The monitoring of receivables and inventory may also produce valuable information about a firm   s future performance as well as information about the value of the collateral which can be used as part of an overall relationship that may lead to more favourable credit terms in the future. Guarantees  give  the  lender  general  recourse  against  the  assets  of  the principle owner or other party issuing the guarantee. A guarantee is similar to a pledge of outside personal collateral but it differs in two important ways. First it is a broader claim than the pledge of personal collateral since the liability of the guarantor is not limited to any specific asset. Second a guarantee is a weaker claim than a pledge of collateral against any given set of assets since a guarantee does  not  involve  specific  terms  that  prevent  these  assets  from  being  sold  or consumed.  Specialised finance companies also play a key role in providing debt financing to SMEs.  Leasing  involves  a  lease  contract  i.e.  an  agreement  between  the owner of the asset    the lessor    and the user of the asset the    lessee    which conveys  to  the  user  the  right  to  use  the  asset  in  return  for  a  number  of specified payments over the agreed period of time. Leasing is simply a way   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 13 of acquiring an asset without paying cash taking out a loan or using other forms of financing. For many SMEs leasing is attractive because it frees up cash  that  would  otherwise  be  tied  up  in  fixed  assets  and  would  not  be available to finance working capital. Moreover leasing companies usually do not require collateral. Hence in an environment where access to capital may be difficult owing to a lack of financial visibility and collateral leasing may  provide  a  useful  complement  or  substitute  to  traditional  bank financing.  Factoring  involves  the  purchase  (at  a  discount)  of  the  accounts receivable15 of a firm by a third party (known as a    factor   ). In the case of factoring the underlying asset is sold to the factor which means that in the event  the  borrower  becomes  insolvent  the  underlying  asset  (the  factored accounts  receivable)  is  not  part  of  the  bankrupted  estate.  Obviously  in  a factoring  relationship  the  credit  is  primarily  based  on  the  quality  of  the underlying accounts not the quality of the borrower.  Financial  institutions  and  other  finance  intermediaries  often  put considerable  weight  on  the  financial  conditions  and  reputations  of  the insiderowners  and  also  on  the  relationship  they  have  with  them  when making  any  investment  decision.  Generally  the  creditworthiness  of  the enterprise  or  the  entrepreneur  is  easily  evaluated  using  modern  creditcoring  techniques  when  a  long  credit  history  pledgeable  assets  and personal data are available. 1.4  Use and structure of SME financing in Europe A  higher  equity  share  within  an  SME  could  reduce  the  risk  of  an investment  and  provide  a  firm  with  wider  access  to  external  finance. According  to  the  European  Commission16  among  the  different  external financing sources those most frequently used are overdrafts bank loans leasing  and  factoring.  Other  sources  include  external  investors  and subventions. Nevertheless the majority of European SMEs depend strongly on bank financing (through bank loans and overdrafts).  The availability of equity to SMEs varies among European countries and  among  the  different  firm  sizes  (Table  6).  In  some  countries  such  as Germany  Italy  and  Austria  SMEs  rely  much  less  on  their  own  capital                                                       15 That is the sale payments due from customers.  16 European Commission (2001).   14 | RYM AYADI to  differences while  in  France  Belgium  Spain  and  Portugal  the  share  of  equity  in  the total balance sheet ranges between 39% and 42%. These differences can be attributed legal frameworks  (including  the  minimum  equity  requirements  for  some companies such as startups). History and culture play an important role especially in the case of family ownership and reputation in some specific activities.  financial  systems  and taxation in Austria  Belgium  France  Germany Table 6.

Although they are more  expensive  than  bank  loans  they  are  often  preferred  by  enterprises because  of  their  higher  flexibility.17  Banks  typically  charge  820%  for overdrafts when there is an explicit agreement on the threshold. This rate could jump even higher when exceeding the agreed amount.   Bank  loans  have  longer  maturity  and  their  charges  depend  on  the interest  rates.  The  environment  of  low  interest  rates  and  inflation experienced over the past few years in the economic and monetary union (EMU) have brought down the rates for bank loans. This means that SMEs can obtain medium and longterm bank loans at rates that vary between 57% (which is 34% above the interbank rates).18 In  terms  of  banking  relationships  in  several  member  states  such  as Austria  and  Germany  enterprises  have  traditionally  relied  on  a  close relationship  with  one  local  bank  (the  Hausbank)  which  covers  relatively small credit amounts (<   100000) and is willing to lend even when business                                                       17 European Commission (2001). 18  In  May  2005  the  oneyear  interbank  rates  in  the  euro  area  (the  EuriborEuro Interbank Offered Rate) were at their lowest level (almost 2%) since the beginning of the 1990s.    THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 15 conditions are difficult. As shown by the ENSR survey19 (2002) (see Table 7)  52%  of  the  microenterprises  rely  on  one  bank  but  onethird  of  the mediumsized enterprises also have a relationship with only one bank. At a country level Denmark (with approximately 90%) and Norway (with 80%) show  the  highest  percentages  of  SMEs  having  credit  lines  with  only  one bank.  By  contrast  in  several  southern  European  countries  SMEs  tend  to have credit lines with several banks. In Spain for example only about onethird  of  the  SMEs  have  credit  lines  with  one  bank  which  is  similar  to Greece (37%) and Italy (38%).  Table 7.

Finally with regard to the maturity period of their loans most of the SMEs    largest bank loans have a maturity period of over three years.  As  Table  8  shows  the  focus  on  shortterm  financing  is  most pronounced in the wholesale sector whereas loans of five years and more are frequently used in the personal services sector.  With respect to alternative financing sources to bank loans the use of leasing seems to be increasing in Europe. It is most often used to acquire goods  with  a  substantial  secondhand  value  (such  as  cars  real  estate machinery  etc.).  The  main  disadvantage  of  leasing  is  that  the     effective    interest rate is usually higher compared with bank loans. Still leasing is an interesting source of funding especially for SMEs and enterprises that have low revenues but high growth opportunities. In the EU leasing rose in 2001                                                       19 European Commission (2003).   16 | RYM AYADI by  about  8.5%  compared  with  2000       in  real  terms  this  equates  to     193 billion.20 In many countries leasing seems to be used particularly by fastgrowing SMEs (especially those in Belgium Finland Ireland and Spain).

Whereas it is estimated that 32% of SMEs in France use factoring it is hardly ever used in Sweden (only 3%).22 Factoring is considered to be more suitable for small enterprises and on average 50% of the total number of European factoring companies    clients have an annual turnover of less than    2 million with 91% having less than    15 million.23 Despite the fact that  it  has  been  used  for  nearly  40  years  the  average  penetration  rate  of factoring is relatively low (only 11%). The low penetration rate of factoring can be readily confirmed when looking at the World Bank   s World Factoring Yearbook     2003.24 When measuring the relative importance of factoring to GDP the factoring rate did not reach 5.4% in Europe25 in 2002.                                                        20 See Leaseurope (2002).  21 The survey was based on 4400 replies from a sample of 42400 enterprises.  22 See the European Business Survey by Grant Thornton (2001).  23 Greater London Enterprise Ltd.

THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 17 Finally  the  use  of  trade  credit  has  been  growing  among  European SMEs (see Table 9). In a survey26 conducted by Intrum Justitia (2005) trade credit  was  ranked as  the  primary  financing  source  above  bank  and  other debt financing. Indeed for a considerable number of SMEs trade credit is a more important source of working capital than bank loans.  Table 9.

Trade credit is easily accessible even under conditions of slow growth or  recession  when  banks  become  more  reluctant  to  lend.  The  charges involved  in  this  form  of  financing  include  the  financing  cost  and  a  risk premium. Frequently a cash discount for immediate payment is offered by the supplier which if not used by the client constitutes an additional cost. Further many SMEs are not able to pay their suppliers on time before they are paid by their customers owing to liquidity constraints. The same survey confirmed that a large proportion of companies are forced to pay invoices later because they are not able to generate sufficient cashflow.                                                        26 The survey was conducted in 23 European countries in February 2005. More than 6500 companies took part in the survey.    18 | RYM AYADI Not  surprisingly  the  amounts  owed  to  trade  creditors  are  larger  in countries with longer payment periods27 (Table 10). The effective payment periods differ by country for example in 2002 it took on average 87 days before payment was made in Italy (corresponding to a delay of 21 days) whereas in Sweden firms collect their debts within an average of 34 days (corresponding to a delay of only 8 days). This trend is confirmed by the Intrum  Justitia  survey  (2005)  which  revealed  that  invoices  in  the  Nordic countries are generally paid with a delay of one week with respect to the agreed terms while in southern countries such as Italy and Spain delays average  between  two  and  three  weeks       with  the  notable  exception  of Portugal  where  payments  are  made  up  to  five  weeks  after  the  due  date. The  same  survey  in  2005  showed  an  overall  increase  of  the  average payment duration to 57.4 days in 2004 as compared with 56.2 days in 2003. Table 10.

The difference  between  the  contractual  or  target  payment  period  and  the  effective period is the payment delay (late payments). In other words suppliers offer their customers a payment delay but the latter do not always pay on time; therefore they automatically obtain extra credit.

Hence the strong reliance on loan finance  implies  an  equally  strong  need  for  collateral  to  secure  access  to loans for healthy businesses. 1.5  The main constraints to SME financing by banks Traditionally  SMEs  seem  to  have  suffered  problems  when  looking  for external  financing.  For  them  the  cost  of  borrowing  (interest  rates  and charges) is an important issue. Despite the steady decline of interest rates in the euro area during the past few years external finance tends to be more expensive for smaller firms than for large ones as the fixed costs of lending (administrative  costs  the  cost  of  collecting  information  and  the  risk premium) are not proportional to the size of the loan. 28                                                        28 See Wagenvoort (2003c).   20 | RYM AYADI According  to  the  2002  ENSR  survey  36%  of  the  respondents  were dissatisfied with their banks because they considered the interest rates to be too high 51% of them thought that bank charges were far too high and 59% were dissatisfied with their bank   s services.29  Some  experts30  attribute  the  high  lending  costs  to  a  lack  of competition  among  lenders  in  certain  regions  which  enables  them  to charge  interest  rates  that  are  in  excess  of  what  the  underlying  credit  risk requires.  Small  businesses  are  usually  dependent  on  small  local  banks because of their local knowledge and experience which in turn strengthens the  bankfirm  relationship  and  contributes  to  reducing  information asymmetry;  but  on  the  other  hand  this  tends  to  create  market  power allowing a possible extraction of the surplus from SMEs. To  illustrate  the  financing  constraints  facing  SMEs  the  results  of  a survey  undertaken  by  the  European  Observatory  of  SMEs  (European Commission  2003)31  indicate  that  about  30%  of  firms  with  fewer  than  50 employees  felt  that  access  to  finance  was  the  major  constraint  to  the development of their business (Figure 2).  In terms of the business growth cycle there are also variations among companies at different points in their development as to how much bank credit is perceived as the main obstacle to their growth (see Table 12). The  availability  of  bank  financing  is  also  contingent  on  the  growth rate of bank lending in relation to the overall business cycle and also to the bank   s lending approach.                                                         29  Efforts  have  been  undertaken  however  by  some  countries  such  as  Ireland  to improve  the  bankclient  relationship.  Indeed  the  enterprise  support  unit  of  the Bank of Ireland introduced a relationshipmanagement approach to the benefit of both  the  bank  and  their  clients.  This  approach  is  complemented  by  a  range  of financial and advisory services geared to the particular circumstances of startups and developing enterprises and also includes    firststep    loans which are interestfree for a threeyear period (European Commission 2003). 30  See  Berger  et  al.

This trend was not however indicative of banks refusing to grant credit to SMEs but rather evidence of a more cautious lending approach as banks  sought  higher  profitability  and  to  meet  greater  riskmanagement requirements. On the contrary the EIB survey (2003) of some 70 European banks showed an increase of credit volumes to consumers and businesses during  the  period  200002.  Similarly  another  survey  conducted  by   22 | RYM AYADI McKinsey  &  Company  for  the  European  Commission  (2005c)  (hereafter referred to as    the McKinsey & Co. survey   ) shows that banks view the SME credit  business  as  a  core  element  of  their  portfolio  and  want  to  increase their growth in this sector.32  Looking  at  the  reasons  that  impede  lending  to  small  and  mediumsized firms (Figure 3) those banks interviewed by the EIB survey identified four obstacles ranked by their level of relevance  1) 2) 3) 4) lack of equity in the client   s firm  high credit risk availability of adequate collateral and  poor information on the client   s firm.  As  shown  in  Figure  3  there  are  striking  differences  among  the obstacles identified in relation to the development of bank lending to firms of  varying  sizes.  For  example  the  lack  of  equity  company  risk  and available collateral are the main problems for SME financing whereas low expected profitability is the main brake on financing for large firms. Each of these issues is examined below.  Figure 3.

The  participating  banks  cover  39%  of  European  banking  assets.  For more details see European Commission (2005b).   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 23 Lack of equity. As discussed in the previous section the average rate of equity financing is usually low in Europe owing to the longanchored loan  financing  tradition.  The  availability  of  equity  in  SMEs  varies  among countries and depends on the SME   s size. As previously noted in Table 6 equity  shares  vary  between  13%  and  51%  in  Europe.  In  France  Belgium and  Portugal  for  example  equity  financing  is  more  prevalent  but  still  it represents onethird of the total balance sheet. This variation is primarily a result of heterogeneous tax laws among the member states which may be more favourable in some countries such as Belgium33 and less favourable in others such as Germany.  High  credit  risk.  When  launching  a  new  business  or  an  innovative project the entrepreneur is normally better informed about the project risks than those financing it. This may prevent lenders from observing the real nature  of  the  borrower  or  influencing  the  borrower   s  strategic  behaviour after the credit is released. As a result the lender could voluntarily raise the risk premium on loans (see Annex 1) to properly manage its risks34 which translates  into  higher  interest  rates  for  borrowers.  This  situation  may trigger an adverseselection effect that encourages riskier behaviour owing to  the  moral  hazard  principle  which  in  turn  enhances  the  probability  of default  and  may  encourage  credit  rationing.  Indeed  the  borrower  may suffer  from  credit  rationing  as  they  may  not  be  able  to  obtain  as  much credit as they want even though they are willing to pay the interest rate set by their lenders or meet extra conditions to ensure their solvability.35  In  view  of  the  upcoming  regulatory  changes  for  European  banks (Basel II and the CRD) the proper management of credit risk will be even more  important  than  it  is  today.  Hence  banks  will  rely  on  more sophisticated  riskmanagement  techniques  and  extensive  information  on                                                       33  It  is  commonly  known  that  tax  regimes  in  the  UK  and  Ireland  are  more favourable to the establishment of SMEs but no data on the average rate of equity financing were available.  34  Governments  in  many  countries  are  aware  of  the  negative  effect  that  credit rationing  has  on  SME  growth  and  have  undertaken  initiatives  to  address  the perceived  funding  gap  in  their  national  economies.  These  include  investing  in loans  and  equity  guarantee  schemes  venture  capital  trusts  grants  equity investments and other programmes. 35  The  theoretical  literature  on  credit  rationing  as  a  result  of  asymmetric information was initiated by Stiglitz & Weiss (1981).   24 | RYM AYADI the  borrower  to  derive  the  probabilities  of  default  and  other  risk parameters.  Availability  of  adequate  collateral.  A  bank  is  inclined  to  ask  for collateral  to  reduce  the  loan  loss  in  the  event  of  default.  For  an  SME however  providing  collateral  is  not  always  an  easy  task36  especially  the type that protects the lender for the amount of risk taken.37 This situation may  explain  why  23%  (and  34%)  of  those  SMEs  employing  between  09 employees and between 1049 employees respectively are not able to access bank loans according to the ENSR survey (2002).  larger  ones  as  they  face Informational  opacity.  Small  firms  are  considered  to  be  more vulnerable  than less  rigorous  reporting requirements  owing  to  their  age  and  their  short  credit  history.  Indeed unlike larger firms small firms do not enter into contracts that are publicly visible and widely reported in the press     contracts with their labour force their suppliers and their customers are generally kept private. In addition small businesses do not issue traded securities that are continuously priced in public markets. Nor do they have audited financial statements that can be  shared  with  any  provider  of  outside  finance.  Some  familyowned businesses  for  example  are  very  reluctant  to  report  strategic  (sometimes considered  to  be  confidential)  information  such  as  business  structure growth opportunities strategic orientation and even ownership structure. As a result small firms are often unable to convey their status in a credible way  and  have  more  difficulty  building  a  reputation  to  signal  their  high quality  as  a  borrower.  The  inherent  characteristics  (and  weaknesses)  of SMEs  in  terms  of  size  and  limited  access  to  capital  markets  feed  their informational opacity which may prevent easy access to sources of finance and in some cases makes financial contracting problematic.                                                       36 It is necessary to define what kinds of assets are acceptable collateral from the bank   s  point  of  view.  The  most  common  form  of  collateral  is  real  estate  (either owned  by  the  business  or  privately  owned  by  the  entrepreneur).  It  may  also happen that SMEs assign private or personal savings books to banks as collateral. Other assets such as accounts receivable inventories or fixed assets could serve as collateral if they fulfil specific conditions.   37  SMEs  generally  lack  sufficient  collateral.  Yet  even  if  collateral  is  available  an economic  slowdown  may  have  a  negative  effect  on  its  value  (European Commission 2001).   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 25 According  to  the  Observatory  of  European  SMEs  (European Commission 2003) the availability of information is a basic condition for granting  loans  to  small  and  mediumsized  enterprises.  But  the  evidence shows  that  banks  only  receive  balance  sheets  and  the  profit  and  loss accounts  from  about  twothirds  of  their  SME  clients.  More  sophisticated documents  such  as  budgets  for  the  next  few  years  financial  plans  cashflow  forecasts  information  on  inventories  unpaid  invoices  or  qualitative information  are  seldom  provided.  Generally  the  provision  of  all  the information required is a perquisite to extend a loan or an overdraft.  Yet some improvements in the information flow have been observed in  comparison  with  a  few  years  ago.  SMEs  are  becoming  more  proactive and  they  more  readily  deliver  their financial  statements  and  inform  their banks  about  major  developments  in  their  businesses.  Nevertheless  the information  provided  by  SMEs  is  less  sophisticated  and  less  wellstructured  or  validated  as  compared  with  the  information  provided  by large  enterprises.  Small firms  usually  have  small  accounting  departments or  none  at  all.  The  entrepreneurs  themselves  may lack  financial administrative skills or are so involved in daytoday business matters that the  documents  required  by  the  bank  are  often  neglected.  Entrepreneurs should overcome these weaknesses before the implementation of the new CRD  in  Europe.  Indeed  providing  balance  sheets  and  profit  and  loss accounts  will  be  a  standard  requirement  for  all  enterprises  in  Europe  in order to have access to banking finance.  To  explore  the  list  of  obstacles  to  SMEs  financing  we  conducted direct interviews with banking experts. According to them the four factors mentioned above are not the only factors that impede the granting of loans. Poor  business  performance  a  lack  of  entrepreneurial  skills  and  uncertain development  prospects  are  shown  to  be  equally  important.  The  first  of these     poor business performance     can be indicated by a low equity ratio insufficient cashflow and liquidity problems. The latter two problems can be exacerbated by late payments as well as by bad credit management.  If  some  of  these  obstacles  are  assessed  as  being  prevalent  many banks are not willing to provide or extend a credit line even if the SME can offer enough collateral. For some existing clients the reduction of current credit facilities is more likely to happen than a complete withdrawal of all facilities extended to the firm. This reduction is essentially a consequence of the  bank   s  assessment  of  the  risk  profile  of  the  firm.  The  extension  of   26 | RYM AYADI existing credit lines to SMEs might become more difficult as a result of the more stringent regulatory conditions of the new capital requirement rules.  Based  on  the  analysis  above  it  can  be  concluded  that  although alternative  financing  sources  such  as  leasing  factoring  and  trade  credit exist SMEs rely heavily on bank financing. But bank financing requires a large  volume  of  financial  and  strategic  information  that  ought  to  be provided  by  SMEs  to  reduce  the  information  gap  between  the  borrower and its lender. In the face of the new requirements of Basel II globally and the  new  CRD  in  the  EU  banks  will  have  to  reconsider  their  traditional approaches.  Further  the  new  rules  introduce  stricter  requirements  to counter  growing  concerns  about  risks  at  the  European  and  global  levels. SMEs need to understand these regulatory changes as they will have some impact  on  their  financing  conditions  not  necessarily  by  reducing  their credit facilities but by rendering the whole process more risksensitive and dependent on the individual quality of the borrowers. The next section addresses capital regulation in more detail with an indepth discussion of Basel II and the CRD. The Basel Capital Accord the CRD and SME financing  2. Many  questions  arise  when  speaking  about  capital  regulation  What  is capital? Why do banks need to hold capital to conduct their business? What is the role of capital in banking? How much capital are banks required to hold?  And  how  do  capital  requirements  for  banks  impact  SME  financing conditions?  2.1  Why are banks required to hold regulatory capital? History  has  shown  the  grim  reality  of  a  banking  industry  tainted  with worldwide  failures  and  fiascos38  arising  from  errors  of  risk  management. Thus  the  objective  of  capital  regulation  has  always  been  very  simple  to reduce  the  number  of  bank  failures.  Sufficient  capital  must  therefore  be                                                       38 For example not too long ago (in 1995) the UK   s oldest merchant bank Barings also  known  as  the     Queen   s  bank     went  bankrupt  as  a  result  of  the  embezzling actions of a single trader based at a small office in Singapore and the incapacity of the  riskmanagement  team  to  avoid  the  worst  consequences.  This  story  is  one among several.   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 27 maintained  to  provide  a  cushion  to  absorb  losses  that  would  otherwise cause the failure of a bank (see Box 2).  Box 2. What is capital in a regulatory context? In the regulatory context capital is defined on a twotiered basis       Tier  1  capital  (or  core  capital)  includes  stock  issues  (shareholders     equity) and  disclosed  reserves.  Disclosed  reserves  can  be  in  the  form  of  loanloss reserves set aside to cushion future losses and smooth out income volatility.      Tier  2  capital  (or  supplementary  capital)  includes  perpetual  securities unrealised  gains  on  investment  securities  hybrid  capital  instruments  (e.g. mandatory convertibles) longterm subordinated debt with maturity greater than five years and hidden reserves such as an excess allowance for losses on loans and leases. The total of tier 2 capital is limited to a maximum of 100% of the total of tier 1 capital. The  1995  proposal  of  the  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  also provided  for  a  third  tier  of  capital  consisting  of  shortterm  unsecured subordinated  debts  that  can  only  be  used  for  meeting  marketrisk  capital requirements. Source BIS (1988). Among  the  risks  that  a  bank  must  manage  credit  risk is fundamentally  the  most  important  particularly  when  a  bank  mostly focuses on retail and corporate activities including lending to small and mediumsized enterprises. Credit risk is the risk of loss due to the failure of the counterparties to meet their obligations as stated in a loan contract.  A  bank  must  also  manage  other  types  of  risks  such  as  market  risk when it manages securities and bonds in its balance sheet and operational risk when it relies heavily on information technology and human resources. By definition market risk is the risk of loss owing to a change in market prices such as equity prices interest or exchange rates. Operational risk is the  risk  of  loss  resulting  from  inadequate  or  failed  internal  processes persons or systems or from external events.  As a consequence a bank that manages these risks is required to hold capital referred to as capital requirements or the capital adequacy ratio to limit  its  leverage  and  provide  a  buffer  against  unexpected  losses.  The retention of sufficient capital decreases the likelihood of a bank becoming insolvent and reduces the negative impact of bank failure through its loss absorption  and  increased  public  confidence.  Nevertheless  high  capital   28 | RYM AYADI adequacy ratios do not guarantee the bank   s soundness particularly if the risks  being  taken  are  high  or  the  bank  is  mismanaged.  Therefore supervisors consider a bank   s capital adequacy in the context of a broader set of factors. But the bottom line is that capital is an important indicator of a bank   s general condition and a signal to capital markets and minimum capital  requirements  are  one  of  the  essential  supervisory  instruments.  In many  cases  higher  capital  requirements  could  prove  necessary  for  bank loans  to  higher  risk  clients       in  times  of  recession  for  example  the management  of  credit  risk  for  these  types  of  loans  may  turn  out  to  be difficult and undoubtedly the primary source of banks    losses.  2.2  Basel I and its shortcomings The  Basel  Capital  Accord  (Basel  I)       the  current  international framework  on  capital  adequacy       was  adopted  in  1988  by  a  group  of central  banks  and  other  national  supervisory  authorities  working  within the Basel Committee on Banking Supervision (BCBS).39 The 1988 Accord40 set out details for measuring capital adequacy and the minimum standards for implementation into the national laws of the G13 member countries by December 1992.  The Basel I Accord has two fundamental objectives namely     to     strengthen  the  soundness  and  the  stability  of  the  international banking  system   41  by  creating  common  minimum  capital  adequacy requirements  for  internationally  active  banks  to  set  aside  a  capital cushion for the amount of risk taken; and                                                       39  The  BCBS  was  created in  1975  within the  Bank  of  International Settlements  in Basel. The Committee brought together bank supervisors from the G13 countries (Belgium  Canada  France  Germany  Italy  Japan  Luxembourg  the  Netherlands Spain Sweden Switzerland the UK and the US) to respond to the myriad of bank failures that undermined financial stability in the 1970s. It has no formal authority; rather  its  objective  is  to  develop  broad  supervisory standards and  promote  best practices in the expectation that each country will implement the standards in the ways  most  appropriate  to  its  circumstances.  Agreements  are  developed  by consensus  but  decisions about  which parts  of  the agreements  to  implement and how to do so are left to each nation   s regulatory authorities.    40 See BIS (1988). 41 Ibid.   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 29     to  create  a  level  playing  field  among  international  banks  by establishing  that  the  framework  should  be  fair  and  consistent  in  its application to banks in different countries.  The original framework assessed capital mainly in relation to credit risk  and  addressed  other  risks  (such  as  market  risk  liquidity  risk  and operational risk) only implicitly     it effectively loaded all regulatory capital requirements into measures of credit risk.  Specifically the 1988 capital framework requires banks to hold capital known as    regulatory capital    through the combination of equity loanloss reserves subordinated debts and some other instruments equal to at least 8% of all the riskweighted assets (RWA) (such as loans and securities) and assetequivalent  offbalancesheet  exposures  (such  as  loan  commitments standby  letters  of  credit  and  obligations  on  derivatives  contracts)  in  their portfolios.42  This  defines  a  common  measure  of  solvency  known  as  the    Cooke Ratio    (see Box 3).  The  assignment  of  risk  weights  is  based  on  the  perceived  credit quality  of  an  individual  obligor  and  each  offbalancesheet  exposure  is converted to its equivalent amount of asset and then weighted accordingly.  Four broad categories of capital charges are set by the Basel I Accord      government  exposures  with  OECD  countries  receive  0%  creditrisk capital charges;  OECD  banks  and  nonOECD  governments  receive  a  1.6%  capital charge (which corresponds to a risk weight of 20%);  mortgages receive a 4% capital charge (which  corresponds to a risk weight of 50%); and other  remaining  exposures  such  as  those  to  other  banks  and  all corporations  including  SMEs  receive  a  capital  charge  of  8%  (which corresponds  to  a  risk  weight  of  100%).  More  recently  the  1996 amendment43  to  the  Basel  Capital  Accord  extended  the  initial                                                                   42 In addition to onbalancesheet activities the Basel framework takes into account the credit risk of offbalancesheet items by applying credit conversion factors to the different types of offbalancesheet assets so that they can then be treated as onbalancesheet items.  43  Amendment  of  the  Capital Accord  to incorporate market  risks  BCBS  January 1996 (BIS 1996).   30 | RYM AYADI requirement to include riskbased capital adequacy for market risk in the trading books of the banks.

How to calculate minimum capital requirements according to the 1988 Basel Capital Accord Capital adequacy for onbalancesheet exposures as measured by the twotiered capital  regime  will  result  in  a  riskweighted  ratio  in  which  the  bank   s  total capital  requirements  are  related  to  the  different  categories  of  onbalancesheet exposures weighted to the four risk categories displayed in Table B.3.1.

The resulting weighted values from each of the risk  categories  are  then  added  together.  The  sum  is  the  bank   s  total  riskweighted assets which forms the denominator of the Cooke Ratio. Finally the required  capital  for  the  bank  must  be  equal  to  at  least  8%  of  the  total  riskweighted assets in the bank   s portfolio. For example An unsecured loan of    100 to a nonbank entity requires a risk weight of 100% (Table B.3.1). The riskweighted asset is therefore A minimum of 8% capital requirement results in 8%*RWA= 8%*   100=   8. RWA =    100*100% =    100 Source BIS (1988).  Basel  I  has  served  its  purpose  of  promoting  financial  stability  and providing an equitable basis for competition among internationally active banks since its inception in 1988. Undoubtedly throughout the numerous turbulent market events during the past decade (i.e. bank failures such the Barings collapse in 1995) Basel I has provided the needed stability among   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 31 these banks by strengthening the capital base of the international financial system. Nevertheless in spite of its success Basel I was seen to suffer from many  shortcomings.  Its  inadequacy  was  mainly  triggered  by  major innovations  in  the  banking  industry  and  advances  in  riskmanagement techniques as discussed below. The  first  limitation  of  Basel  I  is  related  to  the  overly  simplified  approach inherent to its architecture. Indeed as previously explained the use of only four  broad  credit  riskweighting  categories  for  capital  charges  does  not provide enough granularity in the measurement or distinction of different levels of credit risk embedded in banking portfolios especially to address the activities of the most complex organisations. This limited differentiation among  degrees  of  risks  means  that  calculated  capital  ratios  are  often uninformative  and  may  provide  misleading  information  about  a  bank   s capital adequacy relative to its real risks. As an example suppose    bank A    has a portfolio of different quality borrowers. This bank is required to hold 8% of capital adequacy on its overall portfolio irregardless of the quality of its  borrowers  which  in  turn  means  that  a  better  quality  or  investment grade borrower is not rewarded by its bank (with better terms in its loan policy better rates and more access to loan financing). Second  the  most  obvious  limitation  which  is  a  result  of  the  limited differentiation  among  degrees  of  risks  is  the  creation  of  incentives  for banks  to  engage  in     gaming     through  regulatory  arbitrage  provided  by asset securitisation and some other innovative financial vehicles including credit  derivatives.  The  general  idea  behind  these  new  instruments  is  to allow banks to trade their credit risk exposures in order to transfer the risk to other financial actors in the market. In other words thanks to these new instruments banks tend to trade exposures for whatever regulatory capital requirement  is  higher  than  what  the  market  requires.  As  an  example residential  mortgages  are  types  of  assets  that  banks  securitise  in  large volume because they believe the required regulatory capital to be greater than  market  or  economic  capital  (see  Box  4).  As  a  consequence  asset securitisation  has the  1988  Accord   s  minimum  capital requirements ineffective as a tool to hold capital against the real risk taken. Through  asset  securitisation  banks  have  been  able  to  significantly  lower their  credit  riskbased  capital  requirements  without  reducing  the  actual credit risk embedded in their banking portfolios.  Third a onesizefitsall approach to risk management is not adequate for banks  of  different  levels  of  complexity  in  determining  minimum  capital rendered   32 | RYM AYADI requirements nor does it provide them with enough incentives to improve riskmanagement  techniques.  Moreover  the  1988  Accord  gives  very  little attention  to  creditrisk  mitigation.  Despite  the  rapid  expansion  of  credit derivatives as a riskmanagement tool during the past decade the current Accord does not recognise offsets on the banking book through creditrisk mitigation  techniques  covering  collateral  guarantees44  credit  derivatives and onbalancesheet netting.  Finally  with  the  exception  of  the  1996  amendment  to  extend  capital adequacy to market risk the 1988 Accord focused primarily on creditrisk capital  requirements  and  did  not  keep  pace  with  banking  industry developments. Indeed over the past 15 years banks have extensively used the technological advances in information technology to improve their riskmanagement far  more that  cover  a comprehensive range of risks outside credit and market risks.   techniques  and functions Box 4. What is economic capital? Economic  capital  is  a  bank   s  own  estimates  of  the  capital  needed  to  support  its risktaking  activities.  It  represents  the  emerging  best  practice  for  measuring  and reporting  all  kinds  of  risk  across  a  financial  organisation.  It  is  called     economic    because it measures risk in terms of economic realities. It is called    capital    because part  of  the  measurement  process  involves  converting  a  risk  distribution  to  the amount of capital that is required to support the risk in line with the institution   s target financial strength (e.g. credit rating). An economic capital framework allows banking institutions to drive a return on  equity  discipline  into  individual  transaction  decisions  through  riskbased pricing.  Riskbased  pricing  can  be  a  key  competitive  differentiator.  Indeed  the banks that use riskbased pricing are able to    cherry pick    the most profitable loans through  aggressive  pricing;  those  not  using  this  technique  will  accumulate  a disproportionate share of underpriced and higherrisk loans.  Leading global banks that have embraced the economic capital framework include  ABN  Amro  Deutsche  Bank  Bank  of  Ireland  Barclays  SE  Banken  and ING.                                                         44 According to a survey of industry views undertaken by the capital group of the BCBS in January 2000 collateral and guarantees are the most widely used creditrisk mitigation techniques.   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 33 2.3  Basel II A new era of risk management  Since  1998  the  BCBS  has  been  engaged  in  a  revision  process  of  the  1988 Capital Accord in 2001 it published the second consultation paper (CP2); in 2003 the third consultation paper (CP3) improved the previous version of the Accord; and in June 2004 the new Basel Capital Accord (Basel II) was formally released.  The  application  of  the  new  Accord  will  be  gradual  from  yearend 2006  until  yearend  2007.  The  Committee  explicitly  stated  that  the standardised  and  the  IRB  approaches  for  credit  risk  and  the  basic  and standardised approaches for operational risk remain scheduled for the end of  2006.  The  advanced  IRB  approach  for  credit  risk  and  the  advanced measurement approach for operational risk will be deferred until the end of 2007 in order to provide additional time for supervisors and the industry to develop a consistent and reliable method of implementation. The  new  Basel  Capital  Accord  introduces  an  evolutionary  and flexible approach to banking supervision which reflects the rapid progress and  sophistication  of  banking  practices  and  riskmanagement  techniques. By  aligning  regulation  and  supervision  with  these  techniques  the  new capital  framework  not  only  provides  strong  incentives  for  banks  to continue  improving  their  internal  riskmanagement  capabilities  but  also gives  the  necessary  tools  to  supervisors  to  enable  them  to  react  to  any emerging  matter  that  occurs  and  thus  reduces  the  regulatory  arbitrage opportunities that the existing rules create.  Indeed Basel II introduces a number of new aspects to the regulation and  supervision  of  banks  structured  around  three  mutually  reinforcing pillars              pillar 1 minimum capital requirements pillar 2 supervisory review and pillar 3 market discipline.  2.3.1  Pillar  1       Measuring  credit  and  operational  risks  for  capital requirements The computation of the minimum supervisory capital under the first pillar will be based on the sum of the capital requirements originating from 1) credit risk 2) market risk and 3) operational risk (see Box 5).    34 | RYM AYADI Box 5. The capital ratio under Basel II Regulatory capital / riskweighted assets (measure revised) = minimum required capital ratio (8% minimum unchanged) Credit risk exposure (measure revised) + market risk exposure (measure unchanged) operational risk exposure (explicit measure added) +  the  minimum  supervisory  capital  which  The main novelties in the first pillar are the variety of approaches for estimating the standardised approach and the IRB approaches (i.e. the foundation and the advanced IRB approaches). In the standardised approach the risk weights will  be  based  on  a  rating  that  is  provided  by  external  credit  assessment institutions  or  other  institutions  accepted  by  national  supervisors  such  as export  credit  agencies.  In  the  IRB  approaches  the  rating  is  produced internally by a bank riskmanagement system.  include 1.  Measuring credit risk under the standardised approach In  the  standardised  approach45  the  amount  of  capital  required  on  an unsecured    1 loan to a private firm     now fixed at 8 cents (8% x    1)     could decrease to 1.6 or increase to 12 cents based on the ratings issued by the socalled    external credit assessment institution    (ECAI). A bank will be allowed to use the ratings of more than one ECAI but some  precise  rules  will  prevent  any  opportunistic  (   cherrypicking   ) behaviour. Thus banks will not be allowed to choose for each customer the  rating  source  assigning  the  most  favourable  judgement  (thereby reducing the total amount of regulatory capital). The  risk  categories  broken  down  by  the  ECAI  will  correspond  to different risk weights a process known as    mapping   .  Better ratings (type AAAAA) will bring about lower weights in the computation  of  riskweighted  assets;  moreover  as  in  Basel  I  different categories of counterparties (e.g. nonfinancial firms states or banks) will receive different sets of coefficients. This is summarised in Table 13 where ratings by Standard and Poor   s are used as a sample scale.                                                         45  The  description  of  the  standardised  and  other  Basel  II  approaches  has  been drawn from Ayadi & Resti (2004).

Columns  report  the  various  ratings  or  risk  categories  that  can  be assigned to counterparty.  By combining rows and columns one sees that for example a    100 loan to a AAArated nonfinancial company will translate into    20 of riskweighted assets and will therefore lead to a capital requirement of 20 x 8% =    1.6 (in other words 1.6% of the unweighted exposure). Similarly a    100 facility offered to a sovereign state with a rating lower than B will give rise to a    150 riskweighted exposure hence requiring a capital coverage of 150 x 8% =    12 (12% of the face value). The  last  two  columns  warrant  some  brief  clarification.  First  unrated exposures  (where  no  ECAIissued  rating  is  available)  will  usually  be weighted at 100% (as in the present Accord). This is likely to apply to most European nonfinancial firms (although some of them will have access to better  treatment  if  included  in  the  retail  portfolio  as  explained  below). Second pastdue loans towards the bank (where a delay of more than 90 days has occurred on any payment) will usually be weighted at 150% (like the worstrated classes) as payment delays could signal that the borrower is experiencing solvency problems. 2.  Measuring credit risk under the IRB approaches If a bank chooses (and is allowed by the national supervisor) to create its own rating system (instead of depending on external agencies) the capital against each credit exposure will be a function of five basic risk parameters 1. Probability of default (PD) is the default probability for a borrower over a oneyear period. It is also known as the expected default frequency. A starting point of the measurement of PD is the definition of default. In general the default event arises from the nonpayment of principal or interest. It is commonly admitted that default occurs if payment is past  due  90  days.  These  types  of  loans  are  characterised  as     nonperforming   .  Loss  given  default  (LGD)  is  the  expected  amount  of  loss  on  a  facility provided to the borrower when s/he defaults. To determine LGD a  2.  THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 37 3. bank  must  be  able  to  identify  the  borrowers  who  defaulted  the exposures  outstanding  at  the  time  of  default  and  the  amount  and timing  of  repayments  ultimately  received.  In  addition  private information  on  the  borrower  and  the  availability  of  collateral  could serve to develop the LGD estimates.  Exposure at default (EAD) is the amount the borrower owes at the time of default. The EAD is the sum of the current utilisation expressed as a percentage of the total commitment and the loan equivalent which is  the  additional  utilisation  as  a  percentage  of  the  unused commitment. Remaining  maturity  of  the  exposure  (m)  raises  the  possibility  that  the original  probability  of  default  needs  to  be  revised  and  possibly increased. Finally there is the degree of diversification and correlation (rho) of the credit portfolio to which the exposure belongs. The  expected  loss  is  a  simple  multiplication  of  (PD*LGD*EAD).  In conjunction  with  the  maturity  estimate  of  the  exposure  (m)  and  the diversification coefficient (rho) these risk parameters are used to determine capital for both economic capital and Basel II regulatory capital models.  4. 5. Risk weights and thus capital requirements would be determined by a  combination  of  a  bank  providing  the  quantitative  inputs  and  the supervisor  providing  the  formulas.  The  details  for  calculating  capital charges could vary somewhat according to the type of exposure (sovereign corporate retail etc.).  There are two IRB approaches the foundation and the advanced. The difference  between  the  two  is  that  the  former  would  require  the  bank  to determine only each loan   s probability of default and the supervisor would provide the other risk inputs; under the latter the bank would determine all  the  risk  parameters  internally  based  on  estimations  and  procedures validated by the supervisor. The choice of operating under either of the two approaches would be required to meet minimum qualifying criteria based on the comprehensiveness and integrity of the banks    internal capabilities for assessing the risk inputs relevant for each approach. Table 14 presents more  details  on  the  estimation/computation  of  the  abovementioned  risk factors.      Factor PD LGD Meaning Probability that the borrower is unwilling or unable to pay  Loss rate in the event of default EAD Exposure at default Table 14. Risk factors included in the IRB approaches Computation in the foundation approach The PD must be computed over a oneyear risk horizon accounting for possible deteriorations in the borrower   s creditworthiness in the medium to long term. Computation in the advanced approach The  LGD  is  fixed  at  45%  for  all  senior  unsecured exposures.  This  value  must  be  raised  to  75%  for subordinated  exposures  but  can  be  adjusted downwards  when  some  recognised  collateral  is pledged  against  the  loan.  When  the  collateral  is  an eligible financial instrument the LGD can be reduced down to 0% based on the value of the collateral and on  a  system  of  regulatory  haircuts.  Three  types  of nonfinancial collateral are also accepted receivables real  estate  (commercial  and  residential)  and  other collateral  (including  physical  capital  but  excluding any assets acquired by the bank as a result of a loan default). These nonfinancial collaterals may drive the LGD  down  to  40%  (35%  for  receivables  and  real estate).  EAD  is  computed  at  100%  of  current  exposure  plus 75%  of  undrawn  irrevocable  commitments.  Offbalance  sheet  exposures  will  have  to  be  converted into  credit  equivalents  by  means  of  standard  creditconversion factors.  Banks  will  be  allowed  to  use  their  own  estimates  of LGDs  provided  that  they  can  persuade  supervisors that their  models  are  conceptually  sound  and consistent  with  their  past  experience.  LGDs  will  have to be assessed in an economic sense rather than from a mere  accounting  perspective  when  measuring recovery rates all relevant factors that may reduce the final  economic  value  of  the  recovered  part  of  the exposure must be taken into account. This includes the discount  effect  associated  with  the  time  elapsed between  the  emergence  of  the  default  and  the  actual recovery  but  also  the  various  direct  and  indirect administrative  costs  associated  with  collecting  on  the exposure. Banks  will  be  allowed  to  use  their  own  estimates  of EAD provided that they can persuade supervisors that their  models  are  conceptually  sound  and  consistent with their past experience. | 38  THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 39 Maturity is conventionally set at two and a half years.  Maturity  must  be  computed  as  a  zerorate  financial duration  and  will  be  capped  at  five  years.  Maturities shorter  than  one  year  will  be  allowed  only  in  very specific cases.  A  rather  high  correlation  (24%)  is  used  for  loans  to  highlyrated  large  nonfinancial  firms  (the  socalled    corporate     portfolio);  this  is  owing  to  the  fact  that  such  companies  are  supposed  to  fail  mainly  because  of systemic shocks (that tend to hit all obligors at the same time). The correlation grows lower (from 24% to 12%) as the borrower   s rating worsens in this case in fact idiosyncratic factors are thought to be the main driver behind default risk. The two extreme values seen above (24% and 12%) are scaled down towards 20% and 8% respectively when the borrower   s turnover is less than    50 million. This is because small firms too are supposed to be affected mainly by idiosyncratic risks. Correlations grow even thinner (17% for highlyrated borrowers and 2% for lowrating counterparties) in the case  of  loans  to  individuals  and  small  firms  included  in  the     retail     portfolio.  For  the  socalled     qualifying revolvingretail  exposures     (mainly  credit  cards  and  overdrafts  issued  at  a  very  high  interest  rate)  the correlation coefficients for high and lowquality borrowers range from 11 to 2%. Finally a fixed correlation of 15% is used in the case of residential mortgages.

Measuring operational risk under pillar 1 The  new  capital  requirements  will  not  be  limited  to  credit  risk  a considerable amount of capital will have to be held against operational risk. Operational risk is defined as    the risk that flaws in a bank   s own systems or  human  resources  as  well  as  external  events  may  cause  unexpected losses  such  as  those  related  to  mass litigation  fraud  or  natural catastrophes   .46  To  measure  operational  risk  three  approaches  are provided by the Accord              the basic indicator approach  the standardised approach and the advanced measurement approaches.   Under  the  basic  indicator  approach  banks  are  required  to  hold  a capital  cushion  against  operational  risks  equal  to  15%  of  their  total  gross income  (measured  as  a  threeyear  moving  average).  This  just  reflects  the fact that larger banks are subject to a higher amount of risk since they are expected to have higher gross income. Under the standardised approach (note that this is not in any way related  to  the  standardised  approach  to  credit  risk)  the  banks     gross income is split among eight business lines corporate finance trading and sales payment and settlement commercial banking agency services retail banking asset management and retail brokerage. For the first three lines which  are  supposed  to  be  more  exposed  to  operational  risks  the  15% coefficient is raised to 18%; symmetrically it is lowered to 12% for the last three lines which are thought to be less risky.  The  advanced  measurement  approach  is  designed  to  be  more sensitive to operational risk and is intended for internationally active banks that  have  significant  exposure  to  operational  risk.  It  seeks  to  build  on banks    rapidly developing internal assessment techniques and would allow banks  to  use  their  own  methods  for  assessing their  exposures  as  long  as these methods are judged by supervisors to be sufficiently comprehensive and systematic.                                                        46 See BIS (2004).    THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 41 2.3.2  Pillar 2     Supervisory review The  supervisory  review  process  carried  out  by  national  authorities  will play  a  key  role  under  the  new  Accord  in  prompting  banks  to  develop refine  and  make  better  use  of  riskmeasurement  techniques.  This  second pillar will translate into four main lines of action. The national regulators will     check  that  the  bank   s  riskmanagement  systems  comply  with  the specifications  included  in  the  first  pillar  of  the  Accord  (such  as transparency integrity and consistency of the internal rating system); evaluate  risks  that  fall  under  the  provisions  of  the  first  pillar  but which may be imperfectly estimated by its computation formulae (for example the correlation and concentration effects included in the new Accord through a set of standard values may not be appropriate for individual banks); assess  risks  not  included  under  the  first  pillar  (e.g.  the  interestrate risk originated by the different maturity mix of assets and liabilities); and evaluate how the economic cycle could affect the bank   s future capital adequacy. Such effects will have to be estimated though    stress tests    simulating  how  the  bank   s  capital  requirements  would  change  if  a recession were to occur.              In the prudential supervision process regulators will  a) verify that each bank has a sound system in place to assess its own capital needs and a sensible strategy to ensure that its capital remains adequate in the future;  review  and  validate  such  a  system  taking  appropriate  steps whenever it is not fully satisfactory;  impose  capital  requirements  above  and  beyond  the  regulatory minimum stated in the first pillar if necessary; and  act  in  a  quick  and  timely  manner  (asking  for  prompt  corrective actions)  to  prevent  the  bank   s  capital  from  falling  below  the minimum threshold suggested by its risk profile. b) c) d) 2.3.3  Pillar 3     Market discipline  The third pillar aims at providing the market participants (particularly the bank stakeholders) with all the relevant information that may help them to   42 | RYM AYADI assess the risk profile of a bank. They will then be able to discipline banks operating  with  an  inadequate  capital  endowment  or  an  ineffective  riskmanagement system (or both).  is  generally  perceived  as  a  step Banks are therefore required to release a set of minimum data both quantitative  (e.g.  capital  adequacy  measures  and  the  main  aggregates  on which  capital  computation  is  based)  and  qualitative  (riskassessment methodologies and related organisational processes). Bank disclosure of the internal  rating  systems  provided  for  distinct  portfolios  including  SME portfolios increase transparency.  Nevertheless  the  degree  of  transparency  and  disclosure  is not  precisely  defined  and  there  is  still  vast  room  for  manoeuvre.  More specifically nothing is said about disclosing the rating or the criteria used for a specific borrower. The transparency requirements of the third pillar do  not  apply  to  any  exclusive  or  confidential  information  that  if  made known to the bank   s competitors could decrease the value of the bank or reduce its competitive advantage. forward to As  a  rule  the  information  required  by  the  third  pillar  must  be released every six months (every year for  qualitative data concerning  the bank   s  credit  policies  reporting  and  management  systems;  every  quarter for quantitative data on capital ratios and related aggregates).  Implementation of Basel II in Europe 2.3.4 At  the  European  level  the  new  Basel  framework  provided  substantial background  to  revise  the  EU   s  proposals  for  the  CRD.47  In  July  2004  a proposal for an updated Capital Requirements Directive was published. It mainly  kept  the  same  provisions  introduced  in  the  Basel  II  text.  Some variations  were  introduced  however  to  accommodate  the  European context. The new Directive was adopted by the European Parliament on 28 September 2005.  Although originally required to be applied by internationally active banks  the  CRD  will  target  all  credit  institutions  and  investment  firms irrespective  of  their  size  activities  or  levels  of  sophistication.  The implementation date should follow the same timeframe as that foreseen in                                                       47 Directive 2000/12/EC of 20 March 2000 relating to the taking up and pursuit of the business of credit institutions and Directive 93/6/EEC of 15 March 1993 on the capital  adequacy  of (European Commission 2004b). firms  and  credit institutions investment   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 43 the  original  Basel  II  framework  (i.e.  a  gradual  implementation  from  1 January 2007 for the simplest approaches and 1 January 2008 for the most advanced ones).         The  scope  of  application  of  the  new  Directive  is  highly  challenging since it should be appropriate for small mediumsized and large banks as well  as  investment  firms  on  the  grounds  that  they  carry  out  similar activities and risks. In order to smooth the transition to the new regulatory framework  of  such  a  large  population  of  financial  institutions  varying  in size  and  sophistication  and  to  make  risksensitivity  achievable  by  all  of them  the  Commission  has  introduced  some  flexible  Europeanspecific solutions     The proposed    rollout    rules for the IRB approaches will allow credit institutions to move different business lines and exposure classes to the  foundation  or  the  advanced  IRB  approach  during  a  reasonable timeframe (Art. 85 of the revised Directive).  Small and mediumsized banks will be allowed partial use of the IRB approaches for some exposures combined with continued use of the standardised  approach  for  exposures  to  sovereigns  and  financial institutions (Art. 89 of the revised Directive). Preferential  treatment  (lower  capital  charges  as  compared  with  the Basel II original text) will be accorded to private equity and venture capital  investments  when  they  are  considered  to  be     sufficiently diversified    (Annex VI and Annex VII of the revised Directive).  Covered bonds will also be given special treatment (Annex VI of the revised Directive). Small investment firms will be exempt from the new operational risk charges reflecting their risk profile and limited systemic importance. Moreover  to  assess  the  likely  impact  of  these  new  rules  on  the European  economy  the  European  Council  of  Ministers  requested48  the Commission  to  present  a  report  on  the  consequences  of  the  Basel  II deliberations  for  all  sectors  of  the  European  economy  with  particular attention  given  to  SMEs.  In  response  the  Commission  contracted PricewaterhouseCoopers  Risk  Management in  partnership  with  the National Institute for Economic and Social Research to prepare the study.                                                       48  The  request  was  formulated  at  the  European  Council  of  Ministers  meeting  in Barcelona on 1516 March 2002.            44 | RYM AYADI The study49 concluded that the rules would have a positive impact of the new rules on Europe   s financial institutions corporates and SMEs.  For the time being it is difficult to make an exhaustive evaluation of the  effects  of  the  new  CRD.  But  at  first  glance  a  more  risksensitive calibration  and  a  more  obvious  linkage  between  a  bank   s  own  riskmanagement  and  mitigation  techniques  along  with  regulatory  capital requirements may provide a natural incentive for banks to implement the most sophisticated tools to manage their risks. Nevertheless it is important to proceed with a costbenefit analysis particularly for small and mediumsized  banks  that  may  or  may  not  have  the  necessary  resources  to implement  such  onerous  tools.  Moreover  if  these  costs  are  passed  on  to consumers and SMEs their financing conditions may deteriorate and this in turn would adversely impact their growth.  2.3.5  How do Basel II and the CRD define and treat SMEs? Under  Basel  II  and  the  CRD50  SMEs  are  defined  as  companies  with  an annual turnover of less than    50 million. The annual turnover criterion can be substituted by total assets at the discretion of the national supervisor. Within the SME category there is an additional distinction between corporate  and  retail  SMEs.  First  SMEs  are  treated  in  the  corporate  asset class  when  the  total  annual  sales  are  less  than     50  million  and  total exposure  to  a  bank  is  greater  than     1  million.  A  discount  factor  that  can reach 20% is introduced to correct the asset risk weights on the basis of the borrower   s size.51 Second SME loans below an exposure size of    1 million can be treated in the retail portfolio52 (this is subject to a concentration limit and  to  the  requirement  that  the  lending  institution  actually  treats  such exposures as retail).53 The capital requirement in the retail portfolio is less than the corporate portfolio.                                                       49 European Commission (2004a).  50 See Art. 79 of the new CRD proposals. 51  The  firmsize  adjustment  factor  is  an  algorithm  that  modifies  the  asset correlation in reverse proportion to the SME   s size. 52  Banks  considered  the  retail  definition  to  be  arbitrary  rather  conservative  and unable to reflect how they determine retail and corporate exposures boundaries.  53 This provision encourages banks to treat as many clients as possible under the retail approach.    THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 45 At first glance it is obvious that the definition adopted by the Basel Committee is different from that of the European Commission (2003) as a consequence  of  the  different  focus  each  has  had.  The  Basel  II  and  CRD definition only considers the annual turnover and the size of the exposures irregardless  of  the  number  of  employees  or  the  total  balance  sheet  of  the SME.  What  matters  is  managing  the  risk  of  the  exposures  which  is consistent  with  the  objective  of  limiting  insolvencies  in  banks     portfolios. The  implementation  of  the  CRD  in  Europe  will  certainly  help  to  bring about a needed consistency between the two definitions. Many  changes  have  been  undertaken  since  the  beginning  of  the process54  aimed  at  giving  adequate  consideration  to  the  capital  charges imposed  on  lending  to  SMEs  under  the  different  approaches  of  the  new Accord.  On  the  one  hand  these  changes have led  to  a  decrease  of  capital charges  on  lending  to  SMEs  and  on  the  other  hand  have  provided  the possibility  of  differentiating  between  SMEs  that  are  part  of  the  retail portfolio and those that are part of the corporate one.55 Figure 4 shows the change of the slope of the risk weight curve as a function of the probability of default indicating the more favourable treatment of the SME portfolio either falling under the lowest part of the corporate portfolio or under the retail one.                                                        54 For example in the January 2001 consultation paper the capital charges imposed on the SME portfolio were said to be excessive and could result in hindering their growth. 55  CEPS  carried  out  a  survey  on  the  practical  implications  of  the  new  Basel  II Accord for the European financial system. A questionnaire was distributed to 250 participants  at  a  conference  jointly  organised  by  CEPS  with  FESE  (Federation  of European  Securities  Exchanges)  and  PwC  (PricewaterhouseCoopers)  on     The Changing Regulatory Regime in Europe A Challenging New Business Concept    in November 2003 in Brussels. This conference brought together market participants regulators and academics to discuss the issues raised by the Basel II consultation process  almost  a  month  after  the  Madrid  compromise.  Accordingly  in  order  to obtain  a  direct  assessment  of  how  deeply  the  current  proposal  has  been understood  and  accepted  or  even  rejected  throughout  the  European  financial industry  CEPS  undertook  a  statistical  analysis  of  the  54  relevant  responses collected.  When  asked  about  the  extent  to  which  SME  financing  had  become  a political  issue  88%  of  respondents  confirmed  the  political  nature  of  the  SME financing  debate  and  70%  indicated  that  the  agreement  on  special  treatment reached in July 2002 appears rather beneficial (Ayadi & De Rossi 2004a).     46 | RYM AYADI Figure 4.

For  banks  that  choose  to  rate  their  risk  exposures  under  the standardised approach56      SMEs  that  are  treated as  corporate  borrowers  will  receive  a  risk weight of between 20 and 150% depending on their rating class quality.57       Unrated  exposures  will  receive  a  100%  risk  weight  which  is equivalent to the current 8% of the unweighted loan.       SMEs  that  are  qualified  as  retail  borrowers58  will  receive  a  75% risk weight.                                                        56 See Annex VI of the CRD.  57 As explained previously the capital charge on a highquality loan of    100 to an SME rated AAA to AA is    20 of risk weighted asset multiplied by the original 8% leading  to  a  total  of     1.6  (in  other  words  1.6%  of  the  unweighted  exposure).  In contrast a lowquality loan to an SME will give rise to a capital charge of 150 x 8% =    12 which is 12% of the unweighted exposure.   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 47      The treatment of secured loans for SMEs has received particular attention in two cases. o  When  the  loans  are  secured  by  commercial  real  estate  in principle they  will  receive  a  risk  weight  of  100%. Nevertheless national supervisors will be allowed to assign a reduced  risk  weight  of  50%  for  50%  of  the  market  value  or 60%  of  the  mortgagelending  value  when  two  supervisory tests are fulfilled.59  o  When  the  loans  are  secured  by  mortgages  on  residential property they will receive a risk weight of 35%.  o  Any unsecured exposure will have a risk weight of 100%.      The  treatment  of  loans  that  are  past  due  for  more  than  90  days will receive a risk weight of 150%.       Finally exposures associated with investments in venture capital firms and private equity will be assigned a risk weight of 150%.60 For some cases national supervisors will apply  a risk weight of 50% and 100% to such exposures.  2.  Under  the  IRB  approach61  two  alternatives  are  offered  to  banks according to whether they use the foundation or the advanced IRB to rate  their  SME  portfolio.  Some  differences  exist  depending  upon whether the SME is treated as a corporate or as a retail borrower      When  an  SME  is  treated  as  a  corporate  obligor  under  the foundation IRB approach its risk weight depends on the PD the LGD and the firm size. The LGD for uncollateralised positions is set  at  45%  and  75%  of  the  loan  and  is  explicitly  subordinated.62                                                                                                                                        58 Retail exposures are exposures that comply with the criteria laid down in Art. 79(2) of the Directive proposal 2000/12/EC. 59 These two tests are a) the losses resulting from commercial realestate lending of up to 50% of the market value and 60% of the mortgagelending value must not exceed 0.3% of the outstanding loans in a given year; and b) overall losses resulting from commercial realestate lending must not exceed 0.5% of the outstanding loans in a given year.  60 This is subject to the discretion of competent authorities as per Annex VI section 11 of the CRD.  61 See Annex VII of the CRD.  62  A  subordinated  loan  is  a  facility  that  is  expressly  subordinated  to  another facility.  At  national  discretion  supervisors  may  choose  to  employ  a  wider   48 | RYM AYADI The level of LGD may however be reduced to 0% depending on the  collateral  (eligible  financial  collateral  and  receivables  and commercial and residential real estate will receive an LGD of 0% and 35% respectively). The formulas are given in Annex 2.      Under the advanced approach the bank is allowed to estimate the risk  parameters  of  an  SME  exposure.  Further  the  internal estimates  of  LGD  may  lead  to  lower  capital  requirements  if collateral  exists.  For  uncollateralised  positions  the  advanced approach may lead to higher capital requirements as the LGD is not  limited  to  45%.  As  for  EAD  and  maturity  the  internal estimates  may  vary  across  banks  and  lead  to  higher  or  lower capital charges.       When an SME fulfils the qualifying criteria to be treated as a retail exposure  a  bank  must  provide  its  own  estimates  of  the underlying risk components irrespective of whether it is applying the  foundation  or  the  advanced  IRB  approach.  The  risk  weight depends on the estimates of the PD LGD and EAD. This would theoretically  lead  to  lowering  the  capital  requirement  compared with the riskweight function for corporates.       Under the IRB approach63 any equity exposure is subject to a set of considerations as outlined below.  o If a bank is using the simple marketbased approach this will entail  risk  weights  of  190%  for  private  equity  exposures  in sufficiently  diversified  portfolios  290%  for  exchangetraded equity exposures and 370% for other equity exposures. These risk weights are much lower than those originally applied in the Basel II text. o  Otherwise the other approaches (the PD/LGD approach and internal  models  approach)  may  trigger  more  differentiated risk  weights  depending  on  the  risk  type  of  these  exposures. Under  the  original  Basel  II  framework  these  risk  charges could not be lower than 200% for firms with publicly traded equities  and  300%  for  those  with  private  equities.  For  some                                                                                                                                        definition of subordination. This may include economic subordination such as in cases where the facility is unsecured and the bulk of the borrower   s assets are used to secure other exposures. 63 See Annex VII section 1.3 of the CRD.    THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 49 longterm  investments  or  existing  positions  exemptions  or transitional arrangements may apply and lead to a risk weight of 100%. All other investments will imply significantly higher capital charges.  2.3.6  How does the CRD treat collateral? Under  the  CRD  proposal  the  European  Commission  has  made  a distinction between funded and unfunded credit protection.  Funded credit protection refers to a technique of creditrisk mitigation in  which  the  reduction  of  the  credit  risk  on  the  exposure  of  a  credit institution derives from the right of the credit institution     in the event of default  of  the  counterparty  or  on  the  occurrence  of  other  specified  credit events  relating  to  the  counterparty       to  liquidate  to  obtain  transfer  or appropriation of to retain certain assets or amounts to reduce the amount of  the  exposure  to  or  to  replace  it  with  the  amount  of  the  difference between  the  amount  of  the  exposure  and  the  amount  of  a  claim  on  the credit  institution  (Art.  4    31  of  the  revised  Directive  2000/12/EC).  In addition  to  residential  and  commercial  real  estate  all  financial  items including cash certificates of deposit or comparable instruments issued by the lending bank gold debt securities some qualified shares and mutual funds investing in the abovementioned instruments all listed shares and life  insurance  policies  and  other  instruments  issued  by  thirdparty institutions are considered to be eligible collateral under the funded credit protection. Unfunded  credit  protection  refers  to  a  technique  of  creditrisk mitigation in which the reduction of credit risk on the exposure of a credit institution derives from the undertaking of a third party to pay an amount in  the  event  of  the  default  of  the  borrower  or  on  the  occurrence  of  other specified events (Art. 4   32 of the revised Directive). The eligible providers of unfunded protection are detailed in Annex VIII part 1 and in Annex VI part 4 of the revised Directive 2000/12/EC.  IRB Under the  standardised  and foundation  approaches  besides residential  and  commercial  real  estate  other  types  of  collateral  are acceptable  including  a  wide  range  of  financial  collateral.  Each  type  is subject to a different treatment  1.  Under the simple approach the portion of the exposure covered by recognised  collateral  receives  the  risk  weight  applicable  to  the   50 | RYM AYADI collateral itself not to the original borrower (usually subject to a floor of 20%).  2.  Under  the  comprehensive  approach  no  capital  requirement  is applied to the collateralised portion of the exposure but the value of the  collateral  must  be  trimmed  by  a  fraction  (a  discount  factor) reflecting  the  risk  that  the  market  value  of  the  financial  instrument pledged  by  the  borrower  may  decrease  before  it  is  revaluated  or remargined.  Guarantees  and  credit  derivatives  are  considered  to  be  forms  of unfunded protection. They are acceptable under the standardised and IRB foundation  approaches  as  credit  risk  mitigants  provided  that  they  are eligible  and  fulfil  the  minimum  requirements  set  in  the  revised  Directive 2000/12/EC (Annex VIII part 2).  Under  the  IRB  advanced  approach  besides  the  eligible  collateral recognised  under  the  standardised  and  the  IRB  foundation  approaches other  forms  of  collateral  known  as  eligible  IRB  collateral  are  also recognised.  These  include  accounts  receivable  specified  commercial  and residential real estate and other collateral subject to fulfilment of minimum requirements.  The treatment of receivables is a novelty (see Annex 3). The principle is to extend the risk analysis of the borrower   s business industry and the clients with whom the borrower does business. Hence the bank is able to review  the  borrower   s  credit  practices  to  assess  their  soundness  and credibility.64  The  treatment  of  guarantees  and  credit  derivatives  under  the  IRB advanced  approach  closely  follows  the  treatment  under  the  standardised and  IRB  foundation  approaches.  Their  eligibility  and  recognition  are  also subject to the minimum criteria set by the revised Directive 2000/12/EC in Annex VII part 4.  Credit insurance can be perceived as a type of guarantee. It could be classified  as  unfunded  credit  protection  and  hence  could  mitigate  credit risk.  Nevertheless  credit  insurance  could  be  recognised  in  the  group  of guarantees  as  long  as  it  fulfils  some  minimum  requirements  common  to guarantees  and  credit  derivatives  and  other  operational  requirements                                                       64 This process could be timeconsuming for bankers as it also requires followingup and monitoring the clients of their small borrowers.   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 51 relating to riskmanagement processes to qualify as a creditrisk mitigant. Therefore  this  recognition  is  conditional  and  the  question  remains  of whether conditional insurance policies can match the requirements of the recognised  guarantees.  Moreover  this  conditionality  does  not  fully consider the creditenhancement effect of the protection provided by credit insurance.  In  practice  this  conditionality  may  limit  the  recognition  of  credit insurance under the new banking regulation and gives banking institutions much room for discretion to accept or reject this form of risk mitigation. 2.4  Development of an internal credit rating system As previously noted Basel II has introduced a revolutionary approach to risk management mainly to respond to the criticisms levelled against the current  regulatory  capital  standards.  More  specifically  the  failure  of  the present  capital  regime  to  capture  the  intrinsic  credit  risk  in  the  banking business  has  led  to  a  unanimous  determination  to  rely  on  internally developed creditrisk models65 initiated by the industry and monitored by supervisors. This gives rise to the question of what is considered to be a    sound    internal credit risk model. This description should be accorded to a system only when it meets the practical needs of the end users (the banks or other financial institutions that provide finance to SMEs) and wins the approval of  the  regulatory  supervisors.  Briefly  stated  the  model  should  be  able  to accomplish two important objectives      An  internal  rating  model  should  be  able  to  accurately  assess  and quantify the intrinsic credit risk embedded in the bank   s portfolio. In doing  so  it  should  introduce  both  quantitative  and  qualitative measures that facilitate prudential portfolio riskmanagement.  Ultimately  it  must  provide  a  mechanism  that  can  be  used  to determine  the  economic  capital  requirement  of  a  bank  and  the resulting capital allocation framework must be robust enough to be used for riskadjusted pricing and other strategic purposes.  Figure 5 is a simplified attempt to illustrate the linkages between the     essential components of a sound internal credit risk model.                                                         65 See Crouhy et al. (2001) for a comparison of the current credit risk models.     | 52  THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 53 Clearly the initial inputs to the model are crucial. For the most part these are highly dependent on the existing system infrastructure and data warehousing  within  a  bank.  The  ability  to  extract  customerrelated information  and  current  market  rates  on  demand  is  vital.  As  an  initial benchmark for assessing the creditworthiness of an obligor the bank   s own riskrating system must be sufficiently robust and granular to distinguish the different levels of credit quality. Other inputs required are the obligorspecific information such as the probabilities of defaults recovery rates (or lossgiven defaults) outstanding accounts commitments and covenants.  The next component of the model is the ability to calculate individual risk  measurements  for  example  expected  loss  unexpected  loss  adjusted exposure  and  the  markedtomarket  valuation  of  the  underlying  loan. Subsequently  given  supplementary  information  such  as  macroeconomic variables  default  correlation  sovereignrelated  quantities  and  other obligorspecific information aggregate risk measures can be calculated on a portfolio basis. In order to attach a statistical confidence level to the capital required as a buffer against insolvency the bank needs to use tools such as the  Monte  Carlo  simulation66  and  extreme  value  theory67  to  arrive  at  a desired loss distribution for the portfolio. This leads to the ultimate outputs of  the  internal  model  such  as  riskadjusted  performance  measurements riskadjusted pricing and economic capital requirements. Over  the  last  two  decades  creditrating  models  have allowed  banks and other financial institutions to assess the risks incurred in their lending activities  to  SMEs  more  accurately.  Indeed  rating  models  involve processing data about the firm and its owner using statistical models. The outcome  of  the  whole  process  is  a  rating  or  a  set  of  summary  statistics about the borrower   s expected future loan performance.  A  note  of  caution  however  is  that  credit  rating  is  not  a     plugandplay    approach in which one just inputs data into a computer and uses the                                                       66 The Monte Carlo simulation is an analytical technique for solving a problem by performing a large number of trial runs (i.e. simulations) and inferring a solution from the collective results. It is a method for calculating the probability distribution of possible outcomes. 67 Extreme value theory is a branch of statistics dealing with the extreme deviations from the median of probability distributions. The general theory sets out to assess the type of probability distributions generated by processes. Extreme value theory is important for assessing risk for highly unusual events such as 100year floods.   54 | RYM AYADI output at its face value. It requires a major investment in time technology training  and  human  resources.  Financial  institutions  have  the  choice  to either develop their own internal credit rating system or to share external rating solutions by pooling data. The pooling of data allows for the creation of a data source that is large enough to undertake historical analysis and enables lenders to benefit from tools that would otherwise not have been available.  One  classic  example  is  the  use  of  credit  bureau  data  to  create pooled risk ratings.  We  next  focus  on  the  development  stages  of  an  internal  rating  (or scoring)  model  since  banks  that  choose  to  apply  the  IRB  approach  will have to implement their own internal models to assess credit risks.  First  however  we  review  the  system  components  associated  with loans to SMEs. 2.4.1  Recap of the main risk components of a loan to SMEs  It  is  important  for  SMEs  to  understand  the  process  followed  by  banks  in assessing credit risk in order to be able to transmit the detailed information that  banks  need  to  evaluate  their  creditworthiness.  When  using  the  IRB approaches banks consider the following components 1. 2. PD     probability of default by the borrower; EAD       outstanding  part  of  the  loan  (still  to  be  repaid  hence outstanding risk) or exposure at default; LGD       probability  that  the  financial  institution  does  not  succeed  in recovering the debt once default has occurred; and 3. 4.  M     maturity of the loan. Capital requirements are computed according to predetermined and simple  formulas  based  on  the  four  components  of  risks.68  The  main principle  of  the  internal  rating  is  that  the  financial  institution  is  able  to cover  expected  losses69  (EL)  with  the  provisions  and  unexpected  losses (UL)70  with  its  own  capital.  Basically  capital  requirements  address  the unexpected losses which must be fully covered by a bank   s lending rates. Expected losses however are treated as a cost and not as a risk and are computed by multiplying the PD the LGD and the EAD.                                                        68 Refer to Annex 2. 69 Expected loss is a mean of the future losses.  70 These losses may or may not materialise for many years.   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 55 As already seen Basel II presents two IRB approaches     Under  the  foundation  IRB  approach  the  rating  is  focused  on  the estimation  of  PD  that  is  the  probability  that  a  company  does  not repay. Under  the  advanced  IRB  approach  besides  estimating  the  PD  the rating takes also EAD and LGD into account.     Probability of default is the most important component of credit risk. It is essential to the two approaches foreseen by both Basel II and the CRD and is  therefore  the  main  determinant  of  capital  reserves.  The  risk  elements interact as shown in Figure 6     An  SME  can  have  a  PD  within  a  category  or  a  class  for  instance between 0.01% and 10%. The  EAD  will  range  in  general  between  50%  and  100%  of  the  loan. Default  often  occurs  soon  after  lending.  The  lower  the  outstanding loan the less frequently default occurs.  LGD  most  commonly  fluctuates  between  20% and  100%.  The  worst scenario is that the bank/financial institution does not recover any of the defaulted amounts and hence the recovery rate is 0 and the LGD is  100%.  In  the  best  scenario  recovery  rate  will  reach  80%  of  the principal outstanding; hence the LGD will be reduced to 20%.         Figure 6.

EAD can multiply a given capital requirement by 2. LGD can multiply a given capital requirement by 5. Thus  PD  is  also  the  most  determinant  factor  for  calculating  capital requirements. Rating  an  SME  consists  of  applying  a  statistical  system  that  multiplies  a series of descriptive ratios by a set of coefficients which results in a certain value (a rating or score). This value allows for comparison between SMEs establishing a sort of risk gradient the higher the value is the higher the probability of default. The value corresponds to a determined risk category and  this  risk  category  is  associated  with  a  PD.  Therefore  to  analyse  the impact of a certain rating system we must look at the ratios used. To illustrate this the external rating agencies provide a matrix with the  gradual  classification  of  risks.  Each  rating  corresponds  implicitly  to  a PD. As previously discussed the risk mapping is used directly under the standardised approach (Table 15) whereas under the IRB approaches PD and the other risk components are estimated internally.

Only A credit rating model applies different weights to the characteristics used  to  predict  the  performance.  The  weights  (or  values)  measure  the influence of that characteristic on the outcome. The weights and the levels of those characteristics that exert a significant influence will be included in the final model. The outcome or performance is the business metric to be evaluated in  order  to  improve  the  decisionmaking  process;  the  score  or  rating assigned to any application is the sum of the appropriate weights given by the values of each characteristic included in the model.     In order to perform well research points to several characteristics that are essential for rating systems. They must be     understandable       the  rating  system  must  be  easy  to  verbalise  and should  be  understandable  not  only  statistically  but  also  in  business terms; powerful     the system must be able to discern clearly between good and bad payers;  weighted  up  by  default  probability       the  system  must  be  able  to indicate the probability that an individual client could become a bad payer; and  empirically  valid       the  system  must  have  shown  its  predictive capacity.              Rating systems take into account different types of information concerning SMEs. Complete rating systems have three modules.  1) The first module is comprised of economic and financial information on the firm from corporate accounts (balance sheets as well as profit and  loss  accounts).  This  information  is  normally  available  for  the majority of firms. The economic and financial data must be credible                                                       71 Rating models are used when rating small mediumsized and large enterprises; scoring models are generally used to score individuals.    58 | RYM AYADI 2) 3) and  reliable  (the  companies  must  be  audited  by  reliable  auditing institutions).  The  second  module  is  constructed  upon  the  qualitative  data  of  the enterprise  such  as  its  management  internal  processes  and  human capital base. This data is often gathered on the company   s premises.  The  third  module  involves  an  analysis  of  a  bank   s  proprietary information on the borrower (Figure 7).  Figure 7.

Apart from the different types of information used in the construction of  rating  modules  mentioned  above  there  are  other  risk  indicators  or    alerts     reflecting  the  historical  behaviour  of  a  company  when  operating with  financial  institutions  (past  due  loans).  This  information  could  be financial  reflecting  the  solvency  history  of  the  company  and  also qualitative such as the age of the company or the behaviour of the owner towards  the  employees.  The  related  information  could  be  collected  from private  credit  bureaus  public  credit  registries  central  banks  judicial archives on the company (and often the individuals) bankruptcy files and other public or private sources available in the different countries.   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 59 Some  of  the  information  gathered  is  used  to  approximate  the  PD. Other data play a decisive role in the estimation of the level of exposure of the firm (EAD) and severity (LGD) associated with the recovery rate such as  the  availability  of  physical  or  financial  collateral  or  guarantees  from banks credit insurance or the principal owner affiliates or parent firms.  If a default occurs the estimation of the LGD and EAD are computed by  a  separate  rating  model  generally  used  at  the  origination  of  the  loan. This  rating  model  serves  to  reevaluate  the  collateral  and  guaranties  to allow the calculation of the recovery rate when the default occurs.   Four  different  stages  can  be  identified  in  the  elaboration  of  a  rating associated with a PD 1) 2) 3) 4) the gathering of historical information analysis of individual factors specification and estimation of the model and verification of PD accuracy. Phase 1. Collection of historical information First  the  rating  system  of  the  bank  needs  to  identify  the  financial  and economic profile of the firm from the inception of historical data (year 1 year  2  etc.).  These  data  are  either  bankheld  information  or  obtained through the national central bank  of each country private external credit bureaus etc. The rating system needs to reflect the evolution of the credit liabilities  of  the  firm.  More  specifically  was  the  company  able  to  repay debt? Did any problems arise that caused default? See Figure 8. Figure 8. Compilation of historical data EconomicFinancialinformationPayment/Default track record12 monthsEconomicFinancialinformationPayment/Default track record12 monthsEconomicFinancialinformationPayment/Default track record12 monthsSource Soley Sans & Rahnema (2004). Present time  60 | RYM AYADI The  information  collected  allows  for  the  calculation  of  predictive ratios that reflect the criteria below linked to the type of data (qualitative and quantitative). Quantitative data     Performance  (i.e.  the  result  of  ordinary  activities/total  assets  and cashflow generation)  (cid190)  The higher and the steadier these ratios are the better the rating and the lower the probability of default. This is an indication of the capacity of the company to generate returns and therefore to meet its credit obligations.                         Leverage (i.e. own capital or equity and total debt) (cid190)  The  higher  this  ratio  is  the  better  the  rating  and  the  lower  the probability  of  default.  A  higher  equity  ratio  reflects  a  stronger balance sheet.  Debt  coverage  (i.e.  net  profit  plus  noncash  expenses/shortterm debt) (cid190)  The  higher  this  ratio  is  the  better  the  rating  and  the  lower  the probability  of  default.  This  is  an  indication  of  the  capacity  of  the company to pay shortterm debt interest. Liquidity  (i.e.  cash/shortterm  debt or  cash/total  assets  or  accounts payable/total assets) (cid190)  The  higher  this  ratio  is  the  better  the  rating  and  the  lower  the probability  of  default  as  this  shows  that  the  company  has sufficient liquidity to absorb shortterm debt.  Growth (i.e. sales growth) (cid190)  The steadier sales growth is the better the rating and the lower the  probability  of  default.  A  sustainable  growth  in  sales  is  an indication of the future prosperity of the company. Productivity (i.e. sales/assets) (cid190)  The  higher  this  ratio  is  the  better  the  rating  and  the  lower  the probability  of  default.  This  ratio  indicates  the  capacity  of  the company to generate sales from the employment of its assets.  Size (i.e. annual total assets and annual total turnover)   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 61     (cid190)  Total assets/total turnover indicate how large the company is and to which bracket it belongs in the bank   s assets (corporate versus retail portfolio).  Other factors such as market conditions particularly when firms have operations in emerging markets past due loans credit history debt structure the level of activity diversification innovation capacity the level  of  outstanding  trade  credit  and  merchandise  disputes  with suppliers/clients etc.      Macroeconomic factors (e.g. sovereign risk of the country where firms are located export growth and commodity price levels) Qualitative data              Development prospects of the industry Availability of a clear wellstructured and credible business plan Profile of the enterprise (activity sector age growth cycle number of employees etc.) Capacity/experience  reputation  and  past  credit  history  of  the entrepreneur/manager/owner Ownership  and  governance  structure  of  the  firm  (the  number  of shareholders the distribution of the shares etc.)               Management quality of accounts receivable     Availability  of  collateral  guarantees  etc.  This  is  a  particularly important  factor  for  a  bank  when  it  establishes  a  price  for  a  loan. Providing  valuable  collateral  helps  to  reduce  the  interest  charges. Even if the rating is poor providing collateral may help to obtain a loan with less stringent conditions.  The validity of the data set constructed should fulfil three basic premises     coverage of a complete economic cycle     data collected must refer to different periods in time covering up to 10 years;  sufficient quality of information     the ratios calculated must take into account a sufficient number of companies (ratios based upon a small number of companies must be disregarded); and data  must  be  representative  of  the  type  of  enterprise  covered      models  based  on  a  certain  typology  of  firms  are  not  necessarily applicable to all firms of all types.           62 | RYM AYADI least  three included  at To  check  the  validity  of  these  criteria  and  to  complement  the  list  of quantitative  and  qualitative  information  needed  for  the  purpose  of  this study  we  sent  a  qualitative  questionnaire72  to  credit  risk  managers compliance and auditing experts in some 150 banking institutions located throughout Europe. The questions mainly sought more information about the  internal  rating  systems  used  by  European  banks.  The  banks  were selected from a representative sample within the EU15 plus some Eastern European  countries.73  The  sample lending institutions  in  different  geographical  areas.  When  possible  telephone contact was made with key persons within the bank to explain the purpose of the research. If they agreed to participate very specific questions were posed  through  email  or  followup  telephone  interviews  to  explore particular issues that either were not well understood or not identified in the questionnaire.  credit institutions participated74  geographically  distributed  as  follows  Denmark  (2)  France (2) Portugal (1) Germany (1) Finland (1) and Greece (1) along with two rating experts from two international rating agencies. Among these three banks intend to comply with the partial use of the IRB approach and the other five are in the process of implementing the IRB approaches (four are in the process of applying the foundation approach and one the advanced approach). The eight banks consider SME lending as either very important to their business (between 20 and 40% of their assets) or the predominant from  eight  banking risk  experts Eight                                                       72 The questionnaire is reproduced in Annex 4. The intention of the questionnaire was to obtain information on the preparations made by banks to comply with the provisions of Basel II related to internal processes for managing credit risk. 73 The Eastern European countries included Poland the Czech Republic Hungary and the Slovak Republic.  74  Many  reasons  could  explain  the  low  rate  of  responses.  First  some  credit managers and/or experts were not prepared to give any responses on the internal rating  system  they  used  to  manage  credit  risk.  Second  some  did  not  want  to disclose  aspects  of  their  credit  riskmanagement  methods  noting  this  as confidential strategic information or stating that they would need the agreement of their board to discuss it. Third some are not planning to adopt the IRB approaches for credit and operational risks. Finally it should be noted that 15 questionnaires were sent back because the contact person was no longer working in the bank. The low rate of responses does not however affect the quality of the results as it is a qualitative survey.    THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 63 sector (more than 40% of their total assets). The majority consider that at least  20%  of  their  overall  SME  exposures  fulfil  the  requirements  to  be qualified as part of their retail portfolio.   They indicated that the historical data they collect are based on easily gathered  financial  information  from  balancesheet  statements  and  profitandloss  accounts  mostly  related  to  the  factors  mentioned  above. Specifically data are gathered with regard to the debt/capital structure the ability  of  the  SME  to  satisfy  its  credit  obligations  through  the  ratios concerning free cashflow earnings before interest and taxes the profit and loss  structure  and  the  business  plan.  These  data  are  determinant  when selecting potential borrowers.  They  added  that  the  main  qualitative  factors  taken  into  account  are those related to the ownership structure the legal form and the age of the enterprise the managerial capabilities and reputation of the entrepreneur or owner (experience age creditworthiness and his/her share in the capital structure).  To  obtain  this  information  the  respondent  banks  prefer  to collect  it  directly  from  their  customers  and  in  some  cases  from  private external credit bureaus or public credit registries.  The majority of the respondents mentioned the relevance of collateral and  guarantees  in  the  process  of  credit  approval  notably  when  granting medium  to  longterm  credit.  For  example  when  the  collateral  is  very liquid such as cash or some types of debt securities the pricing of the loan is lower since the bank is able to recover loan losses if default occurs. Other collateral  such  as  real  estate  (commercial  and  residential)  and  receivables reduce  the  risk  inherent  in  the  loan  but  necessitate  extensive  assessment when  the  borrower  defaults.  Therefore  the  recovery  rates  would  vary depending on the loss given default (LGD) assigned to each loan.  In general collateral allows an extension of the credit line in terms of volume  and  duration  and  in  some  cases  lowers  the  cost  of  credit.  In particular when the loan is pledged by accounts receivable the respondent banks  consider  that  wellmanaged  accounts  are  far  better  perceived  than those  poorly  managed.  Credit  insurance  was  mentioned  by  a  few responding  banks  as  a  valuable  guarantee  on  accounts  receivable  (or indemnification  against  default)  and  also  in  case  the  enterprise  has operations in emerging markets where political risk may be a factor. It is also said to be a complete riskmanagement tool that helps management to put  in  place  the  necessary  procedures  to  prevent  and  minimise  late payments  and  defaults  thereby  reducing  the  exposure  of  the  receivables   64 | RYM AYADI portfolio  and  enhancing  the  capacity  of  using  commercial  credit  as  a competitive tool.  Phase 2. Analysis of individual factors The  objective  of  this  stage  is  to  determine  which  ratios  best  serve  the construction of the final model. The relationship between each of the ratios and the dependent variable (default) and their predictive capacity must be analysed. Those factors offering a low predictive capacity must be excluded from  the  analysis  along  with  ratios  presenting  counterintuitive  relations with default.  Phase  2  is  mainly  a  statistical  exercise.  It  depends  greatly  on  the activity  sector  of  companies  their  growth  cycle  and  the  overall  business environment of the company.  When  asking  the  banking  experts  about  the  characteristics  of  this selection phase they confirmed that it is done through statistical analysis of individual  factors  and  ratios  which  are  selected  according  to  their relevance in the decisionmaking procedure.  Phase 3. Specification and estimation of the model The next stage is to carry out a multivariance analysis to assign weightings to  the  model  taking  into  account  not  only  the  individual  predictive capacity (univariance) of each ratio but also its corelationship with other types of information. Other variables are introduced during this phase such as  the  diversification  and  the  granularity  of  the  portfolio.  Phase  3  is essentially an econometric exercise. Phase 4. Obtaining the rating and the associated PD Once  the  model  and  weightings  of  the  applicable  ratios  are  set  the  next stage  seeks  to  systematise  the  assignment  of  the  PD  from  the  rating obtained through internal statistical models. The establishment of groups of percentiles that will define the rating of a company follows the ordering of enterprises according to their rating. For each rating level a PD is obtained by  observing  the  proportion  of  defaulted  and  nondefaulted  companies that obtained that rating in the past.  Responses  by  bank  experts  to  questions  concerning  phases  3  and  4 were very divergent as some were advanced in the PD generation process and others were preparing to establish the best systems corresponding to   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 65 their businesses. Such divergence was expected given the efforts underway to get ready for the new rating processes required by the Basel II and CRD regulations.  Finally depending on the bank or financial institution the rating is updated every year sometimes every quarter or month according to some risk managers. If the same conditions are maintained the assigned rating is stable.  If  conditions  improve  (worsen)  the  rating  will  also  improve (worsen).  The  respondent  banks  indicated  that  the  main  factors  leading  to  credit downgrading are              the delayed submission of financial data; incomplete unstructured or unclear financial data; a  worsening  of  the  business  and  financial  factors  of  the  company such  as  loss  of  market  share  decreased  or  negative  earnings  before interest  and  taxes  an  increase  in  balancesheet  mismatches  (longterm  commitments  versus  shortterm  liquidity)  deterioration  of liquidity  an  increase  of  longterm  debt  reduced  equity  ratio recurring overspends poor credit management within the company (more late and defaulted payers) and a rise in merchandise disputes with suppliers/clients;  drastic  changes  in  the  ownership  structure  of  the  firm  such  as  the mortality of the owner/manager and absence of future plans or the loss of other key persons; and  some macroeconomic factors such as an increase in the political risks where the company is located or a reduction of exports.         They also mentioned that they look at excessive overdraft behaviour  and blocked payments.  2.4.3  A rating system in practice Rating  systems  are  based  on  very  objective  mathematical  and  statistical systems that render the financing decisions more realistic for the particular situation of a given firm. In practice  a rating system consists of     a mathematical formula that assigns a rating (or score) to a company based on a set of ratios; and    66 | RYM AYADI     a  correspondence  to  a  risk  group  based  on  prior  ratings  and  the present quality of the borrower and finally the assignment of a PD.75  A  practical  example  of  a  credit  rating  system  is  RISKCALCTm  a predetermined  rating  system  produced  by  Moody   s  KMV  to  accurately characterise  the  credit  risk  of  private  companies  for  faster  underwriting decisions  and  providing  efficient  monitoring  of  portfolio  credit  trends. Using this system we first describe the financial ratios that should be taken into account in the credit risk assessment exercise to produce the desired rating  and  the  correspondent  probability  of  default.  Then  we  show  the results  given  by  the  RISKCALCTm  and  offer  some  explanations  based  on different circumstances.  The  ratios  that  are  weighted  in  the  RISKCALCTm  rating  system  are  the following      Leverage ratios o  Own  capital/debt       this  is  a  measure  of  the  level  of  nondistributed profits relative to the total debt. o  Total debt/total assets     this is a measure to compare the level of debt relative to assets.  The higher this ratio is the higher the probability of default.      Liquidity ratio (more specifically cash/shortterm debt)     the higher this ratio is the lower the probability of default.  Performance  ratio  (the  result  of  ordinary  activities/assets)       the higher this ratio is the lower the probability of default.  Debt coverage ratios o  Net  profit  plus  noncash  expenses/shortterm  debt       the  higher this ratio is the lower the probability of default.  o  Cash flow/financial expenses     the higher this ratio is the lower o  Financial  expenses/net  sales       the  higher  this  ratio  is  the  lower the probability of default.  the probability of default. Growth  (sales  growth)       this  is  calculated  between  N  and  N1; increased growth implies a lower probability of default.                                                                   75 See Soley Sans & Rahnema (2004).   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 67     Productivity  (sales/assets)       the  higher  this  ratio  is  the  lower  the probability of default.  The results of a simulation exercise of the data of some companies are reported in Table 16.  The  quality  of  the  firms  depends  on  the  assigned  rating  and  the correspondent  probability  of  default.  Each  factor  (input)  is  weighted according to its degree of importance. These weights may vary depending on the models used. The final result improves with the rating and the lower probability of default revealing how easy it would be for the firm to obtain financing.  For  example  firm  A  has  the  best  rating  (AA3)  associated  with  the lowest  probability  of  default.  It  has  the  highest  own  capital/debts liquidity  cashflow/debt  and  cashflow/financial  expenses  ratios  in comparison with the other firms. On the opposite side of the table firm K has  the  worst  rating  (B3)  associated  with  a  high  probability  of  default (26%); this firm has low chances of obtaining a loan with good conditions since it is considered to be highly risky.  These  results  are  mainly  based  on  the  economic  and  financial  data collected either directly or through some private credit bureaus or national credit  registries.  The  ratings  however  may  also  depend  on  other information that may serve as alerts such as past due loans     for example in the case of firm G data collected from a private credit bureau showed that  this  company  has  a  previous  default  history  with  other  financial institutions  prior  to  the  rating  exercise  performed  by  RISKCALCTm.  The alert resulted in a downgrade of the company in question irregardless of its current economic and financial situation.  It  is  important  to  note  that  historical  data  on  the  solvency  of companies76  can  serve  as  effective  warnings  that  impact  their  actual  and future  financing.  Other  situations  such  as  the  loss  of  a  key  person  in  the firm  the  loss  of  market  shares  late  payments  from  clients  or  low innovation capacity can cause the downgrading of the firm. These factors were confirmed by the majority of the banking experts who participated in the survey.                                                        76 This data can be collected in the national credit registries the judicial archives and in the central banks in each country.

At  a  further  stage  the  estimation  of  the  probability  of  default  will permit the calculation of the regulatory capital necessary to cover the risk carried in the portfolio of the bank or the financial institution. The higher the probability of default the higher are the associated capital requirements and the poorer are the conditions for obtaining a loan.  Firm A would receive a loan with very good conditions whereas firm K  would  obtain  a  loan  with  more  stringent  conditions  to  account  for  the amount of risk the bank would be taking to offer the finance.     The risk premium The key component of the cost of credit  2.4.4 As explained in the previous section the risk premium depends on three components  the  probability  of  default  the  loss  given  default  and  the exposure at default.      The estimation of PD is given by the internal rating which depends on the economic and financial situation of the borrower and previous solvency history.  The  LGD  is  the  estimation  of  the  percentage  of  losses  over  the exposure minus its recovered part and associated costs. LGD depends on  the  guarantees  and  collateral  provided  by  the  borrowers  which are  used  to  calculate  the  recovery  rate.  During  interviews  with  a rating  expert  from  an  international  rating  agency  and  with  a  credit risk  expert  within  a  bank  they  both  mentioned  that  the  use  of guarantees  and  collateral  are  taken into  consideration  when calculating the recovery rates.  EAD is the estimation of the amount used by the borrower at the time when she or he defaults. EAD is the sum of the amount of the loan used and a fraction (K) of the available loan. This fraction depends on the type of product and the rating of the borrower. A  good  estimation  of  the  risk  premium  depends  greatly  on  the accuracy  of  the  client  rating  process.  This  process  will  allow  their classification according to their creditworthiness by assigning a rating and a PD (see Figure 9).      Moreover  rating  is  the  key  element  for  banks  and  other  financial institutions  to  determine  the  return  adjusted  to  risk.  Indeed  a  growing   70 | RYM AYADI number of financial institutions have been using riskadjusted performance measures to measure their economic capital including     the return on riskadjusted capital (RORAC); and      the  riskadjusted  return  on  riskadjusted  capital  (RARORAC)  also called    riskadjusted return on capital    (RAROC).  In  RAROC  the  riskadjusted  return  is  the  difference  between financial revenues and financial costs minus the potential expected losses and  the  administrative  costs.  The  riskadjusted  capital  is  the  economic capital. This ratio can be calculated for each activity department unit etc.  Figure 9. Estimation of the risk premium Source Soley Sans & Rahnema (2004).  2.5  What  is  the  likely  impact  of  the  CRD  on  SME  financing  in Europe?  In  Europe  the  majority  of  SMEs  rely  on  loan  financing  as  previously shown;  however  another  option  exists  for  a  bank       which  is  to  finance companies through equity either directly or through venture capital. Basel II and the CRD will impact SME financing which may at a first sight raise some questions about the overall consequences of these changes. Although the  new  Basel  capital  rules  will  certainly  impact  the  credit  conditions  for SMEs they may not necessarily lead to a reduction of credit supply to these entities.  In  terms  of  the  cost  of  credit  Basel  II  will  directly  affect  three components  of  the  cost  of  credit  to  SMEs.  First  the  administrative  or operational cost resulting from the processes to originate and manage loan portfolios  may  increase  owing  to  the  use  of  more  sophisticated  risk   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 71 management  tools  that  require  greater  investment  in  infrastructure  (data collection  database  maintenance  and  adequate  modelling)  and  human resources.  Second  there  is the  cost  of  risk  composed  of  the  cost  of  capital which  is  the  opportunity  cost  resulting  from  the  fact  that  banks  need regulatory  and  risk  capital  to  cover  loan  exposures  and  finally  the  risk premium which is linked to the probability of default of the borrower the exposure  at  default  and  the  loss  given  default.  The  impact  of  the  new banking  regulatory  rules  on  these  latter  two  costs  is  not  straightforward since it will depend on the risk characteristics of the borrowers (see Box 6).  Box 6. What impact does Basel II/CRD have on the cost of credit to SMEs? The consumption of the credit institution   s own resources (equity subordinated debts and other reserves) has a direct relationship with the risk incurred by its credit  and  other  operations.  This  is  the  essence  of  the  risk  premium  an important component of the cost of credit. Typically the cost of credit includes     the refinancing cost which is the price paid by the credit institution to its resource providers (the shareholders and other stakeholders); the  administrative  cost  which  includes  the  cost  of  collecting  processing analysing and evaluating the borrowers    information the followup and the control of the different lines of credit; the cost of the credit institution   s own resources (tier 1 and tier 2) which is the opportunity cost requested by the shareholders of the institution; the  risk  premium  which  is  the  additional  cost  sought  by  the  credit institution from each borrower to cover its expected and unexpected losses; and the credit institution margin which is the profitability of the bank.                  Basel II/CRD will have an effect on             the administrative cost owing to the more sophisticated evaluation process of credit risk; the cost of the credit institution   s own resources because of its relationship to the consumption of capital the risk of the portfolio and the higher capital requirements; and most importantly the  risk  premium  by  giving  banks  the  opportunity  to  assess  more effectively  the  risk  incurred  by  its  activities.  This  will  be  possible  by introducing  more  risksensitive  management  techniques  to  assess  distinct SME  qualities.  The  risk  premium  will  be  lower  when  lending  to  good quality  SMEs  (or  highly  rated)  and  higher  when  lending  to  poor  quality SMEs (or badly rated).    72 | RYM AYADI The more risksensitive pricing introduced by the new rules through the  IRB  approaches  will  entail  a  certain  variation  in  capital  adequacy depending ultimately on the individual quality of the borrowers. A poorquality  borrower  (rated  B  or  CCC)  will  force  its  lender  to  hold  more regulatory capital compared with a betterquality borrower (rated AAA or AA) but this does not ban loan financing.77  As  shown  in  Figure  10  lending  to  small  businesses  under  the  IRB approach would reward highly rated businesses by only requiring banks to hold approximately 2% of capital charges as compared with 8% under the current  Basel  rules.  The  lowrated  firms  will  cause  their  lenders  to  hold more than 8% of capital charges to tax the high risk inherent in this type of business. Under the standardised approach the risk sensitivity of the new rules is lost which means that a bank is required to hold the 8% of capital charges irregardless of the quality of the borrower.

On  average  results  from  the  third  Quantitative  Impact  Study  of European    group 2    banks     those that are small and generally less complex and not internationally active     showed that no matter which category the SME exposure is assigned (to the corporate or the retail portfolio) the new regulatory capital rules will yield a lower SME risk weight compared with the existing framework (Table 17).  Moreover as noted earlier the European Commission report (2004a) on the consequences of the Basel II rules for all the sectors of the European economy with a particular focus on SMEs concludes that the new Accord should not have any negative impact on the availability and cost of finance for SMEs in most European countries. It points out that worries about an increase in the cost of finance owing to an increased use of internal ratings in lending activity are not justified. On the contrary capital requirements relating to SME credit risks are expected to decrease notably when using IRB approaches.  Other empirical studies78 undertaken to assess the possible effects of Basel  II  implementation  on  SMEs  in  Europe  generally  find  that  the  new                                                       78  See  Schwaiger  (2002)  for  the  impact  of  Basel  II  on  Austrian  SMEs  Saurina  & Trucharte (2004) for the impact on Spanish SMEs and Altman & Sabato (2005) for the impact on Italian SMEs.     74 | RYM AYADI banking  rules  lead  to  capital  requirement  savings  linked  to  the  SME segment  when  using  one  of  the  proposed  approaches.  When  using  the standardised  approach  banks  will  enjoy  more  savings  when  SMEs  are considered under the retail portfolio (the risk weight goes from 100 to 75%). When using one of the IRB approaches banks are allowed to personalise the capital requirement calculations and build their own models to estimate PDs  when  using  the  foundation  IRB  approach  and  PDs  LGDs  and  other parameters when using the advanced IRB approach for each client.79  Table  17.

THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 75 when adopting the standardised foundation or advanced IRB approaches. Furthermore  different  lending  procedures  and  varying  risk  management expertise will lead to diverse outcomes throughout the banking industry with betterrated banks able to manoeuvre more and lend at better rates. On  the  whole  it  is  very  likely  that  banks  opting  for  the  moreadvanced rating  approaches  would  have  a  competitive  advantage  when  lending  to SMEs within the retail bracket. Indeed these different approaches will certainly generate differences in  capital  requirements  for  different  quality  SME  portfolios  favouring  to some extent the large internationally active banks that are more willing to adopt  the  advanced  IRB  approach  and  thus  benefit  from  a  considerable capital discount on highly rated SMEs notably those treated as retail. The high  risksensitivity  of  the  IRB  approaches  would  benefit  the  investment grade  SMEs  and  penalise  the  riskier  ones  (say  Brated  borrowers  and below).  The  latter  will  be  less  expensive  for  banks  adopting  the standardised approaches; the opposite is true for highly rated SMEs.  The  existence  and  the  application  of  sophisticated  creditrisk management  tools  will  be  a  key  element  for  banks  to  qualify  for  the advanced IRB approaches and in turn to ensure better riskmanagement of their credit portfolios including the exposures to SMEs.  Small  or  mediumsized  banking  institutions  that  have  poorer internal  riskmanagement  systems  and  are  unwilling  to  install  more sophisticated tools will have to adopt the standardised approach which is a fairly improved version of the current capital regulatory rules. This does not lead to capital charges for the SME portfolio that are different from the current rules (on average the 8% capital requirements are kept regardless of the rating of the borrower); but it would result in a deterioration of their asset quality since they do not have the adequate rating system to isolate and  reject  highrisk  borrowers.  The  greater  risk  sensitivity  introduced when  using  the  foundation  IRB  implies  low  capital  requirements  in particular for good quality SMEs and relatively high capital requirements for poor quality ones (see Figure 11).  This is not necessarily bad news for SMEs since a medium to poorquality  borrower  is  better  off  asking  for  a  loan  from  a  bank  using  a standardised approach whereas highly rated SMEs are better off asking for loans from IRB banks.  As previously explained traditionally small and mediumsized banks are  active  locally  and  are  the  main  supply  sources  of  external  finance  to   76 | RYM AYADI SMEs. While they have a strong longterm relationship80 with their clients based  on  local  knowledge  and  experience  (which  helps  to  reduce information  asymmetries)  they  may  profit  from  their  local  dominant position  by  extracting     rents     from  SMEs  a  situation  that  leads  to  higher charges.  In  this  respect  it  is  important  to  monitor  and  ensure  that  anticompetitive behaviour is kept under the competition authorities    control. Figure 11.

As  a  result  capital  requirements  may  become  a limitation  for  granting  loans  to  SMEs  and  others  which  in  turn  could intensify the economic slowdown. The procyclical effect of the new Accord arises  from  the  use  of  risksensitive  techniques  in  the  internal  creditrisk systems. These effects are certainly different while using the standardised or the IRB approaches. Indeed according to a study by the Bank of England81 which sought to  estimate  the  extent  to  which  banks  would  downgrade  loans  in  a recession ratings based on Moody   s approach lead to little if any increase of  capital  requirements  whereas  ratings  based  on  a  Mertontype  model82 lead  to  an  increase  of  40  to  50%.83  The  strong  reactivity  of  the  more sophisticated  riskassessment  models  (such  as  Mertontype  models)  is mainly  related  to  the  correlation  of  the  probabilities  of  default  to  the economic  cycle.  Indeed  the  probabilities  of  default  are  lower  when  the economic  conditions  are  favourable  and  higher  when  the  economy experiences a downturn. Confirming these conclusions Altman et al. (2002) investigated the link between probabilities of default and loss given default and  the  effects  of  procyclicality  on  capital  requirements.  They  found  that banks  that  estimate  probabilities  of  default  and  lossgiven  default  had  to reduce their credit portfolios to a larger extent compared with banks that only estimate PDs and rely on supervisory estimates of LGDs. This finding provides  clear  evidence  that  the  procyclicality  of  the  Accord  is  more prominent when using the advanced IRB approach.  When the economy is in a downturn the high risksensitivity of Basel II may indirectly exacerbate the deterioration of SME financial conditions since banks are more likely to cut credit because of the overall deterioration                                                       81 See CatarineuRabell et al. (2003). 82 A Merton model or structural credit risk model was first proposed by Black and Scholes    and developed by Robert Merton in 1973 in his seminal paper on option pricing as well as in a more detailed paper in 1974. Merton had in fact anticipated the model earlier in 1970. This fact along with his active support of the work of Black and Scholes is why the model is often referred to by his name. 83  Similar  results  were  found  in  Kashyap  and  Stein  (2003);  see  also  Jordan  et  al. (2003).   78 | RYM AYADI of the asset quality. At the same time the payment behaviour of companies is very likely to deteriorate which typically undermines SMEs    commercial transactions.  This  would  create  cash  imbalances  due  to  late  payments casting additional doubt on SMEs    creditworthiness and as a consequence would  curb  lending  even  more.  Reduced  lending  would  have  a  direct negative  effect  on  growth  suggesting  that  some  corrective  measures should be put in place to avoid exacerbating the cycle.  Against  this  background  when  asking  bankers  whether  the  new Basel  Accord  would  make  lending  to  SMEs  less  attractive  in  comparison with  large  companies  a  survey  by  the  European  Investment  Bank (Wagenvoort  2003c)  showed  that  roughly  one  out  of  four  bankers  still finds  it  difficult  to  assess  the  possible  impact  of  Basel  II  on  SME  lending (see Figure 12).  Figure 12. The likely impact of Basel II on firm lending  45%40%35%30%25%20%15%10%5%0%Become less attractive Stay equally attractive Become more attractive Difficult to ascertain atthis stageSource Wagenvoort (2003c). Small MediumsizedLargeAround  40%  of  the  bankers  are  of  the  opinion  that  lending  to medium  and  large  firms  will  remain  equally  attractive  as  under  current banking  regulation.  With  respect  to  small  firms  only  20%  of  the respondents  think  that  Basel  II  will  be  neutral  for  smallfirm  lending. Among those who expect Basel II to have an impact on loans to small firms about  half  think  that  Basel  II  will  stimulate  lending  while  the  other  half anticipates a negative impact. In other words it is expected that there will be  banks  reducing  smallfirm  lending  but  this  reduction  is  likely  to  be offset by other banks that increase it. Recently the McKinsey & Co. survey   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 79 confirmed  that  an  overwhelming  majority  of  banks  view  the  SME  credit business  as  a  core  element  of  their  portfolio  and  showed  their  interest  in increasing it. In terms of the practical implications for SME lending the new IRB approaches to managing credit risk imply an increase of work to maintain updated and completed databases and to review the ratings and the factors involved  in  the  modelling  process  more  often.  Indeed  there  is  a  strong expectation that IRB banks will require their clients (notably SMEs under corporate and retail portfolios) to provide more better structured focused and timely data (financial statements business plans etc.) to complete their systems  and  to  allow  them  to  produce  a  precise  and  adequate  ratings closely  aligned  to  their  risk  profile  over  time.  Covenants  will  become standard  features  of  loan  contracts  (in  particular  ratings  leverage  and liquidity)  especially  for  longterm  credit  and  the  trend  to  collateralised lending as a means to mitigate credit risk will continue. The most tangible changes are the use of a more sophisticated statistical design to derive the ratings  and  the  way  this  information  is  interpreted  when  using  the  most sophisticated  statistical  techniques  to  convert  quantitative  and  qualitative data into ratings and probabilities of default which will enhance the ability to  identify  potential  future  defaults.  These  changes  will  entail  a  much tighter  and  more  systematic  monitoring  of  creditworthiness  of  the borrower and credit risk overall. Yearly rating will be a common standard for  banks  to  help  identify  problem  loans.  The monitoring  process  will  be based  on  the  data  submitted  yearly  by  the  clients  and  any  delay  in submission  will  serve  as  a  warning  signal  and  most  likely  lead  to  a downgrading. These conclusions were confirmed by the majority of banks in the McKinsey & Co. survey (European Commission 2005b).  On the one hand Basel II is a revolution in terms of improving risk management  through  the  introduction  of  more  risksensitive  and  more sophisticated  tools  borrowed  from  modern  finance  theories.  But  on  the other  hand  it  may  create  a  higher  burden  for  some  small  enterprises (notably  the  potentially  lowrated  SMEs)  which  would  need  to  provide wellstructured  and  timely  financial  statements  to  keep  their  bank accounts  in  a  straight  line  with  their  agreements  to  communicate  any change (in the personnel and capital employed in the firm and arrange the successor  matters)  to  provide  adequate  guarantees  and  collateral  and  to manage  their  credit  function  very  carefully.  These  enterprises  could  still overcome  the  burden  by  internally  managing  their  own  risk  first  by investing  in  the  accounting/financial  function  and  ensuring  they  submit   80 | RYM AYADI accurate  and  timely  information  about  their  financial  situation  to  their banks; second by implementing a viable credit management method that could  be  complemented  by  credit  insurance  to  monitor  their  clients    payment behaviour and therefore to avoid bad payment habits or coverage in the event of insolvencies. This would in turn lead to a more stable cash flow and hence may improve the enterprise   s creditworthiness.  Banks also have the alternative to finance SMEs in the first stages of their growth cycle through equity either directly or by investing in private equity  or  venture  capital.  Under  the  Basel  I  Accord  equity  positions  are riskweighted  at  100%  which  does  not  correctly  reflect  their  underlying risk profile. The risk weights assigned to these types of exposures which are considered to be highrisk categories are noticeably higher under the new  Basel  rules.  The  European  Commission   s  CRD  proposal  has introduced  lowerrisk  weights  to  such  exposures  as  compared  with  the original text of Basel II but these are still considered to be higher than the current rules.  The  new  treatment  may  limit  the  attractiveness  of  this  type  of financing. The higher charges imposed on directequity financing and bank investments in private equity and venture capital business in Europe will inhibit banking institutions from investing in such businesses as they are becoming very costly.84 Some SMEs in particular those developing new technologies (   hightech    SMEs) and relying to a certain extent on private equity and venture capital  financing  will  be  somewhat  affected  by  this  treatment.85  Indeed developing  new  technologies  is  considered  to  be  a  risky  business  in addition  to  the  uncertainty  of  expected  returns  where  the  problem  of information asymmetry is prominent.                                                        84 The role of banks in developing the European private equity and venture capital market is essential as banks contribute 25% of all capital committed (EVCA 2004).  85 According to a survey of European venture capital conducted by Bottazzi et al. (2004) almost 1300 European firms were financed by European venture capitalists. These firms mainly belong to the hightechnology industry.   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 81 3.  Measures  to  improve  SME  financing  under  the  new  rating culture their  business. they  usually  conceive Banks  have  been  and  will  continue  to  be  the  most  important  source  of financing for SMEs in Europe. Today banks are facing a drastic change in the  manner Indeed  recent developments  such  as  emerging  riskmanagement  techniques  financial innovation  and  other  drivers linked  to  the  high  expectations  of shareholders  and  regulators  have  brought  new  challenges  for  banks. Hence  they  need  to  run  their  business  with  the  most  accurate  tools  not only  to  meet  expectations  but  also  to  position  themselves  against  fierce competition.  In  practice  banks  must  manage  the  risks  to  which  they  are exposed very carefully with a specific focus on credit risk stemming from counterparties  of  varying  risk  quality.  The  SME  sector  is  clearly  one  in which  banks  are  looking  to  expand       first  because  SMEs  have  a  high potential  for  innovation  and  flexibility  and  second  because  they  foster growth. In parallel the European Commission is committed to creating the best  possible  environment  for  SMEs  to  grow  and  to  contribute  to  the realisation of the EU   s Lisbon Agenda of March 2000.  The  new  requirements  introduced  by  Basel  II  in  parallel  with  the CRD mirror the trend in the financial industry towards more scientific riskmeasurement  and  management.  Since  managing  risks  is  the  core  of business  of  financial  institutions  they  ought  to  do  it  in  the  best  possible way.  Hence  the  new  regulation  creates  higher  incentives  for  banks  to assess the risk inherent in each individual exposure riskier lending will be more expensive while safer lending will be less costly. In other words for the  banks  that  choose  the  IRB  methods  there  will  be  no  room  for  crosssubsidisation. For these types of banks credit decisions will be based on the individual risk quality  of each borrower and his or her  capacity to repay debt over time.  For SMEs this will mean that their rating and probability of default are the determinant components for credit decisions (acceptance rejection and  conditions).  They  are  also  going  to  have  a  wider  range  of  choices  in terms  of  price  and  credit  conditions.  Since  SMEs  will  not  necessarily  be aware of these changes it is important that banks inform them. SMEs will also need to expend greater efforts and cooperate in a constructive way.  At  the  same  time  the  public  sector  should  take  action  in  terms  of improving the general framework conditions of finance. Together with the   82 | RYM AYADI markets  the  public  sector  should  act  as  a  catalyst  to  encourage development.   3.1  The role of banks As previously shown gaps in information between borrowers and lenders are  among  the  root  causes  of  financing  constraints  for  SMEs.  The establishment of a longterm relationship based on increased transparency is  key  to  reducing  these  information  asymmetries.86  The  new  banking regulations  also  cite  increased  transparency  as  a  precondition  for  an effective cooperation between lenders and SMEs.  Banks  should  not  hesitate  to  play  their  role  by  informing  their customers about the changes and showing them how ratings impact their credit terms. Communication should not be limited to the reasons for not granting bank loans or withdrawing existing credit lines     it should be built upon  mutual  trust  between  banks  and  SMEs.  Indeed  since  ratings  and associated  probabilities  of  default  are  becoming  the  main  factor  for deciding whether or not a bank assigns or extends a line of credit SMEs will need to be informed.  Therefore  bank  procedures       including  individual  ratings  risk assessment and the factors leading to downgrading      will  need to be more transparent to SMEs. In our interviews with banks they were asked about their  plans  to  disclose  the  rating  process  and  individual  ratings  to  their clients.  Only  a  minority  intend  to  disclose  the  individual  ratings voluntarily. The majority plan to inform customers about the main drivers of  the  rating  decision  to  enable  them  to  address  the  necessary  levers leading  to  an  improved  rating  and  to  mitigate  credit  risk.87  Obviously  a variety of views emanated from these interviews.  Against  these  different  views  it  is  advisable  to  define  minimum criteria on the level of the transparency required which is not prejudicial to banks  in  terms  of  cost  increases  or  competitiveness.  Disclosing  and explaining  the  overall  detailed  ratings  process  to  potential  clients  could overburden  a  bank  as  it  implies  mobilising  extra  human  resources.  If the potential client becomes a loyal customer the additional costs incurred by                                                       86 See Boot (2000). 87 These conclusions were confirmed by the McKinsey & Co. survey (see European Commission 2005b).   THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 83 the bank may be passed on as service costs to the customer. If the potential client  is  no  longer  interested  or  is  shopping  around  to  obtain  the  best ratings then these costs will be a complete loss. Building on this point it is crucial to define the right amount of disclosure that is both acceptable by banks and helpful to SMEs.  To explore this recommendation our survey asked banks how they perceive an explicit regulation of ratings disclosure to loan applicants. The striking majority of respondents were not in favour of such a move since they  think  this  would  entail  an  extra  regulatory  burden.88  In this  respect they  consider  that  a  nonlegislative  code  of  conduct  between  banks  and SMEs should suffice to establish a framework that sets out principles on the disclosure  of  ratings  and  rating  processes  for  banking  and  SME associations.  We  strongly  believe  that  a  better  disclosure  of  rating  processes  by banks  will  improve  the  new  rating  culture  and  also  the  SME   bank relationship  in  the  rating  process.  It  is  therefore  important  to  adequately define the principles that are the minimum requirements for governing this relationship. For example before the rating process banks need to inform SMEs about 1) 2) the data needed to determine the rating;  the  factors  affecting  the  credit  decision  (collateral  external  ratings etc.);  the  principles  of  the  rating  system  that  will  be  applied  (i.e.  those covering the retail versus corporate categories); and  possible  ways  to  improve  the  rating  (better  credit  management further guarantees a more defined business plan etc.).  After the rating process banks need to communicate and explain the credit decision (acceptance rejection or likely change of loan conditions) in a  clear  comprehensible  written  manner.  When  updating  the  ratings (generally  on  an  annual  basis)  banks  need  to  inform  their  clients  well  in 3) 4)                                                       88 The adopted CRD stipulates that    banks are called upon to disclose their ratings decisions in writing and comprehensibly to SMEs and other corporate applicants for  loans.  Should  a  voluntarily  undertaking  by  the  sector  in  this  regard  prove inadequate  national  legislative  measures  shall  be  adopted.  The  administrative costs  for  the  banks  have  to  be  at  an  appropriate  rate  to  the  size  of  the  loan    (emphasis added).    84 | RYM AYADI advance  to  provide  the  necessary  inputs  and  again  provide  a  written comprehensible explanation of the changes.  3.2  The role of SMEs  Adopting  one  of  the  IRB  approaches  under  the  new  banking  regulation means that banks have to rely extensively on quantitative and qualitative information  provided  by  SMEs.  This  information  is  essential  for  running the  internal  rating  system  properly.  Companies  that  are  well  managed adequately leveraged (equity ratio) and that provide timely relevant and precise  information  will  be  in  a  position  to  obtain  a  better  rating  and consequently  better  credit  conditions.  Hence  it  is  crucial  that  companies understand  and  accommodate  the  new  capital  requirements  in  order  to provide  the  most  relevant  data  needed  by  lenders  to  rate  their  risk exposures. Below are the practical actions that SMEs must take to improve their ratings.89  General steps  1) Study  and  understand  the  bank  requirements  for  granting  a  loan. Financial advice could be seen as an additional solution to make sure all the elements are taken into consideration.  2)  Deliver  clear  complete  and  timely  financial  and  performance  data needed by lenders to assign yearly ratings for granting a new loan or extending  an  existing  line  of  credit  with  better  conditions.  Indeed delayed submission of financial and performance data is seen to be a warning  signal  in  many  banks     internal  rating  systems.  It  usually leads  to  a  downgrading  and  therefore  price  increases  in  new  loan offers or the refusal of new loans.  Practical actions 3) Improve the factors that are considered to be important in the rating process specifically       Make  sure  that  cashflow  stabilisation  and  generation  receive priority  among  these  efforts  since  it  is  often  the  key  tangible                                                       89 For more details see the European Commission   s (2005c) practical guide to loan financing for SMEs.    THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 85 signal with which SMEs can negotiate their creditworthiness. This could  be  done  by  increasing  and  diversifying  the  sources  of revenues  (products  and  services)  the  customer  and  supplier   s base and distribution channels and implementing viable internal or  external  creditmanagement  procedures  to  monitor  clients    payment  behaviour  (receivables)  and  therefore  avoid  bad payment  habits.  Late  payment  habits  from  clients  should  be limited  since  the  late  or  irregular  cashingin  of  revenues  could easily drag down the rating and by limiting the perceived debt capacity  of  the  firm  may  adversely  affect  company  growth.  In addition to legislative efforts to combat such malpractices (e.g. the EU   s late payment directive) many companies could directly take action by (for example) using credit insurance policies to prevent and minimise late payments and defaults. Credit insurance could offer a complete riskmanagement tool that helps management to put in place the necessary procedures to continuously monitor the creditworthiness  of  clients  and  reduce  the  risk  of  delays  and defaults.  Increase  the  equity  base  by  preferring  retained  earnings  over distributed profits.  Improve  the  accounting  controlling  and  management  methods within  the  company  where  these  need  attention.  Entrepreneurs should  not  only  give  more  importance  to  the  accounting  and financial  functions  within  the  company  but  also  move  towards more active balancesheet (or asset liability) management in terms of reducing the mismatch between longterm commitment versus cash. SMEs should also consider how they manage their liabilities as a means to increase competitiveness. In this respect innovation could serve them very well     as it has served banks     to reduce the  overall  amount  of  risk  through  the  active  management  of liabilities.               Consolidate the  business  development  strategy  encourage strategic  thinking  among  managers  in  terms  of  the  business prospects  undertake  market/sector/activity  analyses  and improve external communications with stakeholders.       Renew  the  attention  given  to  some  aspects  of  the  business  that may have been neglected such as keeping bank accounts in line with agreements communicating any changes in the personnel or   86 | RYM AYADI 4) capital  employed arrangements for key staff.  in  the  firm  and  determining  successor      Put in place recovery procedures in the event of crisis scenarios such as the loss of a key person in the company the revaluation of a  national  currency  for  companies  that  heavily  rely  on  exports etc.  Ensure  that  adequate  guarantees  and  collateral  are  provided. Collateral  and  guarantees  help  to  obtain  better  loan  conditions.  As previously  noted  the  loan  pricing  policy  is  mainly  influenced  by rating term structure (maturity) and collateral. SMEs need to be able to  provide  adequate  collateral.  The  list  of  creditrisk  mitigation techniques in Basel II and the CRD is extensive but these ultimately depend on the expected recovery rate (which is a related variable of the LGD). For example the expected recovery rate of cash is almost 100% while the expected recovery rate for receivables is between 60 and 95%. It is advisable for SMEs to look at other types of collateral such as credit insurance which again could offer an indemnification for  accounts  receivable  to  increase  their  value  when  recovery  is required in the case of default. Credit insurance could also serve as a protection for SMEs in countries with high political risks.  6) Other specific actions 5)  Work more proactively to increase equity finance. Many SMEs need stronger balance sheets. Venture capital equity finance and business angels  are  more  readily  accessible  to  SMEs  that  can  show  high growth potential.  Consider different financing sources. Although it is true that the main financing products are provided by banks it is important for SMEs to be able to compare different financing sources to judge which is more appropriate to the risk level of the company according to its growth cycle.  Leasing  factoring  and  other  sources  could  offer  a  good response  to  SMEs  willing  to  investigate  other  financing  means particularly  for  those  that  have  more  difficulties  providing  wellstructured financial and performance data     the basic prerequisites to accessing finance through banks.    THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 87 is  an 3.3  The role of public policy  Improving  access  to  finance important  aspect  of  fostering entrepreneurship and growth in Europe. Many actions have been already been  taken  at  the  European  and  national  levels  to  improve  access  to finance. The purpose of this section is not to enumerate these actions but to suggest  some  improvements  to  enhance  the  environment  for  SME financing in the postBasel II/CRD era.  1) There  is  room  for  continued  improvement  in  the  relationship between  banks  and  SMEs  in  the  new  rating  culture.  Thus  it  is important to establish a nonlegislative framework (code of conduct) that sets out the principles for defining minimum criteria for ratings disclosure. 2)  Access to equity finance could also be improved. As equity finance is included in the highrisk category under Basel II and the CRD banks are likely to withdraw from these investments owing to the high risk weights  assigned  to  them.  At  the  same  time  many  SMEs  need stronger  balance  sheets  that  can  be  translated  into  a  higher  equity ratio.  Hence  at  the  regional  national  and  European  levels  it  is important to focus on developing European venture capital markets and  their  liquidity  and  to  promote  the  possibilities  provided  by business angels and their networks.  Since a stronger equity base is a reflection of higher creditworthiness it is important to recognise that retained earnings are the best form of financing  growth  and  investment.  National  governments  should review  whether  their  tax  laws  obstruct  firm  growth  by  taxing retained earnings more than distributed profits.  Legislative  efforts  to  combat  late  payment  habits  need  to  continue and be reinforced to ensure better stabilisation of cash flows which are a prerequisite for better ratings.   3) 4)    BIBLIOGRAPHY Ade  B.

May.        ANNEXES    ANNEX 1. WHAT IS THE CREDIT RISK PREMIUM? By  taking  credit  risk  and  the  length  of  the  lending  period  into  account differences  in  nominal  interest  rates  at  a  point  in  time  can  be  explained with the following equation  imarket=r{ *+E(       ++)}tThe  first  two  components  in  brackets  are  the  desired  rate  of  return and the expected inflation that make up the core of any interest rate at a point  in  time.  The  third  component            is  known  as  the     risk  premium    established  by  credit  markets  for  different  categories  of  risk.  This  value depends on how riskaverse lenders might be at any point of time. The last component            is  known  as  the  liquidity  premium  which  represents  the amount of compensation required by the lender for lending to the long end of the market. Let us take an example based on different nominal interest rates  and  different  levels  of  risk  associated  with  a  certain  class  of borrowers as shown in Table A.1. Table A.1. Nominal interest rates and different levels of risk for a certain class of borrowers  Term  Shortterm (1 year or less)  Mediumterm (110 years)  5.54% Longterm (+10 years)  Source Based on Standard & Poor   s (2003). 4.24% No risk Treasury   AAAAA 3.36% Low risk  Medium risk  High risk BCC 5% ABB 3.95% 1.80% 4.46% 6.21% 5.12% 6.89% 8% 10% Each  column  represents  a  different  level  of  risk  associated  with  a particular category of borrowers. This risk is also known as the credit risk whereby  different  types  of  borrowers  (or  related  projects)  have  different probabilities  of  being  able  to  make  scheduled  interest  payments  and  to repay  the  principle  of  the  debt.  These  risk  categories  are  commonly established by various credit agencies the most popular being Standard & Poor   s (S&P) and Moody   s. | 95  96 | RYM AYADI The norisk category corresponds to the government debt (Tbills Tnotes and Tbonds). In this category there is an absolute certainty that the borrower will be able to properly make scheduled interest payments and repay the principle of the debt. The lowrisk category corresponds to S&P   s classification of AAAAA called    investment grade lending   . Borrowers in this category have a strong history of debt repayment and a strong steam of revenues  to  service  any  future  debt.  Lending  under  this  category  is considered  to  be  for  the  very  riskaverse  who  seek  to  protect  their  asset base by avoiding the borrowers who might default in their debt repayment.  The classification ABB represents the somewhat speculative grade of mediumrisk lending. Borrowers in this category often have a good credit history;  however  some  uncertainty  about  future  revenues  to  service additional  debt  persists.  Lenders  involved  in  these  types  of  loans  are willing  to  speculate  that  all  interest  payments  and  principal  repayments will take place in return for a slightly higher return on their investment. Finally the highrisk category carries a BCCC rating also known as    junk    or highly speculative lending. Lenders in this category are willing to put  their  assets  at  risk  in  return  for  a  high  return  given  the  strong probability  of  default  carried  by  this  type  of  asset.  Given  these  risk categories  the  risk  premium  is  the  reward  or  the  additional  return  for holding a risky investment rather than a riskfree one.    ANNEX 2.

A GLANCE AT THE TREATMENT OF PURCHASED RECEIVABLES UNDER BASEL II    Eligible  purchased  receivables  are  divided  into  retail  and  corporate receivables. SME receivables fall under both categories.  1. If  SME  receivables  are  qualified  under  the  retail  category  the purchasing bank that complies with the internal ratingsbased (IRB) rules  for  retail  exposures  is  eligible  for  the  following     topdown    approach. For this type of asset there are IRB charges for both default risk and dilution risk.  To  assess  the  default  risk  the  bank  must  provide  estimates  for probability  of  default  (PD)  and  lossgiven  default  (LGD)  for  the receivables on a standalone basis without regard to any assumption of recourse or guarantees from the seller or other parties.  Dilution  refers  to  the  possibility  that  the  receivable  amount  is reduced through cash or noncash credit to the receivables    obligor. Examples include offsets or allowances arising from returns of goods sold  disputes  regarding  product  quality  possible  debts  of  the borrower  to  a  receivable  obligor  and  any  payment  or  promotional discount  offered  by  the  borrower  (e.g.  a  credit  for  cash  payments within  30  days).  To  assess  dilution  risk  the  purchasing  bank  must estimate a oneyear expected loss for dilution risk also expressed in a percentage of the receivables amount. To estimate the expected loss the bank can utilise external and internal data and the estimate must be computed on a standalone basis. To calculate the risk weights for dilution risk the PD must be set equal to the estimated expected loss and  the  LGD  must  be  set  at  100%;  a  oneyear  maturity  could  be applied  under  the  supervisory  discretion.  This  treatment  applies  to whether underlying receivables are corporate or retail exposures.   If  SME  receivables  are  qualified  under  the  corporate  category  their treatment  depends  on  whether  they  are  eligible  for  the  topdown 2.

To  be  eligible  for  treatment  under  this  approach they must satisfy the following conditions  a) b) They must be purchased from unrelated thirdparty sellers. They must be generated on an arm   s length basis between the seller and the obligor. The purchasing bank has a claim on the proceeds from the pool of  receivables  or  a  prorata  interest  in  the  proceeds  (first  loss position second loss position etc.). The  supervisor  must  set  a  concentration  limit  above  which capital  requirements  should  be  calculated.  The  concentration limit  may  refer  to  the  following  parameters  the  size  of  one individual  exposure  relative  to  the  total  pool  the  size  of  the pool of receivables as a percentage of regulatory capital or the maximum size of an individual exposure in the pool.  c) d) To  assess  the  default  risk  in  the  eligible  purchased  corporate receivables two approaches apply.  a)  Under the IRB foundation approach if the purchasing bank is unable to decompose the expected loss into its PD and LGD in a reliable  manner  the  risk  weight  is  determined  from  the corporate following specifications      function  using risk  weight the If  the  bank  can  demonstrate  that  the  exposures  are exclusively senior claims to corporate borrowers an LGD of  45%  is  used;  PD  is  then  calculated  by  dividing  the expected loss by this given LGD. If the PD is a bank   s estimate of the expected loss LGD is set to be 100%.      If  the  purchasing  bank  is  able  to  estimate  PD  in  a  reliable manner the risk weight is determined from the corporate risk weight  functions  according  to  the  specifications  of  LGD maturity  (m)  and  the  treatment  of  guarantees  under  the foundation approach.  b)  Under  the  advanced  IRB  approach  the  purchasing  bank  will provide estimates of the risk parameters internally. If  the  purchased  corporate  receivables  are  not  eligible  for  this treatment their default risk will be assessed as other corporate exposures.      ANNEX 4.

GENERAL INFORMATION Purpose of the questionnaire  The creation of the best possible environment for entrepreneurship is at the heart  of  the  strategy  launched  by  the  European  Council  in  Lisbon. Nevertheless the forthcoming new CRD has sparked concerns that higher capital  charges  will  further  curb  lending  to  SMEs.  Actually  the  new banking regulation intends to enhance the efficiency of credit allocation by giving incentives to a more risk sensitive pricing introduced by the internal ratingsbased  approaches.  This  will  certainly  entail  variance  in  capital adequacy  depending  on  the  individual  quality  of  the  SME.  As  a                                                            The  author would like  to  acknowledge  the  research  assistance  of  Francesco  De Rossi in the preparation of this survey.  100 |  THE NEW BASEL CAPITAL ACCORD AND SME FINANCING | 101 consequence the availability of loan financing will be more conditional on an  enterprise   s  financial  strength  and  its  ability  to  provide  relevant quantitative  and  qualitative  information.  A  particular  prerequisite  to improve  the  enterprise   s  financial  strength  is  a  smoother  settlement  of commercial transactions. The  CEPS  survey  aims  at  providing  statistical  evidence  to  help understand  banks     rating  procedures  SMEs     financial  structure  and  the effects of late payments in an atmosphere of dynamic repositioning due to the  forthcoming  banking  regulation.  The  results  will  serve  to  publish  a CEPS report on The New Basel Capital Accord and SME Financing SMEs and the New Rating Culture expected to be released in mid2005. This questionnaire should be directed to the audit compliance or risk department of your bank.   Banks and Other Financial Institutions 1.  What is the asset size of your financial institution?
