Financial inclusion has always been a critical component in alleviating poverty  and  is  reflecting  the  target  of  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDG).  In  case  of poverty  alleviation  particularly  in  Malaysia  Zakat  distribution  has  always  been  a  vital  and significant  factor  in  reducing  income  inequalities  among  the  various  strata  of  community. However  in  this  study  usage  of  FinTech  and  mobile  banking  is  discussed  to  achieving financial inclusion by  efficient zakat  distribution. From  review of  the various literatures the use of technology such as mobile banking has proven a successful tool for financial inclusion. This possibly will be a new channel for zakat distribution in addressing the issue of efficiency and distribution effectiveness.  Therefore the purpose of this study is  to  show the relevancy and  significance  of  mobile  banking  for  efficient  zakat  distribution  which  leads  to  a  cost reduction in an effort to poverty alleviation. Furthermore recommendations were also  given in  this study  for the purpose of contribution  to  the existing body of  Fintech  knowledge and Islamic social financing.   Keywords MDG SDG Financial Inclusion Poverty Alleviation Mobile Banking   INTRODUCTION The  population  of  financially  excluded  around  the  globe  is  enormous.  According  to  the United  Nations  (UN)  about  3  billion  people  around  the  globe  does  not  have  access  to financial  services  such  as  bank  account  savings  credit  entitlements  that  is  provided  by  the financial institutions insurance coverage and other services (Chibba 2008; UN 2007). The purpose  of  financial  inclusion  is  to  provide  financial  access  to  all  social  groups.  Beside  the fact  that  financial  inclusion  has  been  proven  to  be  a  vital  element  in  alleviating  poverty  by inclusiveness  of  economic  growth  (Demirg    Kunt  Klapper  Singer  &  Van  Oudheusden 2015).  In  line  with  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  which  was  formed  during the  Millennium  Summit in  September  2000  all  the  gathered  world  leaders  have  committed  15  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX  their nations to a new global partnership to reduce extreme poverty. This is a mapping out a time  bound  goals  series  which  is  otherwise  known  as  Millennium  Development  Goals (MDG). During the meeting 2527 September 2015 at United Nations Headquarters in New York  a  new  global  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  were  worked  out.  This Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was worked out from the Millennium Development Goal  (MDGs).  With  17  such  goals  all  United  Nation  (UN)  leaders  have  committed  their nations  between  now  and  2030  to  achieve  all  the  above  goals  in  order  to  provide  a  better world for everyone.  Poverty reduction and economic growth is among the goals that need to be religiously perused for achieving the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) (UN 2015). In juncture to poverty reduction and economic growth a financial inclusion program through the so called social  financing such  as  Zakat Sadaqah  and  Wqaf  has been  used in  Islamic civilisations as vital  element  to  achieve  the  above  objectives  (Demirg    Kunt  et  al.  2015;  Farah  Aida Rashidah  &  Normah  2012).  However  in  this  study  the  main  focus  is  to  show  that  with mobile banking financial  inclusion could  be achieved  faster by improving the efficiency of zakat  distribution.  At  the  same  time  this  can  contribute  towards  poverty  alleviation.  This  is because  mobile  banking  has  been  proven  to  be  significant  factor  in  contributing  towards financial  inclusion  from  the  previous  studies  (Atul  Srivastava  2013;  Etim  2014;  Hinson 2011; Mago 2014). At the same time this also facilitates achieving one of the targets of the Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  itself.  The  relevancy  of  mobile  banking  towards financial inclusion and zakat distribution will be further discussed in the following sections.   MILLENNIUM GOALS SUSTAINABLE DEVELOPMENT GOALS (SDGS) As  mentioned  in  the  introduction  section  above  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs) was formed in  September 2000 during the Millennium Summit.  All  the leaders  gathered on the historic day have committed their nations to a new global partnership with a time bound targets with a deadline of 2015. Malaysia as well is one of  the members of United Nations. Therefore  the  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  was  also  applied  to  Malaysia.  The original 8 goals are as following (United Nations Malaysia 2016) DEVELOPMENT (MDGS) AND 1.  (MDG1) Eradicate extreme hunger and poverty 2.  (MDG2) Achieve Universal Primary Education 3.  (MDG3) Promote gender equality and empower women. 4.  (MDG4) Reduce child mortality 5.  (MDG5) Improve maternal health 6.  (MDG6) Combat HIV/AIDS Malaria and other disease 7.  (MDG7) Ensure environmental sustainability 8.  (MDG8) Developed a global partnership for development    From the Malaysia Millennium Development Goals (MDG) 2015 report it was stated that Malaysia has achieved most of the goals and targets and that the benefits of development have  disperse  to  all  levels  such  as  at  the  national  regional  state  and  in  many  cases community  and individual levels. With respect  to  the  super goal absolute poverty has been largely eliminated. All schoolage children are receiving primary education and most of them would  receive  11  years  of  almost  free  education.  Gender  parity  has  been  over  achieved  in education. Healthcare outcomes in child and maternal mortality rates are at levels comparable to those in developed countries. In the area of environment the government are making good progress on the pledge to reduce the intensity in the carbon emissions. However despite the achievement  there  are  still  challenges  lied  ahead  to  achieve  the  goal  of  inclusive  and  16  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX  sustainable development. Besides there are still small pockets of  relative poverty remained and the effort will need to be intensified to reach the less fortunate amongst our people. For example the remote and hardtoreach communities still have problems in accessing services such  as  education  financial  services  (related  to  financial  inclusion)  healthcare  but innovative ways are being developed to make sure that necessary services will be delivered to them.  During the summit meeting at UN Headquarters in New York 193 Head of States and other leaders had committed their nation to a new global partnership which was built from the previously eight MDG which is also known as the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). The  gathered  leaders  set  revised  targets  to  eradicate  poverty  in  all  forms  and  dimension including  extreme  poverty  which  is  the  greatest  global  challenge.  They  focused  to  acquire sustainable  development is  economic  social  and environmental.  One  of  the  reasons  of  why  SDG  was  formed  is  because  to  fulfill  the unfinished  business  and  to  strive  forward  to  provide  a  better  world  for  everyone. Consequential Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) are 17 as follows three  dimensions  which from Table 1 List of Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs)   SDG 1 End poverty in all its forms everywhere.

Thus in this conceptual paper mobile banking is brought forward as a method in helping to Source www.un.org.my   17  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX The  main  objectives  hence  for  this  study  in  the  following  paragraphs  in  proceeding  improve  the  zakat  distribution  system  in  Malaysia.  Consequently  the  intention  to  improve zakat distribution method could possibly help the financial inclusion in achieving one of the 17 SDG for Malaysia.  sections will be; Firstly to discussing on mobile banking role in efficient distribution of zakat; and  Secondly  to  be  used  as  the  new  method  for  zakat  distribution  among  the  asnaf  as  these  are poor people entrapped mostly in poverty.   METHODOLOGY The methodology in this research has been divided into two phases. Phase one is based on the review  of  the  literature;  while  the  second  phase  is  through  some  preliminary  interviews  of the officers who are entrusted in zakat management and distribution in Malaysia. In order to achieve  the  purpose  of  first  phase  of  this  study  various  literatures  was  collected  and comprehensively reviewed. In the process of reviewing literatures keywords such as    mobile banking        mobile  banking  acceptance        financial  inclusion        zakat  problem  and  issues       role  of  zakat        enhancement  of  zakat  distribution        technology  in  zakat  distribution    Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) was used in collecting the appropriate literature to be used.  Interview sessions were also conducted with District Executive Officers in charge for zakat  distribution  to  acquire  some  pertinent  issues  on  zakat  distribution.  The  time  duration for the interview is  between 30 minutes the least  to  1 hour. The interview  was divided into three areas of scope of the study. First scope is to identify what are the current issues in zakat distribution in term of management technology structure and system. The second scope is to assess whether the zakat officer have heard    Fintech    then a brief explanation was conducted for the officers to gain some understanding regarding    Fintech   . The third scope is assessing the  opinion  of  zakat  officers  on  using  mobile  banking  as  the  new  channel  for  zakat distribution  method  in  Malaysia.  The  interview  is  conducted  in  calm  and  comfortable environment which helps the officers to answer all the three questions comfortably. The questions that were asked to the zakat officer are as followed 1.  In your opinion what are the current issues in zakat distribution? 2.  Have you heard the term    Fintech   ? a.  If the answer is no a brief explanation regarding    Fintech    will be given 3.  What  is  your  opinion  on  using  mobile  banking  as  the  new  channel  of  zakat  distribution method in your respective jurisdictions? Thus with the combination of literature review and interview sessions with the zakat officers regarding  mobile  banking  system  to  be  possibly  seen  as  the  new  channel  of  the  zakat distribution method among asnaf in Malaysia.   ZAKAT AN OVERVIEW  Zakat is one of the five fundamental pillars of Islam. Payment of zakat is an obligatory form of  worship  to  Allah  s.w.t.  Zakat  is  a  Quranic  term  that  signifies  the  specific  obligation  of giving  a  portion  of  an  individual   s  wealth  and  possession  solely  for  charitable  purposes. Literally  zakat  is  derived  from  an  Arabic  word  that  carries  the  meaning  of     that  which purifies     as  well  as     that  which  foster     for  example  growth  and  increased  wealth redistribution among poor (Mannan 1986). On top of that zakat has been mentioned in the Holy  Quran  with  other  meaning  such  as  sadaqah  (donation)  which  also  carries  the connotation  of  giving  voluntarily  in  charity.  According  to  Lembaga  Zakat  Selangor  (2010)  18  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX  zakat  means  spending  some  specific  property  to  be  given  or  paid  to  the  asnaf  as  they  are entitled  to  receive  the  zakat  funds  which  they  are  in  line  with  the  conditions  stipulated  by syara   .  Asnaf  who  are  categorized  into  eight  categories  as  mentioned  in  the  Holy  Quran  in Surah AtTaubah     Alms are for the poor and the needy and those employed to administer zakat (amil) for those whose hearts have been reconciled to the Truth for those in bondage and in debt in the cause of Allah and for the wayfarer    (960)  The asnaf can be categorized into eight types which are respectively; Masakin (poor)  AlFuqara  (needy)  Algharimun  (people  in  debt)  Ibn  sabil  (traveler/wayfarer)  Alriqab (slave)  Muallaf  (convert/reconciled  to  Islam)  Fisabilillah  (doing  something  for  Islam   s cause) and Amil (has the right to collect zakat). The zakat has been divided into two which is zakat alfitr and zakat of wealth. Zakat  alfitr is where Muslim will pay once a year during the month of Ramadhan before the festive season  or  also  known  Eid  Mubarak  (Hari  Raya  Aidilfitri).  While  for  zakat  on  wealth  it includes zakat on income zakat on business zakat on saving zakat on gold and silver zakat on poultry (for example cow goat and so on) zakat on fruits and grain zakat on investment as well as zakat on Employees Provident Fund (EPF). Zakat is a vital element and a centre of Islamic public  finance which covers the moral social  and economic obligations on the  rich fellow  members  of  the  Muslims.  From  the  moral  perspective  zakat  washes  away  the sentiment of greed of the rich. On the other in the social sphere zakat act as a social security net that safeguards provided by Islam to minimise sufferings from the society by making it a social obligation for the rich. While in the economic sphere zakat prevents the accumulation of wealth in the hands of a few (Hairunnizam Wahid 2014).  Zakat Institution in Malaysia In Malaysia the Zakat Institution is under the jurisdiction of each state. Each state  has their own  law  regarding  Zakat  management.  For  example  in  Selangor  Darul  Ehsan  the  highest authority is the Sultan of Selangor which then will be followed by the State Islamic Religious Council (SIRC) or also known as Majlis Agama Islam Selangor (MAIS)1. However there are some states which have also outsourced and privatized their zakat collections like Selangor Wilayah  Persekutuan  Kuala  Lumpur  Pahang  Pulau  Pinang  Melaka  and  Negeri  Sembilan (Ahmad Wahid  & Mohamad 2006). This  privatization has been made due to  ensuring the zakat  management  is  capable  of  providing  quality  service  in  maximizing  customers    satisfaction  through  professional  approach  by  using  latest  technology  while  in  line  with Islamic value propositions.  Role of Zakat in Poverty Alleviation According to AlQardawi (1999) the word    alzakah    has been mentioned thirty times in the Holy  Quran.  Literally  zakat  means  to  grow  and  to  increase  while  in  Shari   ah  zakat  is  a concept referring to the redistribution of wealth prescribed by God to the deserving category of people. Zakat management is measured in terms of efficiency and effectiveness by looking at threefold aims; while helping in poverty alleviation zakat helps to minimise the greediness among  the  Muslims  and  good  oriented  behaviour.  It  is  expected  that  zakat  will  be  able  to purify the income of all the zakat payers and at the same time console the heart of the asnaf by  fulfilling  the  basic  needs  of  the  poor  and  destitute  by  solving  their  socioeconomic                                                            1 Source http//www.zakatselangor.com.my/infolzs/strukturkorporatlzs/   19  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX  problems  such  as  poverty  unemployment  indebtedness  and  unfair  income  distribution among the communities (AlQardawi 1999; Bello 2010). For knowledge sake Islam is not the only one that has the tool to alleviate poverty. Even in other religions they have their own concept and mechanism (Mahamod 2011). For example the concept of almsgiving among Hindus (known as datrtadatrtva) Buddhism (danain) and tithe for the Christians are known systems of charitable acts. Tithe for instance refers to the requirement of paying part of one   s income  to  the  Church  for  the  maintenance  of  the  religious  institution  the  support  of  its ministers (religious administrators) the promotion of its works and the relief of the poor. For further  confirmation  even  previous  studies  have  highlighted  that  zakat  is  an  effective mechanism in tackling social issues such eradication of poverty from country that is actively involved in utilizing zakat for poverty reduction in their own country such as Indonesia and Malaysia  (Embong  Taha  &  Nor  2013;  Farah  Aida  et  al.  2012;  Hassan  2010;  Saad  & Abdullah 2014).  Zakat Collection and Distribution in Malaysia Nowadays  enhanced  used  of  digital  devices  and  financial  technology  and  innovation  has improved how zakat is collected. Since the people do not know how to calculate the amount of zakat they need to pay the institution has provided a calculator on their website which can calculate  the  total  amount  need  to  be  paid  according  to  the  type  of  zakat  such  as  zakat  on income zakat  on business  zakat  on gold  and silver and others. There  is various ways for a Muslim  to  pay  their  zakat.  For  example  Zakat  Selangor  has  provided  four  ways  for  the Muslims in the state to pay zakat2.   The first method is through internet banking. Zakat payers now can pay zakat through their internet banking. Currently there are 10 banks that offer such services which  are RHB Bank (RHB Online banking) AmBank (AmOnline) CIMB Bank (CIMB Clicks) Bank Islam (Bank  Islam  Internet  Banking)  OCBC  Bank  (OCBC  AlAmin  Internet  Banking)  Public Bank  (PB  eBank.com)  Bank  Rakyat  (iRakyat)  EON  Bank  (EON  Bank  Online  Banking) HSBC Bank (HSBC online Banking) and Maybank (Maybank2u).  The second method is through swiping Credit card and Debit Card. Those who would like  to  pay  zakat  using  a  credit  card  can  just  go  to  any  Lembaga  Zakat  Selangor  (LZS)  or Zakat counter and just swipe the card. However the counter only allowed Islamic credit card which has been recognized by the Jabatan Mufti Negeri Selangor. Among the Islamic credit cards that many banks in Malaysia allowed are (1) Bank Islam (Visa & Master) (2) AlTaslif AmBank (Visa & Master) (3) IBank Rakyat (4) AlIkhwan Maybank Islamic (5) AlRajhi Bank  and  (6)  AlAiman  BSN.  For  a  debit  card  all  local  banks  including  international  ones such  as  AlRajhi  Bank  are  allowed  to  be  used  as  long  as  the  card  has  the  logo  of  MEPS BANKCARD and microchip.  The  third  method is  through  MyClear  FPX  (Financial  Process  Exchange).  FPX  is  a service where the payment can be done in real time directly from your internet banking. The last method is used through salary reduction scheme directly through any LZS zakat counter through  Postage  SMS  and  others.  The  salary  reduction  scheme  is  also  known  as     Skim Berkat   .  Issues in Zakat Distribution The  collection  of  zakat  has  been  developing  from  year  to  year  but  the  issue  of  zakat distribution  still  remains  to  be  discussed  and  improved  for  the  benefit  of  the  asnaf  itself (Lubis  et  al.  2011).  Due  to  the  proper  control  and  management  policy  the  Baitul  Maal  of respective states do not allow private participation in Zakat disbursements rather it remains                                                            2 Source http//www.zakatselangor.com.my/   20  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX  under  state  administration.  Distribution  channel  and  method  of  Zakat  disbursements  issue have attracted the attention of Muslim community especially the zakat payers (Hafizah Siti Khalilah Rahayu & Siti Nur Zahirah 2016). This is because the zakat payers would like to know where and to whom does the zakat amount being paid. There are also prior studies that had been done that discuss the issues of the inefficiency of management in zakat distribution (Ahmad  et  al.  2006;  Ahmad  Wahid  &  Noor  2005;  Ibrahim  2008;  Wahid  Ahmad  & Kader  2009).  Most  prior  studies  show  one  similar  view  which  is  issue  of  fast  and  speedy disbursements  whereby  the  collection  of  zakat  is  getting  better  year  by  year  but  the  issue regarding the distribution still not being paid proper attention.  According  to  Azman  et  al.  (2012)  there  are  three  issues.  Zakat  institutions  in Malaysia must pay attention to; which are (1) inefficiency especially in distribution aspects (2)  identifying  and  managing  database  after  tracing  prospective  zakat  payers  and  receivers and  (3)  capacity  building  of  the  asnaf.  In  the  efficiency  aspect  the  zakat  distribution sometimes does not  reach to  the    real     asnaf due to  lack of  knowledge. Secondly the zakat was distributed to the right person but at the same time there are other people who need more zakat compared to the former. Thirdly the element is presence of bureaucracy which would slow  down  the  process  of  application  for  zakat.  For  example  people  who  have     bad    experience with the authority would feel discouraged to apply for seeking financial assistance of zakat.  In the prospective payer   s aspect after discussing with relevant authorities the author believes  that  the  collection  of  zakat  could  be  improved  not  only  identifying  those  who currently pay zakat but also trace down to the prospective and potential zakat payers. This is because  according  to  report  made  by  PPZ/MAIWP  in  2010  the  number  of  Muslims  in  a relatively  rich  states  Selangor  is  approximately  2  million  the  total  of  those  who  pay  zakat only around 160000. Therefore the authority needs to be more proactive by giving a briefing on  the  importance  of  paying  zakat  as  a  Muslim.  Zakat  institution  aim  is  also  to  build  and guide  the  asnaf.  Just  by  giving  the  asnaf  a  sum  of  money  to  buy  their  necessities  is  only  a shortterm solution. The longterm goal is to transform from an asnaf from receiving Zakat to the  one  who  pays  the  zakat  in  long  run.  However  this  could  be  achieved  by  providing education  certain  skills  and  training  that  could  avail  him/her  for  future  employability  or starting businesses. During  a question and answer session on 21st of June and 16th  of July 2017 with  a District  Executive  for  Zakat  Distribution  of  Hulu  Selangor  some  problem  was  identified particularly  on  the  method  of  distribution  of  zakat  to  the  asnaf.  Regarding  the  issue  of  the zakat  where  he/she  doesn   t  get  to  the     real     asnaf  is  not  valid.  The  zakat  officer  stated  that    Firstly the process to be an asnaf is very thorough. The asnaf have to fill in the census form or also known as    borang bancian    which require the information regarding the person. After that  the  zakat  officer  will  go  through  the  form  and  then  personally  will  visit  the  house  to check the information given whether it is true or not. This is because there are cases of fraud where people pretend to be an asnaf in the past would have been avoided   . Regarding the method (monetary) of distributing the zakat there are three ways so far which are (1) cash (2) cheque and (3)  Internet  Banking. The zakat officers also stated that about more than 80% of the asnaf today have bank accounts so mostly the popular method is through internet banking. However there are instances when cash and cheque are needed. For example  a  person  who  involved  in  declared  bankruptcy  does  not  have  a  bank  account.  So mostly they receive the zakat in the form of cash. For example an asnaf applied for zakat to buy a bicycle. The zakat will be given in the form of cheque to avoid any misuse of the zakat received. So the method is different according to the situation.  During  the  second  session  Mr.  Mohd  Syafiq  gives  his  opinion  on  the  suggestion  of using  mobile  banking  as  a  method  of  distributing  the  zakat  to  the  asnaf.  Before  Mr.  Mohd  21  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX  Syafiq gives his opinion a brief explanation on how Fintech and the technology innovation in the  financial  industry  has  changed  our  daily  routine  is  given  to  himself.  According  to  Mr. Mohd  Syafiq     Firstly  it  is  good  because  it  will  provide  an  alternative  method  for  Zakat Institutions. Secondly most of the asnaf that he has been dealing with are using smartphone nowadays  which  will  be  easier  for  the  Zakat  Institutions  to  apply  the  mobile  banking services.  On  top  of  that  zakat  will  be  introducing     Vcash   .     Vcash     is  specifically  for  the person who urgently needs cash. The asnaf will receive an SMS from the zakat system. Then he  can  go  to  the  bank  and  show  the  SMS  received  from  the  zakat  to  receive  some  cash. However this service is still new therefore for now if I   m not sure whether it is available or not.  Thirdly  regarding  the  issue  where  asnaf  called  the  Zakat  Institution  to  complain  why they  have  still  not  received  the  zakat  even  though  it  is  overdue  and  has  been  distributed  to other recipients. Sometimes due to communication breakdown the asnaf failed to know even that they have received the zakat or not.     Enhancement of Zakat Distribution in Malaysia There  are  literatures  that  discusses  on  the  enhancement  of  zakat  distribution  especially  in term  of  management.  For  example  Lubis  M.  Yaacob  N.  I.  Omar  Y.  Dahlan  A.  & Rahman  A.  (2011  April)  conducted  a  study  on  the  enhancement  of  zakat  distribution management  system.  The  study  proposed  the  usage  of  Geographical  Information  System (GIS)  approach.  GIS  is  an  advanced  system  that  utilize  longitudinal  and  latitude  and alleviating  variable  in  presenting  data  by  automation  calculation  through  spatial  result analysis that will help in supporting decisionmaking process. The system also has been used in various sector such as archaeology natural resources management agriculture and so on. Particularly  in  Malaysia  the  system  has  been  adopted  in  forest  harvesting  (Yusmah  & Rodziah  2005).  The  authors  also  thoroughly  explain  how  this  system  would  help  in improving the efficiency of zakat distribution with a following diagram.

R. A. Awang S. N. B. & Mahmood A. B. (2015) suggested to fully  utilize  the  role  of  Mosque  in  helping  to  improve  the  Muslim  community  especially  in the aspect of zakat distribution. Therefore a conceptual solution was proposed by the authors which is a system that is collaborated with network of mosque known as eZakat4u. The main purpose of the system is to  improve the efficiency  of distribution of zakat  among the  asnaf with the collaboration of networkofmosque (NoM) Marang District Office and MAIDAM (Majlis Agama Islam dan Adat Melayu Terengganu) itself. The author further explained the Business  Model  Canvas  (BMC)  for  the  NoM  and  eZakat4u  system  through  the  table2 below.  Technology enhancement in zakat distribution channel As been mentioned in  the earlier section zakat  collection and distribution method by  Zakat Institutions has improved so much due to the technology factor. Zakat collection channel has improved by the year. During the old days people use to go to zakat institutions itself to pay the  zakat  or  they  will  go  to  the  mosque  near  to  their  neighbourhood  to  pay  zakat  because usually amil (person who has the right to collect zakat will be there). Now days there are lots of channels provided by the Zakat Institutions for the zakat payers to pay zakat. For example in Selangor Lembaga Zakat Selangor (LZS) provide various of method to pay zakat such as  through  internet  banking  credit  and  debit  card  MyClear  FPX  salary  reduction  scheme postage SMS and others. While for the asnaf they have been receiving zakat in the form of cash cheque and now days things are  getting more easier with  internet  banking where they can save time and cost. However this is for the financial assistance (bantuan kewangan). For the  assistance  such  as  food  rice  and  others  zakat  officers  themselves  will  deliver  to  the asnaf. Thus in  this study  the  focus is  more on the channel  for zakat  distribution in  term  of financial assistance.

International Journal of Management and Commerce Innovations 3(1) 264268.    23   Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX   FINANCIAL TECHNOLOGY (Fintech) Technology  has  changed  how  people  interact  with  each  other.  For  example  in  term  of communication.  During  the  old  days  people  use  letters  old  phone  public  phones  pager  or meeting directly facetoface to communicate to each other. This evolution also applies in the financial industry in  the  aspect  of how consumer conduct  their financial transaction in  their daily life. Financial institution has evolved the services from deskcounter to webbased and then further advanced to the internet and digital method. People in the industry or people who have  knowledge  in  the  financial  industry  now  days  refer  this  as     Fintech   .  However  the services provided by the financial institutions such as online banking mobile banking apps and  so  on  is  only  a  fraction  of     Fintech   .  Currently  there  is  no  consensus  or  unanimously term of    Fintech    which is accepted by all. The table3 below shows definitions of    Fintech    from various literatures. Author  (Bettinger 1972) p.62 (Micu & Micu 2016) p. 380 (Shim & Shin 2016) p. 170 (Maier 2016) p. 143 (  i  insk   Krabec & Venegas 2016) p. 1 (Lon  arski 2016) p. 2 (Shen & Huang 2016) p. 221 (Xie Zou & Liu 2016) p. 241 & 250 (Jun & Yeo 2016) p. 159 (Kim Choi Park & Yeon 2016) p. 1058 (Xie & Zou 2013) p. 1  Table 3 Definition of Fintech  Definition      FINTECH  is  an  acronym  which  stands  for  financial  technology  combined  bank expertise with modern management science technique and the computer   .    Financial Technology also known as FinTech is a new sector in the finance industry that incorporates the whole plethora of technology that is used in finance to facilitate trades  corporates  business  or  interaction  and  services  provided  to  the  retail consumer       Fintech  is  an  emerging  financial  services  sector  that  includes  thirdparty  payment MMF  insurance  products  risk  management  authentication  and  peertopeer  (P2P) lending       Driven by technological advances new service model has developed in the financial industry  which  offer  additional  opportunities  to  customers.  Under  the  common denominator     fintech     these  new  businesses  aim  to  challenge  existing  financial institutions  by  using  technology  to  deliver  value  to  the  customer  in  an  alternative way   .    FinTech  is  an  economic  industry  composed  of  companies  that  use  technology  to make financial services more efficient   .    In addition to this a particular evolution and use of technology (commonly referred these days as fintech) in finance are disrupting traditional business model in financial markets as well as bringing about new and unchartered risk territories   .    Internet finance which is often referred to as    digital finance    and    Fintech    outside China was coined by Ping Xie and Chuanwei Zou (2012)       Internet finance is a spectral concept. It covers all form of financial transaction and financial  intermediaries  and  markets  such  as  commercial  banks  securities  firms insurance  companies  and  stock  exchange  to  the  scenario  under  Walrasian equilibrium  (where  neither  financial  intermediaries  nor  markets  exist)  caused  by  the impacts  of  internets  technologies     and     We  think  internet  finance  and  Fintech  are essentially different word for the same concept   .    Recent advances in information and communication technology (ICT) have led to the rapid  development  and  expansion  of  new  and  innovative  financial  services  often termed FinTech       Fintech is a service sector which uses mobilecentered IT technology to enhance the efficiency  of  the  financial  system.  As  a  term  it  is  a  compound  of     finance     and    technology    and collectively refers to industrial changes forged from the convergence of financial services and IT   .    Besides  indirect  financing  via  commercial  banks  and  direct  financing  through security markets a third way to conduct financial activities will emerge which we call    internet finance      .  24  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX  (Barberis 2014) p. 5 (Ernst & Young & Langley 2014) p. 1    FinTech  refers  to  the  application  of  technology  within  the  financial  industry.  The sector  covers  a  wide  range  of  activities  from  payment  (e.g.  Contactless)  to  financial data  and  analysis  (e.g.  Credit  scoring)  financial  software  (e.g.  risk  management) digitized  processes  (e.g.  authentication)  and  perhaps  most  wellknown  to  the  wider public payment platforms (e.g. P2P lending).       Technology  applied  to  financial  services  (Fintech)  has  a  significant  impact  on  our daily  lives  from  facilitating  payments  for  goods  and  services  to  providing  the infrastructure essential to the operation of the world   s financial institutions    Source Schueffel P. (2016). Taming the Beast A Scientific Definition of Fintech. Journal of Innovation Management JIM 4(4) 32   54.  From the table 3 above it is fair to say that each literature has their own definition of    Fintech   . There also literatures that share similar views for example Bettinger (1972) refer fintech  as  financial  technology  combined  with  modern  bank  expertise  modern  science technique  and  the  computer.  This  is  similar  to  Barberis  (2014)  which  refer  fintech  as  the application  of  technology  within  the  financial  industry  that  cover  wide  range  of  activities from  payment  to  financial  data  analysis  financial  software  digitized  processes  and  wellknown  to  wider  public  such  as  payment  platform  for  example  P2P  lending  and  others. However all the definition has two commonalities that they shared from each other which is all  has  (1)  financial  industry  involved  (2)  technology  innovation  and  (3)  enhancing  or facilitating the financial activities in the broadest sense.  Schueffel P. (2016) had done a semantic analysis study on the definition of    FinTech. It was found that (1) four of the ten discriminable scholarly definitions claim fintech to be a sector or industry (2) two of the ten definitions define it as a technology (3) three sources view fintech as a type of action and it can be a business services and broad activities in the financial industry. From the study the following definition of    FinTech    is proposed    Fintech is a new financial industry that applies technology to improve financial activities    Therefore in this study the main objective is to propose the use of mobile banking to further improve the efficiency of zakat distribution in Malaysia.  Proposed Distribution Method Mobile Banking The  collection  methods  is  already  transforming  rapidly  from  year  to  year.  From  traditional method which is from counter collection to the application of sophisticated internet banking and so on. However technology innovation for the disbursements of zakat is not on the same level  as  the  collection  process.  Therefore  in  this  study  Mobile  banking  (mbanking)  is suggested as a proposal of the new distribution channel of zakat to the asnaf. Mobile banking features which are mobility user friendly costsaving anytime and anywhere could be one of  the  solutions  to  tackle  the  issue  of  inefficiency  in  zakat  distribution.  On  top  of  that  if mobile banking is applied for the distribution channel surely the collaboration between banks and zakat institutions is needed. There are bank   s management that is focusing in the area of mobile  banking.  For  example  Maybank  is  now  focusing  in  the  area  of  mobile  banking because  of  the  agenda  of     FinTech     which  have  tremendous  industry  opportunities  as mentioned  by  Datuk  Muhammad  bin  Ibrahim  who  is  currently  the  Governor  of  Negara Malaysia. The application of mobile banking will not only help to strengthen the distribution method  of  zakat  but  also  solve  many  challenges  of  income  inequalities  from  the  economic sphere of the social changes in terms of increasing urban and rural poverty.  As  been  mentioned  in  the  earlier  section  Mobile  Banking  can  be  operated  in  many ways  such  as  SMS  Web  Online  Banking  and  Apps  that  is  provided  by  the  Banks.  Mobile banking can help to improve the zakat distributions in the following ways 1.  Credit verification  25  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX  a.  Asnaf (people who are eligible to receive zakat) often had problem where they had to verify whether they had receive the zakat from the Zakat Institutions. They had to call the zakat institutions and it takes a lot time. If it happens every time it can be  very  annoying.  With  Mobile  banking  technology  structure  combined  with Zakat  system  they  could  developed  an  SMS  system  that  is  specifically  to  notify the asnaf that they had receive the zakat. b.  An  Apps  also  could  be  developed  by  the  expertise  of  technology  team  from  the Banks  combined  with  expertise  from  zakat  distribution  management  team.  For example through the apps just by entering the identification card no (IC) they can check and manage whether they had receive the zakat or not. If this matter could be resolve it could possibly greatly benefit all the asnaf.  2.  Technology development There are cases of asnaf where they require financial help urgently and usually there will go to the  Zakat  institution to  receive financial help  in  the form cash (if it   s a  financial matter). Thus with the advancement of technology now days the zakat institutions could possibly generate a system message to the asnaf where it could be used to withdraw cash at the spot at any banks which are collaborated with the Zakat Institutions. This could be helpful in case of there is shortage of cash from Zakat Institutions side.  Mobile Banking Role in Financial Inclusion Financial inclusion is recognized and supported to be playing a critical role in developing and improving the economic and social conditions in developing countries. Literature reviews and previous  studies  undertaken  encompassing  theoretically  empirically  and  with  evidence suggested  that  financial  inclusion  has  the  potential  to  reduce  absolute  poverty  promotes growth.  This  is  reflected  amongst  the  aforementioned  Millennium  Development  Goals (MDGs)  as  well  (Chibba  2008;  Setboonsarng  &  Parpiev  2008).Thus  by  achieving  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  implied  the  viewpoint  that  social  and  economic growth  and  development  can   t  take  place  if  there  is  a  large  part  of  the  society  that  is overlooked from the economic sphere in national planning. This is because through financial inclusion the poor and low income person can enjoy access to finance at a reasonable cost a safe place to  keep saving and having more options to  choose. The true purpose of financial inclusion  is  to  promote  inclusive  development  through  socially  responsible  pursuit  of globalization which reflects towards poverty alleviation.   Therefore for all these reasons financial inclusion is important to serve as a means to address  poverty  alleviation  and  related  issues  of  equity  and  access  (Chibba  2009). Furthermore  with  the  advancement  of  Millennium  Development  Goals  (MDGs)  to Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs) financial inclusion is important than ever in order to provide a better world for everyone.  In  the  early  stage  of  use  of  financial  technology  (FinTech)  and  mobile  banking adoption  research  in  Malaysia  Amin  et  al.  (2006)  defined  SMSbanking  as  banking transaction via mobile phone in the form of short message(SMS). Amin et al. (2007) further defined  mobile  banking  as  banking  transaction  such  as  checking  balance  latest  transaction and  credit  card  transaction  through  mobile  phone.  Thye  Goh  et  al.  (2014)  defined  mobile banking  to  financial  transaction  such  as  checking  account  balance  bill  payment  and  other financial services (p2p landing or p2p payment) done via mobile phone tablets or any use of technological devices that have equivalent functions. Valentine (2011) further elaborated that the channel for mobile banking services can be categorized as    triple play    which is through SMSbased  webbased  and  mobile  Apps.  For  example  Maybank  has  Maybank2u  apps  for their consumer CIMB bank has CIMB Click apps and Bank Islam has Bank Islam iinfo and  26  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX  TAP  Mobilebankingi.  All  these  financial  services  innovation  in  Malaysia  has  given  a  lot benefit to the consumer by reducing cost and less time consuming.  According  to  Etim  (2014)  any  financial  activities  that  are  conducted  via  mobile phone or mobile devices is generally referred as mobile money. This is supported by previous author  (Porteous  2006a;  Weber  &  Darbellay  2010a)  which  categorize  mobile  money  into mobile banking (mbanking) and mobile money (mpayment). There are two models that are significant  in  the  SubSahara  Africa  (SSA)  region  which  is  the  additive  model  and transformative model. The additive model allows the account bank users to use their mobile phones  to  access  the  bank  account  and  other  services  provided  such  as  checking  account balance  transfer  fund  paying  bills  and  others.  While  the  transformative  model  gives financial  access  to  the  unbanked  towards  financial  products  without  bank  accounts  through mobile phones based on the services provided by the MNO   s (Mobile network providers) and Microfinance Institutions (MFIs) (Porteous 2006b; Weber & Darbellay 2010b). An example of  the  transformative  model  is  MPESA.  MPESA  is  a  mobile  payment  services  that  was formed  by  Safaricom  and  its  parent  organization  Vodafone  in  Kenya  in  March  2007.  In Malaysia the mobile payment (mpayment) service is still developing. For example there are various mobile wallet payment services that are offered in Malaysia such as Visa Checkout Masterpass CIMB pay Maybank pay MOL Pay Samsung Pay and Alipay. However most of these services offered require the person to  have a bank account  which is  the contrast  of MPESA.  Mobile  banking  was  proven  to  be  playing  a  significant  role  in  improving  financial inclusion in other countries. For example in Ghana there are a large number of people who live below the international poverty line which is 1% and most of them do not have financial access to the financial product or services. However through mobile banking about 90% of the  people  now  have  financial  access  (Hinson  2011).  With  mobile  banking  the  large population of Ghana now have financial access towards financial products just by using their mobile phones. This is very convenient for them since most of them are living in a rural area and  it  is  hard  for  them  to  go  to  the  main  cities  just  to  have  a  financial  access  to  their  bank accounts and other financial services or product. On top of that Mago (2014) investigated the impact of mobile banking on financial inclusion in Masvingo province Zimbabwe. Majority of  the  respondents  found  that  mobile  banking  is  benefited  them  even  it  has  not  been  fully utilized  yet.  Furthermore  the  significance  of  mobile  banking  to  financial  inclusion  is threefold.  Firstly  it  provides  financial  access  to  the  underserved  population  and  unbanked location. Secondly it will improve the regulatory and competition policy in the country itself. Lastly it gives an insight on the fundamental concept of the services. However there are still people  who  are  not  aware  on  the  impact  of  mobile  banking  on  sustainable  growth  and possible contribution towards financial inclusion (Atul Srivastava 2013).

Perhaps  due  to  the  reason  that Malaysia is better wired than elsewhere. There is a    usage    gap between internet and mobile banking  in  Malaysia.  Report  by  Asia  Institute  of  Finance  (2016)  also  stated  that  the consumer in Malaysia still lack awareness on how the digital technology can offer and benefit them. Besides that it was found that security and privacy concern are the top two drivers and inhibitor of digital banking adoption. From the above discussion there are various views on the definition itself of mobile banking. However for the purpose of this study mobile banking is defined as any financial transaction (checking account balance paying bills fund transfer and others) that could  be done via mobile phone through all the channel  (SMSbased webbased and mobile Apps) provided by the financial institutions.   CONCLUSION Overall the government in Malaysia has done a very good effort in achieving the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs). However there are still some unfinished business of financial inclusion that needs to be looked at such as eradication of extreme poverty and hunger and B40  groups.  With  the  introduction  of  Sustainable  Development  Goals  (SDGs)  which  were further extended from the 8 goals to the 17 goals that cover various aspects thus far further improvement is needed in order to provide a better world for everyone regardless of different sociocultural background.   It  was  proven  previously  from  the  previous  studies  that  mobile  banking  has  been  a tool of financial inclusion in other nations such as SubSahara African Region Bangladesh India  and  other  countries.  The  Financial  inclusion  is  proven  to  be  playing  a  vital  role  in achieving poverty alleviation and providing financial access. However the era of Fintech has brought opportunity and therefore in this study financial inclusion is being made easy through mobile  banking.  This  would  be  an  application  of  technology  innovation  in  the  Islamic financial sector.   There  is  no  argument  otherwise  that  zakat  management  particularly  helps  in alleviating  poverty  in  Malaysia.  However  there  are  still  some  issues  that  need  to  addressed and eventually be improved. In this study we focus on the zakat distribution channel method so  that  it  can  be  related  with  mobile  banking.  Therefore  in  this  study  usage  of  mobile banking  is  suggested  to  be  as  the  new  channel  for  zakat  disbursement  method.  However  it was found that particularly in Malaysia the number of subscriber for mobile banking is very low compared to internet banking due to reasons mentioned in previous paragraphs that need to be surveyed and field based investigated in next phase of this empirical study. Thus it is our recommendation that in the future studies on the factors that would influence the adoption of mobile banking for zakat distribution among asnaf need to be undertaken.    28  Proceeding of the 5th International Conference on Management and Muamalah 2018 (ICoMM 2018) eISBN 9789672122XXX and 5(3) Business Economics Administration Azman A.
