ABSTRACT Despite the fact that financial institutions have identified the SME sector as a fast growing  sector  in  the  country  there  are  several  constraints  serving  as  bottlenecks  to  SMEs  in accessing  finance  from  financial  institutions.  This  study  examines  difficulties  SMEs  face  in accessing loan difficulties financial institutions face in lending to SMEs and the impact of loan on the profitability of SMEs. In conducting this study questionnaires were administered to SMEs. Credit officers in the selected banks were interviewed.  The following major findings came to the fore; Interest rate on loan to the SMEs is extremely high Repayment periods on loans to SMEs are too short making it very difficult to embark on any developmental or expansion projects most SMEs  do  not  understand  terms  and  conditions  and  also  oblivious  of  the  interpretation  of  the percentage charged on the loans. It was also found out that small business owners normally give false  information  when  accessing  loan  from  financial  institutions.  The  study  suggested  that government should institute some form of tax incentives to financial institutions involved in SME lending  and  formulate  regulatory  laws  to  help  loans  recovery.  SME  associations  must  be established to unite them and serve as guarantors whenever loans are accessed.  KEYWORDS SME debt financing financial institutions   INTRODUCTION  Small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs)  are  the  backbone  of  all  economies.  They  are considered  as  key  component  and  players  in  national  growth  and  development.  They  are  often described as proficient and prolific job creators the  seeds  of  big  businesses  and  the  lubricant  of  national  economic  engines. The  dynamic  role they  play  in  developing  countries  have  been  exceedingly  emphasized they are a major source of economic development in developing countries.  They  also  play  a  key  role  in  the  economic  development  of  developed  countries. According to Kayanula and Quartey (2000) SMES  seem  to  have  advantages  over  their  big  size  competitors  in  that  they  are  able  to  adapt  more  easily  to  market  conditions  and  they  are also  able  to  withstand  hostile  economic  conditions  because  of  their  flexible  nature. They  are labour  intensive  and  more   likely  to  succeed  in  smaller  urban  centres  and  rural  areas  where  they contribute  to a more  equitable distribution in the regional wealth thus slowing  down the  flow  of  migration from rural  to  urban areas.    In  recognition  of  the enormous potential roles  of  SMEs in economic development  measures  and  programmes  have been  designed  and  policies  enunciated  and  executed  by  successive  governments donor agencies  and multilateral agencies  to  encourage  their  development  and  16 ISSN 20535821(Print) ISSN 2053583X(Online)   International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship   Research Vol.3No.2pp.1630 March 2015              Published by European Centre for Research Training and Development UK (www.eajournals.org) to  make  them  more  vibrant yet the challenge of access to debt finance has not been addressed. One of such programmes is Ghana Enterprise Development  Commission(GEDC)  which  aims  at  assisting  Ghanaian  businessmen  to  enter  into  fields  where  foreigners  mainly  operated  but  became  available  to  Ghanaian  after  the  Alliance  Compliance  order  in  1970.  Another one was Private  Enterprise  Foundation (PEF)  it was   established to train managers of SMEs Micro   finance  and  Small  Loans  Centre (MASLOC)  which  were  to  establish  branches  in  all regions   to  provide micro  finance  services to small businesses was established only to see the light of misappropriation and funds being directed to political party members. Most of the schemes were not  restricted  as  a  result  most  beneficiaries  were  the  big  companies    liquidation  of  the  lending schemes  was  difficult  for  example  Austria  Import  Support  Program  in  collaboration  with  the government  of  Ghana  provided  financial  assistance  to  about  twenty  businesses  in  Ghana  to purchase machinery equipment and raw material from Austria. This facility was issued in 1990 and supposed to be liquidated in 1996 but as at the year 2001 only one beneficiary had paid. It  has  been  worrisome  that  despite all the  incentives  policies  programmes  and  support  aimed  at  revamping  SMEs  they  have   performed  rather  below  expectation. Most of the lending schemes are accompanied with directives and mainly imports. They often cited reason for their failure as inadequate finance. According to Parker et al. (1995)  world  bank  study  found  that  about  90%  of  small  enterprises  surveyed  stated  that  credit  was  a  major  constraint to  investment.  Access to finance is limited because financial institutions perceive SMEs to have high default rates and risks.     It  has  been  shown that  there  is  a  high  corelation  between  the  degree  of  poverty  hunger  unemployment  economic  well  being (standard  of  living)  of  the  citizens  of countries  and  vibrancy  of  the  respective  country   s  SMEs (Onugu 2005).  If  Ghana  is to solve its  main  problem of unemployment and  able  to  secure  employment  for   the  increasingly  population  and  improve  the  standard  of  living  of  it  citizens then one  sure  way  is  to   vigorously  pursue  the  development  of  SMEs through the provision of adequate finance.  It  is  time  to  address issues stagnating SMEs  given  the  aggravating  level  of  poverty  in  Ghana  and  the  need  to  achieve a  better Ghana economy.  It  is  in  view  of  this  that  this  study  seeks  to  explore  the  challenges    of    SMEs    in    accessing  debts  finance  in  the  Ghanaian  financial  market  and  to recommend some solutions to these problems.    LITERATURE REVIEW  Challenges of SMEs in accessing loans in financial institutions The fact that SMEs have not made the desired impact on the Ghana economy in spite of all the efforts and support of succeeding administrations and governments gives a cause for concern. It underscores the conviction that there are fundamental issues or problems which face SMEs but which up till now have either not been addressed at all or have not been wholesomely tackled. A review  of  literature  reveals  indeed  that  access  to  loan  is  the  main  problem.  The  following researchers confirmed it.   Lack of adequate financial resources places significant constraints on SME development. Cook and  Nixson  (2000)  observe  that  notwithstanding  the  recognition  of  the  role  of  SMEs  in  the ISSN 20535821(Print) ISSN 2053583X(Online)  17  International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship   Research Vol.3No.2pp.1630 March 2015              Published by European Centre for Research Training and Development UK (www.eajournals.org) development process in many developing countries SMEs development is always constrained by the limited availability of financial resources to meet a variety of operational and investment needs.   SME owners in Europe when asked about the most important problems they faced they mention access  to  finance  first  ahead  of  issues  such  as        taxation        lack  of  skill  access  to  public procurements unfair competition labour law  access to the single market  and so forth (European Commission  Report  2008).    In  Ghana  the  major  problem  face  by  SMEs  is  access  to  credit (Boapeah 1993).  A few of the challenges of SMEs in accessing loans are discussed below;    Stringent conditions  In  many  cases  SMEs  are  not  able  to  access  loans  from  financial  institutions  because  of  the conditions attached to the loan. Financial  institutions  refuse  to lend  to some small  enterprises because  they  do  not  have  acceptable collateral. Previous researchers have suggested that bank financing will depend upon whether the lending can be secure by collateral (Storey 1994; Berger and Udell 1998). Collateral  in  the  form  of  assets  is  only   a  way  for  financial  institutions to recover  their  money  in  event  of  default. Without  adequate  collateral  banks  have  limited  or  no  ways  to  protect  the  loan  assets.  The  financial  institutions  demand  collateral  in  order  to  mitigate  the  risk  associated  with  the loans. SMEs with good business plans not back by adequate collateral are normally refuse credit because financial institutions cannot afford to take any chances of nonrepayment of loans. Financial institutions always insist that this collateral requirement is fulfil.  Strict vetting of credit applications    Banks  are  also  strict  when  vetting  credit  applications  of  small  businesses.   According to Appenteng the vice president of the Association  of Ghana  Industries (AGI) (2010) banks  are  more  stringent  when  appraising  credit  applications  of  SMES  hence  subjecting  them  to  cumbersome  credit  procedures.  The procedure of vetting loan applications waste so much time that loans are delayed and issued when intended purposes have expired.  Short period for repayment  At times loans received are less than requested and short periods are giving for the repayment of the loans. Ricupero (2002) states that commercial bank loans extended to SMEs are often limited to a period far too short to pay off any sizeable investment and Abereijo and Fayomi (2005) notes that the majority of commercial bank loans offered to SMEs are often limited to a period far too short to pay off any sizeable investment.   Unaware of factors financial institutions take into considerations Small enterprises do not  know   factors  financial  institutions  take into  consideration  before  lending  to  its  customers. Financial  institutions  generally  do  not  lend  to  whoever  would  be  willing  to  pay  higher  interest  rates  because  doing  so  would  attract  riskier  borrowers. They have ways of checking credit worthiness of their customers.  They lend to  businesses  which  they  are  convince  that  they  have  the  ability  to repay  the  loan (Ocansey 2006).  It  has  been  observed  that  a  key  factor  that  make  the  SMEs  unable  to  access  financial  assistance  was  the  lack  of  understanding  in  the  operations  of  banks  and  vice  versa.  Consequently in effect SMEs suffer from the frustration of delay in accessing bank credits or denied completely.      18 ISSN 20535821(Print) ISSN 2053583X(Online)   International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship   Research Vol.3No.2pp.1630 March 2015              Published by European Centre for Research Training and Development UK (www.eajournals.org) Banks demand things like audited financial information convincing business plan and bankable proposal   before they lend to small business. Most small enterprises do not have technical capacity to do these things. This makes it difficult for them to access loans.   Government institutions and development partners to help SMEs  Successively Governments after independence have set up institutions to assist SMEs because of the  persistent  financing  gap;  Governments  and  development  partners  to  stimulate  the  flow  of financing  to  SMEs  over  and  above  what  is  available  from  exiting  private  sector  financial institutions have launched many interventions. The problem is that most SMEs are not aware of the existence of these institutions.Schemes introduced  by  government  either alone or with  the support of donor agencies to increase the flow of financing to SMEs. The schemes have included the following      Business Assistance Fund The Business Assistance Fund was operated in the 1990s to provide direct government lending to the SME sector. The program was widely seen to have been abused politically with most of the loans going to perceives government supporters.      Ghana  Investment  Fund  In  2002  the  Ghana  investment  Fund  Act  (Act  616)  was  passed  to establish a fund to provide for the grant of credit facilities by designated financial institutions to companies. However the scheme was never implemented.     Export Development and Investment Fund (EDIF) Under this scheme companies with export programs can borrow up to $500000 over a fiveyear period at a subsidized cedi interest rate of 15%.  While  the  scheme  is  administered  through  banks  the  EDI  board  maintains  tight  control approving all the credit recommendations of the participating banks. (Mensah 2004)  Guarantee Facilities Section 13 of the  Loans  Act  of 1970 (Act  335)  empowers the Government  of Ghana  (GoG) to provide  government  guarantee  to  any  external  financiers  who  wish  to  advance  funds  to  any Ghanaian organization and the terms of such facility require the provision of guarantee from the Government.  Guarantee  facilities  are  contingent  liabilities  of  the  Government.  The  onus  for repaying the facility lies with the borrower and not the Government. The facility crystallizes and becomes liability due from GoG if the borrower is unable to honour his/her loan obligation and the Government is called upon to settle the facility as a guarantor.  Currently the only governmentsupported loan guarantee scheme in operation is operated by Exim guaranty Company which is majorityowned by the Bank of Ghana (Mensah 2004).  Financial Illiteracy Financial  illiteracy  and  complexities  is  a  major  problem  throughout  the  world  and  has  been identified as one of the key reasons why SMEs are unable to access loans. Most SMEs which are not able to properly comprehend the lengthy terms and conditions are also oblivious of the interpretation of the percentage charged on the loans and become alarmed when the repayment periods tend to be longer than expected.  It is thought that microfinance institutions are doing a good job by providing loan facilities for SMEs but they sometimes do not tell the truth. Some of these institutions take advantage of their educational weakness and for one reason or the other refuse to give details and explain the interest ISSN 20535821(Print) ISSN 2053583X(Online)  19  International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship   Research Vol.3No.2pp.1630 March 2015              Published by European Centre for Research Training and Development UK (www.eajournals.org) rates and its implications on the loans lend to small business. This becomes a problem when they have to repay the loans. (Donkor 2012) Challenges of financial institutions in lending to SMEs  The  financial  system  in  every  country  plays  a  key  role  in  the  development  and  growth  of  the economy. Lemuel (2009) stated that the traditional commercial banks that are key players in the financial systems of nearly every economy have the potential to pull financial resources together to  meet  the  credit  never  there  is  a  huge  gap  between  supply  capacities  of  the  banks  and  the demanding needs of SMEs. Financial institutions in Ghana face many challenges which prevent them from lending to SMEs. Some of the constraints of financial institutions are discussed below;    High transaction Costs Like  all  other  businesses  banks  incur  costs  to  do  a  business  they  incur  costs  to  assess  credit process and monitor loans. Transaction costs directly related to profitability. The higher the cost of  processing  a  transaction  the  lower  is  the  return.  SMEs     loans  often  consume  time  to  assess monitor and manage. According to Zavatta (2008) irrespective of risk profile considerations the handling of SME financing is an expensive business. Many bankers perceive that small business require much more advisory supporthand than large corporate client does. All these involve cost.    Lack of reliable information Small  business  owners  are  not  transparent  or do  not  open  up  of  their  businesses  to  outsiders.  For  some  reasons  they  do  not  give  the  true  information  about  their  assets  liabilities  profits  and  others  to  tax  collectors  their  employees  and  outsiders.      Access  to  external  finance  depends  on  an  open  trade  of  information  between  the  one  receiving  the  fund  and  the  giver.  More  transparency  and  better  dialogue  between  SMEs  and  financial  institutions  can  help  to  solve  some  of  the  challenges   SMEs  face  in  accessing  loans. The  refusal  of  small  business  owners  to  give  right  information  about  their  business  to  outsiders  make  it  difficult  to  assess  creditworthiness  and  also  difficult  to  lend.  If  true  and  quality  information  are    supplied    to    banks    and    other    financial    institutions    it    would    be    easy    to    assess  creditworthiness  of  businesses  and  reduce  risk  of  default. This  would  also  enable  financial  institutions  to   give  small  enterprises  good  terms  of  payments. In Ricupero (2002) part of the reluctance of banks to lend SMEs is the banks    inability to evaluate risk because of lack of reliable financial information.    Lack of adequate financial statements  Most SMEs do not prepare financial statements. SMEs are not requiring by law to prepare financial statements. Even in highly developed economies such as those in the European Union SMEs are not required to report on their financial performance in a standardized manner if they do not reach a significant threshold in total assets turnover and/or number of employees. This means that many SMEs in developed and developing countries do not produce reliable financial information which could be used by creditor or investors. (Ricupero 2002). Bass and Schrooten (2005) concluded that the lack of reliable information leads to comparably high interest  rates even if a longterm relationship between borrower and bank exists. In a situation like this having audited financial statements play a major role. Audited financial statements are very useful in accessing credit from financial institutions. Often banks require audited financial statements before granting credit. For 20 ISSN 20535821(Print) ISSN 2053583X(Online)   International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship   Research Vol.3No.2pp.1630 March 2015              Published by European Centre for Research Training and Development UK (www.eajournals.org) example Berry and Brian (1994) found that lenders in the UK pay much attention to accounting information  in  order  to  deal  with  the  loan  applications  of  small  firms.  Given  the  reduced information risk arising from audited financial statements potential lending institutions may offer low  interest  rates  as  well.  In  other  words  audited  financial  statements  improve  borrower   s credibility  and  therefore  reduce  risk  for  lenders.  Sacerdoti  (2005).  The  ability  of  borrowers  to provide  adequate  financial  statements  and  the  establishment  of  credible  credit  bureaus  and financial data bases are essential to encourage the expansion of credit promote competition in the banking systems and thereby reduce the cost of credit to borrowers. In many countries banks are reluctant  to  extend  credit  to  SMEs  because  of  the  inability  of  the  borrower  to  produce  formal financial statements and audited accounts. Strengthening accounting  and auditing is  therefore a key  requirement  for  widening  access  to  banks  by  SMEs.  In  many  countries  however  the accounting profession is not well regulated and the quality of accounts varies widely hampering transparency.    Opaqueness of Small Enterprise  Banks face two basic problems the opaqueness in small enterprises and small size of transactions. They do not want to relinquish control over to outsiders and they personally want take control of every aspect  of their business.  According to  Zavatta (Op. cit.) one of the problems of financial institutions in lending fund has to do with unwillingness of small enterprises to relinquish control over the company to outsiders. It is quite widespread among SME. Most SMEs do not keep proper books of accounts.   Credit Rating Agency One of the challenges that financial institutions face in lending to SMEs is to make an accurate risk assessment of loans applications without generating high cost per application. One of the ways of  assessing  risk  of  loans  is  using  credit  rating  agency  or  credit  bureau.  Sacerdoti  (2005)  in advanced countries databases centralizing information on borrowers are frequently established by the private sector; however in a number of continental European countries including France and Italy these have been established and maintained by central bank.  The credit rating agencies publish general  financial details of many companies together with a credit rating. They also produce a special report on creditworthiness of companies if requested for fees. In the absence of credit rating agencies it has become difficult to assess creditworthiness of customers  and  it  is  costly  to  generate  information  about  the  repayment  morale  of  potential enterprise. Information provided by rating agencies help to reduce risk of default. This information infrastructure is not common in Africa. Zavatta (Op. cit.) the       information infrastructure       it is still largely undeveloped. There is lack of credit bureaus and other mechanisms for collecting and exchanging information on payment performance. This inevitably exacerbates the informational asymmetries between enterprises and lenders/ investors. In IMF Working Paper (Access to  Bank Credit in SubSaharan Africa  Key  Issues and Reform Strategies) prepared by Sacerdoti (2005) stated that to foster a credit culture it is essential that progress be made in area of credit information.     21 ISSN 20535821(Print) ISSN 2053583X(Online)   International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship   Research Vol.3No.2pp.1630 March 2015              Published by European Centre for Research Training and Development UK (www.eajournals.org) METHODOLOGY OF THE STUDY  The study employed both exploratory and descriptive research design. The purpose was to portray the  accurate  situations  pertaining  in  the  small  businesses  and  the  banking  environments.  The population of the research was SMEs and banks in Ghana. In Ghana SME is defined by National Board for Small Scale Industries (NBSSI) as business which employs form 30 to 99 with fixed assets of not less than 100000 U. S. Dollars excluding land and building. These businesses are seen as the backbone of the economy of Ghana. This is because they account for about 50% of the Gross  Domestic  Products  in  Ghana  and  also  serve  a  safety  valve  for  the  country   s  perennial unemployment  problem.  These  businesses  are  geographically  spread  which  ensure  evenly distribution  of  goods  and  services.  On  the  other  hand  the  formal  financial  sector  has  about  27 registered banks that are in competition with many savings and loan rural banks and nonfinancial institutions spread out in every part of the country.   Both  probability and nonprobability sampling techniques were used.  In the case of probability sampling stratified sampling was used to group the SMEs into service trade and manufacturing so as to ensure fair selection of all the groups. Quota sampling was also used for distribution of 300  questionnaires  among  the  groups  with  each  having  100.  Also  purposive  by  accessibility sampling was used for the selection of the ten banks. The study targeted the owners of the SMEs and the loan officers of the banks who closed attached to the loans.  The data obtained were mainly primary sourced through the use of questionnaires and interviews. Questionnaires  were  self  administered  with  opened  ended  and  closed  ended  questions.  Proper guidance  was  offered  to  ensure  accurate  supply  of  information.  Due  to  the  busy  nature  of  the banking  sector  semistructured  interview  was  designed  to  solicit  information  from  the  loan officers of the banks and this was done facetoface.The Statistical Package for Social Sciences and Microsoft excel were used for data presentation and analysis and the data was qualitatively and quantitatively analysed.   DATA FINDINGS AND DISCUSSIONS This  chapter  discusses  the  findings  uncovered  by  the  administration  of  the  questionnaires  and interviews. It comprises the challenges encountered by SMEs in accessing debt finance as well as the challenges the financial institutions face in providing credits to the SMEs in Ghana.  The Problems Encountered By SMEs in Accessing Credit in Financial Institutions.  Major Constraint to the Growth of SME SMEs in developing countries are faced with lots of challenges in their operations and this was reflected in the responses received  from  the target  respondents.  Fig 1 below shows the various challenges faced by SMEs in Ghana.       22 ISSN 20535821(Print) ISSN 2053583X(Online)   International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship   Research Vol.3No.2pp.1630 March 2015              Published by European Centre for Research Training and Development UK (www.eajournals.org)   Constraints Technology Competition Lack of finance Irregular power supply Taxes Total Percentage % 14 36 46 4 0 100 Table 1 Major Constraint to Growth  The above shows participants rankings of the major problems facing the growth of their businesses in order on importance. 46% of the participant ranked lack of finance as the major constraints to the  growth  of  their  business  followed  by  competition  which  recorded  36%.  Technology  was ranked as the third major constraint to the growth of SMEs with just 4% thinking that irregular power supply also constrained their growth. This result reinforces the theory by Cuevas et al (1993) where they indicated that access to bank credit by SMEs has been an issue and continues to be raised by numerous studies as a major constraint to growth which was also supported by Aryeetey et al. (1993) that from the view point of private sector problems related to finance dominate all other  constraints  to  business  expansion.  These  go  to  also  indicate  that  finance  for  SMEs particularly in Ghana is still a major problem even though the number of banks operating in the country has increased tremendously since 1993 when Aryeetey et al. came out with their studies. With a total based on the number of banks (www.bog.gov.gh) and number of nonbank financial institutions operating in  the country one would expect that access to  credit by these SMEs will greatly improve as competition among lending institutions becomes keen. But this expectation has not been met since the results confirm the numerous theories that lack of access to credit and bank loans remain a key constraint that needs attention to resolve in order to enhance SMEs growth. This notion was also in line with Schiffer and Weder (2001) who found that the smaller the size of a firm the more difficult it is to attract loans from financial institutions.  Lending Rate High cost of credit is the major constraints facing small and medium size businesses in Ghana and it is the main problem hampering the development of industrialization in Ghana.

One significant thing is that among the respondents none saw the interest rates charged on loans by the financial institutions to be low. This result support   Appenteng (2010) who  said  some  savings   and  loans  companies  charged  as  much  as  10  percent  per  month  which  when  accumulated  would  be  over  100  percent  interest  rate  per  annum.  It  is  more difficult for firms  paying such high interest  rate to obtain excess  profit after being  able  to  settle  this  high  cost  of  debt.  The  extremely  high  interest  rate  group  pays  interest between 7% and 10% per month. 8% of the respondents which indicated that the rates charged by the financial institution are high also pay interest of 5% to7% per month with just 5% which may be termed     fortunate     service their debts at a maximum rate of  21% per annum. This puts the businesses under intense pressure and eventually making the business unprofitable.

The above figure shows the loan repayment duration indicated by respondents in this study. It can be seen that 82% were given a repayment period of less than one year whilst 13%  a repayment period of one year and  5% indicated a repayment period of  two years. The result is in consonance with Ricupero   s (2002) position that commercial bank loans extended to SMEs are often limited to a period far too short to enable them pay off any sizeable investment. Abereijo and Fayomi (2005) also made a similar observation when they stated that the majority of commercial bank loans offered to SMEs are often limited to a period far too short to pay off any sizeable investment.  Understanding Interest Calculations  Many loan beneficiaries have complained that financial institutions do not explain how interests are  calculated  on  their  loans.  The  researcher  therefore  investigated  this  phenomenon  and  has arrived at the following; 65% of respondents confirmed the assertion that financial institutions do not educate loan beneficiaries / applicants on how interests are calculated. 35% however revealed that  they  were  informed  about  the  modes  of  interest  calculation.  It  is  therefore  important  that financial  institutions  involve  loan  applicants  in  the  computation  of  interests  to  exonerate  the financial institutions from any perception of fraud activities.This accentuate the opinion of Donkor (2012) that it is thought microfinance institutions are doing a good job by providing loan facilities for SMEs but they sometimes do not tell the truth. Some of these institutions take advantage of their educational level and for one reason or the other refuse to give details and explain the interest rates and its implications on the loans to small business owners. The effect is realised when they begin the repayment of the loan.  25 ISSN 20535821(Print) ISSN 2053583X(Online)   International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship   Research Vol.3No.2pp.1630 March 2015              Published by European Centre for Research Training and Development UK (www.eajournals.org) Meeting loan approval criteria From the survey conducted it was realized that SMEs are unable to meet the banks requirement. Most SMEs fail to obtain guarantors and collateral require by the banks some also fail to prepare financial statements of their businesses and as such being denied of the loan. The result is in line with ECA (2001) which states that banks and other financial institutions have no confidence in SMEs as they are perceived as highrisk ventures with high rates of failure. As a result prohibitive collateral conditions are set up to prevent SMEs from obtaining loans. that most  guarantors are not willing to offer support due to the nature and management style of the SMEs. There were only 3.83%  of  the  respondents  who  faced  the  challenge  of  cash  flow  and  1.09%  faced  with  other challenges such as lack of business plan.   Default payment of Loans It was estimated that about 64% of respondents have had default in the payment of loan with only 36% being able to repay back loans received from financial institutions within the regulation time. Some of these defaulters close down their businesses and run away which affect the banks financial performance. As a result of the high default rate financial institutions are compelled to charge high interest rates. Further research revealed (figure 4.5) some factors that accounted for the high default rate.    43.8%  complained  of  low  turnover  29.2%  high  monthly  instalment  payment  and  short duration of repayment constituted 7.29% while 10.42% complained of high interest rates and other interesting findings such as poor management of account receivables of these SMEs. However it is believed that with proper management of SMEs receivables they should have enough cash to boost up their working capital to run their operations and also meet their financial obligations.

Some were exactly what the SMEs gave while others were different. Below are the challenges given by the officers of the banks  History of High Default Rate In the interview conducted 50% of the respondents indicated that SMEs are characterised with high  default  rate.  50%  default  rate  is  a  very  high  risk  and  would  hinder  every  institution  from granting  credit  facility.  Many  businesses  lacked  the  accounting  and  management  capacity  to demonstrate their ability to service a loan land tenure issues limited businesses    ability to raise the collateral  that  the  banks  required  to  allay  perceived  risk  the  legal  and  court  systems  made  it difficult for banks to seize collateral when borrowers defaulted and the absence of credit bureaus made it difficult for banks to assess borrowers    credit history. To add to the risk the International Monetary Fund  (IMF 2003) concluded that because they have  focused largely on  government debt banks may have limited expertise in evaluating risks associated with private sector lending.    False information   s about businesses From the survey conducted 50% of the respondents agreed that small business owners habitually give false information about their business when applying for loan while 33.3% of the respondents mildly agreed. However 16.7% disagreed to the fact that SMEs provide false information about their business when apply for loan. To justify their claim it was indicated that SMEs may give false information out of ignorance. If  true  and  quality  information  are  supplied  to  banks  and  other  financial  institutions  it  would  be  easy  to  assess  creditworthiness  of  businesses  and  reduce  risk  of  default. This  would  also  enable  financial  institutions  to   give  small  enterprises  favourable  terms  of  payment. This finding is in line with what Ricupero (2002) said part of the reluctance of banks to lend SMEs is the banks    inability to evaluate risk because of lack of reliable financial information.   It was also identified that poor record keeping of SMEs is the difficulty of the financial institutions to assess their financial performance. Moreover the most of the loans obtained are not used for it intended purposes. Sometimes the owners of the business use the loan to solve personal issues and later find it difficult to pay because no turnover was accrued to service the debt.With regard to the demand of collateral it was further explained that the property must be insured for it acceptance. However some of these SMEs provide collaterals that are covered with false documents. Some of the properties may not bear the name of the business or the cosigner and it may be impossible to secure the loan.   Moreover most SMEs were known to be sole proprietorships and do not operate the account of the business as separate entity from their personal account. As a result the banks may be unwilling to provide loan facility to businesses that have no accounts with them.   IMPLICATION TO RESEARCH AND PRACTICE  The  research  may  contribute  to  the  existing  knowledge  and  by  so  doing  create  environment necessary  for  SME  financing.  This  is  through  the  identification  and  exploration  of  challenges 27 ISSN 20535821(Print) ISSN 2053583X(Online)   International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship   Research Vol.3No.2pp.1630 March 2015              Published by European Centre for Research Training and Development UK (www.eajournals.org) confronting SMEs    access to debt financing and to find out appropriate mechanisms that would encourage demand and supply of this debt financing. The major contribution of this research to the  body  of  knowledge  is  that  many  challenges  such  as  high  default  rate  inability  to  calculate interest by the SMEs provision of false information lack of collateral and many others have been examined on how they affect SMEs    access to debt finance.   It is expected that this research will open the way for the availability of longterm debts so as to complement  the  internally  generated  funds  which  will  enhance  growth  and  expansion  of businesses when these challenges are carefully addressed.   This work will add to the body of knowledge by making sure SMEs are encouraged to seek debt financing when the   government and other institutions and donors allocate financial resources to support the growth of SMEs in Ghana. For example when information is available to be assessed by SMEs and the financial institutions good relationship will be encouraged. It is also to make sure that financial market (banks) does not concentrate on growthoriented businesses but rather focus on SMEs that have been denied so long a time when their challenges are considered.   It  is  hoped  that  the  findings  and  recommendations  of  this  study  will  contribute  to  the  body  of knowledge by providing information to the Bank of Ghana on the appropriate model and strategy that need to be developed in order to ensure longterm debt delivery to the SMEs in Ghana.The results  of  the  study  will  offer  directions  to  the  management  of  financial  institutions  through reduction  of  risk  in  providing  debt  and  develop  attractive  products  to  support  the  SMEs.  The research will therefore promote competition among the banks in their service delivery to the small businesses thereby expanding their area of investments.  However the outcome of the study can be implemented if the Business Associations institutions and the Ghana Association of Banks in collaboration with the Bank of Ghana will organise routine workshops  and  seminars  on  some  issues  that  emerged  and  recommended  in  the  study.  These recommendations  may (database) implementation of monitoring schemes and establishment of a model which will facilitate longterm finance.  RECOMMENDATIONS AND CONCLUSION  In the light of the above discussions the following could be recommended The government should introduce tax reduction incentive to the banks that involve in providing long term debt finance to SMEs. This may encourage the financial institutions to lend to SMEs. The bank of Ghana by their regulations should help banks come out with innovative packages such as SME department. This department may be responsible for offering education monitoring and collection of SMEs    debts.In order to reduce the high default rate and the perception of risk the government of Ghana should formulate supportive laws that will ensure smooth retrieval of loans by  the  banks.  Accurate  database  on  businesses  must  be  set  up  for  their  proper  monitoring.  All SMEs must be registered under an established institution.The SMEs must form Associations which will address their financial issues. The association may serve as guarantors whenever long term loans are applied. introduction  of information technology include; ISSN 20535821(Print) ISSN 2053583X(Online)  28  International Journal of Small Business and Entrepreneurship   Research Vol.3No.2pp.1630 March 2015              Published by European Centre for Research Training and Development UK (www.eajournals.org) Finally SMEs are known to be the strong force behind the economic growth and development of the country. Because they are widely spread they are able to respond to the needs of the mass. In spite  of  the  increasing  number  of  financial  institutions  government  interventions  and  donor supports demand and supply of debt finance continue to be a challenge. It needs the collaborative efforts of all the stakeholders to address the challenges in order for SMEs to access adequate debts needed for business expansion.  FUTURE RESEARCH  The study may be extended to explore the effects of SMEs    debts on profitability performance. This may find out how SMEs access to loan affects their profitability and how the supply of loans affects banks financial performance. Profitability ratios may be used for the analysis.
