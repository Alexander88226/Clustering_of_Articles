Central political and broader social support forthe Chinesethe growth of such financialCommunist Party (CCP) has been closely connected to the promise of   tech nationalchampions    leading a new wave of economic growth led by middleclass consumption andgreater efficiency in financial and other consumer services (Hu and Zheng 2016). It is amarket environmentthat offers enormous first mover advantages embedded in anincreasingly consumeroriented society that is highly receptive to the    disruption    of the statecontrolled banking system. China   s fintech heavyweights including Ant Financial JD Financeand Du Xiaoman alongside a raft of no less ambitious smaller dedicated online lending firmssuch as Dianrong Lufax and Yirendai are extending competitive and marketdriven digitalfinancial services to individuals and enterprises that previously found access to financialcapital difficult within the confines of a financially repressed traditional banking system.The consequences of such transformations are not limited to the reform of China   sfinancial system and economic growth model but are of deep significance for the future ofChinese politics and society. Just as the growth of systemically significant technology firms inWestern countries has given rise to contentious questions of their influence on democraticprocesses the significance of China   s new fintech firms extends to their potential impact onthe CCP   s    authoritarian resilience    as it confronts challenges of deepening marketorientedreforms and the rise of the Chinese middleclass consumer. This impact takes two potentialforms. First such financial inclusion raises awareness and use of financial opportunities andprocessesoflogicentrepreneurialism and consumption (Hall 2012   van der Zwan 2014). Secondlyit isconnected to the increasingly important role of publicprivate and statebusiness strugglesover the control of information in a context of big data capitalism (Hansen and Porter 2017  Richards and King 2013). As such the rise of online credit and investment serviceschallenges the CCP   s longentrenched control over financial intermediation and allocation ofcapital at the mesoinstitutional level as well as the deeper foundations of the social contractthat has characterized Chinese citizens    trust in the CCP to provide opportunities for individualeconomic betterment and collective prosperity.investmentdrivenindividualizedincreasinglyfosteringThis article analyzes these tensions examining the role of Chinese DFS in the evolvingrelationship between financial development and China   s authoritarian capitalism. It arguesthat the rise of Chinese fintech represents more than a marketbased utilization of newfinancial technologies in response to an entrenched statedominated banking system butrather constitutes an important institutional foundation in the ongoing construction of anauthoritarian capitalist system. These foundations comprise an interlinked array of big datatechnologies financial firms and practices of digital credit scoring cumulatively embedded ina unique authoritarian political culture. The political economy of Chinese fintech extendsbeyond the immediate dynamics of change within the financial system   it is a broader andmore complex process of financialization involving also the transformation of social andeconomic governance structures.transaction costs and increasing financialI detail how the development of big datadriven credit scoring technologies for reducingfinancialinclusion have assumed a broadersignificance in the context of new practices of    algorithmic governance    (CampbellVerduynGoguen and Porter 2017) through which big data algorithms    functions as market devicesare both supplemented by and transmuted into tools of political power. This algorithmican Gruin3governance exhibits the Chinese political economy   s distinctive traits of deepeningmarketization combined with strongly authoritarian state capacity     the manifestation ofChina   s    networked authoritarianism    in the financial realm (MacKinnon 2011). The analysistherefore develops a critique ofliberalization    and    financialinclusion    discourses of Chinese fintech that portray this process as a largely progressivesocioeconomic development and a demonstration of the economic potentials made possibleby technological change (Xie Zou and Liu 2016b). Such a conclusion overlooks how specifictechnologies are always deeply embedded in social and political dynamics that transmutetheir function and operation   in this case embedded in what Creemers (2017a 85) describesas the CCP   s broader project of placing    technology at the centre of an ambitious agenda forcomprehensive reform of social and economic governance   .the intertwined    financialThese arguments contribute to two important contemporary debates in the politicaleconomy of finance. First the findings open up new conceptual avenues in the politicaleconomy of financial reform and financialization in authoritarian states such as China. Existingscholarship on the influence of financialization on democratic politics remains largely centeredupon AngloAmerican financial systems (Aitken 2007   Bruff 2014   Langley 2007). I show howtechnological innovation     even when it reflects a form of    marketoriented transition        isconnected to the practice of digital    authoritarian resilience    and represents a continuation ofrather a rupture with longstanding principles and structures of Chinese governance.

The embeddedness ofthese financialtechnologies within the Chinese political culture represents one set ofconditions in which such technologies can give rise to unintended political consequencesthrough a reengineering of their usage and a transmutation of their economic and politicalpotentials.financialization. SecondlyThe remainder of the article proceeds as follows.In the next section I outline theanalytical value of adopting the concept of financialization for understanding the nature andconsequences of big datadriven financial technologies in China. The argument then proceedsin two empirical steps. First I trace how the rise of Chinese fintech is generating new sourcesof financial value through a process of    inclusive financialliberalization    in response to afinancially repressed statedominated system. I then turn to the deeper political dimensions ofthis process examining how the rise of Chinese fintech is connected to the evolution ofalgorithmic governance in China. This involves both the need for the CCP to exert control overthe financialization process as well as its ambition to develop new forms of control throughfinancialization. The analysis draws upon a range of primary sources including governmentpolicy documents industry data and 29 field interviews conducted in Beijing between October2016 and September 2018. These interviews were obtained via a snowballing method tolocate interviewees who could provide a perspective on the development of Chinese fintechfrom that of public governance (government officials) private enterprise (practitioners from thefintech industry) or policy research (think tank researchers). These are supported by recourseto the Chineselanguage secondary literature. The concluding section discusses theimplications of the analysis and explores avenues for further research. 4Finance and SocietyTechnology and financialization in authoritarian capitalismSince the goal of constructing the    socialist market economy    was first declared in 1993 astatecontrolled banking sector has lain at the core of the CCP   s experimental approach toreform and opening involving efforts to harness the economic efficiencies of domestic marketcompetition whilst guarding againstits potentially destabilizing effects. One implicitassumption underlying much political economy analysis of China   s financial    liberalization    hastherefore been that it transfers power over financial capital to actors     both individual andcorporate     beyond the partystate and thus forms one aspect of a broader marketorienteddevelopmental trajectory threatening the stability of CCP rule (see Ang 2018   Yang 2006  Yang 2017). As history and the work of a number of other scholars has shown (Dickson 2008  Gruin 2016   Tsai 2007)the CCP has exhibited remarkable capacity to manage thechallenges raised by a rapidly evolving market economy.The rise of fintech represents one more of these challenges (Wang 2017). Despite thepurported politicoeconomic advantages of increasing financial efficiency and broadening thefinancial base the rise of deep broad and integrated    fintech ecosystems    also represents asocioeconomic challenge to the longstanding and politically important methods of controlexercised by the CCP over financial markets and activities (Gruin 2016). Fintech thus raisesanew longstanding questions concerning the CCP   s capacity to have its cake and eat it too byboth harnessing and constraining financial capital as an economic resource and nowincreasingly also digital financialization as a deeper and broader sociopolitical project. Theemergence of Chinese DFS therefore presents us with a new iteration of a familiar yetcounterintuitive situation that one of the primary sources of legitimacyenhancing growthconstitutes simultaneously a potential threat to CCP authority.Much of the existing scholarly literature on the emergence of Chinese DFS concentrateson its related roles in accelerating financial liberalization and of financial inclusion as part ofChina   s evolving developmental model (Chen 2016   Huang Lei and Shen 2016   Kshetri2016). This focus has its roots in the political economy of financial reform and efforts to parsethe role of DFS in the growth of Chinese shadow banking financial efficiency and stability(Huang Shen Wang and Guo 2016   Li and Yi Tin 2016   Tsai 2015   2016). This set ofdebates stands apart from those of political scientists and China scholars who emphasize therole of digital information and governance in the context of China   s networked authoritarianism(MacKinnon 2011   Tsai 2017). This increasingly entails the construction of a technologydriven mode of    social management    (Creemers 2017a   Hoffman 2017) a process alsohighlighted in the popular media which tends to portray it     somewhat unfairly     as a directmanifestation of an Orwellian dystopia (e.g. Botsman 2017). Nevertheless such literaturedoes not locate these dynamics in the broader political economy of Chinese capitalism inwhich financial development and liberalization have potentially significant implications for theviability and consequences of Chinese authoritarian governance.Digital financial inclusion as financializationThis article bridges these debates by reframing the emergence of DFS and digital creditscoring as a case offinancialization. Such an approach opens up valuable heuristicopportunities for investigating the specific consequences of technological change in globalfinance. Although financialization is a contested and multifaceted conceptual umbrella for avariety of phenomena (Christophers 2015)its core premise remains the increasinginstitutions and elites in the operation of theimportance of financial markets motives Gruin5economy and its governing institutions (Epstein 2005). Reviews of financialization scholarshiphave identified three broad analytical levels to the concept the macropolitical economic themesoinstitutional and the microcultural (van der Zwan 2014). Interested in the distributivepatterns of politicoeconomic power produced by financialization economists and politicalscientists have tended to emphasize the macro and mesoanalytical levels focusing on thechanging patterns of interaction between financial and nonfinancial sectors and firms andthe shifting relationships between political and financial institutions. By contrast the microcultural delves deeper into how financialization    reshapes the way people think about theirlives and the world around them    (Davis and Kim 2015 212). Financial participationunderwrites discourses and ideologies of individual responsibility risktaking and calculativepractices of personal management (Aitken 2007   Martin 2002). These and other financialsubjectivities can become not just supplemental to but constitutive of entire social systemsaggregating into what Mehrling (2017) labels    financial society   .The sociopoliticallogics and imperatives of   financial society    are most acutelypronounced in AngloAmerican societies whilst they are now increasingly evident in regionswhose financial development has unfolded alongside the emergence and diffusion of globalneoliberalism (Gonzalez 2015). China has longattempted to resist the strictures of globalizedfinance even as it sought to attract and enlist foreign capital in its modernization drive. Itsinsulation from the direct consequences of the financial crises of the 1990s and 2000smorphed into a more sophisticated set of strategies to both embrace and constrain the powerof global financialintegration (McNally and Gruin 2017). Whilst this strategy has provenrelatively successful in reaping the rewards of integration whilst guarding against attendantmacroeconomic risks the influence of deeper socioculturally rooted dimensions of financialdevelopment represents a different form of financial globalization. Although closely tied to theevolution of neoliberalism as a transnational project financialization should not be consideredcommensurate with its underlying logics and ideologies (Davis and Walsh 2017).One implication of adopting such a perspective towards the microfoundations offinancialization is that trajectories of financialization will vary significantly by socioculturalcontext. Although the geographic horizons of the financialization literature have broadenedsignificantly since their initial focus upon the AngloAmerican heartland of financial capitalismexplicitly comparative studies of Chinese financialization have remained aloof of the microlevel and societal changes potentially wrought by the same token largely assuming theuniversality of its drivers and causes (e.g. Karwowski and Stockhammer 2017). Meanwhilesinglecase studies of Chinese financialization have made significant progress in tracing thepatterns of financialization at multiple analytical levels. From a macroeconomic perspectivethey have revealed the influence of financialization on economic growth and structure (Jia andWinseck 2018   Wang 2015) corporate governance (Modell and Yang 2018) and financialstability (Xia and Fuchs 2016). Wang (2018) has examined how China   s digital financialinclusion diverges from traditional developmental models ofinsteadinclusion into an increasinglyincorporating both discourses and practices offinancialized stateled capitalist model.inclusionfinancialfinancialAt the microculturallevel Chong (2018) has explored the everyday practices andnarratives through which Chinese enterprises are becoming financialized emphasizing contactwith global professional service firms and    best practices    in human resource managementcorporate governance and business ethics. Nevertheless although such studies help us movebeyond an understanding of financialization as simply a new logic of capital accumulationthey tend not to focus on the analyticallinkages between the different levels at whichfinancialization can be perceived. In one exception Dal Maso (2015 47) has characterized the 6Finance and Societygrowth of stock market participation since the early 1990s as a form of stateled    massfinancialization   . She links it to both an opening up of socioeconomic space for individualsaffected by the downsizing of the stateowned economy and associated welfare systems aswell as a role in the rhetoric of the Chinese regime   s drive to buttress ideological support forthe new socialist market economy.This article   s theoretical arguments are situated across these levels of analysis seekingto connect the evolving macropower relations of financialized capitalism with the microcultural mechanisms of how individual social relations are enrolled in its behavioural logicsand practices. From this perspective financialization at all levels is a deeply social process.Both its causes and consequences are socially rooted with macroeconomic and institutionaldefinitions offinancialization serving as important and clear proxies for underlyingrealignments of sociopolitical norms and cultural discourses. By the same token microcultural mechanisms underpinning financialization generate agency for influencing macropower relations   those able to modulate and redirect these logics are better equipped tosimultaneously constrain and harness the power of financial capitalism. A corollary to thesearguments is that the role of technology in financialization is mediated by a range of social andcultural factors. Innovation in information and communications technology serves to facilitatebroader financialinclusion by rendering online financial services cheaper more readilytailored to individual needs and more widely available both temporally and geographically. Yetwhen coupled with the algorithms underpinning big data technologies social media andmessaging platforms also bring less sanguine consequences serving as powerfulmechanisms for diffusing and reifying certain financial logics and practices at the expense ofothers.A sensitivity to the sociopolitical embeddedness of technological change and innovationis of importance to ongoing debates surrounding digital financialinnovation in China andbeyond for several reasons. First by embedding the analysis of market devices more deeply inthe sociopolitics of finance capitalism financialization becomes a more useful conceptual toolin the deepening conversation between economic sociology and political economy. Theincreasingly significant role played by financial technologies in catalyzing accelerating andmodulating financialization processes raises broad issues of distribution power andregulation that have too rarely been elucidated by    social studies of finance    scholars whohave focused more closely on the sociotechnical market devices underpinning financialnetworks and exchanges (Coombs 2016   Erturk Froud Johal Leaver and Williams 2013).Technological devices that calculate and model economic activities are crucial objects of studyfor questions surrounding how markets are made possible (Muniesa Millo and Callon 2007).Yet framing algorithms as economic assemblages that    perform    markets in their image risksforegrounding their abstract and disembedded qualities and downplaying the interests ofpolitical agents who both establish the structural parameters of this performativity and wielddevices as specific political tools and weapons. Understanding the broader significance offintech accordingly demands a nuanced analysis sensitive to the reciprocal influence betweentechnological innovations and (different forms of) capitalist political economy. Cast in suchlight financialization therefore goes beyond seeing the algorithms of big datadriven creditscoring as a disruptive technology affecting market evolution in a linear or homogenousfashion. Instead I show how algorithmic devices responsible for digital financial inclusion haveboth been shaped by     and deployed within     the authoritarian capitalism under constructionby the CCP.Secondly the comparative capitalisms literature has long struggled to adequately dealwith China   s socialist market economy (Tsai 2013). Conceptualizing the rise of Chinese DFS Gruin7as a process of sociopolitically embedded financialization brings debates on institutionalchange in Chinese finance into more fruitful conversation with the political economy of AngloAmerican financial systems that have hitherto dominated both the spread of financializedpractices and discourses as well as scholarly efforts to study them in comparative context. Inthis sense rather than asking how fintech would affect Chinese politics and society thequestion is one of how the significance of fintech is affected by its emergence through a highlycomplex and historically formed political tradition.Systemic stability in the Chinese political traditionThe Chinese political tradition in which fintech is developing is characterized by its emphasisupon a systemic stability underpinned by a holistic integration or harmony of its constituentparts. For much of the twentieth century Chinese society underwent the cyclical yet systematicdestruction of social trust reaching a climax during the Cultural Revolution when trustbetween individuals and within communities was replaced by blind and exclusive faith in theideological fervour of Mao Zedong. In line with its postMao transition from a    revolutionary    toa    governing party   the overarching objective of contemporary Chinesegovernance remains the preservation and enhancement of the political authority of the CCPalongside the growth and development of Chinese economy and society. Since 1978 the CCPhas endeavoured to preserve residual trust in its guarantee of social and economic progress inan era of profound social and institutional transformation (Gruin 2019). This has provenincreasingly difficult as the complexity and connectedness of the market economy and societyhas increased giving rise to trust deficits across a range of social and economic sectors suchas consumer protection environmental regulation corruption and fraud (Ohlberg Ahmed andLang 2017) and the government   s recognition that upgraded governance systems     both inideological and technical terms     are integral for the CCP   s continued capacity to govern.(Heath 2016)The CCP   s ambition of constructing an authoritarian capitalist society that reconciles thepotentials afforded by a capitalist market economy with the strictures of an authoritarianpolitical regime is increasingly apparent (Ang 2018   Lieber 2013). As Hoffman (2017) hasargued central to this governance model is a form of complex systemsthinking traceable tothe 1970s which views technology as a mechanism for achieving Leninist social management.In this systemsbased conceptualization of governancethe constituent elements areevaluated with reference to their utility or function in achieving systemobjectives socialharmony and economic development (Creemers 2018). This blurs divisions between publicand private and the laying of responsibility for overall social development upon the citizenryparty members commercial enterprises social organizations and government officials alike(Thornton 2007). The outcome is a form of    cyberLeninism    (Creemers 2017b) that has inturn undergone substantial upgrading since the start of the Xi administration a turning pointin the CCP   s approach to utilizing and exploiting technology to restructure the Party   s governingframework.These distinctive political traits have influenced the development of digital credit scoringas an institutional foundation for an evolving authoritarian capitalist society in which China   sneostatist logic of retaining macrocontrol over financial market evolution can be contrastedwith the neoliberal tendency to vest epistemic authority in firms and corporate actors. Thefollowing sections accordingly trace the rise of Chinese fintech as an interlinked set oftechnologies big databased financialinstitutions and practices like digital credit scoringwhose significance derives from their embeddedness in this distinctive political economy and 8Finance and Societythe political tradition that underpins it. Contextualizing such technologies in the broaderpatterns of political and social governance illustrates their importance beyond the economicdimensions of financial inclusion and liberalization. Yet it also cautions against breathlessaccounts of the role of fintech in the Orwellian rise of China   s surveillance state for thesignificance of digital credit scoring lies not only in the imposition of explicit surveillancemechanisms. Rather big datadriven financialization enables explicit incentives and implicitsanctions to be woven more deeply into the fabric of everyday life as partandparcel of thefinancialization of Chinese economy and society.Inclusive financial liberalization? The rise of Chinese fintechFrom its inception Chinese DFS has generated broad expectations that it would play asignificant and positive role within China   s    new economy    by furthering financial inclusion andaccelerating deeper structural economic rebalancing. The capacity of big datadriven creditscoring lending and payments systems to facilitate this socioeconomic transition constitutesone major dimension of its politicoeconomic significance and provides an insight into therationale underpinning central government support for the sector   s growth and development.The emergence of Chinese fintech is therefore at its core a story of the politicoeconomicconsequences of longstanding financial repression (Gruin 2013   Tsai 2015)leading tofinancing and efficiency gaps on both the lending and borrowing sides to small and mediumenterprises (SMEs) and lowincome households (Feyzio  lu 2009   Hsiao Shen and Bian2015). Under the loose governance of the People   s Bank of China (PBOC) the shadow bankingsystem that emerged in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis was engaged in a balancing actbetween supporting economic growth through the existing investmentheavy developmentalmodel and accelerating financial liberalization and competition within the banking sector (HsuLi and Xue 2014   Shen 2016   Tsai 2015).Within this environment the growth of China   s DFS sector since 2013 has been both rapidand sizable. Financialinnovation linked to ecommerce has utilized new technologyinfrastructure and big data analytics to grant dramatically improved and faster access tofinancial services for consumers and SMEs (Xiang Zhang Wang and Huang 2017). Afterseveral years of explosive expansion including the rise and fall of a large P2P online lendingbubble Chinese fintech is now entering a process of consolidation and maturation with thenew    tech national champions    spearheading growth. Ant Financial China   s largest fintechfirm alone raised USD 14 billion in 2018 compared with a North American total of USD 12.1billion and European of USD 3.8 billion (CB Insights 2019). The firm has granted loans tomore than 4 million businesses and individuals with a total amount of RMB 700 billion indirect lending (Cheng 2017). Although online lending remains equivalent to less than 5% ofdomestic bank loans (01Caijing 2018) this drastically understates the extent to whichChinese citizens    financial lives are moving online and the rapid proliferation and uptake ofretail lending and investment services.The rise of DFS connects closely to questions surrounding the role of the financial systemin China   s broader economic development. The promotion of fintech as a viable avenue formarketoriented financial growth is closely tied to a broader array of efforts to address China   scurrent macroeconomic conditions contributing to three related economic policy goalsdeepening China   s financial reforms improving the market environment and transforming theoverall national development model (Xiang et al. 2017   Xie Zou and Liu 2014). This isechoed in much of the Western literature which perceives the rise of fintech as heralding thelongawaited largescale liberalization of China   s financial sector (Huang et al. 2016   Ma Gruin92017). Premier Li Keqiang encapsulated the sentiment when stating at the opening ofTencent   s WeBank that the growth of online banks    will lower costs for and deliver practicalbenefits to small clients while forcing traditional financial institutions to accelerate reforms   (PwC 2015 7).This financial liberalization narrative around the emergence of fintech dovetails with thatof financial inclusion. The 18th Central Committee meeting in November 2013 established an   inclusive financial system    as a key priority for financial reform whilst in March 2014 PremierLi Keqiang began to draw explicit connections between digital finance and financial inclusion(Li 2014). A major push in this strategy to develop new growth drivers whilst preservingfinancial stability came in the 2015 Internet Plus Plan which sought to integrate the mobileInternet cloud computing big data and the Internet of Things with modern manufacturing toencourage the healthy development of ecommerce industrial networks and internet banking(State Council of the PRC 2015b). This policy initiative places financial sector reform front andcentre aiming to enhance China   s state capacities and market efficiencies in ecommerce bypromoting the contribution of digital financial services. Following quick on the heels of theInternet Plus Plan on 31 December 2015 the State Council elevated financial inclusion to thestatus of a key pillar of national development and financial reform stressing the central role ofbig data analytics cloud computing and the integration of offline and online commerce inenabling fintech firms to broaden access to financial services (State Council of the PRC2016). An initial laissezfaire attitude toward the sector   s growth was followed by concertedand coordinated set of regulatory measures by the PBOC and China Banking RegulatoryCommission (PBOC 2015b   CBRC. 2016) which aimed to ensure that online financingchannels are structured to maximize capital flows to SMEs and individual entrepreneursrather than giving rise to regulatory arbitrage. This policy discourse of    inclusive financialliberalization        along with the belief that DFS and online lending genuinely address afinancing gap for SMEs and foster greater financial inclusion as a whole     is reinforced by therise of the Chinese consumer as both a key driver of China   s economic growth model over thenext decades as well as the    financial empowerment    of the individualin an increasinglymaterialistic society (Xie et al. 2014   Huang et al. 2016). From this perspective the policyincentives for promoting online financial inclusion and innovation as a means of capitalizingupon the Chinese consumer class as an economic force are clear (Li and Yi Tin 2016).Such economic rationales for fintech development are supplemented by visions of a morefarreaching transformation of Chinese socioeconomic life always with a positive spin. As AntFinancial   s Chief Strategy Officer and respected academic economist Chen Long (2016 231)describes it    from Fintech to Finlife   . In this process    reallife demand is the mother ofinnovation     the reason why China   s fintech developed so fast is that its development is tightlyknitted to and supports consumption growth. As a result technology finance and reallifeneed form a virtuous circle   . Widespread societal support for fintech is closely connected toenthusiasm for a future imaginary of liberalized financial markets and access to financialservices for individuals and entrepreneurs unencumbered by the strictures of state authority(Bai 2016   Wang 2017). This underscores the receptivity of this rapidly burgeoning consumerclass to the reshaping of lifestyles and consumption patterns around the growth of ecommerce fintech and the big datadriven business practices that underpin them. It furtherembeds the rise of fintech within a socially legitimated political discourse of economicdevelopment and modernization.As the sector began to gradually mature the broader institutional foundation of ChineseDFS began to take clearer shape. The core source of financial value in Chinese online lendingis the collection of information on consumer and business economic behaviour predominantly 10Finance and Societyoriented thus far around ecommerce (Tang Zhang and He 2014). Yet an early challenge layin developing usable credit scores given the underdeveloped state of Chinese consumerfinance and the historical exclusion of SMEs from formal credit channels (CFI 2016). In early2015 eight private technology firms were granted permission through a PBOC pilot program tocommence    preparatory work    on establishing formal credit databases and scoringmethodologies. Although such pilot programs (for example Ant Financial   s Zhima [akaSesame] Credit) have been conflated with broader systems of surveillance (see Botsman2017) there are nevertheless substantive links between the PBOC   s pilot program and thebroader work of constructing a social credit system. Through Alibaba   s extensive reach into allaspects of consumer   s online behaviour Ant Financial has access to data on online purchasesutility bill payments social network use mobile phone records and previous microfinancehistory and is constructing the world   s most comprehensive online financial services platform(Caixin 2017) whilst other tech giants Baidu Tencent and Jingdong are developing equallycomprehensive credit scoring databases (Caixin 2017   Millward 2016).Online lending and the emergence of digital credit scoring is facilitating shifts in China   smodel of growth and development enabling the expansion of new digital economies andmarkets whilst also accelerating a rupture with the financial repression that has longcharacterized the role of finance and particularly the banking system in China   s economicreform and development. MYbank Ant Financial   s onlineonly private bank provides a    310   loan service (threeminute application onesecond approval and grant and zero manualintervention) that is specifically geared towards micro and small entrepreneurs that havegrown up within the Alibaba ecommerce ecosystem (Cheng 2017). The use of big dataanalytics in credit risk assessment has led to JD Finance having served over 100000 SMEswith supply chain finance solutions amounting to a total of RMB 250 billion concentrating noton a traditional loan model but instead using big data analytics to offer loan packages withcharacteristics tailored to individual enterprises such as flexible amortization rates (Dong2017). As a means of capitalizing upon the Chinese consumer class as an economic forcecentral to China   s broader structural economic rebalancing (Barton Chen and Jin 2013) theeconomic incentives for promoting online financial inclusion and innovation then are clear toChinese policymakers and are increasingly forming the basis for economic development plans(Interview 13 September 2017   Li and Yi Tin 2016 175).functionsliberalization   DFSdriven    inclusive financialthus as a catalyst offinancialization. As Gabor and Brooks (2016) have observed the developmental potentialsafforded by fintech often obscure the ways in which it functions as an instrument offinancialization. Through a process of    constituting the unbanked    (Aitken 2017) financialinclusion     and digital financial inclusion doubly so     involves making visible and extractingvalue from previously excluded potential consumers or investors. In the Chinese case thisprocess has implications for the locus and exercise of political power as the capture by largeprivate financial firms not just of this economic value but also of influence over consumerfinancing behaviors potentially challenges the longstanding control exercised by the state overfinancial capital. Yet it also bolsters potentials for algorithmic governance by integratingpolitical priorities and strictures into the evolving fabric offinancial networks anddependencies.Fintech and the rise of algorithmic governance in ChinaThe rise of DFS as a foundation for inclusive financial liberalization thus marks a subtle butsignificant shift in the socioeconomic reach of the Chinese financial system as well as the Gruin11ifinclusion movement    digitalunderlying logics of newly formed financial networks and relationships. Accelerating China   sfinancial inclusion in this way begins to shift the locus of financial authority from the traditionalnetwork of commercial banks to those overseeing and exploiting the infrastructure of digitalfinance itself the databases and dataprocessing techniques at the heart of algorithmic creditscoring. As Mader (2015 78) observed with reference to the implications of the broaderfinancialfulfilled would immenselyempower whoever controls the new monetary infrastructures.    Multiple sets of power relationsare affected and potentially reconfigured through digital financialization as big data comesincreasingly to serve both as a tool and lever of algorithmic governance (CampbellVerduynGoguen and Porter 2016). DFSled financialization thus presents novel challenges for theCCP. Digital financial inclusion involves a potentially rapid diffusion of personal economic andbehavioural data   data that is useful not just for making financial decisions but which can alsobe used to influence wider social attitudes and incentives.inclusionfinancialThe holistic systemsthinking at the core of contemporary Chinese social governance isreflected in the history of the CCP using the financial system as both an economic and a sociopolitical tool particularly since reform and opening commenced in 1978 (Heilmann 2008  Gruin 2019). One consequence is that economic growth is not pursued with firm ideologicaldistinctions between marketled economic innovation and stateguided economic upgradingsince either mode of change must remain within the purview and control of the party(Heilmann 2005   McNally 2012   Gruin 2016). The close industrygovernment coordination inthe development of credit databases and dataprocessing techniques fits squarely within thistradition blurring the lines between public and private in harnessing the financial system as apolitical as well as economic tool. Accordingly as the next two subsections detail the greaterpoliticoeconomic significance of Chinese DFS arises from its role not just as a means ofmaking visible and extracting economic value from the financially repressed Chineseconsumer but in laying the technological foundations for a more wideranging mode of socialmanagement and governanceConstraining digital financialization Consolidation and controlOne of the key objectives of the 2015 Guiding Proposal was to achieve industry consolidationwithin the rapidly burgeoning online lending industry and both broaden and deepen thefinancial services offered by large companies (Interview 23 September 2016). Thisconsolidation also took on greater political significance as the large tech firms could beregulated in a more balanced manner and were both amenable to and dependent on closecoordination with the government in order to preserve their political support and marketposition (Feng 2017   Interview 4 October 2016). Whilst regulatory arbitrage beyond the banksin a financially repressed and conservative regulatory environment had been one of the initialcatalysts for the emergence of digital finance industry consolidation was now seen as bothreducing financial risk and increasing monitoring capacity (Interview 27 September 2016  Interview 3 October 2016).Industrygovernment coordination in digital credit scoring took more explicit form inMarch 2016 when the NationalInternet Finance Association (NIFA) was established inShanghai with CreditEase as Executive Director and Li Dongrong former PBOC DeputyGovernor as serving President. Firmly under the administrative purview of the PBOC the NIFArepresents one element of the government   s efforts to exercise control over the evolution ofthe country   s digital credit scoring infrastructure. One of its early projects was to establish thelaunched in September 2016 innew digital Credit Information Sharing Platform (CISP) 12Finance and Societyconjunction with the PBOC. With 17 NIFA members including Ant Financial JD Finance andLufax present from its inception this platform brought Chinese credit scoring genuinely intothe algorithmic era (Yang 2016). The platform offered promise of solving one of the biggestproblems of online lending platforms operating in the absence of traditional indepth creditassessment procedures. Information asymmetry and incompleteness as well as data sharingacross multiple platforms have proven significant hurdles in the way of an accurate andreliable credit scoring mechanism. CISP operates by way of a generalized informationdissemination system so that customer and competitive information remain protected. Thesynergy between the interests of the sector and the government are apparent in Li Dongrong   sstatement at the new platform   s launchThe credit information recorded through the platform can not only improve the internet finance industrycredit system but also complement with the existing data in the national financial credit informationdatabase and other industry credit databases further consolidating the social credit system   s informationfoundation. (NIFA 2016 n.p.)The NIFA   s pursuit of this objective through the CISP has been bolstered by wider nationalpolicy support. For example Yiwu one of China   s leading trade hubs for manufactured goodswas identified by the PBOC and National Development and Reform Commission (NDRC) as oneof twelve    demonstration cities    for integrating social credit systems with finance foreign tradeand market supervision (PBOC and NDRC 2017   Xinhua 2018a). The NIFA has paid specialattention to the Yiwu plans seeking ways to integrate the CISP with both national and localgovernment efforts to compile usable credit databasesincluding the development ofintegrated cloud storage for financial information managed by a stateowned enterprise underthe control of the CBRC (STCN 2018).These patterns of industrygovernment control coordination and cooperation are part ofwhat Creemers (2018 1) refers to as an    evolving practice of control   . The largest lendingplatforms have been central to this push for regulation and the direction of its development.Key members of the NIFA have spoken of the close working relationship between regulatorsand industry players (CNTV 2016). The essence of the compact reached between the newheavyweight DFS providers and the government is clear from the industry   s perspective theirwillingness to confront existing banking monopolies grant them access to the front lines of theChinese consumer revolution as long as they fully meet central government expectations forthe sharing analysis and utilization of underlying data (Interview 4 October 2016   Interview15 September 2017). Just as with the establishment of its wider ecommerce empire AntFinancial has been closely aligned with the priorities of regulators in the development of itsfinancial business (Elliott and Qiao 2015). Ant Financial is now prepared to open its systemsand data to the central bank and other authorities    realtime monitoring and supervision(ECNS 2015) and there remains little doubt that regulatory authorities are in control of theoverall agenda (Interview 29 September 2016   Interview 4 October 2016).The government in turn has a clear interest in exercising control over such firms as AntFinancial. As one source with knowledge of Ant   s growing scrutiny from regulatory authoritiestells it    as a nonbank nonstateowned institution in China it   s not allowed to independentlygrow too big to manage    (Zhang and Ruwitch 2018 n.p.). Party committees are not merely inexistence at the country   s largest tech firms but have been effective in monitoring theiralignment with government priorities and policies (Interview 14 September 2017). Eight majortechnology firms were initially granted pilot licenses to develop consumer credit scoreshowever the PBOC opted later to merge the platforms into one unified credit scoringorganization. Under NIFA   s supervision Baihang Credit Scoring is China   s first unified private Gruin13platform to provide personal credit information services and is intended to supplement theexisting staterun personal credit database (Xinhua 2018b). Financial inclusion is not onlyabout developing new domains from which to extract economic value but also     andpotentially more importantly     about ensuring that the potentials offered through digital creditscoring techniques remain under government control and management. As the next sectiondetails the development of China   s broader social credit system (SCS) provides an insight intothese potentials illustrating how big datadriven financialization can also be leveraged toenable novel forms of algorithmic governance to emerge and take shape.Leveraging digital financialization Governance potentials of algorithmic credit scoringThe preliminary plan for a comprehensive social credit system was announced in 2014 andforms the blueprint for a broader plan of upgrading both social and economic supervisionthrough technological innovation (State Council of the PRC 2014). New financial technologiesare explicitly linked to this social engineering agenda which seeks to create a    more civilized      quality    (suzhi) of thesociety via improvements in the natural psychological and socialcitizenry (Barm   and Goldkorn 2013). This objective has taken on particular significance inthe context of the rise of the Chinese consumer a process closely connected to questions ofsociopolitical change in reformera China and subject to careful    ideology management    by theCCP (Goodman 2014). The holistic systemsoriented focus of Chinese governance that blursthe boundaries between public and private also complicates liberal notions of public andprivate data. As Chen Gang (2016 12) opened with in an influential article    in the presentera data has become a fundamental national strategic resource   . In accordance with theholistic systemsoriented focus of Chinese governance constructing usable digital creditdatabases is an integrated process unfolding along two tracks within the private and statesectors. The construction by large ecommerce and tech platforms of large repositories offinancially valuable consumer data is being complemented by coordinated efforts amongfinancial regulatory bodies such as the PBOC and other central government agenciesincluding the NDRC and the State Internet Information Office the latter of which is chargedwith control over China   s internet censorship and propaganda regimes (see Table 1).The core public repository of credit information is the Credit Reference Centre (CRC) ofthe People   s Bank of China which provides a high quality of existing historical credit data. TheCRC system was initially established in 2004 and will constitute an important foundation forthe broader SCS (PBOC 2015a). Amongst other existing certified financial institutions thePostal Savings Bank of China with the largest branch network in the country is supplyingfinancial data on otherwise difficulttoevaluate rural customers (CFI 2016). Additionallyuncertified credit institutions provide lending information alongside data from public sectorentities handling credittransactions such as phone bills and property tax paymentsinformation from law enforcement agencies and from the court system. All of this is beingfurther integrated into the National Credit Information Sharing Platform which has beenoperational since October 2015 and currently includes almost 400 datasets by more than 30central ministries and governmental agencies (NDRC 2016). These two data collection andprocessing infrastructures     one borne directly out of consumers    online activities the otherfounded upon public records and existing databases     are expected to merge together overthe next years even if the intention is not to produce one single    credit score    as a result butto enable data to be utilized for a variety of different purposes (Interview 2 October 2016  Interview 30 September 2016  Interview 15 September2017). This mutability between private sector initiatives to support commercial business andInterview 29 September 2016   14Finance and Societythe government   s objective to implement broader systems of social governance is a naturalreflection of China   s distinctive political tradition.Table 1. Illustrative data sources for private and public financial credit scoring mechanisms.Source Ant Financial October 2016 (updated September 2017)   PBOC.The initial plan for the social credit system did not refer explicitly to the use of algorithmicbig data analytics. Yet to assume that this means data collected purely for the purposes offinancial risk management will never play a role in the broader matrix of social governancemechanisms would appear na  ve. As one industry professional observed the 2014 SCS planextended through to 2020 but    that is not the end of the process. There will obviously be anew plan after that.    (Interview 15 September 2017). In this light it is less surprising then thatthe more recent 2017 State Council notice on the 13th FiveYear Plan for Market Supervisionrefers specifically to establishing and    perfecting    new regulatory mechanisms involving    creditsupervision big data supervision multidimensional collective governance    and so on (StateCouncil of the PRC 2017 n.p.). The same document also places the role of technology frontand centre in undergirding this system of market supervision that expands the concept of Gruin15credit ratings far beyond financial metrics to include social political and environmentalfactors both in terms of data inputs and rating outputs (State Council of the PRC 2017).Likewise in the implementation of the Internet Plus Plan the State Council has underscoredthe importance of big data analytic techniques to enhance    social governance ability    at alllevels of government as well as the expectation of collaboration between government andtech firms in establishing the necessary credit information sharing platforms (State Council ofthe PRC 2015a). Unsurprisingly the substantive details of the algorithms that will producethese evaluations are as yet and will likely remain unknown. But the intent is clear a constantmonitoring presence of automatically generated and updated credit rating scores which will    in the terms of official discourse     constitute    selfdisciplining enforcement    mechanisms atthe level of both the individual citizen and the corporate entity (State Council of the PRC2017).Both the empirical data sources as well as the algorithmic scoring techniques beingdeveloped across the range of DFS players are thus integral elements in transferring thepractice and methodologies of financial credit rating to a broader range of quantifiable socialand political benchmarks (Yan and Li 2014 291   Xie Zou and Liu 2016b). Although there islittle public acknowledgement of this process the extent to which the laws and regulationsdefining the limits of data sharing between tech firms and the government reflect Beijing   spolitical priorities is widely known amongst officials and industry alike (Interview 13September 2017). One influential former financial policymaker describes the goal in thesetermsFinancial services will be available to all and everyone will enjoy the benefits. In this way Internet finance ismore democratic than a finance controlled by professional elites     Individuals (or institutions) have manystakeholders who all have some information about their wealth employment status personality and so on.If all stakeholders    information is released and pooled on social networks and inaccurate information isdisputed or filtered through social networks and search engines we will get a reliable picture of theircreditworthiness. Social networks also enable the accumulation of    social capital    among people withwhich costs of financial activities will drop considerably and opportunistic behaviors will be constrained.(Xie Zou and Liu 2016a)Such visions underscore just how fine a line there is between the use of credit scoringalgorithms for evaluating financial creditworthiness on the one hand and sociopoliticaltrustworthiness on the other. Those technologies underpinning financial data collection andprocessing become increasingly mutable instruments of financial governance and socialmanagement helping ensure that the financialization of Chinese society buttresses ratherthan undermines the existing power structures of CCPled authoritarian capitalismConclusionThe core argument advanced in this article has been that the rise of Chinese DFS constitutesa digital financialization process embedding technologicalinnovation within the distinctivepolitical economy of Chinese authoritarian capitalism. Its impact arises from the interaction offour factors the emergence of big data credit scoring technologies an economic growth modeldemanding a more open and efficient financial system a retail market environment primed forthe uptake of digital financial services and an authoritarian and ideologically robust stateapparatus seeking to maximize new opportunities for socioeconomic development whilstminimizing related threats to systemic stability and authoritarian control. Although its fullcontours are only beginning to emerge digital financialization is generating new tools and 16Finance and Societyopportunities for the CCP to monitor both individual and corporate actors to sanction them iftheir behaviours are    nonapproved    and to slowly reshape social agency itself into an exercisein satisfying algorithmic templates of economic and social behavior.Analyzing the rise of Chinese fintech in this way has wider implications for ourunderstanding and study of how technological shifts at the heart of financial market practicesand structures can reshape the politics of money and finance. Reframing big datadrivenfinancial liberalization as a form of digital financialization embedded in the broader politics ofcapitalist development illustrates the effect of distinctive political traditions and economicstructures on the nature and consequences of institutional change. The construction ofChina   s digital credit scoring infrastructure is one manifestation of the myriad potential ways inwhich advances in financialtechnology open up new opportunities for socioeconomic   development    as well as the exercise of political authority.This study   s findings thus raise questions deserving furtherresearch into howfinancialization processes can be analyzed in comparative context. First it calls for furthertheorization of different factors that influence financialization in different (trans)nationalcontexts and the accompanying diffusion of technologies and practices. The developmentsanalyzed here are just one historicalinstantiation of how technology can interact with adistinctive political tradition so as to present a novel governance strategy for addressing alongstanding politicoeconomic problem.In other contexts different sociocultural factorsmight be equally important for example the role of Islamic philosophy and ideology (seeRethel 2011) as both a source of normative principles guiding the application of big datatechnologies to financialinstitutionalized powerintermediation as well as an array ofstructures shaping patterns of politicoeconomic power and authority.Secondly this issue of the nature of    the digital    and the crucial role played by technologyin contemporary financial inclusion and financialization speaks to deeper transformations ingovernance across liberal and illiberal societies alike as big data technologies are increasinglydeployed to monitor predict and actively generate the behaviours of technology users. Suchpractices of algorithmic governance are agnostic to the division between the public sphere ofgovernment and the private sphere of enterprise calling into question the ongoing salience ofconceptual dichotomies between    democratic    and    authoritarian    capitalism. This distinctionbecomes increasingly ambiguous when it comes to how the ownership valorization andexploitation of personal data can function as mechanisms of algorithmic governance. Chineseneostatism and AngloAmerican neoliberalism can each rely upon similartools andtechnologies of socioeconomic surveillance and biopolitics despite the differing balance ofpower between juridical sovereign authority (neostatism) and marketsituated capital(neoliberalism). The Chinese case thus provides one instructive example of the role that bigdata and digital credit scoring can play in consolidating nonliberal forms of technologyenabled financial capitalism. At a time when calls are heard for the Western world   s largestmedia technology firms to be regulated as utilities we must be alert and alive to the potentialsof fintechled financialization to likewise consolidate and deepen the authoritarian culturallogics and institutional structures of neoliberal capitalism.
