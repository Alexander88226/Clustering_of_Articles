INTRODUCTION Small and medium enterprises (SMEs) play a significant role  in  economic  development  and  are  considered  the backbone  of  industrial  development.  The  contribution  of SMEs to a nation\\xe2\\x80\\x99s economy can be seen in a number of ways  such  as  employment  opportunities  and  economic output. The objectives of encouraging SMEs in developing countries are to combat unemployment increase the rate of growth  of  real  per  capita  income  balance  income distribution and improve economic stability [1]. Almost all countries including Malaysia acknowledge the significant role  that  SMEs  play  in  their  economic  development.  In Malaysia SMEs have contributed about 31 percent of the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s gross domestic product (GDP) they employ 56                                                            Manuscript received July 28 2013; revised September 30 2013. percent of the workforce and account for 19 percent of total exports. Moreover SMEs account for 99 percent of total businesses in Malaysia. In view of the importance of SMEs to  the  economy  the  Malaysian  government  has  taken various  steps  to  promote  their  growth.  For  example  the SME Master Plan 2011 to 2020 has been designed to align the  roles  of  this  sector  and  the  New  Economic  Model (NEM).  However  despite  the  acknowledged  importance of  SMEs  they  continue  to  face  difficulties  securing funding. SMEs in Malaysia often face problem in obtaining funds  from  financial  institutions  and  the  government  [2]. Usually the interest rate charged by financial institutions on  loans  to  SMEs  is  high.  In  addition  the  financial institutions  frequently  require  collateral  before  they  will approve  a  loan.  Although  SMEs  specifically  micro businesses  may  be  viable  and  have  a  promising  future arranging  such  collateral  may  be  problematic.  This situation  has  resulted  in  some  SMEs  turning  to  illegal money lenders/loan sharks or \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAh Long\\xe2\\x80\\x9d1 because this is the fastest and easiest way of obtaining finance. Ah Long requires no collateral or proper documentation but those who  fail  to  pay  on  time  face  the  threat  of  violence.  The objectives of this paper are to (i) explain the problems that banks  face  with  loan  applications  by  SMEs  and  (ii) examine  the  factors  involved  in  obtaining  loans  from banks. II.  PROBLEMS THAT BANKS FACE WITH LOAN APPLICATIONS BY SMES The financing of SMEs has attracted much attention in recent years driven in part by the fact that SMEs account for the majority of firms in most countries around the world and  account  for  a  significant  share  of  employment  [16]. Furthermore  most  large  companies  usually  start  out  as                                                            1 Ah Long is a term for illegal loan sharks in Malaysia and Singapore. They lend money to people who are unable to obtain loans from banks or other legal sources. They charge a very high interest rate and frequently threaten violence (and administer it) if the loan is not repaid on time. \\xc2\\xa92013 Engineering and Technology Publishingdoi 10.12720/joams.1.4.354357354\\x0c  small  enterprises  so  the  ability  of  SMEs  to  develop  and invest becomes crucial to any economy wishing to prosper. For SMEs to remain viable and grow it is crucial for them to have access to and be able to obtain financial support. Lack of access to financing is a key obstacle to a business\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth especially SMEs [3]. [4] in their study asserted that small  and  new  businesses  face  problems  in  securing finance compared with larger established companies.  [3] highlighted  three  factors  that  make  financial  institutions uninterested  in  involvement  with  SMEs  (i)  financing SMEs is difficult because they are opaque2; (ii) SMEs are more  likely  to  be  informal  compared  with  large  firms something  that  compounds  their  opaqueness  and  poses additional  obstacles  and  risks  to  SME  lending;  and  (iii) banks cannot lend to SMEs if they are unable to provide reliable accounts detailing their financial activity. [5] also highlighted the importance of financial accounting stating that the principal factor that banks take into consideration when conducting credit analysis is the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial statement. An audited financial statement (e.g. chairman\\xe2\\x80\\x99s and  auditor\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  reports)  is  the  most  important  type  of qualitative information and that a balance sheet is the most important  type  of  quantitative  information  [5].  [6]  stated that  because  SMEs  usually  do  not  have  current  audited financial statements it is difficult for them to ascertain their capability/ability to repay a loan and at the same time  to build up a good reputation and relationship with financial institutions.  According  to  [7]  financial  institutions  use almost  the  same  method  qualitative  and  quantitative information to evaluate both large and small companies. The  purpose  of  the  loan  is  also  an  important  factor financial institutions take into consideration when deciding whether  to  approve  a  loan  [5].  The  purpose  refers  to  the type of business the SME is involved in or to the nature of the business the SME wishes to set up. Banks will consider businesses that are viable able to generate income in the long term and appear likely to be successful in the market. [8]  previously  discussed  the  importance  that  banks  place on  collateral  when  approving  loans  for  SMEs  and suggested that the bank requires collateral to offset the risk of  bad  debts.  [9]  and  [10]  concluded  that  collateral minimises moral hazard problems. According to [7] other factors that banks consider in a loan application from SME are  the  company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  management  structure  and  efficiency profit  potentiality  market  strength  performance  and geographical location. [11]  Elucidated  several  problems  faced  by  SMEs  in obtaining  loans  from  banks  (i)  they  cannot  provide  an appropriate  guarantor  or  the  collateral  is  not  sufficient given the amount they wish to borrow; (ii) they do not have sufficient experience in the areas of management planning and business operation and their future business prospects appear unconvincing; (ii) they lack adequate and accurate information  on  development  programs  for  SMEs  offered by government agencies and financial institutions; and (iv)                                                            2 Opaqueness means that it is difficult to know whether firms have the capacity to pay (have viable projects) or they have a willingness to pay (due to moral hazard). they are confused by the types of loans or programs best suited to their need as some of the programs/loans overlap. [12] concluded that SMEs lack accurate information on the types of loans available. They reported that SMEs depend on  informal  information  sources  (hearsay)  regarding available  loans  or  programs  rather  than  on  official information from banks or government agencies. The study asserted  that  the  lack  of  knowledge  means  that  available grants/funds are not fully utilised by SMEs.  III.  METHODOLOGY This exploratory study employed a qualitative research approach  a  library  search  and  interviews.  Officials  from five banks in Malaysia were asked about the problems they faced with loan applications from SMEs. The  main  purpose  of  this  study  was  to  prove  the existence  of  the  subject  under  discussion  that  is  the problems that banks face with loan applications by SMEs [12].  Although  the  data  collection  was  based  on  a semistructured  questionnaire  the  respondents  had  the freedom  to  raise  issues  not  addressed  by  the  questions providing  they  fell  within  the  scope  of  the  research.  The interviews  were  conducted  with  officials  in  charge  of SMEs  in  their  respective  banks  and  used  to  gauge  the problems involved with loan applications. After conducting the interviews the researcher believed that the information obtained was sufficient to achieve the research objectives. The use of a criterion of \\xe2\\x80\\x98satisfactory results\\xe2\\x80\\x99  is  consistent  with  [13]  who  claimed  that  when consistency  in  the  pattern  of  problems  faced  by  the respondents  is  achieved  the  number  of  respondents  is deemed sufficient to fulfil the desired results (satisfactory results). IV.  RESULTS AND DISCUSSION We have divided this section into two parts (i) factors associated  with  obtaining  loans  from  banks  and  (ii) discussion of the results. A.  Factors Associated with Obtaining Loans from Banks Five banks were selected for the purpose of this study although  their  identities  will  not  be  revealed  as  this information  is  associated  with  data  confidentiality.  We instead identified the five banks as Banks A B C D and E.

Discussion of the Results [5] pointed out that the principal factor banks take into consideration  when  performing  credit  analysis  is  the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  financial  statement.  Analysis  of  the  financial statement will provide information about the capability of the  borrower  to  pay  back  a  loan  and  the  level  of  risk exposure  to  the  banks  [14].  The  data  gleaned  from  the interviews supported this finding from the literature. The interviews  with  the  bankers  demonstrated  that  without  a \\xe2\\x80\\x98proper\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financial statement it is unlikely that the banks will approve a loan as SMEs cannot convince the bank of their capability  to  pay  it  back.  However  some  of  the  bankers explained  that  banks  are  less  rigid  with  micro  SMEs  as they do not have consistently audited financial statements. In this case banks need to see only the business records or any  evidence  of  cash  flow  such  as  invoices  bills  and current  account/savings  account  statements.  At  the  same time the system employed by banks in Malaysia including the  Credit  Control  Record  Information  System  (CCRIS) will show the exposure of the borrower\\xe2\\x80\\x99s commitment to other loans or liabilities in Malaysia.  Collateral  is  another  vital  factor  considered  by  banks when deciding whether to approve a loan. All interviewees said  that  although  it  is  not  stated  in  writing  they  will consider  the  loan  if  the  borrowers  have  collateral  or  a qualified  guarantor.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  the study conducted by [8] which found that collateral is the principal  factor  for  financial  institutions  in  approving  a loan.  Although  they  realise  that  SMEs  play  a  significant role in the economy and that difficulties in obtaining loans could  be  obstacles  to  their  business\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  growth  the  banks require collateral to reduce moral hazard problems [9] and [15]. A study by [5] claimed that a good relationship between bank and borrower provides an advantage as if they know each  other  well  then  collateral  will  no  longer  be  a requirement. However our findings went against this study. All interviewees stated that a good relationship would not lessen the requirement for collateral specifically for micro SMEs.  To  approve  a  loan  banks  require  SMEs  to  have collateral  and  a  guarantor.  However  on  the  part  of  the government there are some positive efforts in this regard with  the  availability  of  Credit  Guarantee  Corporations (CGC)  through  which  the  government  guarantees  loan applications  by  SMEs  who  are  regarded  as  highrisk borrowers.  However  CGC  charges  extra  interest  rate  on top  of  that  charged  by  the  bank  which  could  prove burdensome for some SMEs. Banks  also  consider  the  type  of  business  in  which  the borrower is involved.  This  finding  is  consistent  with  [3] who reported that the purpose of the loan is an additional important into consideration  when  deciding  whether  to  approve  a  loan. The  type  of  business  shows  the  marketability  and competitiveness of that particular SME. institutions financial factor take Above  all  [16]  concluded  that  SMEs  lack  accurate information on the types of loans available. They reported that  SMEs  depend  on  informal  information  sources (hearsay)  regarding  available  loans  or  programs  rather than  on  official  information  from  banks  or  government agencies. When asked about this issue two of the bankers admitted that the workshops they conducted were attended by  those  that  have  good  relationships  with  them  and through  some  association  such  as  Malays  Business Council. Therefore micro SMEs  may  not  have  access  to this  type  of  workshop.  It  is  possible  that  they  are  not involved  with  this  association  and  have  less  exposure  to and knowledge about the facilities/workshops. V.  CONCLUSION AND SUGGESTIONS  The study found that to minimise the credit risk banks require SMEs to present certain documents before they can offer a loan. Although loans given to customers is one of their  sources  of  income  as  financial  intermediary  banks have  a  huge  responsibility  to  their  depositors  and shareholders. Therefore they must consider many factors in their credit analysis before approving certain loans. The study  also  identifies  the  success  factors  of  SMEs  in obtaining  loans  in  Malaysia.  Having  identified  these  we now  present  some  suggestions  to  improve  the  financing system  used  by  banks  or  financial  institutions  in  dealing with SMEs. First  given  the  importance  of  SMEs  to  the  growth  of GDP  and  employment  opportunities  in  Malaysia  banks and  financial  institutions  must  consider  their  roles  in facilitating  industry.  The  banks  should  play  their  role  in educating SMEs on the loans or special funds provided by government  and  channelled  through  them  which  are available  to  SMEs.  If  SMEs  continue  to  have  problems obtaining accurate information it will prevent them from getting the most benefit out of the opportunities. It is hoped that  workshops  offered  by  banks  or  financial  institutions are properly targeted to SMEs. Banks should also offer free consultancy as part of their CSR (Corporate Social Responsibility). This can be done 356Journal of Advanced Management Science Vol. 1 No. 4 December 2013\\xc2\\xa92013 Engineering and Technology Publishing\\x0c  through their centre or branches to guide SMEs especially micro  businesses  on  the  documentation  required  for approving a loan. In addition SMEs should be guided by expertise especially experts from banks to help establish viable  and  sustainable  businesses.  It  is  hoped  that  SMEs could  benefit  from  this  service  especially  if  the  banks could  engage  more  experts  in  different  areas  such  as marketing IT financial planning and others. Finally  SMEs  are  advised  to  take  the  opportunity  to enhance their knowledge through the establishment of peer groups which could  liaise with the  banks  or  government agencies  to  increase  knowledge  of  the  system  and  keep them updated with all relevant information.
