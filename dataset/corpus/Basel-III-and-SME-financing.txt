The new Basel III regulations and their operational implementation are currently  being  discussed  primarily  among  experts.  By  contrast  the broader  debate  we  need  on  possible  economic  effects  in  particular  on small  and  mediumsized  enterprises  (SMEs)  is  not  taking  place.  This research  paper  therefore  analyses  the  possible  effects  of  the  Basel  III provisions on SME     nancing and reaches the following conclusions     Blanket application of the Basel III regulations to those traditionally     nancing SMEs could in the medium term jeopardise the stability of SME     nancing and thus economic recovery.     Those providing     nance to SMEs do not have the same opportunities for  capital  accumulation  as  systemically  important  large  banks which are the real target group of Basel III. Liquidity requirements as well as the leverage ratio further impair the operational business of a banking group which especially in the     nancial crisis has proved to be systemstabilising.     Adapting  the  regulations  to  the  various  business  models  and the  relevant  speci    cities  of  national  banking  sectors  is  therefore advisable.  For  systemically  important  banks  active  across  the  EU by contrast full implementation should be sought in order to avoid distortions of competition.5 Managerkreis der FriedrichEbertStiftung2.          Introductory RemarksIn  September  2008  the  insolvency  of  US  investment  bank  Lehman Brothers triggered one of the worst global economic crises since 1929. One year later the heads of state and government of the G20 states meeting in Pittsburgh decided to improve the resilience of the     nancial markets by means of new regulations on banking supervision. The Basel Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  was  tasked  with  implementing this decision. On 16 December 2010 it published the new set of rules known as   Basel III  . The  real  economy  needs  developed  and  well  functioning      nancial markets.  The  experiences  of  the      nancial  crisis  therefore  require  the redesign of the rules governing     nancial market participants and thus also of the rules on banking supervision. However because of the signi    cance of  the      nancial  sector  for  national  economies  a  sound  analysis  of  the effects of any planned new regulations is advisable in order to facilitate correct procedures and to keep unwanted sideeffects to a minimum. The reverse side of any sweeping restrictions on the business activities which triggered the crisis would be the constriction of activities vital to national economies such as general lending to companies. SMEs with an annual turnover of up to 500 million euros make up more than 99 per cent of all German companies and employ more than 70 per cent of all workers (see KfW Bankengruppe 2011). SMEs are therefore the growth engine of the German economy. Consequently the financing of this sphere in particular in the form of investment and working capital must be ensured. The providers of     nancing to SMEs are banks whose business model focuses on this. These are not necessarily major players in other words. Rather in Germany as in many other EU member states these are in particular decentrally organised banks.1 In 2009 they issued almost 60 1  In particular savings banks and cooperative banks. 6 Basel III and SME Financingper cent of all SME loans in Germany (see DSGV 2009 7). Although these  institutions  did  not  cause  the      nancial  crisis  but  rather  proved to  be  a  factor  of  stability  in  the  crisis  Basel  III  includes  them  in  its regulations at least as the regulatory process stands at the moment. This approach could indirectly impede the issue of loans to SMEs. This  research  paper  addresses      rst  and  foremost  the  substantive contents of the Basel III provisions as well as the current status of the regulatory process. It then analyses the possible effects of the Basel III provisions  on  lending  focusing  on  the  intermediaries  in  the  German banking  market  which  are  important  for  SMEs.  The  implications  for SME     nancing are also considered. The paper concludes with a number of proposed measures.7 Managerkreis der FriedrichEbertStiftung3.             Basel III     Current Statusa) Substantive Contents The  revisions  of  Basel  III  essentially  encompass  three  sets  of  issues whose effects will also be analysed here                changing the capital mix and raising the minimum capital ratio;introduction of liquidity ratios (liquidity coverage ratio and net stable funding ratio);introduction of a leverage ratio.In accordance with Basel II capital to date has comprised core capital (tier  1  for  example  paidin  capital  reserves  and  net  earnings) supplementary  capital  (tier  2  for  example  designated  reserves  and longterm  subordinated  liabilities)  and  third  tier  capital  (tier  3  for example  shortterm  subordinated  liabilities)  (see  Seufert  2010  3f). Tier  1  capital  is  subdivided  into    hard    and    additional    capital. This will gradually increase with Basel III by 2019 from 4 per cent to 8.5 per cent consisting of 4.5 per cent hard equity capital 2.5 per cent capital conservation buffer and 1.5 per cent additional equity capital. This change re    ects the goal of Basel III more and   better   capital to reinforce the cushion against losses and thus the capital an institution needs  to  continue  (socalled  goingconcern  capital)  in  contrast  to capital  which  comes  into  play  primarily  in  case  of  insolvency  (also known as goneconcern capital). The latter in other words tier 2 capital consequently falls from 4 per cent to 2 per cent. The category of tier 3 capital has been dropped completely. Determining the level of the capital requirement still depends on risk weighting market price risks and operational risks. We shall not present the changes to individual capital components in detail. 8 Basel III and SME FinancingFurthermore in future liquidity ratios will have to be maintained which are aimed at both the shortterm and longerterm stability of a bank. The liquidity coverage ratio for example is supposed to ensure that a bank has suf    cient highvalue liquid assets on a onemonth basis to be able to cover its liquidity needs in a stress situation (for example a partial run on the bank). The newly introduced leverage ratio     nally limits the total business volume  regardless  of  risk  weighting  and  thus  of  the  composition of  assets  to  33  times  the  tier  1  capital. This  key      gure  has  hitherto been  viewed  as  a  component  of  the  socalled  Pillar  1  and  thus  as  a reporting indicator within the framework of disclosure requirements. With the migration of this key     gure to a capital requirement within the framework of Basel III the in    uence of this indicator has increased. b) State of the Legislative ProcessThe  Basel  Committee  on  Banking  Supervision  has  no  legislative competences.  The  G20  states  must  therefore  transpose  the  Basel  III regulations into national law in order to make them binding on the banks. This is supposed to happen by the end of 2012. However this cannot be guaranteed. The  USA  has  not  even  implemented  Basel  II  yet.  For  EU member states legal transposition takes place in the     rst instance at EU level. At present it is not clear whether Basel III will be transposed as a Directive or at least partly as a Regulation. As a Regulation Basel III would  be  equally  binding  on  all  member  states  without  parliamentary process and without the possibility of adaptation to national circumstances. There  are  good  reasons  for  sticking  to  the  customary  practice  of implementation  in  the  form  of  a  Directive.  In  particular  Germany   s 9 Managerkreis der FriedrichEbertStiftungdecentralised banking structure and the resulting possibility of negative effects  on  SME      nancing  make  it  necessary  to  provide  some  sort  of national room to manoeuvre with regard to legislative transposition (see also  Weber  2011).  Since  the  regulations  of  the  Basel  Committee  are directed primarily at large banks the USA for example is applying the provisions only to these institutions (see Zeitler 2011a). 10 Basel III and SME FinancingEffects of Basel III on the Banks4.a) General Capital and Liquidity Requirements The newly introduced liquidity coverage ratio implies   steering effects in favour of a deposit     nanced business model   (see Benzler 2011 24). Against the  background  of  demonstrable  systemic  risks  with  regard  to  interbank     nance  these  steering  effects  are  desirable  for  the  purpose  of  reducing such risks. Focusing on private deposits however could put pressure on margins and thus lead to a deterioration of the pro    t situation in particular with regard to banks with traditional business models already     nanced by deposits.  A    battle  for  private  deposits    is  therefore  conceivable.  Even though this does not directly imply a reduction in lending the scope for forming revenue reserves and thus tier 1 capital would be curbed. In a kind of secondround effect this can reduce banks    ability to lend.The  objective  of  helping  individual  institutions  by  means  of  more  and harder capital to operate with greater caution and resilience and thus also to  increase  systemic  stability  (see  Zeitler  2011b  4)  is  to  be  welcomed. Against the background of the principalagent problem however one might consider whether capital is the right instrument as far as instilling caution is concerned. The problem of Basel III   s undifferentiated approach also comes to light at this point. The real addressees of the Basel III provisions     banks that are supposedly too big to fail     can make direct use of the capital markets for their additional capital needs. In this way for example Deutsche Bank and  Commerzbank  have  already  carried  out  capital  increases  by  issuing new shares. The intermediary banks concentrating on SME     nancing     in particular savings banks cooperative banks and also private bankers and regional banks     must in contrast cover increased capital requirements in the     rst instance from retained pro    ts. Should the mechanism just described develop this would make capital formation even more dif    cult for those banks as a result of the pressure on their margins. The   illiquidity   of the capital of these banking groups also impairs the setting up of (anticyclical) 11 Managerkreis der FriedrichEbertStiftungcapital buffers since hard core capital cannot be acquired shortterm via the capital market even given attractive conditions. In these circumstances capital cannot breathe and over the long term in the context of Basel III it must be increased either through retained earnings or through appeals to shareholders. Capital formation is also hindered by the fact that for certain institutions Basel III foresees among other things the gradual introduction between 2014  and  2018  of  abatements  for  the  difference  between  reserves  and calculated expected losses from the lending business (see Benzler 2011 14 and Basel Committee on Banking Supervision 2010 22). Therefore if expected losses calculated with reference to rating systems are above the reserves required under commercial law this gives rise to an additional abatement from regulatory capital. Whether the effect of this will be to shrink the volume of credit allocated is not as yet clear. Because it can be assumed that the economic risk manifesting itself in among other things expected losses has already in    uenced the economic management of the bank. Certainly this applies only if regulatory capital does not represent a  bottleneck.  If  regulatory  capital  does  constitute  a  bottleneck  these abatements will tend to have the effect of restricting credit allocation all the more so because the role of regulatory capital in the capital management of the bank will be increasing as against economic capital (see Rabobank Group 2011 27). b) Capital Requirement for SME Loans Hitherto in accordance with Basel II riskweighted assets have had to be backed by at least 8 per cent own capital. Through the socalled SME compromise however certain loans can be regarded as being in the retail portfolio provided that the total volume of credit to one borrower does not exceed 1 million euros. Basically a uniform risk weighting of 75 per cent applies to the retail portfolio. This regulation concerns approximately 94.5  per  cent  of  all  companies  (see  Bundesverband  deutscher  Banken 2005 13). SME loans at present have to be backed with 6 per cent own capital. By means of the acrosstheboard increase in the minimum capital 12 Basel III and SME Financingratio to 10.5 per cent without a simultaneous adjustment of risk weighting the capital requirement will rise to almost 8 per cent in accordance with the Basel III provisions. This corresponds to a risk weighting of 100 per cent according to the existing regulation. No objective reason for this is discernible. SME loans certainly did not trigger the     nancial crisis. This is questionable above all in the context of other risk weightings for example those for European government bonds. This point was addressed in detail for example in 2010 by Erste Group Bank (Erste Group Bank AG 2010). There is also a regulatory paradox why higher capital requirements when capital cannot be used to cushion risks since falling short of the minimum capital ratio already leads to sanctions (see Benzler 2011 19)? In future therefore the banks must hold a capital conservation buffer which may be reduced in times of crisis (see Zeitler 2011b 5). As a result this means that the average effective capital requirement is increased to over 8 per cent. c) Impairment of Capital Allocation to SME Loans due to Capital Consumption for SecuritiesBasel  III  is  accompanied  by  an  increase  in  risk  weightings  for  trading book  positions  and  securitisations  (see  Rabobank  Group  2011  15). At      rst  sight  this  seems  to  be  a  step  in  the  right  direction  in  terms  of SME     nancing since the risk weightings for private and corporate loans remain untouched and supposedly risky positions are covered by higher capital requirements. On the assumption that trading book positions or securitisations would be disposed of in response to this increased capital requirement  even  regulatory  risk  capital  would  be  released  for  SME loans.  In  view  of  the  still  unstable  situation  on  the  money  and  capital markets     in particular the market for securitisations     it is questionable however whether it will really be possible to dispose of transactions with risk weightings that are higher under the Basel III regime. One obstacle to disposal could be valuation losses in income statements. By design independent of a risk weighted view is the socalled leverage ratio also known as the modi    ed balance sheet equity ratio. This represents 13 Managerkreis der FriedrichEbertStiftungthe  relationship  between  hard  core  capital  and  balance  sheet  assets including  offbalance  sheet  items.  Since  no  risk  weighting  underlies this indicator it is assumed that viewed in isolation this     gure provides an  incentive  to  prefer  presumably  highyield  assets  to  less  pro    table transactions (see Benzler 2011 30). Taking all the new indicators     capital (including abatements and risk weightings)  liquidity  and  leverage  ratio       the  question  arises  of  a   regulatorily  optimal    bank  portfolio  which  meets  all  requirements simultaneously.  Different  market  participants  now  assume  that  in  this form there is no such thing in particular if other regulatory innovations such as the Capital Requirement Directive II are included.d) Possible Implementation Dif    culties in the Case of Banks that Finance SMEsOne operational point is the question of whether SME credit institutions have  available  the  kind  of  personnel  and  technical  capacities  they need to be able to implement the new regulatory requirements in time. Implementation will require signi    cant efforts at both the institutional and the banking association levels. Assuming that the institutions concerned as a rule are not those that caused the crisis the question arises of whether any likely increase in stability would be commensurate with the cost. 14 Basel III and SME Financing Implications for SME Financing 5.   a) Credit Crunch and Increases in the Cost of BorrowingThe  effects  on  banks     lending  conditions  described  in  Section  3  can have  a  negative  impact  on  SME      nancing  in  two  ways.  On  the  one hand  capital  could  represent  a  bottleneck.  However  this  is  not  to  be understood to mean that increased capital requirements tie up resources that might otherwise be used for lending capital should not be confused with liquidity here (see FAZ 2011 and Admati et al. 2010 10). Certainly capital is a limiting factor with regard to lenders    transactions. Without raising  further  equity  or  securitisation  growth  potential  in  lending  is limited. In particular because of the current limitations on their ability to pass on default risks by means of securitisations or other instruments on the capital market banks do not have further scope for lending (see Dentz 2010 9). On top of this comes the newly introduced leverage ratio mentioned above which generally limits new business. The latter can for example have the effect of contracting lowmargin but highvolume business such as stateguaranteed export     nancing (see Bundesverband deutscher Banken 2010). In addition the in the end stricter requirements with regard to regulatory capital  can  lead  to  increased      nancing  costs.  Certainly  the  costs  at enterprise  level  (private  costs)  are  not  to  be  regarded  as  isolated  but rather should be weighed against the costs at the level of the economy (social costs) (see Miles et al. 2011 2). The point of departure of this consideration     from a recent English study (Miles et al. 2011)     is that no signi    cant connection is discernible between the leverage of British banks and GDP growth. It is worth looking more closely at these lines of argument especially in light of the fact that clearly no signi    cant link is discernible between customer conditions for loans and the leverage of banks in the UK and the USA. 15 Managerkreis der FriedrichEbertStiftungTheoretically  based  on  the  ModiglianiMiller  Theorem  it  could  be argued  that  capital  costs  are  independent  of  the  relationship  between equity and debt. With growing capital adequacy the return requirements of  equity  providers  fall  because  of  the  lower  risk  premium  (see  also FAZ 2011 and Admati et al. 2010 14). Even though the assumption of frictionless markets which underlies the theory is not met the sensitivity of customer conditions with regard to the banks    capital ratio appears to be only comparatively low. These arguments seem to point in the right direction higher capital requirements have a bene    cial effect overall on the one hand customer conditions clearly cannot be too sensitive to the level of the capital ratio (low private costs) and on the other hand with rising capital ratios the probability of bank crises and associated collapses in  GDP  (social  costs)  falls.  The  abovementioned  study  examines  the situation for large British banks. One key     nding is the following   These estimates illustrate that     even doubling the amount of bank capital has a relatively modest impact upon the average cost of bank funds     ranging from  just  under  40bps  to  under  10bps    (Miles  et  al.  2011  27).2  The authors come to the conclusion that a level of capital above that required by Basel III would be desirable. The  question  arises  of  whether  this  is  applicable  to  SME      nanciers. That cannot be assumed ad hoc. On the one hand the argument that the AngloSaxon     nancing structure of enterprises is not directly applicable to the German equivalent is valid. On the other hand capital costs are calculated  based  on  the  capital  asset  pricing  model.  In  capital  market theory  the  required  capital  risk  premium  can  be  ascertained  with  this model. Precisely this is to be regarded critically with regard to savings banks  and  cooperative  banks  since  both  groups  of  institutions  have development mandates and the return on equity for shareholders is not a primary performance indicator. 2  The German Bundesbank in a simulation calculation on the effects of the Basel III capital requirements arrives at a margin of around 50 basis points for the German market (see Deutsche Bundesbank 2010 112).16 Basel III and SME FinancingAt any rate to these banking groups the connection between private costs and  social  costs  is  not  evident.  With  regard  to  the      nancing  structure of  German  SMEs  however  we  can  assume  that  the  consequences  of higher forwarded capital costs would be more pronounced in Germany. In this connection the Bundesbank points out that the expected capital requirements of individual banks vary and   among others are fairly low for  savings  banks  and  cooperative  banks    (see  Deutsche  Bundesbank 2010 112). Nevertheless the Bundesbank also points to the danger of higher interest spreads and potential negative effects on the real economy. The effects of the introduction of the new liquidity ratios mentioned above were not examined. Finally it is conceivable that the banks will try to reduce the risk they have to take into account by means of stricter requirements concerning credit quality. The conclusion must be therefore that even if Basel III does not lead to a fall in the volume of     nancing for SMEs an increase in borrowed capital costs is at least possible or access to borrowed capital will be impeded due to higher requirements with regard to credit quality. b) Current State of SME FinancingAt  present  there  are  no  concrete  indications  of  lending  bottlenecks. According  to  the    credit  hurdle    calculated  by  the  ifo  Institute  only around 24 per cent of the enterprises asked recently complained about restricted  lending  (see  ifo  Institute  2011).  This  is  one  of  the  lowest     gures  since  this  statistic  began  to  be  recorded.  It  is  true  that  banks are  clearly  issuing  fewer  loans  than  before  the      nancial  crisis.  In comparison to 2008 the total volume of loans in 2010 showed a fall of over 34 per cent.3 Against this general trend in the crisis and thereafter 3  Result of an analysis by the Bundesbank   s MFIZinsstatistik for the period 2008 to 2010. 17 Managerkreis der FriedrichEbertStiftungdecentrally  organised  credit  institutions  in  particular  were  able  to ensure  the  stability  of  SME      nancing.  For  example  in  Germany  in 2010  the  volume  of  lending  to  enterprises  and  the  selfemployed  by savings banks was 317 billion euros an increase of around 7 per cent on 2008. The same applies to the cooperative banks which in 2010 lent a total of 178 billion euros to enterprises and selfemployed an increase of around 9 per cent on 2008 (see Deutsche Bundesbank 2011). However the situation on the capital markets remains tense. The Western industrialised countries will not be able to reduce their new debt to zero for the foreseeable future and thus will continue to resort frequently to the bond markets. There are also the bond issues of the Euro Rescue Fund.  Looking  at  the  schedule  of  introduction       the  commencement of higher capital requirements in 2013     it should also be noted that this coincides with the socalled   wall of re    nancing   in other words in 2013 and 2014 many corporate bonds and loans will fall due (see Gisdakis 2011). This increased supply will lead to rising yields and thus indirectly to an increase in the cost of bank loans. On  the  other  hand  SMEs  are  restricted  in  their  choice  of  forms  of     nancing.  Traditionally  house  bank  loans  have  been  SMEs     main     nancing  instrument  around  80  per  cent  of  the  volume  of      nancing is  covered  in  this  way  (see  Bl  ttchen/Nespethal  2010  496).  Capital market related     nancing instruments because of the volumes required and documentation requirements are not available to most SMEs. The dependence on bank loans has not led to any problems to date with regard  to      nancing  in  an  economic  upturn.  Indeed  in  particular  the period before the     nancial crisis was characterised by a surplus of both domestic and foreign loans. Furthermore a consolidation process is to be expected among the regional banks. The volume of credit is therefore not likely to reach the precrisis level in the foreseeable future. The combination of Basel III the tense situation on the capital markets and  overall  reduced  credit  volumes  can  thus  result  in  a  deterioration of  the  SME      nancing  situation.  Whether  the  interim  arrangements and the gradual implementation of Basel III will cushion the possible negative effects on SME     nancing is questionable (for a different view 18 Basel III and SME Financingsee Zeitler 2011b 5). Apart from that the technical basis is lacking for some of the consequences of Basel III for example the higher capital requirements with regard to SME loans and the unrestricted application to SME     nanciers.19 Managerkreis der FriedrichEbertStiftung6.                Measures New capital requirements and the introduction of liquidity ratios are a logical consequence of the     nancial crisis and thus are necessary. The breakdown of the interbank market and the state rescue packages to support the banks    capital in the     nancial crisis have clearly brought it  about  that  a  readjustment  is  necessary  with  regard  to  levels  of capital and liquidity. However there are wellfounded doubts whether the   Basel III corset   should be applied without adjustments to the banking  structure  in  Germany.  To  guarantee  the  stability  of  SME     nancing in the future the FES Managerkreis therefore recommends the following measures                Basel III as has been the practice so far must be implemented as  an  EU  Directive.  In  that  way  national  legislators  would have the opportunity to adjust the Basel III provisions to the specific conditions of the national market. In  particular  the  regulations  must  be  adapted  to  the  typical SME  financiers  which  in  terms  of  size  and  business  model sometimes  differ  considerably  from  the  large  institutions that  are  the  real  addressees  of  Basel  III. At  the  same  time full  implementation  of  Basel  III  for  systemically  important EUwide  banks  should  be  sought  in  order  to  avoid  possible distortions of competition. A  new    SME  compromise    must  be  found  for  Basel  III (analogous to Basel II) in order that the capital requirements for SME loans are not raised. This could happen by means of a change in risk weighting. Despite  the  stability  of  bankbased  corporate  financing  in Germany in consideration of the possible negative effects of 20 Basel III and SME FinancingBasel III on SME financing further extension of capital market access for SMEs is desirable on the grounds of diversification of financing sources.
