Crowdfunding is one of the most dynamically growing segments of fintech but at the same time the academic world is voicing justified scepticism in respect of the sustainability and operating background of the original model. For the time being the position of banks is protected by the legislative and regulatory background but digitally advanced users are seeking out walletfriendly and convenient solutions for the administration of their financial affairs as well. According to certain estimates bank revenues could drop by as much as 20% by 2023 due to the rise of the fintech sector and one third of bank employees could lose their jobs in ten years. Equitybased crowdfunding has the potential to become an alternative to traditional corporate and projectfinancing techniques. The communityforming power of online fundraising platforms is strong and certain campaigns may also serve market communication purposes.1KeywordS crowdfunding fundraising venture capital financial innovation startup financing  JeLcodeS G19 G24 G31 G32 F36 016 for alternative Ttoday  crowdfunding  has  become  a  viable fundraising innovative entrepreneurial ideas (schwienbacher Larralde 2010  p.  2).  innovation  enterprises     needs for  growth  technological  development  and the  increasingly  democratic  capital  market role of the masses enabled the emergence of a new  breed  of  financing  forms  where  funders      supporters  or  investors       strive  to  gain among other things social benefits through the allocation of funds via internet platforms (Kuti     Madar  sz 2014).Following  a  theoretical  introduction  of a  more  general  nature  this  study  will  present  the  investmentbased  returnsfocused crowdfunding model. in the near future this modern form of investment could potentially become  a  competitive  and  secure  alternative Email address  akos.gabossy@outlook.comto traditional fundraising options outside the united states as well. The initial hypothesis of this  paper  is  that  the  original  crowdfunding business  model  is  in  a  state  of  transition  as demonstrated by the recent focus on     strictly interpreted       profitoriented  initiatives  that are  also  sustainable  in  the  long  run.  Besides helping the creator/project owner raise funds a relevant aspect of these initiatives is to offer services similar to those provided by banks to investors.  The  traditional  banking  sector  has also become aware of the gaining of ground of the socalled fintech sector2 and technologybased     typically online     financial businesses are optimising more and more banking processes.domestic  literature       presumably  on  account of the absence of successful platforms in continental europe     has to date not examined crowdfunding indepth. At the same Public Finance Quarterly     2016/4  533     studies    time one of the refreshing exceptions is the 2014 publication by the author duo M  nika Kuti  and  G  bor  Madar  sz  who  provide  a comprehensive  overview  of  the  basic  types and main driving forces of the phenomenon (Kuti       Madar  sz  2014).  The  publication by  Andr  s  Bethlendi  and  Rich  rd  V  gh  also released in 2014 presents the most popular platforms  and  also  analyses  the  regulatory background and necessity of the sector in certain key countries (Bethlendi     V  gh 2014). This  paper  takes  the  theoretical  background of  the  Kuti       Madar  sz  article  as  its  basis. The topicality of the subject matter is well reflected by the fact that according to the report prepared based on data from industry players while in 2012 crowdfunding platforms mediated a total of usd 2.7 billion in 2015 this (audited) value was in excess of usd 34 billion  keeping  with  the  approximately  100% rate  of  growth  per  year  (Massolution  LLC 2015).ThEorETiCAl bACkGround prEsEnTATion oF CrowdFundinGGlobalisation  along  with  the  proliferation of  the  internet  gradually  created  a  system of  selforganising  networks  where  work  is performed along principles of laboursharing and  access  to  information  represents  true value.  After  the  military  communication and  entertainmentrelated  application  of  the internet  it  was  inevitable  that  the  potential in  network  developments  will  sooner  or later  also  impact  the  financial  and  trade sectors.  Based  of  the  organisation  theory approach  of  Evans  and  Wurster  meaningful communication  can  primarily  be  realised among  a  few  players  positioned  close  to one  another  in  a  hierarchical  system  while widespread information provision is primarily realised  through  the  indirect  channels  of the  organisational  pyramid.  Based  on  the conclusions  a  few  new  businesses  will  profit  from  networkbased  economic  models while trust and business reputation will serve as key values in the future (evans     Wurster 1997).  The  roles  of  users  buyers  and  sellers will become blurred and mixed up resulting in  a  symmetric  flow  of  information  (Andr  s Nemeslaki  2004).  This  is  accompanied  by an intense wave of technologyled innovation      a  process  that  typically  started  at  the beginning  of  the  2000s       that  allowed  for the satisfaction of latent consumer needs at a new and higher level of quality. The concept of  innovation  was  introduced  in  economics in 1939 by Schumpeter and has since formed the  basis  of  all  new  innovation  theories despite  the  fact  that  this  initially  referred  to manufacturing companies. Crowdfunding is a complex product an innovative solution where (with the help of technological development) technology  and  the  market  develop  side by  side  and  the  result  has  high  innovation value  for  all  players  in  the  market.  internet companies  still  in  their  early  development phase  recognised  consumer  susceptibility to  innovative  financial  solutions  and  paired these       after  a  relatively  brief  development period       with  convenient technological solutions  that  are  easy  to  understand  and test  by  users  and  can  be  integrated  into past  experiences.  The  unique  characteristic however of internet technologies is that they are relatively simple to duplicate. in addition the  profitgenerating  capacity  of  businesses is  also  typically  evidenced  in  a  later/mature operating phase (Chik  n 2005). The market advantage attainable by companies is limited and no business has managed to acquire a truly monopolistic position in the given market to date. Market leaders for the most part are also only exploiting their market communication powers  rather  than  relying  on  individual proprietary and secret technological solutions.534  Public Finance Quarterly     2016/4 Nonetheless the swiftly rising popularity of interactive fundraising campaigns realised via the internet cannot be disputed. Venture capital and private equity funds along with other relevant industry players invested more than usd 50 billion in nearly 2500 fintech firms after 2010. These are companies that thanks to their innovative solutions have rethought the saving borrowing insurance and financial transaction  habits  of  households  (Accenture 2016).As a result of media interest and the promotion of wellknown Web 2.0 applications smaller or larger scale fundraising campaigns realised online are in a state of explosive expansion.  At  the  same  time  grave  concerns have  been  raised  by  a  number  of  stakeholders in respect of the sustainability and the operational  background  of  the  original  model (Burtch Ghose     Wattal 2013 p. 16). it was in response to the dynamic growth of the market and to academic and practical experience and criticisms that the Obama Administration adopted the Jumpstart Our Business startups Act  (JOBs  Act)  which  primarily  aims  to  set out  the  secure  operating  background  of  the equitybased business model.Crowdfunding  is  a  fundraising  process where a private individual a project or a company receives smaller amounts of funds from a  high  number  if  interested  parties/investors      for  moral  reasons  for  voting  rights  or  in exchange  for  (in)tangible  goods       typically via the internet (Oxford dictionary). it is assumed that the term originates from the word crowdsourcing initially introduced during the first Obama campaign.The essence of this activity is that cooperative groups organised on the internet use the power of the community to develop a given project and work together and participate in a valuecreating process (e.g. creative design artistic creation charity etc.).in the case of crowdfunding these are typi    studies    cally initiatives that in the past were informally financed by friends and family members rather than institutional investors (Vargas 2011 p. 2). These projects without background or track record did not pass     on account of the extreme underlying risk and unpredictability      the  business  plan  analysis  and  assessment processes developed by venture capital firms business  angels  and  banks.  Moreover  these are often notforprofit and cultural initiatives that should actually fall into the category of patronage or donation. The success of crowdfunding sites (that have been growing increasingly  popular  online  since  the  beginning  of the  2000s)  automatically  meant  that  viral grassroots initiatives could be financially and morally supported along the principles of    little  streams  make  great  rivers     and  by  introducing  appropriate  technological  solutions. The uniqueness of the market is well reflected by the fact that the roles of the buyer and the seller are determined on the basis of perspective. While the platform represents the supply side the project owner and the simple user/small  investor  are  also  part  of  demand.  in contrast with the services offered by the traditional banking system the driving forces behind the propagation of crowdfunding     primarily from a user/investor perspective     can be  summed  up  as  follows  (drew  Hendricks 2014)   \\tthe  transaction  is  convenient  and  easily accessible for players on both sides;   \\tthe  power  of  the  crowd  legitimises  the idea and confirms market demand;   \\tinvestor  risk  is  reduced  therefore  the project owner does not start developing/investing without funds;   \\tstakeholders instantaneous receive feedback  as  the  internet  allows  for  swift communication;   \\tan efficient marketing tool as promotion based on spontaneous sharing is by far the most efficient.Public Finance Quarterly     2016/4  535     studies    Moreover from a technological perspective everything was given for developers to adapt the  communitybased  transactions  already tried and tested by consumers to moneyoriented  platforms  that  are  able  to  bring  traditional financial products closer to laymen and make them easier to understand. it should be noted  that  no  new  financing  solutions  were created  and  there  was  no  organisational  innovation.  These  were  only  mediating  websites that for the most part mediated existing financial products through new channels to  market  players  with  higher  risk  resilience (and  greater  yield  expectations).  Companies with bad credit ratings are more likely to turn to crowdfunding solutions. Banking products are less accessible to businesses with minimal collateral background. Banking activity typically  becomes  sluggish  in  the  time  of  financial  crises.  in  such  periods  crowdfunding becomes  a  primary  fundraising  opportunity (daniel Blaseg     Michael Koetter 2015).The  following  section  presents  the  four basic crowdfunding models known today according to their spreading over time (Mollick 2014 p. 3).The  patronage  model  where  the  community supports various charitable initiatives and expects no direct return is perhaps the least interesting form from an economic perspective. This in essence is simple donation. An individual or a group in some part of the world requires help and the community comes to their assistance patronising them along humanitarian principles. Perhaps the most wellknown manifestation of this model is the supporting of  (typically)  agricultural  initiatives  that  facilitate the daytoday sustenance of impoverished people in the third world.in the lending (peertopeer lending) model private individuals lend money based on certain  principles  to  others  for  a  specific  interest  who  then  repay  the  loan  according  to  a preagreed  schedule.  Given  the  fact  that  in these  business  transactions  collateral  is  not adequately  elaborated  the  patronage  nature is  frequently  apparent.  deviating  from  the philanthropic  model  the  target  audience  of these platforms is not the developing world but primarily Western civilisation where users often borrow to buy a vehicle or a hobby tool. The service is mostly considered to be a replacement product of credit cards or smaller personal bank loans. in contrast with conventional banking operation the benefits of internet lending can be summed up as follows (Alistair Milne     Paul Parboteeah 2016)   \\tthe lender is able to generate higher yields with  lower  fees  than  for  example  by investing money in bank deposits;   \\tcredit  assessment  is  often  more  lenient which means that people considered to be insolvent from a banking perspective also have access to funds;   \\tsocial valuecreation is potentially realised during transactions while the process also has personal elements;   \\ttechnological  innovation  improves  the quality  and  speed  of  administration resulting in a more convenient service for both the lender and the beneficiary.The third model rewardbased crowdfunding  is  the  most  prevalent  form  of  crowdfunding  today  with  truly  impressive  and easytocommunicate  projects  having  been implemented  as  a  result  of  these  initiatives. in  this  approach  funders  receive  a  tangible or  intangible  reward  for  backing  a  project. They are often referred to as early customers or prebuyers as they purchase the given products before they are actually marketed (in the prototype phase) thereby supporting product development and market introduction. Based on this logic a multitude of online developments  inventions  computer  games  technological innovations  and  culturalartistic creations  have  found  millions  of  supporters through  the  mediation  of  the  revolutionary 536  Public Finance Quarterly     2016/4 Kickstarter website. Venture capital firms have the most to fear from the continuing progress of  these  platforms  but  the  market  of  lowamount coveragebased corporate loan products could also take a hit. Beyond the fact that the project owner does not have to release a business  share  to  launch  operations  another great competitive advantage of the model in contrast to conventional banking products is that financing is typically realised on a confidential (and not coverage) basis. One of the most important collateral instruments of such platforms is publicity.The efficiency of the model is well reflected by the fact that as research found a successful fundraising campaign will very likely lead to further investments. in the case of a usd 75000 campaign the probability of the target  company  receiving  another  capital  injection  when  it  reaches  the  marginal  efficiency level is 40%; in other words from that point onwards  each  additional  dollar  attracts  new investors at a smaller rate. in addition a successful  campaign  can  generate  considerable publicity and the stakeholders are very likely to find committed employees conclude beneficial business agreements and establish a stable clientele (Venkat Kuppuswammy     Kathy Roth 2016).The  traditional  capital  investment  model differs  from  the  aforementioned  three  arrangements in that it is based on strictly business foundations the interests of investors are properly represented and the yields expected vary depending on the risk of the given project/undertaking.  The  founder  acquires  capital  while  the  investors  receive  their  stake  as well  as  related  voting  rights.  if  the  project owner offers investors a certain percentage of future revenues we talk about a royaltybased model. These models require a higher level of expertise as well as appropriate statutory regulations.  in  the  us  only  accredited  investors can  take  part  in  iPOs  (initial  Private  Offer    studies    ings)  as  private  individuals  (such  issues  are riskier but promise higher returns). it was the loosening of this barrier amongst other things that the JOBs Act was meant to accomplish in the us which     by reducing bureaucratic obstacles     considerably expands the fundraising  opportunities  of  startup  businesses  and also makes the route to public listing simpler. This model could bring restructuring primarily on the market of larger corporate loans and bonds; in addition private equity investment funds operating with considerably lower yield expectations       compared  to  venture  capital firms     will also gain new competitors.CriTiCism oF TrAdiTionAl  modElsGiven  that  certain  crowdfunding  websites can  look  back  on  ten  years  of  operation considerable operationrelated experience has been amassed in this topic. The business model has been criticised on numerous occasions by both  academic  and  professional  circles.  The issue that perhaps impacts the greatest number of  stakeholders  is  the  protection  of  funder interests.  Very  few  industry  opinion  leaders are truly aware that in respect of the operation of  crowdfunding  platforms  the  funder  is at  least  as  important  a  player  as  the  project owner.  if  the  website  is  unable  to  guarantee that the donor   s money will go to a safe place or that the beneficiary can only use the funds for  the  predefined  purpose  sustainability is  thrown  into  doubt.  A study  published  in 2012 examined 471 Kickstarter projects that succeeded  in  reaching  their  funding  goals. interestingly  of  the  471  projects  381  had clearly  identifiable  outcomes  before  the  date selected by the researchers. Of the 381 closed and  assessable  project  launches  there  were 14 initiatives that turned out to be frauds; in other words the project owner disappeared or Public Finance Quarterly     2016/4  537     studies    failed to account for the funds raised (Mollick 2014 p. 11). Based on the report released by Kickstarter  itself  the  number  of  registered frauds  or  fraudulent  attempts  is  negligible which is impressive for a semi notforprofit initiative although it does raise a number of questions when compared to a bank.On  a  related  note  less  than  one  third  of the  projects  featured  in  the  aforementioned study  were  completed  on  time;  in  other words  product  manufacturing  did  not  start by  the  undertaken  deadline.  it  is  clear  that despite  project  owners/entrepreneurs  taking their commitment very seriously professional and  organisational  problems  are  frequently encountered  during  implementation.  Many feel that the success of a given product launch depends  more  on  presentational  ability  and luck  than  actual  entrepreneurial  and  industryspecific  knowhow.  Founders  do  not  go through  the  usual  entrepreneurial  creative and  preparatory  process;  the  funds  more  or less  fall  into  their  lap  after  a  wellexecuted video  presentation  but  afterwards  many  of them fail to manage/account for the money received. deviating from this logical analogy is the opinion which states that the launching  of  a  project  has  the  power  to  generate demand and as such many are systematically using  these  sites  as  marketing  tools  as  the first  step  of  introducing  a  new  professional service/product to the market. in the case of classic  equity  investments  one  of  the  most important characteristic of the funder is that in  addition  to  the  necessary  funds  it  also provides social and knowledge capital to their partner. due to the high number of investors involved in crowdfunding establishing an intimate  relationship  is  practically  impossible and this type of cooperation is decidedly impersonal.Another  interesting  observation  is  that  in traditional models the minimum amount of own funds risked by the beneficiary cannot be regulated and therefore idea creators or project launchers primarily use the funds of others and risk nothing but their own time. Another justified criticism about the operation of traditional crowdfunding sites is that     due to unlimited publicity     projects offering confidential business/technology solutions are wary of raising funds online (Caldbeck 2013). At the  same  time  Facebook twitter  and  other popular social media sites can make any given campaign  lose  credibility  as  tabloidinfected fundraising  might  scare  off  serious  investors planning  for  the  longterm.  Finally  perhaps the most severe criticism of traditional models is that crowdfunding has become    trendy    and the realisation of ideas     generated by the truckload     is not shaped by realistic demand and supply. The segment is showing signs of the emergence of a dangerous financial bubble  allowing  people  to  invest  into  projects without  expertise  thereby  giving  financial support  to  others  without  merit  (dupree 2013). Moreover those familiar with the system are able to manipulate certain campaigns for profit and companies with multiple successful  campaign  launches  under  their  belt are able to accelerate processes through welltimed capital injections from their own funds thereby  bolstering  the  viral  proliferation  of projects  through  consciously  generated  false popularity.ThE EquiTybAsEd CrowdFundinG modElin  response  to  the  critical  observations detailed in the previous section     based on the crowdfunding  report  published  annually  by Massolution     of the four general platforms equitybased  crowdfunding  sites  have  the highest  rate  of  growth.  Between  2007  and 2011  the  compound  annual  growth  rate (CAGR)  of  campaigns  launched  was  114% 538  Public Finance Quarterly     2016/4 (Massolution  LLC.  2012  p.  17).  Once  an appropriate  global  statutory  background  has been  established  this  business  model  will be  able  to  take  on  banks  as  well  as  other institutional  investors.  The  obstacles  posed by  physical  distances  become  practically eliminated and investors and project owners can  both  think  within  global  frameworks (Wingerden       Ryan  2011  p.  54).  Thanks to  community  valuecreation  innumerable realisations  and  concepts  were  integrated into  the  various  projects.  Last  but  not  least players  that  previously  did  not  have  the opportunity can also invest in startup businesses (Almerico 2013).equitybased  crowdfunding  differs  from the three basic models in several respects. in most  cases  the  site  guarantees  some  sort  of project screening or preliminary revision. This is  followed  by  the  capital  allocation  process based on the    all   or   nothing    principle where the  venture  either  raises  the  target  amount within a specific funding window or the project is not realised with the site   s involvement and the money is returned to investors. This is followed by the investment/implementation period where in an optimal situation owners are provided information throughout the process  resulting  in  an  interactive  communication of sorts. The process is concluded by the operating period where ownership is restructured the company is headed by professional management and profitgenerating corporate operation is realised from a single idea (Collins     Pierrakis 2012). The representation of investor interests in the above model can be realised in a number of ways. in an optimal case they can influence the company   s operation at a (virtual) general meeting and get involved in the  operation  as  fullfledged  shareholders.  it should be noted that one of the exceedingly rare versions of the equitybased model is the royaltybased  crowdfunding  model  where investors acquire royalty interest in the intel    studies    lectual property of the company thereby becoming stakeholders in the given project with a different perspective and with different interests (World Bank 2013 p. 20).The 2016 study prepared by the european union admits that the volume of crowdfunding is low for the time being but at the same time the sector has considerable potential in respect of growth and job creation (impacting the sMe sector startups and unlisted small businesses). The analysis also touches on potential risks and notes that their regulation is the responsibility of the countries concerned (european  Commission  2016).  These  risks may include the following   \\tinvestors losing part or all of their capital or  not  getting  the  returns  they  expect; inability to exit investments in the absence of a secondary market;   \\tshare dilution if the company engages in further rounds of capital raising;   \\tinsufficient  information  or  inability  to price  correctly  the  securities  invested  in with appropriate professional control and prescreening often missing;   \\tconflict  and  misalignment  of  interests between  entrepreneurs  platforms  and investors;   \\tinsolvency  of  the  platform  operators resulting  in  deterioration  of  quality  and required financial guarantees are generally missing by crowdfunding firms;   \\tfraud (both for the investors and for the project)  and  related  reputational  risk  for platforms.The  future  of  equitybased  models  is  expected to be represented by initiatives similar to real estate funds (Rudarakanchana 2013); these  platforms  by  nature  can  manage  the aforementioned risks in a more efficient manner.  Real  estate  investment  platforms  are relatively  safe  easy  to  verify  their  operation requires no special expertise and the returns they generate can be supported with a stable Public Finance Quarterly     2016/4  539     studies    business plan. several platforms offer similar services (occasionally based on projectfinancing foundations) on the internet already. The majority of these however are still subject to investment  licences  and  from  a  geographical perspective the projects in need of financing are also primarily restricted to the territories of Western countries.it  can  also  be  projected  that  the  market will  become  consolidated  and       given  the high business potential     a wave of acquisitions may commence primarily in the case of equitybased crowdfunding sites. since capital injection of some tens of thousands dollars  is  not  sufficient  for  a  startup  business as another likely trend the virtual space may begin to see equity investments of dollar millions thanks to the business sharebased model. it is also indicative of a shift of sorts that numerous  conferences  have  brought  up  the dilemma that Kickstarter as well as its main competitor indiegogo3 will both provide the means for acquiring funds through equity investment  (sawers  2014).  At  the  same  time the  greatest  innovation  would  be  to  see  the market  entry  of  a  platform  that  would  be capable  of  raising  funds  worth  tens  of  millions of dollars for investments by operating as a bank and thinking as a large investor. in this particular case innovation would not be a primary aspect. due to high capital needs the  stable  liquidity  and  positive  cash  flowgenerating capacity of these businesses as well as  an  adequate  collateral  background  would be  considered  more  important  than  the  aspects  offered  by  traditional  crowdfunding sites. These undertakings could become fully fledged  financial  institutions  within  a  short time. Their primary objective is to successfully mediate the funds of (small) investors and to  create  a  profitable  operating  background realised  through  commissions  capital  gain and  own  equity  investments.  Large  investments  realised  from  projecttype  financing 540  Public Finance Quarterly     2016/4are shouldered by professional operators and they are assisted in the preparatory phase and later  on  during  operation  by  international law  offices  accounting  firms  and  marketing and technical consultants.FuTurE ouTlook ExpECTEd mArkET TrEndsdespite its brief existence the crowdfunding market  organised  through  the  internet  is  in transition  already.  New  players  and  hybrid business models have appeared and continue to  spring  up  constantly.  The  international publications  released  to  date  are  projecting optimistic  outlooks.  Within  crowdfunding profitbased  peertopeer  lending  and  equitybased platforms are expected to spread most swiftly.  The  model  operating  on  the  basis of  the  reward  system  has  been  criticised justifiably  so  by  numerous  experts.  This crowdfunding vogue is expected to depreciate in proportion to the success of the other two or three platforms.for share From a technological perspective the most credible companies with the most userfriendly  interfaces  will  remain  standing  among the  platforms  competing  with  one  another. Another  important  challenge  is  to  create  an opportunity trading/mediating through  the  given  platform  in  order  to  ease the exit of investors. it is expected in the near future that the various platforms will become separated from one another according to thematic systems allowing strictly business based enterprises  to  be  featured  on  different  lists than those containing artistic and less profitable projects. Owing to the digital revolution applications  offering  financial  services  are winning over users at an increasing rate and thanks to their flexible operating model they are more efficient in tracking market processes than traditional banks. The  wariness  shown  by  banks  is  also  projecting  the  sector   s  success.  According  to  a study prepared by Citigroup banks stand to lose  17  per  cent  of  their  revenues  by  2023 and  within  the  next  ten  years  they  will  be forced  to  let  a  third  of  their  employees  go on account of the expansion of fintech firms (Citigroup 2016). The vast majority of conventional bank branches will be closed down in the near future while the customerbuyer relationship will be typically conducted online in  an  increasingly  impersonal  environment. Moreover new payment solutions will appear the  training  routine  of  bank  employees  will change and the risk management techniques of  crowdfunding  will  presumably  improve. We can also assume that statutory regulation will be adapted to market practice and that larger banking houses will acquire numerous fintech  startups  and  various  financial  innovation solutions. Market trends also point to the appearance of a website that will in addition  to  providing  crowdfunding  solutions integrate  the  services  of  the  fintech  sector becoming a major player of the international banking  sector  once  the  appropriate  regulatory background has been put in place.hunGAriAn ExpEriEnCEsthe spurred  by  the  phenomenon   s  international success first  Hungarianfocused crowdfunding  platforms  appeared  around 2011.  Following  a  short  period  of  trialanderror it became clear that     as opposed to  numerous  other  foreign  online  business models       these  websites  (Creative  selector indulj.be kezdheted.hu adjukossze.hu etc.) are either failing or stagnating. The reason is that  in  many  respects  the  Hungarian  market  is  immature  and  too  small  to  profitably operate such websites. experiences show that Hungarian project owners tend to opt for the     studies    services  of  international  sites.  in  the  recent period  many  successful  Hungarian  firms and  private  individuals  have  raised  fairly substantial startup capital for their respective businesses  or ideas.  At  the  same  time however  as  a  successful  campaign  launch requires  immense  effort  and  a  high  rate  of equity  investment  from  project  owners  as well the number of those making the attempt is limited (enik   Piti 2015). The situation is not ideal on the investor side either mainly because the disposable income of enlightened Hungarian  internet  users  is  a  mere  fraction of the income of their Western counterparts. in  addition  Hungary  is  still  lacking  an entrepreneurialfriendly  environment  and young people are not at all motivated to turn their ideas into a reality. Based on an article published in 2014 by Be  ta Bak   the reasons for the limited popularity of crowdfunding in Hungary can be summed up as follows (Be  ta Bak   2014)   \\tthe market is too small and the number of project owners and investors/donors is limited;   \\tthe  financial  literacy  and  education  of Hungarians is low there are still very few people managing their finances online;   \\tthe statutory regulation of crowdfunding and  the  fintech  sector  in  general  is  nonexistent  and  the  sector  is  unregulated from a taxation perspective as well.The sMe  sector  is  supported  by  the  state and the european union through numerous instruments; consequently smaller firms have become  lazy  with  no  pressure  to  resort  to alternative (crowdfundinglike marketbased) fundraising channels.As a result there is no indication as yet that a new stable player would be able to cement itself  in  the  Hungarian  market.  The  appearance  of  a  crossborder  legitimate  platform with an international background and recognition seems most likely. According to Andr  s Public Finance Quarterly     2016/4  541     studies    Bethlendi and Rich  rd V  gh    the success of a portal depends on numerous factors in order to attract a critical mass the portal must become a    brand        a stable neutral independent  institution  that  is  fully  compliant  with the  criteria  of  investor  protection.  The  presence of prestigious owners behind the portal at its inception may also facilitate success. The establishment of a secure and supporting it background  is  of  key  importance.  And  last but not least crowdfunding portals must be supported by a safe settlement system.    (Andr  s Bethlendi     Rich  rd V  gh 2014).summAryAfter the global economic crisis the banking sector   s  willingness  to  place  assets  dropped and  the  fundraising  opportunities  of  smaller companies       operating  without  appropriate collateral  background  and  sufficient  own funds       became  very  restricted.  At  the  same time with the development of the internet and the growing prominence of fintech solutions platforms  specialising  in  crowdfunding  have grown increasingly popular in recent years.Benefits for investors are numerous risk becomes diversified they can gain quick access to  innovation  the  given  idea/company  goes through a multiplayer prescreening process and  over  and  above  administrative  burdens are reduced to a minimum. The project owner on the other hand is able to efficiently test the  product  and  the  market  receives  a  high number of consumer feedback and typically gains access to lowcost capital without putting up collateral.The  prerequisite  of  a  successful  project launch is the use of the appropriate marketing  tools.  Presentations  (typically  used  in such projects) often push the given product/idea itself into the background and     instead of  rational  arguments       attempt  to  appeal to consumer sentiments. Crowdfunding may also serve purposes other than fundraising in the case of successful projects a selfgenerating marketing effect is a direct consequence of the process which in turn could lead the target company to further rounds of investment.The websites in question for the most part provide users with existing traditional financial  products  offered  by  banks  through  new channels and the innovation is in essence the technological solution of how funds are managed  how  the  sites  communicate  with  users and how they make their operation more efficient.  sensing  the  explosive  popularity  of fintech  banks  started  developing  their  own systems and acquiring smaller or larger online financial service providers and solutions.Among crowdfunding models the equitybased concept could prove to be most viable in  the  long  run  and  once  appropriate  regulations have been established these platforms could potentially become true competitors of the  traditional  banking  system.  The  unique feature of the model is that the close link and direct interaction between the project owner and the funder as well as the spirit of community create a colourful product (which also serves  marketing  purposes)  from  essentially impersonal financial instruments.There are still numerous uncertainty factors in relation to the equitybased model as well. A number of questions still remain how can hundreds  of  owners  be  represented  and  informed at the same time who has what rights and as the case may be how will market exits be handled. A sharetrading platform that is organised entirely online and is capable of documenting online managed iPOs in a flexible and legally compliant fashion may in part offer satisfactory answers to these questions.There are numerous reasons why the Hungarian market is still unsuitable for the propagation  of  crowdfunding.  Owing  to  the  eu 542  Public Finance Quarterly     2016/4     studies    grants given to the sMe sector project owners have become lazy with no pressure to resort to alternative fundraising channels. it can be stated in general that adequate statutory regulation  would  serve  the  development  of  the online  market.  For  the  time  being  the  lack of  investor  confidence  as  well  as  transparent and prudent business operations is a common problem  in  relation  to  crowdfunding  platforms.Notes1  The  background  to  this  study  is  the  paper  by the  author  featured in  the  2014  conference publication  entitled tavaszi  sz  l  (spring  Wind)  as published  by  the  Association  of  Hungarian  Phd and  dLA  students.
