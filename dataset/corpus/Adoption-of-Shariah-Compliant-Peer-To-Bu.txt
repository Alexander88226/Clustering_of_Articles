These FinTechs provide financial  products  and  services  using  different technologies covering various financial areas including lending/ financing.  For instance  PeertoBusiness  (P2B)  financing platforms are one of FinTech solutions which has been growing rapidly  in  the  past  few  years  making  many  governments  setting regulations  to  cater  this  trend.Bahrain  is  one  of  the  countries that  has  issued  number  of  regulations  for  FinTech  activities including for Shariah Compliant P2B financing platforms. These types  of  platforms  shall  provide  Islamic  financing  solutions  for SMEs.  However  as  a  new  financial  solution  in  the  market  it  is expected  to  face  some  challenges  in  term  SMEs  adoption. Therefore this  research  aims  at  building  a  conceptual framework for the strategic framework for FinTechs in Bahrain. The  framework  is  built  based  on  different  sources  of  academic literature  in  domain  space  of  Islamic  Finance  and  FinTech (Islamic  FinTech)  in  addition  to  theories  like  Technology Acceptance Model and Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology. The framework variables will be examined through mixed  research  method  approach  covering  case  study  semistructured  interviews  and  an  online  survey.  The  research outcome shall be a strategic framework for FinTechs in Bahrain to ensure the adoption of SMEs to these platforms. Keywords  FinTech P2B lending SMEs Islamic Finance I. INTRODUCTION Technology has been reshaping  many industries throughout the years including the financial industry especially with the arrival  of  FinTech  in  the  field.  FinTechs  or  Financial Technology  firms  are  defined  as     those  offer  users  with  a range  of  financial  services  and  products  that  once  almost exclusively  was  the  business  of  banks     (CHISHTI  and BARBERIS  2016).  These  FinTechs  offer financial solutions using various technologies that cover the areas of payments remittances insurance  capital  markets  and  digital  currencies  etc. (KPMG and H2 Ventures 2016) lending  wealth  management        Revised Manuscript Received on December 08 2018. WajeehaAli Asia Pacific University of Technology &InnovationMalaysia  Siva  Muthaly  Asia Pacific  University of Technology &InnovationMalaysia  MorakinyoDada Asia Pacific University of Technology & Innovation Malaysia  (P2P)  PeertoBusiness PeertoPeer  (P2P)  lending  platforms  are  one  of  the FinTech  solutions  that  matches  lenders  with  borrowers  that are  credit  worthy  using  an  online  intermediary  platform (Deloitte  2015).  These  platforms  come  in  different  forms providing  both  individuals  and  businesses  access  to  funds such  as  PeertoPeer (P2B) BusinesstoBusiness  (B2B)  etc.  For  example  using  P2B platforms  SMEs  (Small  and  Medium  Enterprises)  can  be financed  directly  by  investors  without  an  intermediary  of  a traditional  financial  institution  (World  Economic  Forum 2015).According  to  the  World  Economic  Forum  FinTechs can help SMEs close the $2 trillion funding gap  worldwide (Cann  2015).  Moreover  the  Arab  Monetary  Fund  (AMF) during  the  G24  Ministerial  meeting  has  mentioned  that  the estimated funding gap for SMEs in the region reaches 300% (AlHamidy 2017) this includes SMEs in Bahrain. In  order  to  fill  the  funding  gap  for  SMEs  and  leverage  the potentials  of  FinTech  in  the  financial  industry  the  Central Bank  of  Bahrain  (CBB)  has  issued  FinTech  Sandbox  and number of regulations for FinTechs to start their business in the Bahraini market. One of these regulations is for Shariah Compliant financingbased Crowdfunding Platforms (Cbb.gov.bh 2017).  Bahrain is known for being a pioneer in Islamic finance and its  focus  in  the  FinTech  area  has  been  declared  in  Deloitte report to be related to payments crowdfunding and Islamic finance (Deloitte 2017). This research therefore focuses on the  Shariah  Compliant  P2B  Financing  Platforms  as  an Islamic  FinTech  solution  and  how  it  can  be  adopted  by SMEs  in  the  Bahraini  market.  As  this  solution  serves  the SME sector  mainly their perspective and adoption of these types  of  Platforms  would  highly  shape  the  future  of FinTechs business in Bahrain. PeertoBusiness (P2B) II. LITERATURE REVIEW As FinTech is a new financial solution in the global market it requires extensive studies to address the issue of consumer adoption  to  these  solutions.  Currently  there  is  a  lack  of study  in  the  area  of  consumer  behavior  and  adoption  of FinTech.  This  was  agreed  by  a  research  conducted  on Chinese  adoption  of  FinTech  based  on  a  Regulatory Focused  Theory  (Chang  et  al.  2016).  According  to  the research  two  factors  affect  the  consumer  behavior  and motivation  towards  adopting  FinTech  by  the  Chinese  and they  are  preventionfocused  factors  and  promotionfocused factors.     Retrieval Number ES2128017519/19  BEIESP  Published By Blue  Eyes  Intelligence  Engineering  & Sciences Publication  407  Adoption of Shariah Compliant PeerToBusiness Financing Platforms by Smes A Conceptual Strategic Framework for Fintechs in Bahrain  and it  comes   According crowdfunding these  platforms. the  Indonesian  market  when based  crowdfunding  QardalHasan3based  crowdfunding Shirakah4based lendingbased crowdfunding  by  using  Islamic  finance  modes  such  as Mudharaba5 and Musharakah6. The research has pointed out major challenges that are being faced  by to crowdfunding  besides  the  lack  of  regulation  in  this  area. These  challenges  are  related  to  consumer   s  trust  weakness in  presenting  the  projects  to  investors  and  shortcoming  in project  marketing  campaigns.    These  are  major  issues  that require to be addressed to have a successful implementation of to  another  research (Marzban Asutay and Boseli 2014) the Shariah Compliant crowdfunding offers an extensive opportunity for the Middle East  and  North  Africa  (MENA)  region  especially  for  the Micro and SMEs (MSMEs) segment. After all a substantial number of Muslim entrepreneurs and investors in the region prefer Shariah Compliant financing.  On the other side these types  of  platform  can  help  in  closing  the  financial  gap  of SMEs  which  has  reached  to $2.4  trillion  in  the  developing countries (Marzban and Yeken 2015). In  order  to  understand  the  factors  effecting  customer   s adoption and perspective about a financing solution like the Shariah  Compliant  P2B  financing  platforms  there  are number  of  theories  which  can  be  useful.  Accordingly Theory  of  Acceptance  Model  (TAM)  and  The  Unified Theory  of  Acceptance  and  Use  of  Technology  (UTAUT) have  been  chosen  in  this  research  to  understand  the customers  (SMEs)  adoption  factors  when  it  comes  to Shariah Compliant P2B financing platforms in Bahrain. A. Technology Acceptance Model (TAM) This model was proposed by Davis in 1986 and throughout the  years  it  has  been  further  enhanced  till  it  became  in  its current  form  (Figure  1).  While  the  model  shows  the relationship between the human attitude and the intention to use it also indicates the factors that affect person   s intention such as the believe of usefulness and ease of use of a certain technology. The research states that by identifying these factors FinTech companies  can  better  strategize  and  promote  their  services to the customers.   Meanwhile  EY  which  is  an  advisory  service  firm  has published  a  report  on  FinTech  adoption  for  2017  (EY 2017). The report has covered 20 different markets in order to  provide  a  global  perspective  of  FinTech  adoption.  EY stated  that  compare  to  its  2015  report  on  FinTech  adoption globally  the  percentage  of  the  adoption  has  increased  to reach 33% in 2017 from 16% in 2015 with China and India leading the  FinTech  adoption  globally.  According  to Rogers     theory  on  diffusion  of  innovation  33%  means  that the  FinTech  industry  is  at     early  majority     adoption  stage. In  this  regard  the  report  mentioned  that  young  adults  that are aged between 2534 (millennial) are the highest users of FinTech  solutions  compare  to  other  ages.  Despite  the  fact that this report did not tackle SMEs adoption to FinTech in specific  the  report  confirmed  the  increased  adoption  of FinTech globally. Islamic crowdfunding as one of FinTech solutions has been identified by a research (Achsien and Purnamasari 2016) as    the use of small  amounts of  money obtained from a large number of individuals or organizations to  fund a project a business or personal loan and other needs through an online webbased  platform  in  accordance  with  sharia  principles   . Throughout the research the researchers have explained the Islamic  crowdfunding  and  its  potential  for  the  Indonesian market as it   s a country with the largest Muslim population. Accordingly the research has highlighted that the nature of Islamic  finance  and  crowdfunding  are  both  mutually reinforcing  and  compatible  through  conceptualizing  the customers  as  investors  providing  investment  opportunities that  offer  higher  interest  rates  allowing  transparency encouraging risk sharing demarcating wealth and investing in real economical actives. Although  there  are  many  mutual  characteristics  between Islamic  finance  and  crowdfunding  Islamic  crowdfunding differs  from  the  conventional  crowdfunding  from  the perspective of absence of    riba    which stands for the interest rate prohibition of speculation and gambling investment in halal  projects  only  and  finally  existence  of  Shariah supervisory  board  that  look  after  the  transactions  and approve the  Shariah  principles. Additionally  Islamic  crowdfunding  comes  with  different business  models  just  like  conventional  crowdfunding  and they are Zakat1based crowdfunding InfaqSadaqahWaqf2 they  meet them if                                                                             Figure 1 Technology Acceptance Model (DuFour et al. 2016) The core concept of TAM is  based on 5 elements  and they are  first  attitude  toward  using  which  represents  person   s evaluation  or  feelings  being  it  positive  or  negative  when using a new technology.Second perceived usefulness                                                                                                         Retrieval Number ES2128017519/19  BEIESP  Published By Blue  Eyes  Intelligence  Engineering  & Sciences Publication  408  International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE) ISSN 22783075 Volume8 Issue2S2 December 2018 intentions hich indicates the usefulness of a new technology where for instance a person can believe that by using a certain system he  or  she  will  witness  an  enhancement  in  the job performance.  Third  perceived  ease  of  use  that  refers  to using  a  new  technology  with  less  efforts  less  requirements of  labor  and  time  which  leads  to  ease  of  use.  Fourth external  variableswhichincludes  numerous  variables  related to  characteristics  of  the  system  user   s  personal  attributes and  environmental  factors  that  affect  the  user   s  behavior. Fifth  intention  to  use  that  stands  for  the  willingness  of  a person to use a new technology. TAM on the other hand has been  applied  in  number  of  researches  esspecially  those related  to  new  systems  and  technologies.  For  example  a research (Chuang Liu and Kao 2016) has used TAM model alongside  attributes  related  to  trust  and  brand  elements  to understand  the  customers  behavior  when  it  comes  to  using FinTech  services.  The  researcher  stated  that  as  FinTech services  are  relatively  new  tech  products  in  the  market understanding  the  potential  customers  as  well  as  existing customers     attitudes  and towards  FinTech products  and  services  can  address  an  important  issue. Therefore by using TAM elements besides brand and  trust 440  customers  were  surveyed  to  indicate  the  factors  effect on  using  FinTech  services  and  products.  Based  on  the research the trust element represented the confidence of the trustor  (user)  that  the  trustees     in  this  case  is  the  FinTech company will meet their need. The brand on the other hand is an element that helps users make the right decisions when the  quality  of  the  service/product  is  not  clear  or  known. Accordingly  the  research  has  concluded  that  all  the elements of TAM as well as brand and trust were positively effecting  user   s  intention  to  use  a  FinTech  service  or product.  However  the  research  has  also  highlighted  that social  norms  as  well  as  the  cost  elements  which  were  not considered  in  this  research  could  be  tested  in  future researches as they might have direct impact on the intention of  using  a  FinTech  service.  The  research  has  proved  that TAM is the right model for testing FinTech service adoption by  customers  in  addition  to  the  brand  and  trust  factors. However  the  survey  results  might  defer  from  a  market  to another and it might differ from targeting a general FinTech product  versus  certain  FinTech  solution  like  P2B  financing platforms. There are many theories and models that explain user   s  acceptance  and  adoption  to  a  new  technology  yet TAM is the most utilized by the researchers. According to a research  by  (Lai  2017)  there  are  number  of  factors effecting  the  speed  of  consumers  adoption  to  the  rapid As  this  model  helps  in  understanding  the  new  technology acceptance  and  adoption  by  users  number  of  researches have  considered  UTAUT  in  their  conceptual  framework  by using some of its core variables. For instance a research on adoption  of  mobile  money  usage  by  MSMEs  customers  in Uganda  (Mugambe  2017)  has  used  the  exact  variables  of UTAUT  except  for  the  voluntariness  of  use  and  has  added three more variables alongside existing variables which are habit price value and hedonic motivation. Accordingly the research  found  that  the  behavior  intention  of  customers  in Uganda  get  notably  affected  by  variables  like  habit  social influence  and  facilitating  conditions.  Whereas  variables such  as  hedonic  motivation  effort  expectancy  and  price changing  technologies  and  they  are  related  to  convenience security customer   s need and availability of the technology itself  etc.  The  research  has  studied  number  of  theories  and models before concluding that TAM is the most suitable for forming a theoretical framework for the Epayment systems.  To conclude these researches have proved that applying the TAM model to test the adoption of Shariah Compliant P2B financing  platforms  in  Bahrain  would  be  significantly valuable  especially  that  factors  like  perceived  usefulness and  perceived  ease  of  use  play  a  vital  role  in  adoption  of new financial technologies. B. Technology (UTAUT) The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of efforts expectancy expectancy This  model is one of the intentionbased  models that  was  a result of reviewing eight other existing theories and models including  TAM.  According  to  the  researcher(Savolainen 2016) the behavioral intention  which leads to  use behavior can  be  expected  through  four  main  variables  that  are performance social influence  and  facilitating  conditions.  These  variables  are further  modified  by  four  elements  such  as  age  gender experience  and  voluntariness  (Figure  2).  Each  variable stands  for  an  important  aspect  in  technology  adoption.  For instance  performance  expectancy  stands  for  the  extents where  a  user  believes  that  his/  her  performance  is  being affected by the system/ technology usage efforts expectancy stands  for  the  extent  of  system/  technology  ease  of  use  by the  user  social  influence  stands  for  the  extent  to  which  a user gives an importance to others opinion regarding her/his usage  of  the  new  system/  technology  and  facilitating conditionsstands  for  the  extent  a  user  believes  in  the readiness  of  the  technical  and  organizational  infrastructure in order to support the usage of the new system/technology.  Figure 2 The Unified Theory of Acceptance and Use of Technology (Goswami and Dutta 2016) value  have  less  impact  on  their  behavior  intention  of  using mobile money in Uganda. Hence the top variables effecting the  customers  from  UTAUT  perspective  were  social influence and facilitating conditions. Likewise a research on improvement  of  the  continued  user  intention  in  FinTech (Jung  2016)  which  aims  at  identifying  the  relationship between user attitude and user satisfaction has used UTAUT to build its conceptual framework.      Retrieval Number ES2128017519/19  BEIESP  Published By Blue  Eyes  Intelligence  Engineering  & Sciences Publication  409  Adoption of Shariah Compliant PeerToBusiness Financing Platforms by Smes A Conceptual Strategic Framework for Fintechs in Bahrain  The  model  applied  in  this  research  has  included  social influence  variable  from  UTAUT  alongside  other  variables such  as  complexity  selfefficiency  innovativeness  and perceived danger. Consequently the research has found that social influence noticeably effects the user intention through its  direct  influence  on  user  attitude  as  well  as  user satisfaction level. Similarly all other  factors  were affecting the satisfaction and attitude variables except for complexity which was found that it has no effect on attitude. In addition to  innovativeness  and  perceived  danger  which  were  found to be nonsignificant in term of user satisfaction. Finally  another  research  on  FinTech  acceptance  in  Finland (Cao 2016) has employed UTAUT model along with TAM Adoption  of  Risky  Technologies  (ART)  and  Motivational Model  (MM)  in  order  to  study  the  factors  effecting  the adoption  of  a  certain  FinTech  payment  solution  in  Finland which  is  called     Plastc  Card   .  Mainly  nine  variables  were used  in  this  research  which  are  perceived  ease  of  use perceived  usefulness  price  value  perceived  enjoyment perceived  information  security  concerns  social  influence personal innovativeness and perceived need of minimalism. These  variables  were  divided  into  three  main  contexts  and tested  accordingly  and  these  contexts  are  technological context individual context and motivational context.  The  result  of that  perceived enjoyment  perceived  usefulness  perceived  innovativeness security  concerns  and  price  value  are  variables  that  have strong  impact  on  behavior  intention  of  FinTech  users  in Finland.  Unlike  variables  such  as  perceived  need  of minimalism  perceived  ease  of  use  perceived  information and  social  influence  where  they  have  weak  impact  on behavioral intention of the FinTech users.  According to the research  the  result  does  not  reflect  the  initial  stage  of FinTech  users  where they are new  to the technology but it reflects  the  current  users  of  FinTech  solutions  who  are continuing their use of FinTech. the  research indicated C. Gap in literature it   s important to  FinTech  and The  literature  discussed  in  this  chapter  has  proved  that FinTech  solutions  such  as  P2B  financing  platforms  can solve the SMEs issue of accessing to funds yet at the same time  these  researches  have  indicated  that  there  is  lack  of researches  related to understand the  factors  effecting  adoption  of  FinTech solutions  by  customers.  Accordingly  it  has  been  noticed that  there  is  an  overall  lack  of  comprehensiveness  in  the existing literature as some has covered the adoption of P2P platforms by SMEs yet didn   t not cover the Shariah aspect others  have  discussed  the  area  of  SMEs  and  Islamic financing  without  indepth  explanation  of  the  adoption  of P2P  platforms  while  some  researches  have  discussed FinTech  in  general  without  giving  a  specific  focus  on  a certain  solution  etc.    Moreover  from  Bahrain  market perspective  there  are  limited  researches  in  FinTech  areas and  almost  no  study  has  discussed  SMEs  in  Bahrain  and their  adoption  factors  to  Shariah  Compliant  P2B  financing platform. Hence there is an extensive  need for this  kind of studies  especially  that  the  regulation  for  this  solution  has been  officially  published  and  the  customers  are  expecting these platforms to enter the market soon.  D. Conceptual Framework Retrieval Number ES2128017519/19  BEIESP  financing  platform Based  on  the  reviewed  literature  theories  i.e.  TAM  and UTAUT and the gaps identified. The framework will focus on SMEs adoption  factors related to the Shariah Compliant P2B the  Bahraini  market. Accordingly  following conceptual  model is created to help identifying  factors  effecting the  adoption  of  Shariah Compliant  P2B  financing  platforms  by  SMEs  in  the Bahrain. in Figure 3 Conceptual Frameworkfor the Strategic framework for FinTechs in Bahrain (Authors own)  The  framework  has  seven  independent  variables  out  of which  two  of  them  are  external  variables  (Social  Influence and  Facilitating  Conditions)  and  five  of  them  are  internal variables related  to the platform like  Cost Brand Security Perceived  ease  of  use  and  perceived  usefulness.  All  the internal  variables  in  addition  to  Social  Influence  variable effect  the  dependent  variable     Behavioral  intention  to  use    which  directly  effects  the  adoption  of  SMEs  to  these platforms.  Facilitating  Conditions  on  the  other  side  effects directly the adoption as per the UTAUT theory.  In order to test  the  validity  of  the  proposed  conceptual  framework  for FinTechs  in  Bahrain  the  study  follows  a  specific  research methodology  to  validate  the  variables  related  to  SMEs adoption.  E. Research Methodology The  research  will  use  the  research     onion     framework  for explaining  the  research  design  that  can  be  defined  through the  following  six  layers  research  philosophy  research approach research strategy research method time horizons and  data  collection  techniques  and  analysis  procedures  (Al Kindy Shah and Jusoh1 2016).               Published By Blue  Eyes  Intelligence  Engineering  & Sciences Publication  410  International Journal of Innovative Technology and Exploring Engineering (IJITEE) ISSN 22783075 Volume8 Issue2S2 December 2018   Figure 5 Sequential Exploratory design flow  IV. FINDINGS The research outcome for the conceptual framework shall be a  strategic  framework  for  FinTechs  that  will  offer  Shariah Compliant  P2B  financing  platforms  in  Bahrain.  This strategic  framework  will  be  the  result  of  the  conceptual framework  test  which  will  be  analysed  using  various research analysis techniques. Thus the research results  will contribute in identifying the factors effecting SMEs based in Bahrain  adoption  to  these  platforms.  In  this  regard  the strategic framework will help the FinTechs ensure the quick and smooth adoption of SMEs to the solution.  V. CONCLUSION On  the  other  side  by  applying  the  framework  the  SMEs will  be  able  to  overcome  one  of  the  major  challenges  they face  in  the  market  which  is  related  to  accessing  funds.  As these strategies will be based on the factors that affect SMEs decision  and  perceptions  by  applying  them  FinTechs  can directly influence the SMEs in the market. REFERENCES 1.  Academike.

Figure 4 Research Onion (Saunders Lewis and Thornhill 2009)  the facts social respondent Based  on  the  research  Onion  framework  the  research follows  the  pragmatism  philosophy  as  it  addresses  social reallife  issue  related  to  SMEs  and  FinTechs  in  Bahrain. This  philosophy  combines  positivism  theory  which  focuses on through  quantitative  methods  and interpretivism  theory  which  focuses  on  getting  an  indepth understanding  of through  qualitative methods.  As  for  the  mixed  method  research  approach  it   s both  inductive  and  deductive  where  at  first  it  collects  data to identify the variables effecting SMEs adoption of Shariah Compliant  P2B  financing  platforms  and  then  it  tests  the hypothesis based on the data  collected in the second phase. The  research  strategy  on  other  side  includes  survey phenomenology and case study. In addition as the research applies  mixed  research  method  both  quantitative  and qualitative  research  methods  will  be  used  with  a  cross sectional time horizon where the data can be collected at any point  of  time.  The  data  collection  will  take  place  through number  of  techniques  such  as  interviews  case  study  and survey. Accordingly each research question will utilize one of these techniques to gather the relevant data.  III. RESULT Based  on  Creswell  the  research  is  based  on  Sequential Exploratory  Design.  First  it  collects  and  analysis  the qualitative data then it collects and analysis the quantitative data  and  finally  presents  an  interpretation  of  the  entire analysis.  The  qualitative  helps  in  getting  an  in  depth understanding  of theShariah  Compliant  P2Bfinancing platforms business  model through a case study based on an existing  platform  and then  conducts  semistructured interviews  with  525  SMEs  that  are  current  users  of  these platforms  in  order  to  understand  their  perceptions  and experience.  The  quantitative  method  on  the  other  hand helps  in  generalizing  the  outcome  of  the  research  and accordingly contributing to building the strategic framework for FinTechs in Bahrain. The quantitative  will be an online survey  targeting  SMEs  based  in  Bahrain  that  are  potential users of these type of platforms (around 150 SMEs).
