strategik pent dalam pengurusan fasil yang dapat membantu dalam mengekalkan kelangsungan perniagaan dan memastikan kemandirian perniagaan semasa bencana berlaku oleh itu industri kecil dan sederhana yang membentuk sektor perniagaan yang pale besar dalam ekonomi dunia perlu dilindungi daripada bencana dengan satu sistem yang dapat memulihkan keadaan sesuatu perniagaan dengan cepat dan tanpa gangguan walaupun pkp telah wujud malaysia hampir sedekad major malaysia mempunyai tahap pengetahuan yang rendah terhadap kewujudan dan kepentingan bcm kepada organisasi perniagaan mereka juga mempunyai masalah dalam melaksanakan bcm secara sistematik kekurangan perbincangan ilmiah dalam bidang akademik berkaitan pkp terutama yang menjuru kepada faktor kejayaan kritik fkk bagi perlaksanan pkp dalam telah mendorong bagi menyiapkan kajian ini objektif kajian ini pula adalah untuk menentukan fkk yang terlibat dan untuk menggambarkan hubungan antara struktur fkk bagi mejayakan perlaksanaan pkp untuk malaysia berdasarkan kajian literatur menyeluruh yang telah dibuat fkk telah diken pasti bagi melaksanakan pkp malaysia oleh yang demikian sesi temubu telah diadakan bersama dengan pakar pkp melalui kaedah interpret structur model ism bagi mengesahkan dapatan kajian literatur yang telah dibuat dan seterusnya membangunkan hubungan struktur antara fkk yang telah diken pasti hasil temubu telah diubah kepada satu model yang berasaskan ism melalui beberapa prosedur untuk membangunkan model berasaskan ism berikutan hasil temubu komitmen dan sokongan pengurusan tertinggi merupakan faktor penggerak utama diikuti oleh industri foku pihak berkepentingan utama sumber manusia perubahan budaya pemilikan dan anggaran kewangan manakala input program adalah faktor yang pale bergantung dengan kuasa kebergantungan dan diikuti oleh komunikasi berkesan penyertaan kemudahan dan kakitangan jawatankuasa bcp kempen kesedaran dan kepimpinan terdapat dua fkk iaitu pertubuhan pkp dan pendidikan dan latihan pkp telah disimpulkan sebagai tidak stabil kerana mempunyai nilai yang sama terhadap nilai penggerak dan kebergantungan fkk perundangan tidak mempunyai kaitan dalam sistem kerana faktor ini tidak memberi banyak pengaruh terhadap faktor yang lain bagi memastikan kejayaan perlaksanaan pkpdi malaysia kajian kebolehlaksanaan kemudiannya dijalankan untuk membandingkan model tersebut dengan keadaan sebenar dalam aspek sosial teknik dan ekonomi justeru mengesahkan secara empirik model berasaskan ism itu tadi secara ringkasnya kajian ini telah mencapai objektifnya apabila senarai fkk telah
