b'herein fileMiklos Dietz  Vinayak HV  and Gillian LeeBracing for seven critical changes as fintech maturesFinancial Services November 2016The fintech sector is being shaped by shifting market conditions new regulations and changes in consumer demands and behaviors.For the past decade fintech companies\\xe2\\x80\\x94technology firms that focus on financial products and services\\xe2\\x80\\x94have moved quickly forcing incumbents to rethink their core business models and embrace digital innovations. But now the fintech industry is itself maturing and entering a period of rapid change. Companies wondering how they will fit into this new era must first understand the forces that are pushing the changes. While the industry will undoubtedly continue to expand as its customer base grows and investor appetite remains unsated changes are imminent. Indeed the very concept of what comprises fintech will shift. As the industry evolves it will play a role well beyond financial products and services individual companies will vie to become undisputed leaders by size and breadth  and ecosystems will develop that have a tight grip on customer loyalty. This new fintech era is being shaped by changes in market conditions new regulations and shifts in consumer demands and behaviors. As a result the industry generally is becoming more cautious even as it becomes more diverse across technologies and products. McKinsey research and work with fintechs in many markets suggest seven critical aspects of this new environment that must be understood to thrive in the shifting market.Expanding scopeThe scope of products and services offered by fintechs is expanding rapidly. Where  once companies focused on payment applications lending and money transfers  the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s reach has extended into more than 30 areas (exhibit). The shift brings  fintechs away from a focus on frontline activities to a broad engagement throughout  the value chain. The new offerings cut across a wide swath of financial services retail wealth management small and midsize enterprises (SMEs) corporate and investment banking and insurance. Various fintechs using a variety of technologies are active in each of these areas. Some for example roboadvisory systems that provide automated recommendations with little human input use tested technologies to meet customer needs while others pursue more experimental technologies such as blockchain systems that track and store an expanding series of transactions to help reduce infrastructure costs and improve efficiency. \\x0cWeb 2016Bracing for seven critical changes as fintech maturesExhibitExhibit 1 of 1We see more than 30 areas emerging as new norms in banking.Key \\xef\\xac\\x81ntech trends \\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Nextgeneration personal financial management\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Peertopeer lending and investment\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 New digital lending\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Aggregator comparison engine\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Roboadvisory\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Social investing\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Crowdfunding\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Investment across regions engineBeyond banking\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Mobile payments\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 International remittances\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Mobile pointofsale devices\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Other payment processing Retail value chain and couponsRetailWealth managementDigital for unbanked\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Blockchain\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Application programming interface ecosystem\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Payment infrastructure\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Big data base risk assessment\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Antimoney laundering and know your customer\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Artificial intelligence and machine learning\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 CybersecurityPaymentsOperations and infrastructureInsuranceDigital model reinventors\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Onestop shop for businessesVirtual marketplaceSmall and midsize enterprisesCapital markets and investment banking\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Peertopeer corporate lending and investment\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Nextgeneration lending to small and midsize enterprises\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Digital cash managementNextgeneration digital marketingSource Panorama by McKinsey\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Telematics\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Social integration\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 IoT and connected devices\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Prevention\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Nextgeneration trade finance\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Trading\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Nextgeneration collateral management\\xe2\\x80\\xa2 Trade analyticsIn addition fintechs are moving beyond addressing a customer\\xe2\\x80\\x99s financial needs to offering a wider range of services blurring the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s boundaries. For example Social Finance known generally as SoFi began by offering financial products to students and young professionals and has since expanded to provide career coaching and networking services. Holvi Payment Services a Finnish startup acquired by Spanish financial group Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) in 2016 began by offering banking services to SMEs and expanded to provide complementary offerings such as an online sales platform bookkeeping services expenseclaims systems and a cashflow tracker. Increasing diversityThe fintech industry is also becoming more diversified with a wide variety of business models seen across geographies segments and technologies. One common model would be a startup backed by venturecapital funding emerging to address a specific customer need. 2\\x0cFor example the USbased Stripe one of the largest fintech players was founded in 2011 to offer an improved online payment system and has attracted more than $300 million from venturecapital funds including Founders Fund Khosla Ventures and Sequoia Capital.1 Stripe was one of the first fintechs to dramatically accelerate and improve the process merchants followed to accept payments online. While legacy payments companies needed five to seven days to set up a new merchant Stripe gave merchants the chance to launch a website and start accepting payments within minutes.2 Another model would be a large technology company expanding into financial services. China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Alibaba one of the bestknown examples of this model started as a major ecommerce site and has moved into financial products with its Alipay subsidiary boasting more than 800 million registered users in 2016. Another emerging model would be an established financial company creating its own fintech unit. For example Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s largest insurer by assets launched a peertopeer service Lufax in 2012 and by 2016 the unit was valued at almost $19 billion.3Fintech pioneers such as PayPal are also adjusting their business models to encompass a wider range of services. PayPal launched in the 1990s to provide a payment system for online purchases then a new phenomena has since expanded to provide instant lines of credit and mobile applications that locate nearby stores and restaurants that accept payment by PayPal.4Along with diversified models performance has also become highly variable among fintechs. Certain players have seen share prices fall more than 50 percent. At the other extreme fintechs that retain the confidence of investors and customers have continued to see strong performance as reflected by share price and business growth. Among the examples share price for IHS Markit a financial information and data provider rose by more than 20 percent over the 12 months ending October 2016. IHS Markit had shown consistently strong financial performance with for instance adjusted third quarter 2016 revenue up 5 percent from a year earlier and its fullyear margin forecast at about 36 percent.5Improving collaborationCollaborative partnerships will become increasingly important as fintechs seek scale and traditional financial institutions seek digital expertise. While fintechs have developed applications that create improved customer experiences many lack skills in customer acquisition and other fields needed to grow quickly. Incumbent banks on the other hand already have hardwon capabilities in these areas but they will have to work harder to create a true digital enterprise.Examples of such partnerships are already emerging. For example in 2014 New York\\xe2\\x80\\x93based Moven and Australia\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Westpac announced an agreement to integrate Moven\\xe2\\x80\\x99s mobile financialmanagement tools with Westpac\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Internetbanking platform in New Zealand. Westpac hoped to use the tools to become the largest bank in the market while Moven sought to expand into new markets.6Spain\\xe2\\x80\\x99s BBVA offers an example of an incumbent bank moving aggressively across several areas.

For example in 2015 PayPal announced the acquisition of Xoom an international fundtransfer service for $890 million. The acquisition was expected to allow PayPal to broaden its services into digital money transfer and management.9In another recent example in 2015 peertopeer lender Prosper Marketplace spent $30 million to acquire BillGuard later renamed Prosper Daily an app that allows users to track their spending and credit. The move added personalfinancialmanagement services to Prosper\\xe2\\x80\\x99s core refinancing and creditrehabilitation offerings and provided a new channel for engaging with customers.10Consolidation which complements the collaboration trend may force other changes in the market as well. For instance banks may have to move quickly to identify acquisition targets before the most attractive are taken by competitors. They will also have to reconcile differences in corporate culture that can limit the upside from such mergers. The trend also offers fintech startups an alternative to initial public offerings for exit options.Normalizing valuationsValuations of fintechs are also normalizing as investors become more cautious and start favoring companies with proven track records. Examining 44 fintechs with valuations of more than $1 billion McKinsey found that valuation growth has slowed considerably. Between 2014 and 2015 valuations for these companies grew on average by 77 percent and then slowed to 9 percent from 2015 to 2016. Companies in the study cut across geographies and segments.In the United States where more than half the companies in the study were based the shift was even more dramatic. While valuations for large US fintechs grew on average by 54 percent from 2014 to 2015 they not only did not grow but dropped by 7 percent from 2015 and 2016. The shift toward normalized valuations was also noticeable in investment trends. One study looked at the 30 largest fintech investments by venturecapital funds in 2016 through August and found that more than half were laterstage funding deals.11 The data suggest investors are more interested in companies with proven business models.Shifting regulationsNot surprising for a new industry the regulatory regimes affecting fintechs are also evolving swiftly and will significantly influence how the industry develops.

In the United Kingdom for example the country\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Financial Conduct Authority has launched Project Innovate a program that guides technology startups through regulatory processes and pushes for speedy responses to applications and questions. Regulators are also increasingly involved in nurturing fintech clusters organizing large educational and communitybuilding events in many markets. As regulators increasingly shape the evolution and growth of the fintech industry it remains unclear how the costs of regulations will impact players particularly earlystage startups. However while regulators work toward balancing the risks to the financialservices sector  they are also eager to encourage innovation and many have taken steps toward this goal. Emerging ecosystemsAs digital offerings become more mature and interconnected vast ecosystems will develop that span multiple industries. In many instances fintechs will become submerged in these ecosystems representing like many others a component of a much broader digital network.Ecosystems will likely develop to follow customer needs rather than conform to traditional industry lines. Leaders in these ecosystems will need strong dataanalytic capabilities to develop useful insights from the torrent of customer information available and they will likely use fintechs and others to develop the system and extract maximum value. While data and analytic capabilities are crucial to leading an ecosystem companies will also need demonstrated prowess in cybersecurity to credibly safeguard the huge amounts of potentially sensitive client data available in the system. Already ecosystem orchestrators are building advantageous dataanalytic capabilities. For example China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Ping An established a big data\\xe2\\x80\\x93analytics platform in 2013 to improve crossselling and customer migration. The platform is a critical component in reaching the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s stated goal of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cone customer one account multiple services and multiple products.\\xe2\\x80\\x9d Ping An is already benefiting from the use of this platform with more than half of Ping An\\xe2\\x80\\x99s 109 million core finance customers successfully migrated and also using its online services as of 2016. Across all its platforms the company has an Internet user base of 298 million people as of  June 2016 presenting powerful opportunities for customer acquisition and channel migration.12Other examples of early ecosystems include Commonwealth Bank of Australia (CBA) which is building relationships with a broad customer base across different channels using technology like MyWealth a portfoliomanagement app; DailyIQ a dataanalytic app for SMEs; and Albert a pointofsale device for business owners.13 Combined these efforts can provide CBA access to rich data on customerspending patterns allowing it to build an ecosystem around these insights and customer relationships. 512 Interim report 2016 Ping An Insurance (Group) Company of China June 2016 pingan.com. 13 Commonwealth Bank of Australia blog \\xe2\\x80\\x9cAlbert Our next generation EFTPOS tablet\\xe2\\x80\\x9d February 19 2016 commbank.com.au.\\x0cOutside the financial sector China\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Tencent a leader in gaming and social networking has launched WeChat a messaging platform that among other features can provide instant loans without collateral of up to $30000. The service combines creditbureau data from the People\\xe2\\x80\\x99s Bank of China with that gleaned from Tencent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s customer base of 800 million active users to analyze and respond to credit applications.14 Fintech services have become an integral component in the company\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ecosystem. The development of ecosystems will differ broadly across markets for various reasons such as consumer behavior and competitive landscape. In the United States for example they could be slower to develop because of market fragmentation with strong companies already providing compelling solutions backed by advanced technologies. Greater consolidation and scale are likely needed to create conditions suitable for viable ecosystems. In emerging markets however digital ecosystems could advance more quickly as companies bypass intermediary technologies and go straight to the most advanced solutions. Platform players that are already deeply entrenched in the lives of consumers like Tencent could leverage  their solid customer base to form the core needed for an ecosystem\\xe2\\x80\\x99s development.Fintechs have matured rapidly in recent years and the industry is entering a new phase of development. With no signs of the industry\\xe2\\x80\\x99s growth abating its reach is likely to broaden quickly to embrace even newer technologies and offerings blurring the boundaries now delineating financial services. As the momentum continues some aspects of fintech are likely to reach into a broad swath of the global economy much like how digital technologies have become a necessity rather than an option for every industry. Understanding the seven features that characterize this new era will allow companies to stake out the most valuable plots in the new landscape.Additional insightsTo provide additional perspectives on how fintech has evolved and its impact on various customer segments and to provide a broader view on its core underlying technologies we have assembled an anthology of articles published by McKinsey.
