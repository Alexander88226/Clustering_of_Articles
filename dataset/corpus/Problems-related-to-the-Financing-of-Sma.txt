Tech) Department of Mechanical Engineering Punjabi University Patiala India Assistant Professor Department of Mechanical Engineering Punjabi University Patiala India Jaskaran Singh Davinder Singh   Abstract MicroSmall  and  Medium  Enterprises  (MSMEs)  contribution  is  highly  remarkable  in  the  overall  industrial  economy  of  the country. In  recent  years the MSME  sector  has consistently  registered  higher  growth  rate compared  to the  overall  industrial sector. In the Indian market MSME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s rapid growth could be seen as Indian entrepreneurs are making remarkable progress in various Industries like Manufacturing Precision Engineering Design Food Processing Pharmaceutical Textile & Garments Retail  Agro  and  Service  sector.  MSMEs  complement  large  industries  as  ancillary  units  and  contribute  enormously  to  the socioeconomic development  of the country.  However  MSME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  contribution  is  phenomenal  in  the  growth  of  Indian  economy simultaneously; they are facing intense pressure and constraints to sustain their competitiveness in a globalized world. Some other issues such as the recession low demand finance heavy competition from MNCs etc. are becoming exposed problem to MSMEs in India. The availability of external finance for them is a topic of significant research interest to academics and an important issue to policy makers around the globe. Therefore in present work an attempt has been made to identify the problems related finance of MSMEs.  Key words Finance MSMEs problems   1. Introduction  Today small and medium industry occupies a position of strategic importance in the Indian economic structure due to its significant contribution in terms of output exports and employment. The smallscale industry accounts for 40% of gross industrial value addition and 50% of total manufacturing exports. More than 3.2 million units spread all over the country producing about 8000 items from very  basic  to  highly  sophisticated  products.  The  SMEs  are  the  biggest  employmentproviding  sectors  after  agriculture;  providing employment to 29.4 million people. However MSMEs which constitute more than 90% of the total number of industrial enterprises are  now  facing  a  tough  competition  from  their  global  counterparts  due  to  liberalization  change  in  manufacturing  strategies technological  changes  and  turbulent  and  uncertain  market  scenario.  The  sector  is  exposed  to  intensified  competition  since liberalization of Indian economy in 1991. Small industry in India has been confronted with an increasingly competitive environment due to \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Liberalization of the investment regime in the 1990s favoring foreign direct investment (FDI); \\xef\\x82\\xb7  The formation of the World Trade Organisation (WTO) in 1995 forcing its member countries (including India) to drastically scale down quantitative and nonquantitative restrictions on imports and \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Domestic  economic  reforms  The  cumulative  impact  of  all  these  developments  is  a  remarkable  transformation  of  the economic environment in which small industry operates implying that the sector has no option but to 'compete or perish' [1]. In  particular  they  have  to  undergo  some  change  when  they  compete  with  global  companies  and  other  large  buyers  as  they  are dependent on supply contracts from the same. This puts considerable pressure on MSMEs to control both their costs and quality and meet the different legal requirements. This is a serious challenge for them especially for those operating in developing countries with laborintensive technologies where labor cost is a major concern [2].   2. Financial Management in MSMEs Finance is the key input of production distribution & development. The financial investment of these small units comes mainly from within; most of them invest their own funds or borrowed funds. Much less comes from banks & government channels. Smallscale entrepreneurs  face  a  lot  of  problems  while  availing  loan  facility  from  commercial  banks  and  Government  agencies.  Financial institutions ask for a lot of information & data state financial corporation takes several months to take decision on extending term INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Page 317             \\x0c   www.ijird.com                                             January 2014                                             Vol 3 Issue 1   loans smallscale sector are not in a position to offer guarantee required by the banking sector. Even when small loans are raised from Government agencies the procedure is so cumbersome that most of the entrepreneurs who either illiterate or semiliterate hesitate to make use of these facilities. This makes matters very difficult for the small industrialist particularly when he is new to this way of life and he has to deal with both state financial corporation as well as banks [3]. The  conceptual  framework  to  which  most  of  the  current  research  literature  adheres  has  been  quite  helpful  in  understanding  the institutions  and  markets  that  provide  funds  to  MSMEs  in  developed  and  developing  nations.  This  framework  has  also  provided insights  into  the  effects  of  policies  that  affect  access  to  funding  by  creditworthy  MSMEs  in  these  nations.  However  the  current framework is oversimplified and neglects key elements of the financial system that affect MSME credit availability [4]. Information is a key input that goes into the credit decision of banks and one of the challenges for banks is to acquire information about the credit risk of the borrower as borrowers have more information than the lender about the projects [5]. This fundamental information problem is a key concern that needs to be addressed in the allocation of loans; the absence of a mechanism to bridge the information asymmetry between the borrower and the lender would lead to a failure to allocate loans efficiently. According to Chen et al. [6] the corporate tax system encourages debt financing and discriminates against MSMEs in most countries since corporate interest payments are tax deductible. Such a type of tax nonneutrality between the financing methods favors large firms which have easier access to bank loans.  2.1. Type of Industrial Finance Depending upon the type of activity entrepreneur requires three types of Finance \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Shortterm  finance  For  the  period  of  less  than  one  year  it  is  usually  required  to  meet  variable  seasonal  or  temporary \\xef\\x82\\xb7  MediumTerm finance For the period of 15 years it is usually required for permanent working capital small expansions working capital needs. replacements modifications etc. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  LongTerm Finance For the period exceeding 5 years Longterm finance is usually required for procuring fixed assets for the establishment of a new business for substantial expansion of existing business modernization.  2.2. Financial Sources of MSMEs Usually the commercial banks provide shortterm credit to MSMEs. The institutions like State Financial Corporations (SFCs) Small Industries Development Corporations (SIDCs) National Small Industries Corporation (NSIC) and National Bank for Agriculture and Rural  Development  (NABARD)  provide  shortterm  loans.  The  financial  assistance  in  the  form  of  supply  of  machinery  on  hire purchase basis from NSIC and to some extent from SIDCs is available. The Small sized units and tiny units also get some shortterm loans from commercial banks along with working capital in the form of composite loans [7]. The Small Industries Development Bank of India (SIDBI) provides refinance to these institutions. This kind of refinance includes assistance provided to State Financial Corporation Bills Finance Scheme Special Capital/Seed Capital Scheme new debt instruments and to the National Small Industries Corporation. In  the small scale industrial units longterm loans are provided by SFCs mainly through Single Window Scheme and National Equity Fund and direct assistance provided to State Financial Corporations in the form of refinance. State Financial Corporations provide some part of working capital for preoperative expenses of Small Scale Industrial Units under the Single Window Scheme.  2.3. Own Financial Resources for Innovation The financing experiences of MSMEs around the world suggest that smaller firms typically depend on internal finance  for initial capital and external finance for liquidity and studies have noted that banks are the major source of external finance. Berger and Udell [4] in their study on small business finance in the US concluded that smaller and younger SMEs relied on internal source of financing (personal or family savings) trade credit and angel finance for the initial capital. This is due to their limited accessibility to small business financing in the market. While  the  bulk  of  research had  been  predominantly  undertaken  in  developed  countries  particularly  the  UK  and  US  research  on MSMEs finance in developing countries is still insufficient and incomprehensible [8]. Nevertheless existing literatures suggest that MSMEs in developing countries behave rather similarly to those MSMEs in developed countries. A specific study by James [9] on fiscal and financial factors that affect SMEs in ASEAN (Malaysia Indonesia Philippine Thailand and Singapore) exposed that most small and medium entrepreneurs in the region use personal savings for initial funding.  2.4. Difficulty in Access to Finance MSMEs  face  a  lot  of  problems  while  availing  loan  facility  from  commercial  banks  as  well  as  Government  agencies.  Financial institutions ask for a lot of information & data state financial corporation takes several months to take decision on extending term loans small scale sector are not in a position to offer guarantee required by the banking sector. Even when small loans can be raised from Government agencies the procedure is so cumbersome that most of the entrepreneurs who either are illiterate or semiliterate hesitate to make use of these facilities [3]. When MSMEs have been offered to external finance they will be charged with high rates of interest as smaller enterprises provided to be more risky & more likely to fail than larger firms. The lack of financial resources hinders many MSMEs from initiating or  even worse  completing their innovative ideas. MSMEs had abounded innovation activities. They have problems to acquire loans because INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Page 318  \\x0c   www.ijird.com                                             January 2014                                             Vol 3 Issue 1   financial institutions are often reluctant to (co)finance risky innovation projects. Another financial constraint refers to the problem of getting access to public funding for innovative ideas and bureaucratic application procedures associated with them. Further it was pointed out that innovation projects must be delayed owing to regulatory reasons until the application has been approved [10].  2.5. Government Policies Government aid is paramount in the case of small scale manufacturing organizations. Government can assist organizations in several ways such as through collaborative training programs R&D programs among governmentfunded research centers universities for specific sectors of the manufacturing industry. Government can encourage networking promote growth ambitions and encourage new product development by making them aware that it is a risky option to continue with their existing products/customers regardless of market  changes.  Government  can  provide  sector  specific  specialist  advice  within  the  manufacturing  industry  and  provide  more financial and tax incentives [11]. It can support programs to  build infrastructure as well as  the incentives (such as tax incentives) and special start up programs to develop private sector [1214]. Increase in technological innovation demands that government should enhance spending on R&D [15].  3. Literature Review \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Tagoe  et al. (2005)  examines the impact of  financial sector liberalization (FSL) policies on the financial management of micro small and mediumsized enterprises (MSMEs) in Ghana using six case studies. Their findings which confirm and extend the conclusions of previous studies; are integrated into a framework that explains the impact of FSL and the factors at work.  The  main  financial  challenge  faced  by  MSMEs  is  access  to  affordable  credit  over  a  reasonable  period.  This  is determined by the financial needs of MSMEs and the action of investors. MSME financing needs reflect their operational requirements while the action of investors depends on their risk perception and the attractiveness of alternative investment (which affects their willingness to invest). Government borrowing the general economic climate availability of collateral quality of MSME record keeping and MSME investor relations skills affect the way in which this challenge is managed. The impact of the activities and potential of enterprise development agencies is also discussed [16]. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Berger and Udell (2006) suggested a more complete conceptual framework for analysis of MSME credit availability issues. This framework shows that the key conduit through which government policies and national financial structures affect credit availability  is  leading  technologies.  The  feasibility  and  profitability  of  different  lending  technologies  are  affected  by  the casual  chain  from  policy  to  financial  structures.  These  technologies  in  turn  have  important  effects  on  MSME  credit availability. Financial structures include the presence of different financial institution types and the conditions under which they  operate.  Lending  technologies  include  several  transactions  technologies  plus  relationship  lending.  The  frequent misleading conclusion is that large institutions are disadvantaged in lending to opaque MSMEs [4]. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Subrahmanya  et  al.  (2010)  have  discussed  the  probes  of  the  drivers  dimensions  achievements  and  outcomes  of technological innovations carried out by SMEs in the auto components electronics and machine tool sectors of Bangalore in India.  Further  it has  certain  the  growth  rates  of  innovative  SMEs  in  relation  to  noninnovative  SMEs  in  terms  of  sales turnover employment and investment. Thereafter it probes the relationship between innovation and growth of SMEs by (i) estimating a correlation between innovation sales and sales growth (ii) calculating innovation sales for high medium and low growth innovative SMEs [17]. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Thampy  (2010)  give  a  brief  description  about  the major bottleneck  to  the growth  of  the  vital  Indian  small and  medium enterprises (MSME) sector is its lack of adequate access to  finance. The major issues in the financing of MSMEs in the Indian context are examined under this paper. These include the information asymmetry facing banks and the efficacy  of measures such as credit scoring for SMEs whether transaction lending would be adequate to address the information issues or  would  lending have  to  be  based  on  a  relationship  with  the  SME.  Whether  the  size  and  origin  of  the  bank  affect  the availability of credit to SMEs. The author also gives an importance of the credit appraisal and risk assessment processes in today\\xe2\\x80\\x99s banking landscape and the role that banks can play in developing the MSME sector in India [18]. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Manan et al. (2011) have discussed that similarity between the stylized patterns of MSMEs financing in other parts of the world with that of Malaysian MSMEs is something that the study would attempt to investigate. Using descriptive analysis findings of the study  showed that the MSMEs in Malaysia are no less different from the rest of their counter parts. One interesting highlight  of  the  study  is  the  fact  that a  significant number  of  SMEs  sought  Islamic  financing  modes  such as Murabahah  Bai  bithaman  Ajiland  Ijarahas  sources  of  external  capital.  This  could  give  a  positive  signal  for  the  Islamic financial institutions to offer more of such facilities to the MSMEs [19]. Jeswal (2012) has discussed that the role of MSMEs in Indian economy. The role of small and medium enterprises in the economic and social development of the country is well established. MSME s emerges leaders during the period of recession restoring jobs and business activity lost during the time despite a slow and fragile economy. The smallscale industry sectors play a vital role in the growth of the country. It contributes almost 40% of the gross industrial value added in the Indian economy. \\xef\\x82\\xb7 \\xef\\x82\\xb7  The growth rates during the various plan periods have been very impressive. The number of smallscale units has increased from an estimated 0.87 million units in the year 198081 to over 3 million in the year. When the performance of this sector is viewed against the growth in the manufacturing and the industry sector as a whole it instills confidence in the resilience of the smallscale sector [1].

(2012) have discussed the economic effect and management effect in small and medium enterprises (MSMEs) the theoretic  model  of  technological  innovation  engineering  is  given  in  the  paper.  By  model  design  pretest  and  pilot  test reliability test and validity test factor analysis can effectively reveal the correlation among innovation planning innovation implementation and innovation platform and innovation performance. For illustration 245 questionnaires return  from 11 provinces and autonomous regions and the return ratio is 70% which satisfy the requirement that the questionnaire returnsratio is not lower than 20% in the data investigation. The empirical results show that model fitting work well and have a high convergence validity [20]. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Meuleman and Maeseneire (2012) studied that for alleviate debt and equity gaps for small firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 innovation projects some countries  spend  public  money  on  R&D  grants  for  this  these  firms  may  be  certify  as  private  financiers  by  experienced government officials. They used a unique Belgian dataset of approved request and denied request for a different type of R&D grants for examining the impact of subsidies on small firms\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to external equity short and longterm debt financing. They also find that R&D subsidy gives a positive signal related to MSME results and quality in a better access to longterm debt [21]. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Mungaya et al. (2012) conducted a survey about the fact that the tax plays an important role in the growth of MSMEs. The role of MSMEs is critical in pushing the socioeconomic development agenda in the lowincome country like Tanzania. For this reason alignment of the tax system to the environment specific MSME growth needs can be considered an important agenda for the policy makers. Keeping this issue as an important issue the study aimed to explore the managers/executive officers\\xe2\\x80\\x99 perception of taxsystem effectiveness in promoting MSMEs growth in the Country. Some selected respondent uses a  questionnaire  and  interview  to  administer  the  survey.  The  descriptive  analysis  method  is  used  to  analyze  the  data  and findings  were  presented  in  terms  of  frequencies  and  percentage  analysis.  Findings  indicate  that  the  majority  of  the respondents perceives the adverse impact of existing tax policies on the growth of MSMEs and suggest for reforming the tax policies in the Country. The findings would help the stakeholders in designing measures to align the taxsystem to MSMEs in a more effective manner [22]. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Shanker (2012) has examined the problems of MSMEs of Pathankot area. They examined the scope of further financing of MSMEs  by  Banks  in  Pathankot  area  and  devise  requisite  strategies  for  financing  thereby  increasing  the  MSMEs  loan portfolio which would help the banks and ultimately the country. On the analysis of the secondary data which was obtained from Banks Performa Reports Annual Returns and Annual Credit Plans it was observed that the huge scope exists for the banks in Pathankot centre for intensive financing of MSMEs. This is observed from the data that at present CD Ratio at the centre is 58.71% (below the prescribed national average of minimum 60%) and the share of SMEs to total advances being 31.58% which need to be increased to at least 50%. The primary study was conducted based on random samples of five hundred micro small and medium enterprises from manufacturing and service sectors in Pathankot. The tabulated data were analysed by applying requisite statistical tools and inferences drawn. Based on the percentage wise responses the innovative and dynamic strategies have been suggested [23]. \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Xiao and Zhao (2012)  provides the information after examining the newlyavailable World Bank survey of  over 28000 firms from 46 countries that how financial development affects firm innovation around the world. They find that while stock market development significantly enhances firm innovation banking sector development has mixed effects. They show that the latter result can be explained by different levels of government ownership of banks. Specifically in countries with lower government ownership of banks banking sector development significantly enhances firm innovation; while in countries with higher  government  ownership  of  banks  banking  sector  development  has  no  significant  or  sometimes  even  significantly negative effects on firm innovation. Such negative effects are significantly stronger for smaller firms. The results are robust to  various  controls  such  as  firm\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  human  capital  and  ownership  structure  to  estimations  using  instrumental  variable techniques and alternative measures of firm innovation [24]. The following factors are identified from an extensive literature review which affects financial management of MSMEs  3.1. Factors Affecting Financial Management  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Shortage of own financial resources for innovation \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Difficulty in access to finance via bank loans Government subsidies etc.  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Slow process for loan applications  \\xef\\x82\\xb7  Lack of Government policies like subsidies relief in taxes etc.  4. Conclusion  Industries from the backbone for national development and are one of the important components for the growth of national economy and the growth of the MSMEs sector at a healthy rate is crucial for overall growth of the industry. However lack of proper financial facilities is the barrier of  better performance. There are not many  financial resources available for innovation activities  within the MSMEs. It is found that the MSMEs depended much of their initial capital on internal sources as they have accessibility problems in getting external debt  or equity  financing. Even if they are offered  with debts they  will be charged with high rates of interest as smaller INTERNATIONAL JOURNAL OF INNOVATIVE RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT Page 320  \\x0c   www.ijird.com                                             January 2014                                             Vol 3 Issue 1   enterprises are perceived to be more risky and more likely to fail than larger firms are. This problem is shared by the MSMEs around the world irrespective of the differences in the countries\\xe2\\x80\\x99 financial infrastructure. In this study an attempt has been made to identify the factor affecting financial management of MSMEs. The present work presents four key issues under financial management. These include Shortage of own financial resources for innovation Difficulty in access to finance via bank loans Government subsidies etc. Slow process for loan applications Lack of Government policies like subsidies relief in taxes etc. Effective management of these issues can lead to the better performance of MSMEs in the competitive environment faced by them.  5.
