b'herein file   ECMI Commentary No. 44 / 17 March 2017  EUROPEAN CAPITAL MARKETS INSTITUTE   How close are we to a Capital Markets Union? Apostolos Thomadakis Introduction The  Commission   s  flagship initiative  of  the  Capital  Markets  Union (CMU)  aims  to  unlock  funding  for capital markets and find ways of linking investors and savers with growth. A number of very disparate measures will it is hoped have a cumulative but significant impact on the creation of a single market for capital. By the end of 2017 the Commission  expects to have finalised and implemented the first phase  of  CMU  measures.  Some  of  these  important  measures  include  an  EU  framework  for  simple transparent  and  standardised  (STS)  securitisation;  prospectus  rules  that  facilitate  access  to  capital markets and generate more but less costly financing opportunities; and improvements to the current venture capital and social entrepreneurship regulations (EuVECA/EuSEF).1  Given the Commission   s priority to accelerate CMU much more remains to be done. This year will be an  exciting and  intense  one  for prospective regulation which will lead  to the second phase of CMU actions. For example in 2017 we expect more work on business insolvency (early restructuring and second  chance);  preferential  tax  treatment  of  debt  over  equity;  capital  charges  to  infrastructure companies  (Solvency  II);  and  favourable  loan  enforcement  regimes  to  SMEs  (Capital  Requirements Regulation and Directive). This is not enough however. Further priorities such as the development of a  personal  pensions  framework  an  action  plan  on  retail  financial  services  the  development  of  a comprehensive  European  strategy  on  sustainable  finance  and  the  development  of  a  coordinated policy approach that supports FinTech are all vital for a successful CMU. This Commentary attempts to highlight the inefficiencies of the current CMU Action Plan.                                                              This Commentary is a contribution to the public consultation on the Capital Markets Union midterm review 2017. 1  See  the  Commission   s  Communication  of  14  September  2016  for  a  rapid  completion  of  the  first  measures proposed under the Action Plan here  http//ec.europa.eu/finance/capitalmarketsunion/docs/20160913cmuacceleratingreform_en.pdf.

Thinking ahead for Europe   2 | APOSTOLOS THOMADAKIS Existing inefficiencies Key drivers of the CMU CMU was motivated by a desire to tackle the obstacles to growth and job creation fill the hole that banks  left  behind  in  the  financing  arena  (overreliance  on  the  banking  sector  was  akin  to  placing  all one   s  eggs  in  a  basket)  and  to  make  the  EU  financial  system  more  resilient  to  future  crises  (shockproof). So far however these three main drivers of the CMU have not been accompanied by vitalised structural measures that could accelerate the pace of capital market integration in Europe.  1. Growth and jobs Even though they are the cornerstone of the CMU the initiative does not contain any policy instrument  that  directly impacts GDP  or employment. Europe has  gone through a severe financial and economic crisis with much of the region still struggling to make meaningful headway on reducing  unemployment  and  stimulating  economic  growth.  Macroeconomic  policies  across  the  EU remain  biased  towards  austerity  and  do  not  adequately  complement  the  expansionary  monetary policy  of  the  ECB  and  other  NCBs  (prosperous  north  vs  poor  south).  While  northern  countries  can expand  aggregate  demand  by  increasing  public  investment  and  reducing  taxes  southern  countries    macroeconomic  expansion  is  hindered  by  past  debts  weak  banking  systems  and  economic uncertainty. Proposals  such  as  a  joint  eurozone/EU  issuance  of  bonds  which  could  probably  enhance  a  fiscal stabilisation  mechanism  improve  the  throughthecycle  resilience  of  the  eurozone  provide  capital markets  with  a  liquid  riskfree  asset  support  the  diversification  of  European  banks     balance  sheets and  create  crossborder  banking  groups remain  rather  vague. Such  proposals  fail  on  legal political and  economic  grounds2  and  will  always  be  postponed  as  long  as  Germany  and  other  northern countries view them as an attempt to share fiscal misgovernance and structural reforms avoidance by southern countries. Political consensus plays an important role here and there is certainly nothing like that in Europe right now. 2. Bank dependency The EU financial system is bankdriven and dominated by large universal banks. The financial crisis showed us that EU would greatly benefit from rebalancing its economic structures towards a more marketbased finance. The CMU should help this rebalancing process by integrating nationally fragmented capital markets. The STS securitisation is a step in the right direction as well as the streamlining of rules for securities prospectuses and the simplification of market entry. However more  effort  has  to  be  made  to  support  startups/SMEs  to  reduce  access  barriers  to  public  trading platforms  and  develop  venture  capital  private  financing  and  crowdfunding.  In  addition  the  CMU needs  to  attract  and  incorporate  more  actively  household  and  corporatesector  savings  in  vehicles that will invest in capital markets and encourage them to diversify across the EU.  In order for the CMU to reach its main aim to facilitate capital market development by reducing the dependency of EU economies on banks more initiatives towards the imposition of legal restrictions on banking  sector  are  necessary.  These  restrictions  will  encourage  innovations  that  expand  the  role  of capital markets at the expense of banks.  We can find  examples of such restrictions  when  looking at the US and the UK. For example the restriction of deposittaking banks from engaging in certain types                                                            2 See Gros (2011).   HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO A CAPITAL MARKETS UNION? | 3 of marketoriented activity3 the ringfencing of retail bank operations into separate legal subsidiaries4 (UK Independent Commission on Banking ICB) and the imposition of size limits aim at dampening the impact of a failure (Section 622 of the Dodd Frank Act).  3.  Shock  absorption  More  integrated  capital  markets  (through  CMU)  are  expected  to  provide additional  shock  absorption  capacity  by  increasing  privatesector  risk  sharing  lowering  economic volatility  via  geographic  diversification  of  equities  and  bonds  enabling  households  and  firms  to lend/borrow from other economies (less impacted by given crisis) involving a more diverse investor base with different funding profiles and risk appetites.5 To  achieve  this  national  differences  in  supervisory  regulatory  tax  and  legal  practices  need  to  be eliminated.  The  Commission  currently  works  in  this  direction  by  focusing  on  standardising  crossborder clearing and settlement infrastructures; by formulating principlesbased legislation on business insolvency  and  early  restructuring;  and  by  establishing  a  code  of  conduct  for  withholdingtaxrelief principles and taxinduced disadvantages for equity financing.  However  these  reforms  largely  depend  on  the  progress  of  related  initiatives  such  as  harmonising accounting  and  auditing  and  increasing  the  role  of  the  European  Securities  and  Markets  Authority (ESMA) which oversees consistent enforcement of EU rules in all 28 member states. While the CMU can  help  expand  risksharing  through  capital  markets  the  adjustment  to  asymmetric  shocks  in  the eurozone  will  further  require  some  additional  element  of  fiscal  union  such  as  a  joint  Eurobond cyclical adjustment fund or common unemployment insurance.  Other key areas that need to be speeded up Further areas that require attention in CMU discussions are posttrade infrastructure online services and FinTech crowdfunding loanoriginating funds and crossborder distribution of funds. These areas are  important  for  unlocking  funding  for  capital  markets  and  finding  ways  to  linking  investors  and savers with growth.   4.  Posttrade infrastructure  Although  another  keystone  of  the  CMU  project  developing  an  EUwide capital market by bringing down national barriers is not new.6 Creating more efficient capital markets                                                            3  For  example  proprietary  trading  or  other  types  of  activities  that  were  deemed  by  the  US  Congress  to  be incompatible  as  a  policy  matter  with  the  appropriate  risk  profile  and  customerdriven  mission  of  banking entities.  However  looking  at  the  US  one  challenge  in  implementing  the  Volcker  Rule  is  complying  with  the marketmaking exemption to the prohibition on proprietary trading. The ambiguity as to what is legal marketmaking and what is prohibited proprietary trading may push dealers covered by the Volcker Rule toward more conservative trading strategies leading to less liquid markets. While some would argue that dealers not affected by the Volcker Rule will step in to provide liquidity recent empirical evidence (Bao et al. 2016) finds that the net effect is a less liquid market. 4 These subsidiaries should be governed by their own prudential safeguards.   5  See  the  speech  by  Eurogroup  President  Jeroen  Dijsselbloem  at  the  Tatra  Summit  in  Bratislava  4  November 2015  (www.consilium.europa.eu/en/press/pressreleases/2015/11/04jdspeechtatrasummit/)  and  Alcidi  and Thirion (2016). 6 In fact the free flow of capital was one of the fundamental principles on which the EU was built and this idea has fed into many EU initiatives and projects. These undertakings ranged from the 1988 deregulation of capital movements in the EU (European Commission 1989) to the 1999 Financial Services Action Plan to the proposals set  forth  by  the  Giovannini  Group  (from  2001)  for  removing  obstacles  to  the  crossborder  clearing  and settlement of securities transactions.   4 | APOSTOLOS THOMADAKIS was cited as an explicit goal of monetary union. The CMU is a further step towards the completion of a single European capital market. Within this scope one of Commission   s priorities is to remove barriers in the posttrading environment. Efficient and safe posttrade infrastructures are key elements of wellfunctioning capital markets.  Even  after  initiatives  including  the  adoption  in  2014  of  a  new  EU  Regulation  on  Central  Securities Depositories7 and the creation by the European Central Bank of the Target2Securities (T2S) platform8 for  securities  settlements  many  of  the  Giovannini  barriers9  remain.  As  identified  in  the  Giovannini reports10  the  EU  should  aim  to  reduce  or  eliminate  the  current  difference  between  crossborder securities transactions and transactions within a single EU country.  More  efficient  settlement  of  transactions  and  processing  would  occur  as  everyone  would  see  the same data and updates would be circulated quickly across the market. Cash transactions could settle in  (near)  realtime  since  the  trade  is  complete  when  the  next  update  to  the  blockchain  is  agreed embedding the transfer of ownership of an asset or other agreement. This would remove the need for posttrade affirmation or confirmation and central clearing during the settlement cycle (which has in some  cases  been  shortened  to  minutes  or  even  seconds).  Since  all  participants  would  now  use  the same underlying dataset for traderelated processes the blockchain would reduce the scope for data errors disputes and reconciliation lags which would speed up the endtoend process. Currently  an  expert  group  (European  PostTrade  Forum  EPTF)  has  been  established  to  assess  the evolution of the EU posttrade landscape following recent legislative changes market developments and the emergence of new technologies. The group will also assess the extent to which the Giovannini barriers have been  removed  and identify any new or emerging barriers. In  parallel the Commission will  propose  a  future  legislative  initiative  to  determine  with  legal  certainty  which  national  law  will apply to security ownership and to third party effects of the assignment of claims. 5.  Online  services  and  FinTech  In  order  to  promote  the  FinTech  sector  the  Commission  needs  to ensure that the regulatory environment strikes the right balance between enabling the development of FinTech and ensuring confidence and protection  for investors.11  Retail investors currently receive limited  rewards  for  assuming  the  high  risks  associated  with  market  based  investments  because  of large intermediation and distribution fees. MiFID II (Markets in Financial Instruments Directive) PRIIPs (Packaged Retail and Insurancebased Investment Products) and IDD (Insurance Distribution Directive) are  expected  to  change  the  landscape  governing  investment  advice  and  product  disclosure  and enforce investors    confidence in capital markets.                                                             7 See http//eurlex.europa.eu/legalcontent/EN/TXT/PDF/?uri=CELEX32014R0909&from=en.  8 See www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/t2s/html/index.en.html.  9 See www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/t2s/about/html/giovannini.en.html.  10 The first Giovannini Group (2001) report identified 15 barriers which were preventing  efficient crossborder clearing and settlement of securities in the EU while the second Giovannini Group (2003) report addressed the actions to be undertaken to eliminate the problems identified in the first report.  11 The Commission set up an internal task force (Financial Technology Task Force FTTF) which brings together services  responsible  for  financial  regulation  for  the  Digital  Single  Market  competition  and  for  a  consumer protection  policy.  With  the  engagement  of  outside  experts  and  stakeholders  the  Commission  aims  at formulating  policyoriented  recommendations  and  propose  measures in  the  course  of  2017.  See https//ec.europa.eu/digitalsinglemarket/en/digitalsinglemarket.      HOW CLOSE ARE WE TO A CAPITAL MARKETS UNION? | 5 The  move  towards  the     online  distribution     of  investment  products  as  well  as  the  new  FinTech ecosystem undeniably represent a huge opportunity to develop further advisory services and openaccess  online  distribution  platforms.  But  for  these  changes  to  be  successful  they  should  be accompanied  by  a  critical  and  comprehensive  assessment  of  the  investment  solutions  and  by outcomes  proposed  to  retail  investors.  Initiatives  such  as  the  Smarter  Consumer  Communications12 which changes the way information is communicated and delivered to customers and the Regulatory Sandbox13 which allows businesses to test innovative products services business models and delivery mechanisms in a live environment could set a great example. 6.  Crowdfunding  Despite  the  expansion  of  funding  sources  available  to  SMEs  (especially  nonbank funding  via  private  equity  and  peertopeer investment  and  borrowing)  securitiesbased crowdfunding  and  peertopeer  business  lending  still  represent  a  small  share  of  SME   s  funding.  A number of reasons for this are i) a nonharmonised legislation on crowdfunding across member states ii) a lack of credit information about SMEs14 which narrows access to crowdfunding as well as to other funding  sources  iii)  a  lack  of  information/knowledge  and  awareness  of  securities  based  on crowdfunding and peertopeer lending amongst investors. This  being  said  it  should  be  noted  that  the  Commission  is  taking  steps  towards  assessing  national regimes  and  best  practice  and  monitoring  the  evolution  of  the  crowdfunding  sector.  However  the current fragmentation and local dimension of these activities will certainly benefit from the MiFID II passport  or  initiatives  that  aim  to  develop  the  crossborder  crowdfunding  business  and  harmonise existing EU legislation with existing and upcoming national regulatory frameworks.15   7. Loanoriginating funds Loanoriginating funds can play an important role and be a useful source of nonbank credit. ESMA has issued an opinion on loanoriginating funds in April 2016 with the scope to identify  elements  that  should  be  part  of  a  possible  European  framework  on  loan  origination.16 However  it  is  not  clear  whether  this  consultation  will  lead  to  a  concrete  legislative  proposal  for  a Europewide  regime  for  lending  by  funds  or  whether  it  will  lead  to  a  review  of  the  current  market landscape.  It  is  also  unclear  what  will  happen  to  nonEU  fund  structures  and  how  if  at  all  an  EU legislative proposal would approach lending into the EU by such funds. The Action Plan identifies that EuVECAs (European Venture Capital Funds) and ELTIFs (European LongTerm  Investment  Funds)  can  to  an  extent originate  loans.  This  is  aside  from  bespoke  regimes  that some  member  states (notably  Ireland and Luxembourg) introduce into their  national  frameworks to frame the conditional under which alternative investment funds can originate loans. The Commission needs to work to assess the need for a coordinated approach to loan origination by funds and the case for a future EU framework. 8. Crossborder distribution of funds Despite the fact that 80% of UCITS (Undertakings for Collective Investment  in  Transferable  Securities)  and  40%  of  AIF  (Alternative  Investment  Funds)  are  marketed                                                            12 See www.fca.org.uk/publications/discussionpapers/smarterconsumercommunicationsfurtherstepjourney. 13 See www.fca.org.uk/firms/projectinnovateinnovationhub/regulatorysandbox. 14 See postevent report of ECMI Lunchtime Seminar on    Removing Information Barriers to Investment in SMEs    www.eurocapitalmarkets.org/events/lunchtimeevents/removinginformationbarriersinvestmentsmes. 15  The  European  Crowdfunding  Stakeholder  Forum  assists  the  Commission crowdfunding.  16 See ESMA (2016). in  developing  policies  for   6 | APOSTOLOS THOMADAKIS crossborder the distribution of funds remain geographically limited.17 The success of the CMU largely depends on the removal of unjustified national barriers to the free movement of capital. Latest data reveal  that  a  third  of  funds  marketed  crossborder  are  sold  in  only  one  other  member  state  and another third in no more than four other member states. Some of the reasons for inefficiency are i) a concentrated fund distribution channels in individual member states; ii) cultural preferences and iii) a lack of incentives to compete across borders.      For  the  Commission  to  ensure  easier  crossborder  investments  a  number  of  challenges  have  to  be tackled.  First  tax  barriers  such  as  withholding  tax  procedures.  Member  states  need  to  conclude  a doubletaxation  agreement  to  avoid  double  taxation  to  investors.  Second  divergences  in  corporate governance frameworks between member states which may discourage investors from making crossborder  investments.  Third  divergences  in  supervisory  outcomes.  ESMA  should  focus  on  achieving convergence of the supervisory frameworks and ensure a better financial integration within member states.18 Moreover ESMA is determined to ensure adequate investor protection independently of the location of the firm providing the services.19   Conclusion To  conclude  the  European  Commission  has  to  ensure  that  the  key  aim  of  the  CMU  and  the  Action Plan is to improve the capital markets themselves rather than making it easier for large institutions to invest  more  and  extend  their  product  and  services  offers.  The  focus  should  be  on  increasing transparency  making  capital  markets  more  accessible  to  smaller  businesses  incentivising  longterm private investment in listed equities encouraging the development and use of disruptive technology and ultimately creating jobs.  This year will prove crucial for the successful implementation of the CMU Action Plan and the delivery of its full potential to support growth in Europe. Moreover the impact that events such as Brexit the French and German national elections will have on CMU  of course remains to be seen. The current environment of political instability and uncertainty mirrors the fact that the EU is at a crossroads with decisive years ahead. It seems that the goal     the completion of CMU by 2019     is moving backwards and farther away.                                                               17 See EC (2017). 18 See Demarigny (2015). 19 See ESMA (2017).
