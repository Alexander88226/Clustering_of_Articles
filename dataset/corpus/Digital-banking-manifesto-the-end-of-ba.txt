Introduction"Banks are trying to be cool and hip and build super cool digital front ends... But it   s like putting lipstick on a pig  ultimately it   s still a pig and the new front end is still running into an awful digital back end."Mark Mullen Chief Executive Atom Durham UKWe are entering a new era of innovation that will reshape consumers    relationships with their banks. In order to understand how banking will evolve in the digital age it is important to understand its basic premise. While reasonable people can disagree about nuances at heart the art of banking is one of skillful record keeping in the doubleentry general ledger. At micro level banks can be thought of as dividend producing machines seeking deposits and issuing loans. At macro level they are creators of credit money.1 The main determinants of their quality and reliability are the amount of capital and the level of liquidity (essentially central bank money) they keep. In general a bank would like to maintain the right levels of both     if it has too little it becomes fragile if it has too much it becomes unprofitable and hence unable to fulfill its purpose of paying dividends. Some of the loans issued by the bank will be repaid as expected and some will default. In general when loans are repaid the bank   s capital grows and when they default the capital diminishes. If the bank   s capital falls below a certain fraction of its riskweighted assets the bank defaults. Good bankers differ from bad ones by their ability to attract a large pool of reliable borrowers so that default levels stay close to their expected values. (Some defaults are inevitable and are accounted for by charging interest.) At the same time good bankers need to attract longterm depositors and serve them well so that depositors do not suddenly withdraw their deposits. If the latter were to happen the bank can exhaust its liquid reserves and default through a different route. In principle if its less liquid assets are sound the central bank which is called the lender of last resort  for a reason can come to the rescue and provide additional liquidity.    2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 4 It is clear from the above description that banking activity is mostly technological and mathematical in nature. Hence it is well suited to be digitized yet the prevalence of legacy systems and legacy culture inhibits banks from embracing innovation as much as they should in order to survive and thrive in the digital economy of the 21 century. The root causes of banking malaise should be obvious     oldfashioned banks are far behind the latest technological breakthroughs; they also have a poor handle of the risks on their books. While major industries including retail travel communications and mass media have undergone revolutionary changes in their business models in the last thirty years or so banking remained static at its core living on its past glories and ignoring the winds of changes. Existing banks suffer from numerous drawbacks because competition among them is relatively weak. Moreover their customers are generally not happy with the level of customer service they receive besides they are exposed to the risk of losing their deposits (above and beyond the regulatory guaranteed minimum) in the case of their bank   s default. Zero or negative deposit rates which became prevalent in most developed countries in recent years make keeping money in the bank both risky and unprofitable. Yet at present customers do not have viable alternatives. In addition there are whole strata of people and SME especially in developing countries who are either underbanked or unbanked due to the fact that traditional banking methods are not flexible enough either to solve the know your customer (KYC) problem for them or to assess their credit worthiness. Thanks to new developments in data technology and in mobile telecommunications adoption we see the potential rise of a third wave of innovation in banking. We will outline in this paper the key features benefits and strategic imperative of the Digital Bank of the Future (DBF).  To understand the opportunity that is promulgating this third wave we define the first two waves of digital innovation in bankingFirst wave companies the    incrementalists   Digital technologies have been entering the banking industry for years. However they have been added incrementally to existing operations either as an overlay or a minor extension. We term these the    incrementalists    or First Wave companies.    2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 5 In the mid 1970s Citi began experimenting with the automated teller machine (ATM). Former MIT Chairman John Reed led the development of Citi   s efforts in this area revolutionizing retail banking. The ATM story is a landmark study in corporate innovation.  The concept was simple deploy machines that could process transactions such as cash withdrawals and check deposits. What was revolutionary was what followed banks historically had been open with limited daytime hours say 9am     3pm which was inconvenient for people who had a job.  However in the 1950   s most householders in the U.S. had a single earner and the stayathomewife was able to handle banking needs during the day. Mapping to a behavior change in society as more and more women entered the workforce the U.S. saw a rise in twoincome households which in turn led to a diminution in the ability of people to take advantage of daytime banking services. Thanks to computerized banking executives could see exactly when people most needed to use banking services. Evening utilization of ATMs surged. Banks in turn then began extending their hours into the evening to accommodate the working professional.   By 2014 there were 524000 tellers in the U.S.2 up from 484000 in 19853. Online banking likewise was piloted in the 1980s by Citi Chemical Bank through Minitel (France) and Prestel (UK) but didn   t really take off until the 1990s in conjunction with soaring internet usage.  Simple browserbased tools gave consumers access to a number of key banking transactions such as money transfer bank statements and electronic bill payment. While the incumbent commercial banks initially were the purveyors of online banking the rise of the internet also saw the rise of the internet bank     most prominently NetBank in 1996.  Second wave companies digital hybridsWe term the Second Wave companies like NetBank to be    Digital Hybrids   . Frequently taking advantage of front end systems to better market and connect with consumers they remain shackled by legacy back and middle office infrastructure risk modeling systems and sometimes labor models.  Often these hybrid banks will have an incumbent bank as their backend.  For example Simple Bank was founded in 2009 with a number of innovations to streamline account management and costs but uses The Bancorp as its backend.  Other emergent hybrid banks such as Fidor Bank (Germany) Atom Bank (UK) LHV Pank (Estonia) and DBS Digibank (Singapore) enjoy purposebuilt IT infrastructure that is 6080% less expensive to build and 3050% less expensive to maintain than legacy banks.  Headcount is considerably lower about 1015% the levels of a traditional bank.     2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 6 However these    digital hybrids    still use centralized databases cloud based storage and primitive user data protocols. They represent a bridge solution between the Main Street bank of yesterday and the fully digital bank of the future.Third wave companies digital nativesA new set of technologies is emerging that permit close integration with consumers    lives promise access to the 2.5 billion unbanked or underbanked consumers globally4 and greater financial flexibility to 45+ million underbanked Small & Mediumsized Enterprises (SMEs) around the world5. DBF will take advantage of these technologies and be designed around the needs of digital natives the 50 and under crowd that grew up with computers as a daily part of their lives. For the millennials a mobilefirst strategy will drive ease of access and rapid adoption through seamless integration with their lives.Taking a breakthrough approach to data security DBF will eschew a central data repository easily attacked in favor of a secure encrypted distributed data system.  Personal data stores not only permit better digital walleting but also greater security around personal biometric data which is integral to the digital bank   s security protocols.The new technology paradigm begs the question what role do banks truly have in the new world? Have we reached the end of banks in the way we know them? Is it possible that fractional banking is on its last legs and the introduction of government issued digital cash which can be stored in a digital wallet outside the banking system will put the last nail in its coffin?We will now look at the key requirements for a digital bank from three perspectives customer investor and the bank itself.   2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 7 II.  Key Requirements for a Digital Bank      Customers    Perspective  At a minimum on the retail side DBF should be able to do the following     Holistic & Customizable Experience Provide a holistic interactive and intuitive overview of the customers    money and more broadly their financial life including information on their current account and deposit balances transactions outstanding loans recurring payments pension contributions and accumulation as well as securities accounts. Tailor its services for different customer segments such as small and informal merchants mass affluent youth market international travelers or lowincome customers. Offer a trusted and relatively inexpensive source of credit for its customers;   2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 8      EndtoEnd Digital Provide a holistic fully digital experience for customers including paperless application and passing of the KYC (Know Your Client) process. Also provide an interactive and intuitive digital financial planner to organize customers    financial life and optimize their resources immediate cash flow requirements savings including tools for automatic savings medical expenses education retirement including roboadvisory with services previously accessible by high end investors only investments including tools for trading securities. Empower customers to electronically apply for mortgage or loan competitive insurance contracts for home liability medical and travel insurance with credit checking procedures expanded to social media. Provide reporting documentation related to bank activity including tax statements etc. Provide access to Personal Data Store (PDS);     Mobile First Enable natively driven mobile epayment solutions including domestic and international payments and remittances automatic bill payments and peertopeer (P2P) payments and money transfers. Rather than having mobile as an afterthought or an added capability everything changes if you start with mobile and build out from there     not just UX but fundamental infrastructure and credit analytics;     Foreign Exchange Deliver seamless and inexpensive foreign exchange services including protection against exchange rate fluctuations by providing multicurrency accounts. Potentially a full range of instruments for hedging against foreign exchange risk including forward contracts spot contracts swaps and exchange traded options can be offered;      Biometrics Offer biometric technology such as face and voice biometrics already actively used at airports and international border controls as core credentials for customers with preference for biometrics to PIN or password as a way of authentication for logging in. Behavioral biometric which is being developed at the moment is a promising venue for achieving an extra degree of protection;     ECredit Card Implement bank ecredit card based on customer   s own preferences with preset limits and permitted transactions consumptionrelated patterns and a comprehensive digital wallet and PDS which includes at the minimum electronic ID ecard for secure online purchases and tools to view pay organize analyze archive ebills and generate relevant tax documents;     Access to P2P World Provide access to    crowdeverything    including P2P payment and lending opportunities.   2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 9 III.  Key Requirements for a Digital Bank      Investor PerspectiveDigital bank is an exciting investment opportunity and inevitable business step because legacy banks are no longer able to adequately service their customers\' needs in the digital age. Customer requirements simply cannot be met by traditional banks unable to catch up with the digital revolution. With neither real estate overhead nor massive maintenance spending on legacy IT systems digital banks expect to grow multibillion dollar balance sheets in several years of operations with the fraction of full time staff compared to traditional banks. For instance Atom Bank in the UK intends to grow into a   5 billion balance sheet business in five years with just 340 full time staff while legacy bank Metro has that size balance sheet with 2200 people. It is clear however that the majority of digital banks\' staff will be engineers and data scientists although as always the role of sales and marketing should not be underestimated.   2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 10 Monetization and capturing valueCompared to legacy banks digital banks can generate value in numerous ways      Digital Payments Digital payments form the core of monetization. They include mobile and online payments both domestic and foreign as well as mobile P2P interactions. Digital payments enable banks to boost fees and interest income and reach a broader set of customers with more diverse services; they are done more cost effectively than by incumbent banks allowing market share gains through competitive pricing and/or accessing 2.5bn unbanked & underbanked;     Digital wallet Digital wallet is essential for digital commerce and ecosystems built on valueadded services. In addition it optimizes transaction costs for customers and funding costs for banking operations;     Digital Sales & Banking Products Artificial intelligence (AI) assisted sales of banking products such as deposits loans and mortgages are conducted through direct channels including social media. That is in line with shifting consumer preferences and behavior trends in ecommerce especially directed at Generation Y and techsavvy customers;     Multichanneling An integrated and seamless multichannel approach to sales increases the bank   s share of customers    wallet boosts customer loyalty thereby making a significant difference in customer adoption rates;     Digital Financial Planner & Roboadvisory AIbased digital financial planner manages monthly income recurring payments savings and investments increasing interaction between the digital bank and customers. The bank acts as a trusted shepherd defining customer lifecycle financial needs. Logical continuation of the circle of trust between the digital bank and customers where customers rely on the Roboadvisory services to optimize investment portfolios based on individual goals and preferences regularly adjust them and record incremental results and properly allocate resources for each phase of the customer   s voyage towards all things digital;     Smart Big Data Advanced analytics allows the digital bank to transform its data into more personalized client service aimed at data monetization;     SME Upside AI and bigdata based credit models enabling riskmanaged provisioning of credit access to SMEs banking the 45 million underbanked SMEs globally.  By 2018 banks in Scandinavia the United Kingdom and Western Europe are forecast to have half or more of new inflow revenue coming from digital related activities in most products such as savings and term deposits and bank services to SMEs6.    2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 11 IV.  Key Requirements for a Digital Bank     Bank   s Perspective"Banks are mired in the legacy of old IT systems that are bad... The first automated banking system was introduced by Coutts in 1967. The joke is that they are still running on it today.    The only saving grace is that banks are not unique in this respect. For instance as was revealed by a recent government report the US nuclear weapons force still relies on a 1970sera computer system and 8inch floppy disks.By its very nature a digital bank has to be a cross between a Fintech company and a bank. While a digital bank similarly to a conventional one can be organized into five divisions Retail Banking Private and Business Banking Analytics and IT Finance Management and Operations and Risk Management the relative importance of these departments is not the same. Moreover the relationship map between various divisions is different in digital and legacy banking with analytics and IT being the cornerstone of the digital banking edifice. In general success and failure of a bank is measurable by technologies and analytical methods adopted rather than by its product line.   2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 12      Novel IT Infrastructure Building a digital bank from scratch enables to create a flexible IT infrastructure which provides state of the art risk management helps to optimize the bank   s balance sheet to achieve return on capital significantly higher than return of the incumbents and guarantees compliance with constantly changing banking regulations in real time which is achieved via building modern RegTech capabilities.     Database Design The bank IT is based on the stateoftheart database technology which can cope with the exponential growth in data new internet technologies and analysis methods. This technology is expected to be based on distributed ledger framework.     Advanced Data Analytics Since banks own rich reserves of raw behavioral data which can provide valuable insights into future customer choices the value proposition offered by digital banking can be extended. Following the example of Internet powerhouses such as Google Amazon Alibaba and Facebook the bank should consolidate data across deposits consumer finance and other transaction accounts for a unified view of customer activities. For instance customers    instore payments are far more accurate than conventional profile data (for example age income geography) in predicting their future financial activities and credit worthiness; their geospatial mobility among stores providing extra improvements. In addition using customer data digital banks can create offerings ranging from payment solutions and information services savings and deposittaking right through to online banking advisory services and simple financing. It is imperative to be able to evaluate collected customer transactions in real time and connect them for prediction of future customer behavior using deep learning and other probabilistic algorithms. It is important to build in safeguards of customer privacy in accordance with their preferences and legal requirements.     Artificial Intelligence Autonomous selection of best methodology when presented with arbitrary data enables banks to dynamically adopt to novel information and build a full financial profile of its customers including credit worthiness debt capacity and risk appetite for financial planning. In addition AI can rapidly adapt to customer needs and present the best offers at the right time changing dynamically as the customer evolves. A    smart bank    can more rapidly capitalize on shifts in a customer   s life cycle and assist them in achieving their financial goals.   2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 13      FullStack Business Model The fullstack business model is crucial to the total client experience. This approach facilitates the bank\'s compliance with the regulatory framework which enforces money laundering and fraud prevention and guarantees customers    protection. In general intelligent fraud detection and remediation systems can function in a far more superior fashion than conventional methods.     Security and Discretion If implemented correctly bulletproof security and customer protection is the area of a great competitive advantage for digital banks compared to other financial service providers. These features are embedded in a secure IT architecture from the onset and preclude both data misuse and data sales to third parties. They naturally include implementation of new cryptographically secured distributed data management 7.    2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 14 V.  Digital Customer SegmentDigital banks have several natural constituencies in both developed and especially developing economies 8        Professional consumers with at least an undergraduate college education;      Digitally educated middle uppermass and massaffluent professional and managerial consumers;      Digitally savvy Gen Y (students and young professionals in their 20s to 30s) digitalbanking natives who are exceedingly digitally savvy. They will form the foundation of the customer base for the digital bank;      SMEs that go mainstream using a digital banking platform designed for their needs; potentially banking 45 million underbanked or unbanked SMEs globally 9.    2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 15 VI.  Unleashing Digital CurrencyDigital banking of the future is unimaginable without using digital currency 10. Currently both central and private banks are actively pursuing creation of digital currencies. Some considerations for this dimension      NonBank Digital Currencies While the best known digital currency is Bitcoin it   s not suited for high volume transactions because of its low transactions per second (TPS) capacity. It is likely that other digital currencies based on consensus achievable by means other than proofofwork will be used in digital banking. One should not forget that Bitcoin is not the first digital currency to emerge nor is it going to be the last. In fact it is possible that digital cash invented by David Chaum more than thirty years ago can see a comeback at the next level of efficiency.      Central Bank Digital Currencies Several central banks are investigating whether a statebacked digital currency could reduce capital outflow money laundering and tax evasion and make economic activity more transparent and efficient. For instance PBOC BoE and Bank of Russia are all actively looking in this direction. In this scenario the    free    (or very inexpensive) deposits that commercial banks have been benefiting from will evaporate.      Private Bank Digital Currencies The idea of banks issuing their own currency is very old. For instance dozens of banks in the United States were doing so in the nineteenth century. Advances in digitization made this idea viable again. For example Bank of Tokyo Mitsubishi UFJ (MUFJ) is developing its own digital currency MUFG coin and the corresponding smartphone application prototype to authenticate digital tokens on a P2P platform. The bank expects to rein in financial transactional costs including cheaper international remittance and money transfers. Moreover in the future the bank might potentially issue its digital currency to customers.11       Distributed Ledger Using distributed ledger reduces financial transaction costs improves resilience of the system as a whole and mitigates operational risks. Without doubt distributed ledger will become intertwined with operational procedures of a digital bank and its interactions with other digital legacy and central banks.     2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 16 VII.  EcosystemIt is natural to expect that a welldesigned digital bank will become the corner stone of a much bigger financial ecosystem. As important constituent parts of such an ecosystem one can think of such digital service providers as insurers brokers wealth managers roboadvisors credit card issuers crossborder payment providers currency exchanges P2P lenders etc. The ability of these companies to satisfy the financial needs of their clients will be greatly enhanced by their access to a wider financial system through the digital bank. At the same the bank will benefit by getting additional information about their customers    demands and habits thus closing the information feedback loop 12. Moreover digital cash issued by the bank can serve as a lubricant allowing the wheels of commerce to spin faster and much more efficiently than is currently possible. It is possible to imagine a digital bank of the future in the center of the internet of things (IoT) which can be thought of as the bank of things (BoT). For instance if a bank   s client house informs him or her that the roof needs repairs the bank can immediately recommend several contractors organize bids help the client to choose the most suitable one and arrange financing. Thus in addition to financial businesses a digital bank of the future can incorporate into its ecosystem various nonfinancial actors. All these developments will enhance social utility of the bank and its appreciation by the public while at the same time increasing its profitability. Banks have to keep in mind that there is no time to lose because the competition for their customers\' digital wallet from current digital champions such as Google Amazon Facebook and Alibaba will be fierce.    2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 17 VIII.  Beyond BanksThe unsatisfactory state of affairs with existing banks opens a unique opportunity for building a digital bank from scratch. Such a bank will fulfill its mission by utilizing the most advanced technologies including cryptography and distributed ledger techniques artificial intelligence big data and deep learning. From the very beginning it will be based on balance sheet optimization deployment of digital distributed ledgerinspired infrastructure and comprehensive automation and digitization of the middle and back office as well as a heightened security employing the most advanced cryptographic techniques throughout the entire organization. By design this bank will be highly efficient profitable and agile. In addition its infrastructure will be flexible enough to handle both private digital currencies (such as Bitcoin) and potential government issued currencies (such as Britcoin). If so desired this bank will be capable of issuing its own digital currency. The bank will liberally apply artificial intelligence and big data analytics for creating unparalleled customer experience automating personal and SME credit issuance and improving risk management. By design such a bank will be valued by investors customers and regulators alike.And yet by building a bank are we trapped in the old paradigm?  If you look at WeChat or Sesame you will see what is scaring the Clevel of even leading edge companies like Facebook and Google to say nothing of the fright induced at leading telecommunications companies. Perhaps surprisingly many legacy banks seem to be more sanguine. WeChat is redefining what financial services means in relation to the broader suite of consumer services individuals engage with.The key is having customercentric data across all areas of life held in standard format with standard APIs that work across all the entire digital ecosystem and not just its financial services or products corner (like a universal PDS but customers don\'t own or manage it; they do). Using this central panoptic data WeChat can integrate services from the whole range of life opportunities (entertainment work finance family etc.) in a seamless and consistent manner.What this gives customers is fully integrated payments credit and banking unbelievable advising capability and amazing KYC and AML all in a form that is completely transparent. Consumers don   t need to know that payments are different from credit or from banking or from shopping in general. Users just wander around online and inperson finding interesting things and buy sell and trade seamlessly. WeChat or Sesame is also integrating health lifestyle and employment services with money services  completely transparently; no separate apps of web pages. You can just take care of what you need to live a better life. However this is conditional on consumers    ability to secure credit as necessary. Given the rather uncertain and limited capacity of P2P networks to provide credit digital banks have to come to the rescue.   2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS? 18 A similar future is unfolding for SMEs customers are shepherded to buy and money flow issues like credit payments KYC and AML go away virtually completely. WeChat reportedly reached over one million SMEs integrated into their services in the first few months of operations.Is there a future that is NO banking versus    digital banking   ?  Instead banking functions are just integrated invisibly everywhere. Several immediate challenges come to mind with this model       Due to the special and unique role of banks in credit money creation nonbank actors simply do not have necessary capacity to satisfy the financial needs of their customers;      There are numerous constraints around offering banking services that may be too limiting for companies in western Europe and the US. If China begins to adopt more restrictive financial regulations to better protect consumers they too will create a less hospitable business environment for these kinds of services.      Will WeChat (or the next WeChat) want to take its high flying tech company stock market multiple and burden it with a financial services discount 13? The more successful it gets at financial services the more acute this question becomes. However if financialization of a tech company is done in a deliberate and measured way it can actually increase the shareholder value.Despite these challenges is there a model that we could call    invisible banking    that integrates into our daily lives without friction? The answer is yes and no     the legacy banking model will unquestionably disappear over time but in the transition period digital banks will have a role in daily life for the foreseeable future as transaction lubricants and enablers.   2016 ALL RIGHTS RESERVED.DIGITAL BANKING MANIFESTO THE END OF BANKS?
