b'herein fileProceedings of ASBBS    Volume 16 Number 1 FINANCING THE SMALL SCALE INDUSTRIES IN BANGLADESH THE MUCHTALKED ABOUT BUT LESS IMPLEMENTED ISSUE  Jesmin Rubayat University of Dhaka rubayat27@yahoo.com    Abstract  There  has  emerged  a  greater  interest  in  understanding  firms     access  to  finance  and  the financing of small scale industries (SSIs) in particular. Various studies have indicated that one of the major obstacles for the formation and development of SSI is related with the SSI   s access  to  financing.  The  industrial  units  belonging  to  the  SSI  sector  many  of  which  are having liquidity problems are finding it difficult to possess the equity needed even to run the daytoday business. Commercial lenders on the other hand having experience  and are still battling  with       the  effects  of  "nonperforming  loans"  are  cautious  in  providing  loans particularly to the SSIs. Therefore in Bangladesh the SSIs face difficulties having access to financial  facilities  and  typically  rely  on  their  own  savings  and  loans  from  friends  and relatives especially during the startup phase. This paper examines the issues involved and the options related to the financing of SSIs in the country. The first part of the paper aims to provide  an  understanding  of  the  present  financing  environment  various  financing mechanisms  and  experiences  in  the  country.  Subsequent  to  this  practical  suggestions  and options are presented on the ways whereby certain financing mechanisms and supports can promote greater access to financial services and efficient use of funds provided. The issue of financing the SSIs is probably the most talked about one but compared to the demand very less has so far been done in this area.    INTRODUCTION Most  growth  theories  imply  that  industrialization  is  a  carrier  of  economic  growth. Nonetheless for a developing country such as Bangladesh whose economy is still very much agrarian the emphasis on industrialization should not be stressed by undermining the role of agriculture  in  the  economy  rather  a  complementary  balance  has  to  be  established  between these two sectors to reap the relative benefits accruing to each other resulting in acceleration of  the  economic  growth.  While  pursuing  the  industrial  development  efforts  the  major objectives  and  strategies  are  focused  on  optimum  utilization  of  resources  creating employment  opportunities  and  catalyzing  the  growth  of  production  and  exports.  The development strategies in the last fifty years centred on two models of industrialization the import  substitution  model  and  the  export  oriented  manufacturing  production  model.  In  any case  it  is  now  recognized  that  the  small  and  medium  enterprises  (SMEs)  are  playing  an increasingly important role as engines for economic growth and employment in many regions of  the  world.  Therefore  policies  and  initiatives  to  develop  SMEs  and  to  increase  their competitiveness  are  a  priority  for  these  countries.  Ahmed  (2006)  opined  that  SME development as instruments of employment and income generation human development and poverty  alleviation  export  promotion  stimulation  of  private  ownership  competition  and entrepreneurship and hence the driving forces behind the growth of a vibrant industrial market economy has generated considerable interest among the policymakers academics business circle  and  the  international  donor  agencies  in  recent  times.  Nevertheless  the  small  scale industries  (SSIs)  including  the  cottage  industries  are  of  special  consideration  as  these ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Volume 16 Number 1  Proceedings of ASBBS   industries mainly serve the domestic market. In addition the strategy for development of SSIs merits  special  attention  of  the  policymakers  in  accelerating  industrial  development  in countries  such  as  Bangladesh.  This  paper  intently  focuses  on  the  SSIs  of  Bangladesh  in general and their financing aspects in particular.   Investment is very much essential for the growth of any industry and increased facilities in obtaining  credits  can  enhance  that  growth.  Finance  is  needed  at  the  starting  phase  of  a business as well as at the enduring phases. The entrepreneurs require mainly three types of finances namely (i) equity capital  to finance assets at the start of a business; (ii) debts     to refinance assets; and (iii) working capital     to maintain the daytoday activities. However the  access  to  financing  is  recognized  as  the  leading  obstacle  to  SSI  growth in  Bangladesh alike most other developing and underdeveloped countries. The SSIs in most cases manage to  start  a  business  with  resources  from  informal  sector  but  find  it  extremely  difficult  to survive  and  expand  without  further  financial  assistance  from  the  institutional  lenders.  By minimizing the barriers to SSI finance and facilitating the adoption of new financing vehicles initiatives  have  to  be  adopted  to  improve  the  business  environment  for  SSIs.  A  sound business environment is a prerequisite for economic growth and crucial for the SSI sector to become not only a source of employment but also a source of innovation and productivity.    METHODOLOGY The  purpose  of  this  paper  is  to  highlight  one  of  the  major  prerequisites  namely  financial supports  of  the  SSI  sector  in  the  backdrop  of  pursuing  rapid  industrialization  strategy underpinning acceleration of economic growth. In addition to the assessment of the current financial  supports  provided  to  the  SSIs  in  the  country  this  paper  aims  to  focus  on  various other financial aspects as well as provide recommendations in this context. For this purpose extensive survey of literature has been made and relevant publications pervious studies and various initiatives taken by the stakeholders (including the government and the development partners)  have  been  consulted.  However  lack  of  reliable  and  comprehensive  industrial statistics especially regarding SSI sector limited the indepth analyses. For instance different institutions  in  Bangladesh  still  follow  different  definitions  of  small  industries  though  the Industrial  Policy  2005  has  declared  a  single  uniform  definition  of  various  categories  of industries     large medium and small. However for the purpose of the analysis the following definitions have been assumed (cid57)  In  the  manufacturing  sector     small  industry     means  an  industry  in  which  the  value/ replacement cost of durable resources other than land and factory buildings is under 15 million taka and    cottage industry    means an industry in which members of a family are engaged parttime or fulltime in production and serviceoriented activities. In the nonmanufacturing sector (trading and other services)    small industry    means an industry in which  fewer  than  25  workers  work  (unlike  family  members  in  a  cottage  industry). [Industrial Policy 2005] (cid57)  Formal  financial  institutions  include  those  institutions  that  are  subject  to  monetary regulation rules and laws of the central bank which in this case is the Bangladesh Bank. Accordingly  formal  financial  institutions  include  commercial  banks  development  or specialized  banks  nonbank  financial  institutions  cooperative  financial  institutions  and international financial institutions.  (cid57)  Informal  financial  institutions  are  those  that  stay  out  of  the  impact  of  rules  of  the Bangladesh  Bank.  These  usually  include  moneylenders  merchants  friends  family members as well as any other saving and crediting associations.   This paper is organized in five sections of which the present introductory section is the first. The  second  section  highlights  the  importance  of  SSIs  in  the  Bangladesh  economy  with  a focus  on  the  future  prospect  of  the  sector.  Section  three  then  moves  on  to  provide  a  brief ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Volume 16 Number 1  Proceedings of ASBBS   overview  on  the  financing  methods  available  to  the  SSIs  while  underscoring  the  barriers faced by the small enterprises to have access to these financing mechanisms. The forth section provides some options to enhance the SSIs\' access to finance. Section five     the concluding part     provides the summary of the paper in general.   IMPORTANCE OF THE SSI SECTOR FOR THE BANGLADESH ECONOMY The environment of Bangladesh\'s economy has been steadily improving since the mid 1990\'s. The  vigorous  campaign  of  privatization  and  tax  reform  undertaken  by  the  government  is believed  to  lead  to  an  expanding  economic  foundation  and  accelerating  the  growth  of industrialization. Although the economy of Bangladesh is agrarian in nature the contribution of  the  industry  sector  to  the  country\'s  gross  domestic  product  (GDP)  is  continuously increasing. However the contribution of the SSIs to the GDP is oscillating between a meagre 45% [Table 1]. Table 1 Contribution of Industry Sector to GDP (in %)   Industry MLI SCI FY99 25.69 11.20 4.40 FY00 25.70 11.01 4.39 FY01 26.20 11.13 4.46 FY03 27.23 11.29 4.68 FY04 27.69 11.41 4.76 FY05 28.32 11.66 4.85 FY06 29.03 12.14 4.94 FY07 29.45 12.47 5.08 FY08 29.67 12.60 5.16  FY02 26.75 11.16 4.60 Source Bangladesh Economic Review 2008 Note MLI     medium and large industries; SCI     small and cottage industries   Center for Economic Development [2001] revealed a SWOT analysis for the SME sector to highlight its importance in the national economy. The analysis is valid for the SSI sector as well. On this basis the following SWOT matrices are sketched to portray the dynamics of the Bangladesh SSI sector in the national economy.   Some of the wellrecognized strengths of the SSIs are (cid57)  source of new employment opportunities (cid57)  more flexible in terms of internal organisational structure (cid57)  comparatively  flexible  in  adopting  more  rapidly  and  readily  innovations  and  new (cid57)  able  to  provide  favourable  environment  for  development  of  entrepreneurial  skills  and technologies business culture (cid57)  closer  to  the  ultimate  consumers  and  can  respond  to  their  demands  more  rapidly  and efficiently in some cases generator of higher competitiveness on the market (cid57) (cid57)  primarily focused on domestic demand and the local market (cid57) in recent times receiving allout support from the government and accordingly to create favourable conditions for the development of the SSI sector is among the priorities in the policy of the government the development partners are also focusing on mitigating hindrances to foster this sector   (cid57)   At the same time some of the SSI weaknesses need to be pointed out for instance  (cid57)  due to difficult access to financing a great part of the SSIs are engaged with activities which are characterised by higher labour intensity than invested capital and thus leading to suboptimal use of resources (cid57)  a  substantial  part  of  the  entrepreneurs  do  not  have  sufficient  marketing  financial accounting  and  legal  knowledge  which  hinders  smoothrunning  of  their  business  and reduces the efficiency of the enterprises  ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Proceedings of ASBBS   (cid57) (cid57)  underestimating  of  the  quality  requirements  and  lack  of  knowledge  on  standard low access level and disregard of the real needs for information and consultation  Volume 16 Number 1  specifications agreements and requirements (cid57)  some  entrepreneurs  are  not  well  acquainted  with  the  current  effective  international   The  importance  of  SSI  for  the  national  economy  could  also  be  outlined  in  terms  of  the opportunities for further strengthening and development of the sector and its impact on the economy toward (cid57)  reduction of the unemployment rate  (cid57) (cid57)  development of new hightechnology industries (cid57)  reduction of regional economic discrepancies (cid57)  possibility  to  loop  the  production  cycle  and  achieve  higher  efficiency  by  setting  up increase of economic competition clusters (related production) on regional or branch principle increase of the welfare of the nation (cid57)   The  potential  threats  for  the  successful  development  of  the  SSI  sector  are  mainly  in  the following directions (cid57) impossibility to extend an individual enterprise by modernisation expansion of activities and  employment  of  new  workers  because  of  the  adverse  external  (macroeconomic) environment    high  taxation  and  insurance  liability  difficult  access  to  financing administrative barriers etc.  and also due to the inability of the entrepreneurs to deal with its challenges  insufficient  managerial  skills  of  the  entrepreneurs  inability  to  react  adequately  to liberalised  markets  and  reshaping  the  manufactured  produce  and  provided  services  in compliance with the international standard requirements   In  Bangladesh  the  importance  of  SSIs  in  the  economic  development  process  has  been recognized  in  all  official  documents  relating to  policy  prescriptions  for  the  industry  sector. The  development  of  SSIs  can  be  rationalized  in  terms  of  a  numerous  reasons  including  (i) labour  intensity  (ii)  use  of  indigenous  rawmaterials  (iii)  lower  capitaloutput  ratio  (iv) generation of employment at minimum investment cost (v) equitable distribution of income (vi)  regional  distribution  of  industrial  investment  (vii)  reduction  in  fixed  investment  costs through subcontracting tieups (viii) foreign exchange earnings through exports (ix)  foreign exchange retention through imports substitution (x) building up entrepreneurial base through trial and error at low cost (xi) introduction of innovations or appropriate technology at low cost and so on. Though the contribution of SSIs to GDP has remained almost static for more than a decade the growth rate witnessed a rise over the period [Table 2].   (cid57) Table 2 Growth of Industry Sector (in %)    Industry MLI SCI FY99  FY00  FY01  FY02  FY03  FY04  FY05  FY06  FY07  FY08 11.23 3.19 4.19 12.01 10.56 0.75 10.77 11.41 9.21 11.19 11.56 10.28 8.19 8.30 7.93 7.10 6.95 7.45 6.75 6.56 7.21 5.48 4.60 7.69 4.76 4.35 5.80 6.68 6.55 7.02 Source Bangladesh Economic Review 2008  The  contribution  of  SSIs  towards  employment  generation  also  appears  higher.  The  sector employed 5 million people directly and indirectly which accounts for 82 percent of the total industrial labour force [Fifth Five Year Plan 19972002]. Again various estimates reveal that ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Volume 16 Number 1  Proceedings of ASBBS   the difference in fixed investment cost in the creation of one unit of employment generation amounts  to  nearly  Taka  100000  between  SSI  and  large  scale  industry.  In  the  absence  of availability  of  any  current  national  level  estimates  about  the  nature  and  magnitude  of contributions  of  the  SSIs  it  is  difficult  to  provide  any  dependable  basis  about  their importance  on  the  economy.  Despite  their  contributions  in  the  economy  in  terms  of employment  and  value  addition  the  SSIs  suffer  from  numerous  operational  constraints resulting  from  the  scale  barriers  and  resource  constraints.  Comprehensive  policy  support including  various  fiscal  and  financial  incentives  are  thus  required  to  foster  an  enabling environment to improve competitive strength of these industrial units.    THE FINANCING ENVIRONMENT FOR THE SSIS The SSIs do not have a dominant presence in the Bangladesh economy compared to mediumsized industries and in general lack the capabilities of being dynamic firms in the process of economic  development.  However  considering  the  scope  of  employment  generation  and making use of relatively lower capitalintensive technologies these industrial units are indeed important.  Nonetheless  these  firms  often  face  economic  institutional  and  legal  obstacles. Such  restraints  include  limited  ability  of  acquiring  sufficient  amount  of  credit  (including initial  capital  and  longer  term  credits)  inadequate  infrastructure  support  high  transaction costs limited managerial  and technical knowhow and so forth. Despite of these obstacles which are mostly interdependent the general opinion on which SSI supporting policies are based stems in the fact that lack of finance makes up the principal restraint in their growth and  intensification.  The  SSIs\'  barriers  in  obtaining  access  to  formal  finance  emerged  from multifaceted  but  interrelated  objective  vis  vis  subjective  factors.  Before  discussing  the prevalent financial mechanisms available for the SSIs some of the barriers to SSI\'s access to finance are highlighted below.    Barriers to Finance Most formal financial institutions prefer to hold mostly riskfree and highincome generating assets. The SSI lending is unattractive due to an anticipated risk associated with this type of business units. At the same time there is high transaction costs involved in extending smaller chunks  of  loan.  By  nature  the  SSI  sector  is  not  homogeneous  and  therefore  the attractiveness of an enterprise to financial institutions varies with the size of the firm maturity of the firm type industry the firm belongs to and so forth. The basic problems encountered by the  commercial  banks  in  lending  to  SSIs  are  the  bank  capital  adequacy  requirements assessment of the riskbearing exposures and making riskcovering provisions.   Besides  there  are  some  inherent  factors  that  make  SSI  financing  less  motivating  to  the financial  institutions.  One  of  the  main  criteria  for  loan  disbursement  in  the  country  is  the sound financial condition of the company and its economic history. But the SSI units usually do  not  have  credit  history.  This  criterion  poses  an  insurmountable  barrier  to  all  small enterprises that are not in a position to satisfy such condition. Even the ones that were set up a couple  of  years  ago  and  have  good  economic  indicators  find  it  difficult  to  meet  the requirement  as  some  of  the  entrepreneurs\'  underreporting  or  nonreporting  of  the  profit  to avoid taxes. More often than not the companies do not have any business plans or accounting records which they need to attest their turnover. The SSIs cannot make longterm financial projections nor can they guarantee any stable income. In addition when seeking medium or longterm loans SSIs are often not in a position to offer sufficient collaterals that fulfil the requirements of financial institutions.  One of the major hindrances faced the SSIs is the interest rate levels charged the financial institutions.  The  average  lending  rate  ranges  between  14%  and  18%.  According  to entrepreneurs most SSIs cannot afford this rate since their average profit is far lower than ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Volume 16 Number 1  Proceedings of ASBBS   this. Even the interest rate charged by Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC)  which was specially set up to assist the development of such enterprises     ranges between 1012%. In a recent drive the Bangladesh Bank set the lending rate to be 5% plus the  bank  rate  for  the  women  entrepreneurs  with  an  aim  to  encourage  the  latter\'s  enhanced participation  in  economic  activities.  But  the  move  has  not  been  that  successful  till  todate. The  financial  institutions  claim  that  given  the  market  setup  whatever  lending  rates  they charge  is  logical  and  that  the  international  financial  institutions  impose  explicit  conditions concerning  the  market  interest  rate  levels.  Regardless  of  the  high  interest  rate  spread (approximately between 9.5% and 10%) the financial institutions also assert that they face difficulty covering the lending risk their expenses and taxes at lower rate levels. The fact that the  bank  did  not  have  knowledge  of  the  entrepreneur  was  another  frequently  cited  factor. Furthermore evidences showed that the association between loan application and size of the firm remains positive and statistically significant even when location and sector are included [Centre for Development 2001].    Hence for a number of reasons the smallsized enterprises run into many difficulties when they  apply  for  a  bank  loan  or  any  sort  of  credit  facility  from  the  formal  sector.  The  SSIs cannot  even  mobilize  resources  from  the  country\'s  capital  market.  Still  the  most  common sources  of  capital  especially  at  startup  phases  are  savings  and loans  from  the  family  and friends. According to a SEDF survey (2006) 62% SMEs did not approach to formal financial institutions to seek financing.    Over  the  years  some  development  partners  tried  to  assist  the  SSI  sector  along  with  the government.  These  financing  types  are  mainly  used  to  finance  credit  lines  to  SSIs accompanied with technical assistance. The credit line funds are given from donors as soft loans and the government  allocates them to banks to be used  as commercial  loans without harming banking practice and the use of own bank capitals. As a consequence the greater part of financial crediting sources is converted into commercial funds and again the SSI units face difficulties in obtaining those funds.   In brief various studies showed that the most important financial barriers faced by the SSIs are  the  high  cost  of  credit  and  loans;  the  lack  of  access  to  equity  capital;  banks  not  being interested in small firms; the lack of access to venture capital; the delays in obtaining loans; the refusal of bank finance; high collateral requirements; banks    bureaucratic procedures; the cost of preparing a business plan; and too high bank charges and fees.    Existing Financial Mechanisms The SSIs have to rely on a limited range of financial sources and typically rely on their own savings and loans from friends and relatives especially during the startup phase. Institutional credits (mainly from the commercial banks) are available mostly when the firms become larger. Informal lenders and other similar sources traditionally also provide finance for the expansion of the SSIs. Reinvested earnings are also a major source of funds for the fixed capital. From the formal sector the flow of credit to SSIs mainly comes from the Bangladesh Small and Cottage Industries Corporation (BSCIC) nationalized commercial banks (NCBs) development financial institutions (DFIs) private commercial banks (PCBs) and other financial institutions such as nonbank financial institutions (NBFIs). However the foreign commercial banks (FCBs) have very negligible participation in providing credit to SSIs.   Table 3 Scheduled Banks\' Term Loans to SSIs ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Proceedings of ASBBS    Volume 16 Number 1 Banks Nationalized Commercial Banks Private Commercial Banks Foreign Commercial Banks Development Financial Institutions Total  2003 1272.1 1928 0 1120.9 4321 (in million Taka) 2004 2408.8 3011.8 0 1088.4 6509 2005 4968 5785.4 0 1507.2 12260.6 Source Bangladesh Bank (2006)  Financial support to SSIs especially after 1990 is provided through various donors\' project as well  as  from  bank  loans  sidebyside  the  government  assistance  through  the  Bangladesh Bank.  Although  the  earlier  focus  was  on  small  and  cottage  industries  now  the  small  and medium  industries  (SMEs)  are  grouped  together  for  the  purpose  of  providing  financial supports. The SSIs obtain financial supports from either the internal sources (the government the Bangladesh Bank commercial banks or other financial institutions) or the external sources (the  development  partners).  With  regard  to the  financial  instruments  the  experience  shows that in most cases small enterprises require very small loans and are somewhat indifferent to what currency finance is available in. The state owned banks have network branches but lack in skill or commitment to lend to SSIs whereas a greater part of remittances which are only partly intermediated by the banking system directly used to finance consumption while a part is used as startup capital requirements of the SSIs.    In the past the government attempted to provide SSIs with access to finance through targeted lending.  There  was  a  government  directive  that  5  percent  of  a  bank\'s  loan  portfolio  be  set aside  for  small  and  cottage  industry  financing.  However  in  recent  times  the  stakeholders including  the  government  focus  more  the  SME  sector  encompassing  necessarily  the  SSI sector.  Some  of  the  initiatives  by  the  government  the  development  partners  and  various financial  institutions  in  Bangladesh  to  provide  financing  facilities  to  the  SME  sector (including of course the SSI sector) are   (cid137) In  the  budget  for  FY08  that  BSCIC  has  taken  initiatives  to  create  a  Trust  Fund  for providing  industrial  loans  to  which  the  government  will  allocate  Taka  230  million.  In addition an endowment allocation of Taka 1.0 billion has been given to SME Foundation.   (cid137)  The  FY08  budget  also  allocated  credit  support to  the  tune  of  Taka  1.50  billion  for  the development of agrobased industries. This credit will be channelled through Bangladesh Krishi Bank Rajshahi Krishi Unnayan Bank BASIC Bank and Karma Sangsthan Bank.   (cid137)  To  overcome  the  financial  constraints  of  SME  sector  and  persuade  banks  and  other financial institutions to provide credit facilities to this sector the Bangladesh Bank has introduced refinance scheme for from May 2004 using three sources of funds  Taka 100 million of Bangladesh Bank\'s own fund US$ 20 million from International Development Association (IDA) and Taka 30 million from the Asian Development Bank (ADB). So far fourteen banks and twenty nonbank financial institutions have availed this facility to support a total of 7598 SMEs with an assistance of Taka 6.17 billion. And almost eighty percent  of  the  funds  under  these  refinancing  facilities  channelled  to  small  industries. Recently the BB has especially emphasized on making the refinancing facilities available to the women entrepreneurs at a comparatively lower rate.  ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Volume 16 Number 1  Proceedings of ASBBS   (cid137)  Considering the importance of small enterprise financing the SME cell of the Ministry of Industries has announced that 80 percent of total resources available for SME would be allocated specially for small enterprises.  (cid137)  The Equity Entrepreneurship Fund (EEF) of the Bangladesh Bank worth Taka 2 billion has been established in 2000 to provide equity to SMEs in agrobased industry and ICT sector through commercial banks. In budget for FY08 this EEF has been split into two funds namely Agriculture Equity Entrepreneurship Fund and IT Equity Entrepreneurship Fund with an allocation of Taka 1.0 billion for each fund.  (cid137)  The SME cell also decided that BASIC and BRAC bank will be working together as lead banks  and  will  be  responsible  for  distribution  of  credit  and  venture  capital  fund  in  the short run.   (cid137)  BASIC Bank Limited (Bangladesh Small Industries and Commerce Bank Limited) was established  in  1988  with  the  foremost  objective  of  financing  the  small  and  cottage industries (SCI). The Memorandum of Articles of BASIC contains that at least 50 percent of  its  loanable  fund  should  be  invested  in  small  scale  industries.  The  bank  also  offers below market interest rates on SCI lending compared to most other banks.   (cid137)  BSCIC  also  provide  credit  support  for  both  fixed  and  working  capital       but  the  loan amount is not too high like other financing institutions. The credit facilities provided by the  organization  are  selfemployment  through  small  and  cottage  industries  women entrepreneur development programme and poverty reduction through income generation. BSCIC offers loan amount ranging from Taka 50000 to Taka 500000.  (cid137)  The Bangladesh Bank has introduced factoring to ease the working capital problem that will  guarantee  SMEs  to  enjoy  consistent  cash  flow  lower  administration  costs  and reduced credit risks.   (cid137)  Earlier  Sonali  bank  Agrani  Bank  and  Janata  Bank  jointly  started  a  Credit  Guarantee Scheme  with  assistance  from  the  Bangladesh  Bank.  A  substantial  amount  of  loan  was disbursed under this scheme; but much of that loan went to nonviable projects and turned into bad debts.   (cid137)  Some PCBs  such as  BRAC Bank Eastern Bank Dhaka Bank Bank Asia and Premier Bank as well as FCBs such as Standard Chartered Bank and HSBC are currently offering special services styled SME banking.  Besides  the  direct  credit  the  organizations  such  as  "SouthAsia  Enterprise  Development Facility (SEDF)" provides support to partner financial institutions through a combination of technical  assistance  and  policy  related  works  so  that  the  latter  are  able  to  make  financing more readily available for SMEs.    Effectiveness of the Existing Financial Support  Public  institutions  including  the  Bangladesh  Bank  NCBs  and  DFIs  engaged  in  extending loans to the agriculture and industry sectors currently have financing facilities for SMEs the performance  and  effectiveness  of  which  have  been  uneven.  These  facilities  have  varying features and terms. Some of the facilities are targeted at certain industries or subject to limited geographic  coverage.  For  example  the  Bangladesh  Bank   s  Ruralbased  AgroProcessing Industries Refinancing Facility originally set up for Taka 1.5 billion had a low utilization rate  owing  mainly  to  the  restriction  on  use  of  funds  to  agroprocessing  industries  located outside the major cities. Later on the size of the facility was reduced to Taka 0.5 billion and the  rest  Taka  1.0  billion  was  reallocated  to  set  up  the  Small  Enterprise  Fund  (SEF).  The ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Volume 16 Number 1  Proceedings of ASBBS   Entrepreneurship Enterprise Fund was set up by in 2001 as a venture capital fund to coinvest in projects in software food processing and agrobased industries. Since its establishment the utilization rate has not been that much satisfactory. On the other hand some credit facilities provided by NCBs and DFIs impose ceiling on loans to subborrowers in certain sectors such as  agricultural  credit  thus  distorting  interest  rates  and  further  exacerbating  the  vulnerable financial  position  of  these  entities.  There  is  no  indicator  to  measure  the  effectiveness outreach  or  impact  of  these  facilities.  Thus  an  indepth  study  needs  to  be  conducted  to identify  ways  to  rationalize  the  existing  government  assistance  and  to  ensure  efficient  and effective delivery mechanisms.   The credit flow to SSIs by majority banks taken together is not very significant compared to the MLIs. One reason is that the MLIs\' requirement for capital is far greater than that of SSIs. One the other hand as mentioned earlier formal financial institutions prefer to extend credit facilities to bigger firms or to those firms which are gradually expanding and have a viable business record. The available data show that outstanding amount of SSIs is very low as compared to total outstanding. This may be due to the fact that SSIs occasionally approach to the financial institutions for financing as well as small amount of money are disbursed to the SSIs. It has also been observed that classified loans to the SSIs are higher for the DFIs than PCBs or even NCBs. The amount of FCBs\' loans extended to the SSIs is negligible compared to the amount extended to the MLIs and accordingly classified loans on the accounts of SSIs are also minimal. In addition given the fact that the SSIs are now in need of complex financial products there can be an initiative to tie up with various FCBs for providing a wide range of the derivative products.   Various studies and experience suggest that the enabling environment for the growth of SSIs has been limited to official documents only in reality much less has been done to promote the smallindustryoriented industrialization in the country. In addition the environment for the growth of the sector has been somewhat adverse due to the ever increasing competition from other  industrial  units       both  domestic  and  foreign       emerging  from  the  trade  liberalization policies of the government. The protective regime has largely been discontinued leaving the SSIs to stiff competition arising from the influx of foreign goods through both official and unofficial  channels.  It  is  true  that  SSIs  are  afflicted  with  a  number  of  built  in  constraints resulting  from  entrepreneurial  and  managerial  deficiencies.  This  has  also  inhibited  their access  to  formal  credit.  Various  studies  revealed  that  lack  of  working  capital  has  been  the single most important cause among all the external factors that make an industrial unit sick. Although  sickness  in  the  industrial  units  is  not  a  new  phenomenon  as  is  evident  in  the developing  countries  and  an  industrial  unit  may  face  a  number  of  odds  during  its implementation  and  operation  stage  because  of  a  number  of  factors  in  the  environment      internal and external     leading to sickness experience suggests that SSIs are more prone to sickness as compared to medium and large scale industries. The BIDS Sick Industries Study (1998)  revealed  that     small  scale     industries  is  at  the  top  (72.5%)  in  terms  of  incidence  of sickness followed by "medium" and "large" scale industries     19.7% and 4.1% respectively. In bid to strengthen the SCI sector of the country during 2001 the National Association of Small and Cottage Industries of Bangladesh recommended to introduce special credit scheme and  simplified  credit  policy  establish  separate  bank  or  leasing  company  adopt  special measures for sick industries and retain 10 percent of the total industrial credits for SSIs.    The  high  cost  of  fund  is  another  issue  raised  by  the  small  scale  entrepreneurs.  For entrepreneurs though the supply of and access to finance is very important the cost of fund is ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Volume 16 Number 1  Proceedings of ASBBS   also a factor for their sustainability and expansion. Very often it is argued that the interest rate on SSI loan is too high and needs to be lowered. In today\'s liberalized market it is up to the banks and financial institutions to consider the fact that if the rate of interest is too high then the  profitability  of  entrepreneurs  especially  for  those  of  the  innovative  projects  will  be adversely affected. The high cost on SME finance also contradicts the government industrial policy  that  is  committed  to  boost  small  business  sector.  A  recent  study  of  the  SME Foundation had found rates of interests for the SME financing ranged between 14 percent and 22 percent. Interest rates are not declining although many banks and financial institutions are opening separate windows for the SME financing. Such high rates of interests force SMEs especially those involve in manufacturing activities and especially smaller in size to become sick and go out of business. Overseas funds at 2 percent rate and the Bangladesh Bank fund at 5  percent  rate  still  could  not  help  lower  the  lending  rates  for  the  small  entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurs have to pay interest to retail bankers at rates three to four times higher than the rate  offered  by  the  Bangladesh  Bank.  Currently  the  SME  Foundation  is  working  with  the government  to  formulate  guidelines  to  bring  down  interest  rates  to  a  single  digit  for  the SMEs.  Once  enacted  the  SME  credit  wholesaling  guidelines  will  help  banks  and  financial institutions  to  channel  low  cost  finance  in  small  ventures.  Such  guidelines  would  also facilitate the Foundation to work as an apex body such as Palli Karma Sahayak Foundation and  channel  funds  into  small  businesses  more  prudently  through  a  network  of  banks  and NBFIs.  The  SME  Foundation  feels  that  the  proposed  SME  credit  wholesaling  guidelines would enable it to reserve refinancing funds and give it to banks and financial institutions at rates lower than that of the Bangladesh Bank.    FINDING NEW AVENUES SSIs operate in an environment whereby barriers to their establishment and growth are very evident. Strengthening the financial sector is one of the most important issues for enabling SSIs  to  perform  successfully.  Most  of  the  commercial  banks  as  well  as  other  financial institutions are somewhat reluctant to provide loans from own funds to SSIs due to the high credit  risk  associated  with  such  lendings.  To  overcome  this  problem  a  mechanism  can  be devised to set up a special insurance scheme with funds from the government donors and even may be contributions from local financial institutions. This fund can be used to cover say 70% of the risks. Though there already exist various guaranteed financing mechanisms for the SSIs their implementations have to be enhanced to opt for the desired level of success. It  is  argued  that  differences  in  the  financial  institution  structure  and  lending  infrastructure significantly  affect  the  availability  of  funds  to  SSIs  by  affecting  the  feasibility  with  which financial  institutions  may  employ  the  different  lending  technologies  in  which  they  have comparative  advantages  to  provide  funds  to  different  types  of  SSIs.  Ahmed  [2006]  argued that  financial  services  for  the  poor  have  proved  to  be  a  powerful  instrument  for  poverty reduction enabling the poor to build assets increase incomes and reduce the vulnerability to economic stress. However while formulating effective financing mechanisms for the SSIs the following three issues need to be considered              To highlight the most effective SSI finance practices and programs especially in the region and to inform both private and public sector institutions about the impact of these policies and practices  To properly implement innovative SSI finance policies and vehicles  To identify mechanisms to solve common SSI finance obstacles and encourage SSI development  It is generally recognized that guaranteed schemes is various forms are required by the SSIs along  with  customized  financial  products.  The  SSIs  are  in  especial  need  for  longerterm resources. The Bangladesh Bank propagated some options for enhancing financial facilities to ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Volume 16 Number 1  Proceedings of ASBBS   the SME sector of the country [Box1] which are also applicable for the SSIs. In addition banks  and  financial  institutions  can  be  encouraged  to  offer  more  and  more  innovative financial products such as factoring venture capital etc. However the SSI entrepreneurs as well  as  the  financial  instruments  providers  should  be  well  acquainted  with  such  products. Academicians and experts time and again opined for a dedicated new financial institution for SME which will also look after the SSIs to provide sufficient longterm lowinterest funds with liberal terms of collateral.   Box1 Enhancing SME Funding the SMEs financially which can be used as a subsidy.  Lack of efficient interbank market to channel excess liquidity lack of legal framework for development of alternatives for longterm financing such as securitized debt securities lack of term funds at reasonable interest rates high interest rates offered for government bonds often crowd  out  longterm  borrowing  for  SMEs  by  Financial  institutions.  The  following  factors deserve consideration       Like the developed countries government can use grants as a major instrument to support      Government  can  provide  credit  guarantee  schemes  to  SMEs  that  is  a  common  feature both  in  developed  and  developing  countries.  Such  guarantee  ensures  repayment  of  any default loan taken by an SME.       Government  can  directly  guarantees  loans  up  to  a  certain  limit  to  small  businesses  to purchase  land  buildings  or  equipment.  Loans  may  be  made  through  banks  or  other financial institutions.       By  implementing  analytical  software  like  credit  scoring  model  based  on  available  data from  reliable  sources  banks  and  financial  institutions  can  provide  loans  to  SMEs  with growth potential and good track record.  In  case  of  providing  refinance  to  the  banks  and  NBFIs  government  should  have  some directives related to collateral requirement and high interest rate.     Source Financial Sector Review Bangladesh Bank   CONCLUSION Financing SSIs is one of the key prerequisites for the achievement of growth of the sector. Evidences  from  around  the  world demonstrate  that  access  to  finance  is  a  key  problem  that much of the private sector and in particular the smallest enterprises face in both developed and developing countries. In case of Bangladesh also the small entrepreneurs  both entrants and  existing  entrepreneurs    significantly  face  obstacles  in  relation  to  the  cost  and  lack  of access to investment capital in spite of the efforts which have been made to alleviate them. To maximise the benefits of financial structures the provision of finance should be accompanied by  parallel  efforts  to  improve  the  investment  climate  and  to  develop  other  SSI  support services. This paper does not however propose for generous assistance to be provided to the SSIs.  Various  studies  revealed  that  financial  opportunities  or  higher  effective  rates  of assistance  provided  earlier  to  the  SSIs  have  contributed  to  the  inefficiency  in  the  sector. Hence a wellorchestrated financial mechanism supported by other support services such as promotional  human  resources  development  and  so  forth  are  required  to  foster  an  enabling environment for the SSI sector. Recognizing this fact the Industrial Policy 2005 stated that conduct  a  survey  to  determine  the  demand  in  the  local  market  of  goods  produced  in  sick industries as a primary step towards the rehabilitation and development of those industries. In view of competition in the local market take action to reduce the production cost of goods in  sick  industries  in  a  costeffective  way  so  that  the  qualitative  standards  of  goods  and productivity are ensured.  Informal  financial  institutions  still  play  an  important  role  in  many  developing  countries. Particularly in the rural areas they importance is higher. For the formal financial institutions ASBBS Annual Conference Las Vegas  February 2009   Volume 16 Number 1  Proceedings of ASBBS   the market presence of different types of institutions and the competition among them have important effects on SSI credit availability because institutions of different types may have comparative  advantages  in  different  lending  technologies.  On  the  other  hand  the  lending infrastructure       the  information  environment  the  legal  the  judicial  and  bankruptcy environment  and  the  tax  and  regulatory  environments       may  directly  affect  SSI  credit availability by affecting the extent to which the different lending technologies may be legally and profitably employed. The lending infrastructure may also restrict SSI credit availability indirectly  by  constraining  the  potential  financial  institution  structure  through  a  restrictive regulatory environment. Ahmed  [2004] argued that  the SMEs  are unwelcome customers to the profit seeking and collateral oriented commercial banks even when there is credit boom and availability of loanable funds is not any constraint. From the discussion it can concluded by saying that the financing mechanisms required by the SSIs do exist although there is still scope for more innovative and customized products what is now required is their effective implementation and a system to monitor that effectiveness.
