This study examines how the finance gap for SMEs might be addressed by means of policies to support other financing initiatives other than commercial finance by  the  conventional  financial  institutions. This  study  through  a questionnaire  survey  investigates the awareness and use of these various financing schemes (quasicommercial credit) available to the  SME  sector.  The  study  also  ascertains  the  difficulties  SMEs  encounter  in  accessing  these  financing  sources.  The  results  of  the  study  reveal  low  awareness  and  usage  levels  of  the  various financing  initiatives  among  SMEs.  Most  of  the  schemes  are  perceived  as  difficult  to  access.  A number of specific action areas have been identified for proactive public policy for small business finance in Ghana.Key words financing initiatives SMEs policy Ghana. JEL Classifications M13 G30. 1. Introduction Access to finance has been identified as a dominant constraint facing SMEs (Lader 1996). A World Bank study found that about 90% of small enterprises surveyed stated that credit was a major constraint to new investment (Parker et al. 1995). Levy (1993) also found that there is limited access to financial resources available to smaller enterprises compared to larger organizations and the consequences for their low growth and development. This stems from the fact that SMEs have limited access  to  capital  markets  partly  due  to  the  perception  of  higher  risk  informational  barriers  and  the higher costs of intermediation for smaller firms. In SubSaharan Africa most small businesses fail in their first year due to lack of support from government and traditional banks (Biekpe 2004).  In Ghana the idea that problems in financing small firms have significantly hindered the role they play in the overall macroeconomic performance of the Ghanaian economy is deeply rooted since the overthrow of the first Republic of Dr. Nkrumah (Boapeah 1993). Previous studies have identified a growing  gap  in  the  financial  support  offered  to  Ghanaian  SMEs.  The  high  interest  rates  collateral requirements and the cumbersome processes have often been mentioned as the main impediments to SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to bank loans in Ghana (see Sowa et al. 1992; Aryeetey et al. 1994; Bigsten et al. 2000; Buatsi 2002). These studies however focused mainly on the difficulties SMEs face in accessing commercial credit from conventional banks and other financial institutions. The present study examines how the finance gap for SMEs might be addressed by means of policies to support other financing initiatives other than commercial finance by the conventional financial  institutions.  The  study  seeks  to  investigate  the  awareness  and use  of  these various  financing schemes  (quasicommercial  credit)  available  to  SMEs  in  Ghana.  The  issue  is  of  critical  significance  given  the  important  role  SMEs  play  in  the  Ghanaian  economy.  SMEs  have  been  noted  to contribute  about  85%  of  manufacturing  employment  (Steel  and  Webster  1991).  They  represent about 80% of the private sector and also account for about 92% of businesses in Ghana. For the current Ghana government\\xe2\\x80\\x99s slogan of \\xe2\\x80\\x9cGolden Age of Business\\xe2\\x80\\x9d to succeed and for the country to reach the per capita income of US $1000 by 2012 there is the need to steadily increase the rate of economic growth from the present level of 45% to 710%. Given that SMEs represent a vast portion  of  the  firm  tissue  in  Ghana  they  have  an  important  role  to  play  in  spurring  growth.                                                           1  This  paper  was  initially  presented  at  the  Second  African  Finance  Journal  Conference  at  the  University  of  Stellenbosch Business School Cape Town South Africa July 2005. \\xc2\\xa9 Joshua Abor Nicholas Biekpe 2006 69\\x0cProblems and Perspectives in Management / Volume 4 Issue 3 2006 The structure of the remainder of the paper is as follows The second section provides a review of the literature on small business finance. The following section explains the methodology employed for  the  study.  The  empirical  results  are  presented  and  discussed  in  the  fourth  section.  The  final section concludes the discussion and also provides policy recommendations in addressing the SME finance gap. 1.1. Overview of SME Development in Ghana The idea of SME promotion has been in existence since 1970 though very little was done at the time. Key  institutions  were  set  up  to  assist  SMEs  and  prominent  among  them  are  the  Office  of Business  Promotion  and  the  present  Ghana  Enterprise  Development  Commission  (GEDC). The main objective of GEDC was to assist Ghanaian businessmen to enter into fields where foreigners mainly operated. It also had packages for strengthening small scale industry in general both technically and financially (Kayanula and Quartey 2000).  The Economic Recovery Programme (ERP) instituted in 1983 has broadened the institutional support  for  SMEs.  The  National  Board  for  Small  Scale  Industries  (NBSSI)  was  also  established within the Ministry of Industry Science and Technology to address the needs of small businesses. The NBSSI established an Entrepreneurial Development Programme intended to train and assist persons with entrepreneurial abilities into self employment.  In 1987 the industrial sector also witnessed  the  coming  into  operation  of  the  Ghana  Appropriate  Technology  Industrial  Service (GRATIS).  It was to supervise the operations of Intermediate Technology Transfer Units (ITTUs) in the country.  GRATIS aims at upgrading small scale industrial concerns by transferring appropriate  technology  to  small  scale  and  informal  industries  at  the  grass  root  level.  ITTUs  in  the  regions  are  intended  to  develop  the  engineering  abilities  of  small  scale  manufacturing  and  service industries engaged in vehicle repairs and other related trades.  They are also to address the needs of nonengineering  industries  (Kayanula  and  Quartey  2000). The  setting  up  of  the  new  Ministry for Private Sector Development by the current government is also an attempt to focus on the development of the SME sector. The most significant institutional weakness facing dynamic SMEs is their lack of access to external  finance.  Repressive  financial  policies  in  the  past  especially  low  interest  and  a  monopolistic banking system minimized the interest of banks in developing this market. To reverse the consequences of these practices a combination of financial liberalization and institutional reform was in order (Aryeetey et al. 1994). In view of the relatively low level of response from the private sector to early ERP reform measures the focus was on the liberalization of various sectors including the financial sector under the Financial Sector Adjustment Programme (FINSAP). Under the FINSAP direct institutional measures  aimed  at  supporting  small  enterprises  were  also  been  put  in  place.  With  World  Bank  assistance the Programme of Action to Mitigate the Social Costs of Adjustment (PAMSCAD) created a special fund to assist microenterprises and the Fund for Small and Medium Enterprises Development  (FUSMED)  was  initiated  to  increase  the  amount  of  credit  available  to  SMEs  through commercial and development banks. This was based on the presumption that poor availability of credit from formal sources was one of the major reasons why the private sector investment had not grown as expected. A major argument was that small firms with good growth potential were being discriminated  against  (Aryeetey  et  al.  1994).  At  the  same  time  however  the  effectiveness  of many similar SME credit was being called in question (Webster 1991). There are currently a number of financing schemes set up by government and the donor agencies available to the SME sector including Private Enterprises and Export Development Fund Export Development  and  Investment  Fund  Deutsche  Gesellschaft  Fuer  Technische  Zusammenarbeit (GTZ)  Business  Assistance  Fund  Ghana  Investment  Fund  Trade  and  Investment  Programme Africa Project Development Facility Support for Private Enterprise Expansion and Development Promotion of Small and Micro Enterprise Fund Business Sector Programme Support Revolving 70\\x0cProblems and Perspectives in Management / Volume 4 Issue 3 2006 Loan  Fund  Ghana  Private  Sector  Development  Fund  etc.  Inspite  of  these  developments  the  finance gap continues to be a major problem to SME development in Ghana. 2. Literature on Small Business Financing The  extant  literature  is  clear  on  the  fact  that  small  businesses  mostly  have  problems  accessing funds  from  finance  providers  to  finance  fixed  assets  and  working  capital  for  their  operations (Tucker and Lean 2003). The presence and nature of a \\xe2\\x80\\x98finance gap\\xe2\\x80\\x99 for small firms has been debated for decades ever since the Macmillan Report (Macmillan 1931). According to Blanton and Dorman (1994) small firms  are frequently undercapitalized. That is the term structure of loans granted  to  SMEs  does  not  suit  their  needs.  Blanton  and  Dorman  (1994)  argue  that  even  when SMEs are given credit they are often granted shortterm loans and therefore they have no option but to depend on shortterm and informal credits in financing their longterm needs such as acquiring new equipments (Riding and Short 1987).  The presence of the \\xe2\\x80\\x98finance gap\\xe2\\x80\\x99 is mainly a result of the existence of information asymmetries between finance providers and borrowers. Information asymmetries refer to the disparity between the information available to businesses seeking capital and suppliers of capital who are typically assumed  to  be  at  an  informational  disadvantage  with  respect  to  insiders  of  the  business  (Stiglitz and Weiss 1981; Bester 1987). Privately held firms do not publish the same quantity or quality of financial information that publicly held firms are required to produce. As a result information on their financial condition earnings and earnings prospects may be incomplete or inaccurate. Faced with this type of uncertainty a lender may deny credit sometimes to firms that are creditworthy but unable to document it (Coleman 2000). In a perfect markets setting with perfect and costless information available to both the small firm (i.e. the agent) and the finance provider (i.e. the principal)  and  no  uncertainties  regarding  present  and  future  trading  conditions  the  principalagent relationship does not suffer from the market failure of information asymmetry. However information  in  the  real  world  is  neither  perfect  nor  costless  and  additionally  the  small  business  finance market is characterized by risk and uncertainty regarding future conditions. Information is distributed asymmetrically between the bank or finance provider and the firm (Tucker and Lean 2003).  Important  issues  identified  within  the  context  of  informational  asymmetry  are  adverse  selection and moral hazard. Under adverse selection theoretical models often assume that an entrepreneur has  private  knowledge  about  the  success  probability  of  a  project  or expected  profits  that  are  not shared with the financier. Consequently suppliers of capital cannot differentiate between a highquality business and a lowquality business and adverse selection can result. Moral hazard refers to the  inability  of  the  finance  provider  to  control  fully  how  the  entrepreneur  uses  funds  provided. Owners can conceivably benefit economically by for example redirecting borrowed funds to invest  in  higher  risk  projects  than  those  approved  by  the  lender  (Stiglitz  and  Weiss  1981;  Bester 1987; Bester and Hellwig 1989; Binks and Ennew 1996). To avoid this situation financiers can implement contract provisions that discourage borrowers from acting against the interests of investor or lender and these precautionary actions can lead to credit rationing. Certain types of moral hazard play a role in the costly monitoring problem but these moral hazard problems do not affect the outcome of the entrepreneur\\xe2\\x80\\x99s projects. Instead moral hazard affects costly monitoring problems by adding the risk that entrepreneurs will lie about their returns and profit at the expense of the finance provider (Stiglitz and Weiss 1981; Binks and Ennew 1996).  The provision of collateral and reputation (track record) can lessen the problem of adverse selection  and  moral  hazard.  Low  risk  borrowers  (who  would  otherwise  leave  the  market  due  to  high interest rates) can signal their status through the provision of adequate collateral and good reputation. With their assets at stake as collateral firms will be motivated to perform to the best of their abilities. In this context lack of collateral and reputation may lead to a firm being denied credit. To the extent that small firms possess less collateral and reputation than large firms they may face yet  greater  difficulty  raising  capital  than  do  large  firms.  Worse  still  since  there  is  considerable uncertainty surrounding the survival and growth of SMEs their assetbacked collateral are usually 71\\x0cProblems and Perspectives in Management / Volume 4 Issue 3 2006 valued at \\xe2\\x80\\x98carcass value\\xe2\\x80\\x99 to ensure that the loan is realistically covered in case of default and immediate  realization  (Binks  et  al.  1992).  This  implies  that  the  already  disadvantaged  small  firms may even need proportionately more collateral than do large firms.  It is also important to note that the motives and objectives of the ownermanager can greatly influence an SME\\xe2\\x80\\x99s ability to secure external finance. Ownermanagers are often unwilling to provide their  personal  assets  as  collateral.  Besides  many  SMEs  have  objectives  other  than  growth  as  a priority (Tucker and Lean 2003). Binks and Ennew (1996) however argue that many small firms will be forced to provide yield expansion to protect their limited liability status (which would otherwise be eroded by the provision of personal assets as loan collateral). One main motive for starting a small business is to maintain greater control over the operation of the business and to internalize the benefits of personal effort and risktaking. In this regard then it is understandable that many  SME  managers  would  not  tolerate  any  dilution  of  this  control  through  the  introduction  of outside equity. Thus the motives of ownermanagers of SMEs may constitute a major constraint on the range of external financing sources available to the firm (Tucker and Lean 2003).  3. Research Methodology In order to ascertain the potential role of government policy to support other financing initiatives it is imperative to determine the use and awareness of the various financing sources available to the  SME  sector  and  also  to  investigate  issues  that  are  of  importance  to  SME  financing.  A  questionnaire survey was carried out based on a sample of 200 firms drawn from the database of the National  Board  for  Small  Scale  Industries  and  that  of  the  Association  of  Ghana  Industries.  The sample selection was based on criteria set by Regional Project on Enterprise Development (RPED) for SMEs in Ghana. That means firms with employee size of less than 100 were included in the study sample. The firms were also drawn from all industrial sectors in Ghana. Pretesting exercises were done to inform the shaping of the final field questionnaire. This was particularly important given the often sensitive nature of such questions. The field survey was carried out between January 2005 and September 2005. Out of the total of 200  questionnaires  125  were  received  from  respondents  representing  a  response  rate  of  62.5%. The resulting response rate is high for a survey of this type considering that empirical studies involving SMEs have been known to generate far lesser percentage response rates. In order to determine the perception of ease of accessing the financing schemes responses were measured with a fivepoint Likert rating scale where very difficult = 1 and very easy = 5. Data obtained from respondents was entered into an "SPSS" database application for analysis. Descriptive statistics were used in the presentation and analysis of empirical results.  4. Discussion of Results 4.1. Characteristics of Sampled Firms Table 1 presents the characteristics of the firms based on industry classification size age and trade status. All in all five industries were represented including agriculture representing 3.2% of valid respondents  manufacturing  (64%)  mining  and  construction  (8.0%)  trading  (5.6%)  and  general services (19.2%). Three size categories were defined on the basis of number of employees. Firms with less than 5 employees were classified as micro firms. Those with between 5 and 29 employees  were  classified  as  small  firms  and  medium  sized  firms  had  between  30  and  99  employees. About 4 (3.2%) of the firms surveyed were in the microenterprise group 75 (60.0%) were small firms and 46 (36.8%) were mediumsized companies. The firms were also categorized on the basis of date of establishment. Firms which have been in business for less than 1 year were labeled as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cinfant\\xe2\\x80\\x9d those  between 1  and 5 years were classified as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cyoung\\xe2\\x80\\x9d those with between 6 and 10 years were classified as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cadult\\xe2\\x80\\x9d and those with over 10 years were also labeled as \\xe2\\x80\\x9cmature\\xe2\\x80\\x9d.  There were 3 infant businesses representing 2.4% of the sample. Twenty three firms were young firms representing 18.4% of the sample adult firms were 35 representing 28.0% while mature compa72\\x0cProblems and Perspectives in Management / Volume 4 Issue 3 2006 nies were 64 representing 51.2%. Majority of the firms were male (64%) and Ghanaian (91.2%) owned. Only 52 representing 41.6% of the sampled SMEs were found to be exporters.

Key Findings Table 2 illustrates the awareness among the firms of the various financing schemes. Most of the firms are unaware of these financing schemes. Apart from EGF and DANIDA less than 50% of the respondents are aware of the other financing schemes. This is particularly surprising given the problems  SMEs  face  in  accessing  loans  from  commercial  banks.  Since  most  (79.2%)  of  these firms have been in business for over fives years one would have expected that they would be reasonably aware of other financing schemes available to the SME sector aside from bank financing. The  low  level of  awareness may  be  due  to  inadequate  and  ineffective marketing  communication implemented  by  these  finance  providers.  Most  of  these  schemes  apart  from  initially  touring  the country to launch their programmes in the regional capitals they do not intensify their marketing communication efforts to get SMEs aware of these financing schemes.  The small budget mostly assigned to administering these schemes by the donors could account for this problem. 73\\x0cProblems and Perspectives in Management / Volume 4 Issue 3 2006 Awareness of the Various Financing Schemes Financing Scheme                                      EMPRETEC Ghana Foundation (EGF)            Danish International Devt.

The  results generally show a very low dependence on these sources of financing. Among the sampled firms less than 10% have been successful in obtaining finance from each of these schemes. This simply reflects the fact that the sample contains a high proportion of firms (mostly over 50%) that are unaware of these financing schemes. Another reason may be the stringent eligibility criteria that make it difficult for SMEs to access these funds. The low use of the various financing schemes is not particularly encouraging since SMEs in Ghana do not have easy access to other sources such as bank loans.

The most common difficulty (26.4% of respondents) was the lack of securable assets required by finance providers. Most of these schemes are  routed through the banks who also review applications using their criteria such as collateral requirement. The essence of involving the banks  is  to  avoid  the  credit  risk  involved  in  lending  to  SMEs.  Some  (22.4%)  indicated  that  the lack of knowledge by finance providers about the nature of the respondent\\xe2\\x80\\x99s business was a problem while 16.8% mentioned that they did not meet the eligibility criteria for accessing the finance. A number of firms (15.2%) however admitted their lack of knowledge about lending criteria used by providers which represent a difficulty in accessing finance and others (12%) also admitted that they  had  difficulty  finding  out  about  available  finance.  Bureaucracy  and  delayed  processing  of applicants proposals were also identified as difficulties by some respondents (12%). Eleven (8.8%) mentioned the lack of financial performance track record as a problem. This should not be strange for startup businesses. A few (3.2%) also indicated the problem of high interest rates.

Conclusion and Policy Recommendations SMEs play an important role in the development of the Ghanaian economy. However their level of growth is often hampered by the limited access to finance. This paper sets out to investigate the awareness  and  use  of  the  various  financing  schemes  (quasicommercial  credit)  available  to  the Ghanaian SME sector. The results of this study reveal low awareness and usage levels of the various  financing  initiatives  among  SMEs.  Most  of  the  schemes  are  perceived  as  difficult  to  access. The difficulties SMEs often face in accessing these funds include lack of securable assets lack of knowledge by finance providers about the nature of respondents business stringent eligibility criteria  lack  of  knowledge  about  lending  criteria  difficulty  in  finding  out  about  available  finance and bureaucracy. These really limit SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 ability to access funds from these initiatives. In the light of the key findings policy actions should include better information provision regarding  the  various  sources  of  finance.  This  could  involve  the  financing  initiatives  pursuing  a  more aggressive  and  continuous  marketing  communication  campaign  to  inform  SMEs  of  the  various financing schemes available to the sector. Eligibility criteria should be made a bit more flexible to enable more SMEs to qualify for access to these funds. Routing these facilities through the commercial banks should be reconsidered. Evaluation of applicants\\xe2\\x80\\x99 proposals could be done by qualified consultants affiliated to these schemes and the banks should rather be appointed as managers of  the  loan  facilities  for  a  fee.  In  that  case  government  bears  the  credit  risk.  This  could  further expedite processing and give applicants a better chance of accessing these facilities.  Policy makers would have to place greater emphasis on facilitating equity capital. Equity capital provides a base for further borrowing reduces businesses\\xe2\\x80\\x99 sensitivity to economic cycles and provides SMEs with access to syndicates of private and institutional venture capital suppliers. There could also be policies aimed at encouraging SMEs to access public equity capital through the reduction of listing requirements and subsidizing flotation cost. These policy prescriptions could go a long way to improve Ghanaian SMEs\\xe2\\x80\\x99 access to longterm financing to spur up growth.  References 1. Aryeetey  E.  BaahNuakoh  A.  Duggleby  T.
