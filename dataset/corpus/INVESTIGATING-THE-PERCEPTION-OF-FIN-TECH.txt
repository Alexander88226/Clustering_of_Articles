Financial technologies (FinTechs) have become an important member of the financial scenario but their relationship with traditional banks nowadays is still not well  defined.  Some  members  of  the  financial  services  industry  see  the flourishing  of  FinTech  as  a  threat  to  the  traditional  banking  industry whereas others believe that FinTech  has become a challenge  that can be turned  into  an  opportunity.  The  perception  FinTech  companies  have  of themselves  is  essential  to  understand  the  strategy  they  will  adopt  in  both shortterm  and  longterm.  Furthermore  the  perception  banks  themselves have of FinTechs is also crucial for future strategic cooperation.  Consequently  the  purpose  of  this  research  is  to  investigate  how  the perception  of  FinTechs  impacts  their  strategic  positioning  in  the  market. This  is  going  to  be  examined  from  two  different  perspectives  traditional banks and FinTechs. The research will lead to a better understanding of FinTechs positioning in the market in both shortrun and longrun.  Semistructured interviews will be held within FinTechs and Bank. The first step will be to interview expert operating in the banking sector to investigate their perception of FinTechs. The second step will be to interview FinTechs specialists and understand how FinTechs perceive themselves in the market and how this perception affects their collaborations with Traditional Banks.

Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  7 1  INTRODUCTION Chapter one intends to give a first framework of the thesis content. The growing importance of innovation  and  the  latest  developments  in  technologies  have  affected  the  banking  industry (Rom  nova & Kudinska 2016) for this reason it is important to examine the behavior of FinTech companies in the Banking Industry. Consequently the theory of disrupted innovation is introduced with the main aim to understand if FinTechs are sustaining or disrupted innovators. Moreover  this  chapter  describes  the  research  question  which  aims  to  investigate  how  the perception of FinTechs impacts their strategic positioning in the market in both the short and long  run.  Finally  purpose  and  contributions  will  be  presented  as  well  as  limitation  and boundaries of the research.    1.1  BACKGROUND  The introduction of the most recent digital developments in the banking industry have seen the flourishing of new members. Financial Technologies (FinTechs) have the potential to reshape the financial industry by cutting costs improving the quality of financial services and creating a more diverse and stable financial landscape (The FinTech Revolution 2015). Even if FinTechs  have become an  important member  of the  financial scenario  their relationship with traditional banks is still not well defined as well as their position in the market. Thus it is necessary to analyze the perception of FinTechs in the market and the extent of innovation they are bringing to this field. Clayton Christensen developed a framework for evaluating those innovations  and  choosing  the  most  suitable  business  strategies  to  respond  to  technological changes (Hungenberg Koening Jelassi & Enders 2007). By doing so he defines two different types of innovation sustaining innovation and disruptive innovation.    Sustaining innovations generate growth by offering a better performance in existing markets. Usually regardless of whether they are incremental or radical these innovations are exploited successfully by the established players in an industry and do not lead to revolutionary changes in an industry   s landscape. On the other hand disruptive innovations initially have a lower performance in the traditionally most important performance criterion (such as functionality speed or size). Even though in most cases disruptive innovations are less complex from a technological viewpoint they are usually brought to the markets successfully by new entrants    (Hungenberg et al. 2007 p. 67).   Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  8 FinTechs    innovative potential will be analyzed in this research with a focus on the perception Fintech have of themselves as well the perception traditional banks have of FinTech. The aim is to understand if they represent a challenge or an opportunity for banks. Indeed    some members  of  the  financial  services  industry  see  the  boom  in  FinTech  as  a  threat  to  the traditional banking industry. Others believe that FinTech has become a challenge that can be turned into an opportunity as it provides more flexibility better functionality in some areas and aggregation of services    (Rom  nova & Kudinska 2016 p. 21).  Thus the temporal dimension will be taken into consideration as well. In fact short and long term  perception  is  essential  for  understanding  the  FinTechs     strategic  positioning  in  the market.  Chris  Rentner  founder  and  the  CEO  of  Akouba  said  about  FinTech  companies    Phase one may be to partner with banks but phase two is to infiltrate bank customer bases at every level (   ). They are not going to stay niche players    (North Western Financial Review 2016 p. 16).   1.2  PROBLEM STATEMENT  This  study  is  set  up  to  address  the  question  of  how  FinTechs     perception  in  the  banking industry can influence their strategy? The structure used to build the research question can be divided  into  three  main  parts  disruptive  innovation  financial  technologies  and  banking industry.  Perception of Fintechs in the Banking IndustryDisruptive Innovation TheoryBanking            Industry Financial  TechnologiesSustaining InnovatorsDisruptive InnovatorsCompetitors or Partners Opportunity or ThreatDefinition of FinTechsPerception in the MarketFigure 1 Perception of FinTechs in the Banking Industry three main parts. Own source  Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  9 Regarding the first one disruptive innovation theory (DIT) the main aim is to understand if FinTechs  are  having  a  disruptive  nature  by  reshaping  the  banking  industry  or  if  they  are simply actors that aim to improve the existing services offered by traditional banks. In fact many researchers and practitioners believe that FinTech can reshape the future of the financial services industry whereas others are skeptical about their adoption (Ryu 2018).  The second one the banking industry will explore possible cooperation between Banks and FinTechs. The difficulty is to understand the competitive and collaborative dynamics in the FinTech innovation (Drasch Schweizer & Urbach 2018).  Lastly financials technologies have as the main aim to comprehend the perception FinTechs have on themselves in the banking industry as well as the perception Banks have of FinTechs. Indeed it is not possible to define FinTech companies on the basis of its use in legislation or legal documents. FinTechs have different kinds of legal and regulatory obligations due to their differing  business  models  and  the  extremely  diverse  products  and  services  they  offer (Dorfleitner Hornuf Schmitt & Weber 2017).  In fact it will be helpful to understand if FinTechs and banks consider FinTechs as banks or as technology companies. All three sections will be analyzed from both the short and long run dimensions to understand the current situation and predict the future effects FinTechs will have on the banking industry.    1.3  RESEARCH GAP AND CONTRIBUTION Nowadays there is no specific agreement on the term FinTechs. (Dorfleitner et. al. 2017). Moreover their position in the market is not well defined neither their belonging to the banking sector. Built on previous research and the abovementioned problem statement the purpose of this study is to investigate    How the perception of Financial Technologies    (FinTechs) in the banking industry can influence their strategy in both short and long run?    Specifically the aim is to contribute to the current theoretical framework with a  qualitative study  that  will  help  us  to  understand  if  FinTechs  are  sustaining  or  disruptive  innovators. Moreover it will enable members of the Banking Industry to comprehend short and long run strategic intention of FinTech companies as well as the possibility to understand if FinTechs place themselves as competitors of banks or as merely partners. Additionally this research will allow a better definition of the terms FinTech.  The study is focusing on the general market where FinTechs are operating there is no specific focus  on  one  country  or  continent.  This  choice  was  taken  as  the  FinTech  phenomenon  is  Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  10 lacking in academic papers in specific areas or countries. Furthermore the adoption of FinTech companies are still at a relative infancy around all over the world (EY Fintech Adoption Index 2015). Further limitations of the study will be better examined during the last stage of the research when all the possible variable will be identified.    1.4  STRUCTURE  In order to introduce the topic a systematic literature review on Disruptive Innovation Theory (DIT) Banking Industry and Financial Technologies are presented. A theoretical framework follows  that  will  largely  describe  reasons  this  research  question  exists  as  well  as  a  deep analysis of theories and useful definitions used in the study will be illustrated.  Subsequently chapter three will define the research question and the assumptions implied. The research is based on a qualitative research method which implies semistructured interviews for both Traditional Banks    Experts and Financial Technologies. Moreover a list of FinTech companies contacted as well as the method used to gather interview contacts will be broadly explained. The final chapters provide the reader with results and conclusions of the research.

The  word  FinTechs  is  a  contraction  of     financial  technology     but currently there is not a universally accepted definition of this term (Dorfleitner et. al. 2017).  A scientific definition extracted from a process of reviewing more than 200 articles containing the  term  FinTech  and  covering  a  period  of  more  than  40  years  says     FinTech  is  a  new financial industry that applies technology to improve financial activities    (Patrick Schueffel 2016 p. 15). Another definition describes FinTechs as    technologically enabled  financial innovation that could result in new business models applications processes or products with an associated material effect on financial markets and institutions and the provision of financial services   . (Financial Stability Board 2017 p. 7). Even  if  at  the  moment  there  is  no  general  agreement  on  a  definition  nor  universal understanding the investments in those companies have been phenomenal (Lee & Shin 2018). According to KPMG (2018) global investments in FinTech companies during the first half of 2018  hit  $579  billion.  This  number  across  venture  capital  (VC)  private  equity  (PE)  and merger and acquisition (M&A) already exceed the total amount of FinTechs funding seen in 2017.  Anton  Ruddenklau  Global  CoLeader  of  FinTechs  KPMG  International  says     We continue to see technology giants around the world explore collaborate and invest in FinTech related opportunities    (KPMG 2018 p. 8).   Figure 2 Global investment activities in FinTech companies. Source Pulse of Fintech 2018  Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  20 The leading country in FinTech startups is China as it dominates the FinTech landscape by representing five of the Top ten FinTechs companies in 2017 (Fintech100 KMPG 2017). This data follows the trend from previous years as Chinese incumbents scale the world FinTech environment  with  an  emphasis  on  payments  and  insurance.  Moreover  the  EY  FinTech Adoption  Index  studies  the  percentage  of  digitally  active  population  using  FinTech.  The average adoption of FinTechs across twenty different markets is 33% and the leading country is again China followed by India and UK (EY Fintech Adoption Index 2017).  According to this data it is clear that FinTech has become a major player in the financial world (Lee & Shin 2018) but let   s analyze deeper the types of FinTech companies existing in the  market.  Nowadays  there  are  six  different  FinTech  business  models  implemented  as illustrated below (Lee & Shin 2018).   sledoM ssenisuBhceTniF Payment Business ModelWealth ManagementBusiness Model CrowdfundingBusiness ModelLending Bunsiness Model Capital MarketBusiness Model Insurance ServicesBusiness Model  Figure 3 FinTech Business Models Six business model operating in the market. Own source   FinTech companies offering payment experiences acquire customers rapidly and at a lower cost than banks and are one of the fastest growing in terms of innovation and adoption of new payment capabilities. Moreover those FinTechs improve the customer experience in terms of speed convenience and multichannel accessibility. In fact payments are one of the most used financial services on a daytoday basis as well as one of the least regulated (Lee & Shin  Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  21 2018).  This  business  model  includes  mobile  wallets  peertopeer  (P2P)  mobile  payments foreign exchange realtime payments and digital currency solutions (BNY Melon 2015).  A different business model is given by wealth management. The most famous example regards automated wealth managers (robotadvisors) and provides financial advice for a fraction of the price  of  a  reallife  adviser.  These  robotadvisors  suggest  a  mix  of  assets  to  invest  using algorithms and based on a customer   s investment characteristics and preferences (Lee & Shin 2018). Differently crowdfunding FinTechs enable networks of people to control the creation of new products media and ideas.  The most popular crowdfunding business models are rewardsbased crowdfunding donationbased crowdfunding and equitybased crowdfunding (Lee & Shin 2018).  Another tendency in FinTech is P2P consumer lending and P2P business lending that allows individuals and businesses to lend and borrow between each other. The main characteristics of this model are lowinterest rates and an improved lending process for lenders and borrowers. Moreover FinTechs are technically not involved in the lending themselves as they are simply matching lenders with borrowers and this represents a huge difference from a bank. (Lee & Shin 2018).  Some  other  new  FinTech  businesses  are  operating  in  some  capital  market  areas  such  as investment foreign exchange trading risk management and research. The most promising ones are trading and foreign currency. Trading FinTechs allow investors and traders to connect with each  other and discuss place  orders to buy  and sell commodities and stocks. Foreign currency transaction FinTechs lower barriers and costs for individuals. Additionally they are able  to  do  so  via  payment  methods  that  are  much  more  familiar  to  individual  clients  or businesses (Lee & Shin 2018). In the insurance business model FinTechs allow a more direct relationship between the insurer and the customer and it is the most wellembraced by traditional insurance providers. FinTechs use data analytics to analyze and match risk and customers are offered products to meet their needs. In fact the technology allows insurers to expand their data collection to nontraditional sources improving their risk analysis (Lee & Shin 2018). According to EY FinTechs Adoption Index (2017) the most popular FinTech products in 2017  among  digitally  active  users  were  money  transfer  and  payments  (50%)  as  well  as insurance  (24%)  whereas  the  less  popular  were  financial  planning  (10%)  and  borrowing (10%). Moreover the use of FinTech products is highest among young adults at an early stage of their career. The most likely to use FinTechs are 25 to 34 year old consumers and FinTech  Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  22 use declines with consumers aged 45 years and older. In fact customers between 25 to 44 year old are comfortable with the internet and mobile technologies but they also require a wide range of financial services as they achieve life milestones such as completing their education starting fulltime employment and having children. The difference is that consumers aged 45 years and above  had already  established relationships with  incumbent providers before the arrival of FinTechs (EY Fintech Adoption Index 2017).               Figure 4 Average rate of FinTech adoption across the age brackets. Source EY FinTech Adoption Index 2017   2.3 INNOVATION IN THE BANKING INDUSTRY Financial technology (FinTech) is recognized as one of the most important innovations in the financial and banking industry and is evolving at a rapid speed driven in part by the sharing economy favorable regulation and information technology (The FinTech Revolution 2015). The emergence of FinTechs companies has drawn much speculation about their potential to disrupt incumbent financial institutions and take as much as 20% of their earnings by 2020 (Oshodin  Molla  Karanasios  &  Ong  2017).  Clayton  Christensen   s  Disruptive  Innovation Theory (DIT) is one of the most influential theories in academic and management literature (Hungenberg et. al. 2006). He suggests a broad definition of the concept of innovation which says    innovation refers to all changes of processes by which an organization transforms labor capital  materials  and  information  into  products  or  services  of  greater  value     (Christensen 1997  p.  xiii).  Thus  in  addition  to  creating  new  processes  and  products  innovation  also includes new types of business models (Hungenberg et. al. 2006). Moreover his theory defines two different types of innovation.  The first one sustaining innovation generates growth by offering  a  better  performance  in  existing  markets.  In  fact  these  innovations  are  exploited  Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  23 successfully by the established players in an industry and do not lead to revolutionary changes (Hungenberg  et.  al.  2006).  Differently  disruptive  innovations  are  usually  brought  to  the markets successfully by new entrants and have a lower performance in the traditionally most important performance criterion such as functionality speed or size.  Usually managers in incumbent firms are unwilling to support disruptive innovations. The first reason  is they usually do  not  completely realize  the  needs  of the  firm   s existing and most profitable customers. The second reason is that they offer a lower profit margin than sustaining innovations (Hungenberg et. al. 2006). Finally it is not always easy to apply the categories of disruptive and sustaining innovation in practice and the reason is that the term disruption is relative (Christensen et al. 2004). It means that even if a specific innovation is disruptive to one actor in an industry it might be sustaining to another one.     Figure 5 Disruptive Innovation Model. Source Christensen et. al. 2015   In this diagram the red line shows how product or services improve over time and the blue line shows  customers  willing  to  pay  for  performance.  In  fact  it  contrasts  product  performance trajectories with customer demand trajectories. Incumbents companies introduce products or services (upper red line incumbent   s sustaining trajectory) to satisfy the high end of the market which is also the most profitable. By doing so they miss the needs of the low end of the market which  is  also  the  least  profitable  segment.  New  entrants  (red  line  entrant   s  disruptive trajectory)  improve  the  performance  of  their  offerings  and  move  upmarket  where  the  Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  24 profitability  is  higher  for them too and by doing this  the challenge the dominance  of  the incumbents (Clayton et. al. 2015). However it is still unclear if FinTech can be considered as disruptive or sustaining innovators. Despite this concern it is necessary to understand if FinTech companies can be considered as part of the banking industry. Innovative solutions and services associated with FinTechs startup  firms  incumbent  financial  institutions  such  as  banks  and  technology  firms  such  as telecommunications  and  mobile  technology  companies  are  creating  a  new  ecosystem  of financial services (Puschmann 2017; Zavolokina Dolata & Schwabe 2016). Moreover it is needed to define if FinTech companies represent an opportunity or threat to the banking industry. Some authors argue that FinTechs are posing a threat or challenge to traditional institutions such as banks (Bunea Kogan & Stolin 2016).   Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  25 3  RESEARCH QUESTION AND ASSUMPTIONS As  it  was  presented  in  the  previous  chapters  the  introduction  of  the  most  recent  digital developments in the banking industry have seen the flourishing of new members (Mackenzie 2015).  FinTechs  attract  customers  with  products  and  services  that  are  more  userfriendly efficient  transparent  and  automated  than  those  currently  available.  Nowadays  traditional banks have not yet exhausted the possibilities for improvements along these lines (EBF 2015; Mackenzie 2015). Moreover it is still unclear if FinTech can be considered as disruptive or sustaining innovators even if those companies are recognized as one of the most important innovations in the financial and banking industry (Mackenzie 2015). Consequently some members of the financial services industry see the flourishing of FinTech companies as a threat to the traditional banking industry whereas others believe that FinTech has become a challenge that can be turned into an opportunity (Romanova & Kudinske 2016).  By saying so the research question developed that will be used as the guideline throughout the paper is the following     How does the perception of FinTechs in the Banking Industry influence their strategy?     This perception will be analyzed from a short and long term perspective as well from FinTechs point of view and banking industry experts.   3.1  ASSUMPTIONS  Based on the abovementioned research question the next section outlines the assumptions of this study. It was considered appropriate to divide the assumptions into three main groups Financial Technologies Banking Industry and Disruptive Innovation Theory (DIT) as also the theoretical framework and interview design are following the same structure.   The assumption regarding the Disruptive Innovation Theory (DIT) is the following   A1 It is not clear to members operating in the Financial and Banking Industry whether FinTech companies represent a disruptive or a sustaining innovation.  Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  26  Sentiments regarding the disruptive nature of FinTechs are contrasting. A recent Financial Times  survey  indicates  that  the  financial  services  disruptive  sector  is  concerned  about  the potential  of  several  digitalbased  technologies  as  applied  to  financial  services  such  as blockchain big data and robotadvisers (Chiu 2016). However like Christensen the father of the Disruptive Innovation Theory (DIT) points out it is not always easy to apply the categories of disruptive and sustaining innovation in practice    Even people who deeply understood the theory of disruptive innovation struggled to use them in a repeatable and methodical fashion    (Christensen  et  al.  2004).  This  is  because     disruption  is  a  relative  term     (Christensen  and Raynor 2003) and even though a particular innovation is disruptive to one player in an industry it might be sustained to another. For example the Internet was believed to be a disruptive innovation while in reality it turned out to be of sustaining nature. In fact the Internet had a sustaining impact as it strengthened the position of the established market leaders (Hungenberg et. al. 2006).   Further assumptions can be categorized as part of the Banking Industry section   A2 FinTechs and Traditional Banks don   t know how to collaborate with each other most suitable strategic alliance or partnership between them are not yet defined.   As a matter of fact banks face sluggish innovation processes and FinTechs take advantage of the digital era to employ customercentric solutions (Ansari & Krop 2012). Although banks have realized that  cooperation with FinTechs  is a  key  approach to  foster  innovation they struggle to address the associated challenges. It is crucial to close this research gap to better understand how technologydriven organizations and traditional banks can cooperate with each other (Drasch et. al. 2018)  The second assumption in the Banking Industry section is the following   A3 The relationship between Traditional Banks and FinTech companies is not well defined as it is still unclear if FinTechs represent a challenge or an opportunity for traditional banks.  The rapid rise of FinTech has changed the business landscape in banking asking for more innovative solutions for this reason some members of the financial services industry see the   Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  27 rise of FinTech companies as a threat to the traditional banking industry. Others consider that FinTech has become a challenge that can be turned into an opportunity as it provides more flexibility  better  functionality  in  some  areas  and  aggregation  of  services  (Romanova  & Kudinske 2016).  The last group regards specific info about Financial Technologies and contains two assumptions   A4 There is no general agreement on a definition of FinTechs that can help to understand the perception FinTechs have on themselves as well as Traditional Banks have of FinTechs.  At the moment there is no universal understanding and definition of FinTechs in the research (Zavolokina et. al. 2016). In fact it is not possible to construct a restrictive definition of FinTechs  that  applies  to  all  of  the  entities  traditionally  associated  with  the  term.  While  most companies in the FinTechs industry have certain features in common there are always enough exceptions to render them inadequate for producing a general definition (Dorfleitner et. al. 2017).  A5 The belonging of FinTech companies to the Banking Industry is not yet defined from both perspectives Traditional Banks and FinTech companies.  Some are considering FinTechs as an integral part of the Banking Industry whereas others see them as the generators of a new ecosystem. The first ones simply imply that FinTechs have become an integral part of the banking industry    (Romanova & Kudinske 2016). Whereas the second  ones  perceive  innovative  solutions  and  services  associated  with  FinTech  startup firms  incumbent  financial  institutions  such  as  banks  and  technology  firms  such  as telecommunications and  mobile technology companies are generating a  new ecosystem of financial services (Puschmann 2017; Zavolokina et. al. 2016). Traditional banks which are considered the dominant institutions have opportunities in the FinTech ecosystem still have challenges in aligning their culture and systems with that of  others in the ecosystem Thus investigating the FinTech initiatives of incumbent institutions provides important insights into the nature and shape of the future financial ecosystems (Oshodin Molla Karanasios & Ong 2017).    Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  28 4  METHODOLOGY This chapter aims to explain the appropriate methodology for achieving the research objectives. The overall purpose of this study is to examine as well as extend the body of knowledge and understanding regarding the perception of FinTechs in the Banking Industry. Consequently this section covers the research design data collection which includes the interview design as well as the choice of respondents and data analysis will be broadly described.    4.1  RESEARCH DESIGN The  consequences  of  digital  innovations  in  the  banking  industry  require  a  deeper understanding. During the last few years the flourishing of new members FinTechs have impacted the operating of traditional players. The aim of this research is to understand how the perception of FinTechs can influence their strategy in the market and both perceptions will be analyzed  FinTechs  and  banking  industry  experts.  As  this  topic  represent  a  new  field  for researchers and few studies have been done previously the choice of a qualitative research was made. For this reason semistructured interviews will be held as those types of interview allow a higher flexibility in the conduction of the interview. In fact it will be possible to add questions to  the  interview  while  it  is  being  conducted  which  consent  to  delve  deeper  into  subjects  of particular interests.  The interview will follow the same format used to construct the research question the literature review and the assumptions Disruptive Innovation Theory (DIT) Financial Technologies and Banking Industry. The first part Disruptive Innovation Theory has the aim to comprehend if FinTechs have a disruptive nature by reshaping the banking industry or if they are sustaining innovators that simply  improve  the existing services offered by  traditional banks. The part regarding  Banking  Industry  will  explore  possible  competitive  or  cooperative  dynamics between Banks and FinTechs whereas in the last part called Financial Technologies we will examine the perception FinTechs have on themselves in the banking industry as well as the perception banks  have  of FinTechs. FinTechs and banking  industry professionals will be interviewed but in different phases of the research.  The first step will be to interview experts operating in the financial and banking industry to investigate their perception of FinTechs. It was considered useful for the research to explore professionals    opinion as an external point of view can help to better define the meaning of the  Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  29 term FinTech as well as the relationship FinTechs have or are going to have with traditional banks in the future. Furthermore their opinion regarding the disruptive effect FinTech have on traditional players in the financial industry will be taken into consideration. This stage will help  to  gain  a  first  insight  into  financial  technologies  and  better  structure  and  conduct interviews with FinTech as the background of knowledge will be broader defined.  The  second  step  will  be  to  interview  FinTechs  specialists  and  understand  how  FinTechs perceive themselves in the market and how this perception affects their collaborations with Traditional  Banks.  A  definition  of  the  term  FinTech  will  be  asked  as  well  as  an  opinion regarding the disruptive innovation of FinTechs. Moreover the research will consider short term and long term perspective during all the three sections of the interview and in both stages.  Finally both interview stages will be combined in order to answer the research question and test the assumptions developed during the previous chapter.    4.2  DATA COLLECTION  This section aims to describe the interview design and the reasons why it was chosen a semistructured interview. Moreover the choice of respondents is broadly described and a list of FinTech companies contacted is presented.    4.2.1  INTERVIEW DESIGN To  answer  the  research  question  proposed  in  this  study  interviews  seem  to  be  a  suitable technique  because  they  allow  asking  openended  questions  and  exploring  individual experiences or opinions regarding the researched phenomenon. For this reason the primary method employed is that of interviews. In particular semistructured interviews are going to be used. This method allows for more personal contact with respondents which makes it easier to build a relationship between interviewer and interviewed (Saunders Lewis & Thornhill 2016).  Furthermore a semistructured design allows the interviewer to add questions to the interview while it is being conducted (Saunders et al. 2016). In the case that a respondent is not going to understand a question the interview format makes it possible to explain the question further (Saunders et al. 2016). It can happen that during an interview the respondents drift away from  Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  30 the subject (Saunders et al. 2016) but the interview guide will allow getting the respondents back on track.  The first step of this interview design is to interview experts working in traditional banks with the main purpose to construct the interviews subjective understanding and perception of FinTech in both long and short run. To reach this goal it will be needed to conduct between two to three interviews. When constructing the questions used for the interviews which are shown in Appendix  the literature provided the basis for the questions. This was done in order to gain responses that were relevant to the research question. For this purpose the interview is divided into three main parts Introduction Main Body and Conclusions. The Main Body is subdivided  is  microareas  Banking  Industry  Disruptive  Innovation  Theory  (DIT)  and Financial  Technologies.  The  approximative  length  will  be  between  20  and  35  minutes. Moreover a pilot interview will be conducted to test its feasibility knowledgeability clearness and length. For this reason the interview can be subject to further modifications.  The second step of this research is to interview specialists working for FinTechs. The main aim is to understand how FinTechs perceive themselves in the market and how this perception affects their collaborations with traditional banks. To reach this goal we will conduct between five to six interviews. The structure of the interview is similar to the one above and includes three main parts Introduction Main Body and Conclusions. The Main Body is subdivided is microareas Banking Industry Competitors and Financial Technologies but questions in each area changes slightly as you can see in Appendix . It will last between 20 and 35 minutes. Also  in  this  case  a  pilot  interview  will  be  conducted  and  for  this  reason  the  following interview can be subject to further modifications.  All  the  interviews  will  be  recorded  after  the  permission  of  the  respondents  and  after  the signature of the Informed Consent which will be sent via email before the interview will take place. The Informed Consent provides information about the purpose of the study what their participation will involve and how their data will be used. In Appendix  you can find a sample of the Informed Consent used during this study.  Recording and interview have several advantages as disadvantages. Among the advantages it can be stated that recording allows the interviewer to concentrate on questioning and listening allows questions formulated in an interview to be accurately recorded for use in later interviews and to possess an accurate and unbiased record (Saunders et. al. 2009). On the other hand it has the disadvantage of intimidating or inhibit the respondents (Saunders et al. 2016).  In addition to the recordings the interviews will be transcribed to easily go through them when analyzing the interviews (Saunders et al. 2016).   Investigating the Perception of FinTechs Disruptive Innovation in the Banking Industry?  31 4.2.2  CHOICE OF RESPONDENTS In order to contact FinTechs and traditional banks    experts a list of possible respondents was created. The selection of FinTechs was done by taking into considerations the report    FinTech 100    which compiles a list of the year   s best FinTech innovators from around the world (KPMG  2017).  Moreover  further  FinTech  companies  were  taken  into  consideration considering their geographical location and facility to reach and interview.  Another crucial element in the choice of respondents was their position inside the company. By having a role in the company that concerns areas of interest of this research such as the  company   s CEOs market analysts or strategic managers. The respondents were considered to have  sufficient  knowledge  and  experience  within  the  relevant  aspects  of  the  study. Furthermore  the  choices  have  been  limited  by  the  availability  and  accessibility  of  the respondents. The chart below illustrates the list of all FinTechs contacted through email or social media such as Facebook Instagram or LinkedIn and phonecalls in an alphabetical order. Moreover in Appendix  you can find attached the email sample used to contact every FinTech present in the list.
