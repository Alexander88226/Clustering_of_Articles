In  order  to  fully  beneficiate  of  the  results  of  research  and  development innovations young SMEs and startups need to be supported in early development stages through  direct  and  indirect  interventions.  The  following  proposals  are  based  on  the analysis  of  the  financial  market  failures  and  the  corresponding  priorities  set  by  the Partnership Agreement signed between Romania and the European Commission as well as the  objectives  of  the  approved  operational  programs  related  to  the  financial  instruments financed by the European Structural Funds and Investment.

The  guarantee  covers  the  losses incurred  by  the  financial  intermediaries  for  each  eligible  SME  transaction.  Losses covered  by  warranty  are  those  relating  to  a  portfolio  only  of  new  SMEs  eligible transactions and must not exceed in total the ceiling agreed in the guarantee agreement. The credit risk retained by the financial intermediary should be at least 20% of the loan portfolio (based on the principle pari passu of risk sharing with the administrator of the Guarantee Scheme). Expected and unexpected losses will be determined by the market conditions (level of bad loans recovery rates etc.).  The implementation of a loan portfolio guarantees for SME investing in Research \\xe2\\x80\\x93Development \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Innovation Given market assessments of credit guarantees administrated by the National Guarantee fund for SMEs Loans and the former analyzes made by Diana Soare (2015a 2015b) we propose  a  conservatively  leverage  of  5x  time  that  could  be  achieved  in  Romania. Leverage is a function of the rate guarantee and rate ceiling. The budget allocation is available  to  cover  the  default  cover  part  of  their  portfolios;  thus  the  loan  portfolio created is greater than the budget allocation (in this case 5 times higher). In addition by introducing  a  ceiling  for  payment  leverage  is  increased  for  example  the  same  loan portfolio  is  covered  by  the  same  budget  allocation.  Loan  guarantee  for  financial instruments required in today's market in Romania where SMEs are considered risky and  their  collaterals  lost  significant  value  due  to  the  crisis  (especially  real  estate collaterals). More so for innovative SMEs which have predominantly intangible assets (patents software platforms ITC) this product is highly appropriate. The tool provides better  access  to  finance  for  innovative  SMEs  eligible  by  guaranteeing  up  to  80%  of individual  loans  included  in  a  portfolio  (capped  under  a  contractual  agreement).  It  is necessary to ensure that the full benefit of the instrument will be switched to SMEs who would therefore benefit from lower prices and improved loan collateral requirements. This  proposal  for  a  financial  instrument  should  be  complementary  to  other  actions; Such loans covered by the tool may be used to cofinance the eligible costs of European projects funded with ESIF grants subject to the rules of cumulation of aid. The budget allocated for loons guarantee portfolio to credit SMEs general investments could be successfully used through allocation of budgets from the National Program for Rural Development and to the National Fund or the Regional Operational Programme for SMEs Loans Guarantee as a result of the last results in the area (Dumitrescu et al. 2014). \\x0cInvestment funds and portofolio of loan guarantees  121Regarding the guarantees for innovative loan portfolio our recommendation is to opt for  designating  the  European  Investment  Fund  as  Manager  of  the  Fund  given  the expertise that it has at European level on financing innovative SMEs. Thus Romania may  opt  to  transfer  part  of  the  budget  from  Operational  Competitiveness  Program  to EIF  for  the  establishment  of  a  guarantee  scheme  for  credit  type  InnovFin  SME Guarantee  Facility  for  SMEs  innovative  which  are  then  allocated  to  Romania  by Financial Intermediaries (following the example Jeremie 20072013). Romania also can opt  for  joining  the  SME  Initiative  as  is  the  case  for  Spain  Malta  and  Bulgaria  by allocating budgets from the Regional Operational Program.   Developing an investment fund for innovative SMEs in Romania  To  calculate  the  financing  deficit  for  private  equity  and  venture  capital  in  Romania we\\xe2\\x80\\x99ve  calculated  the  difference  between  supply  and  demand  based  on  investment benchmark as a percentage of GDP compared to other countries of Central and Eastern Europe  (Hungary  Poland  Bulgaria  and  the  Czech  Republic).  We  also  used  a  second calculation  model  that  evaluates  six  major  factors  of  attractiveness  for  the  analyzed Investment Funds economic activity the depth of the capital market taxation investor protection  and  corporate  governance  human  environment  and social  and entrepreneurial culture and business opportunities. Qualitative analysis of market risk funding from Romania presents a set of constraints that  must  be  known  to  have  a  complete  picture  on  the  theme.  Thus  as  from  the evaluation  of  entrepreneurship  culture  the  local  culture  does  not  encourage  serial entrepreneurs. Most people who start a business do not take into account its subsequent sale.  Moreover  young  people  with  higher  education  tend  to  prefer  positions  in multinational  corporations  which  are  perceived  as  safer.  The  reluctance  of  these potential entrepreneurs is a weakness for the Romanian entrepreneurial culture. There is also  a  lack  of  information  on  risk  financing  options  that  limit  SMEs  in  terms  of development  through  funding.  It  requires  raising  awareness  among  entrepreneurs  on these financial instruments in order to overcome the limited knowledge on the subject. In Romania there are not enough private investors as business angels who can provide mentoring  and  support  to  entrepreneurs  in  order  to  reach  the  level  where  they  can become interesting for private investors or investment funds. Often entrepreneurs are not aware of the potential added value of such investors and tend to overestimate the value of their business (Maxwell Jeffrey and Levesque 2011). It is therefore necessary to  support  the  education  of  entrepreneurs  in  the  financial  realm  and  on  the  rigors  of business  and  investment.  Following  there  is  an  analysis  made  at  European  level  that revels the lack of financial education is one of the main factors influencing the small rate  approval  for  financing  proposals  for  two  of  the  newest  types  of  finance  Grants \\t\\t\\x0c\\t122 M\\xc4\\x83d\\xc4\\x83lina Gabriela Anghel Constantin Anghelache Daniel Dumitrescu through  Horizon  2020  SME  Instrument  and  Private  Investments  through  Business Angels Networks.  the  creation  of  specific Source http//www.ecsif.eu/events From the above we can understand that there is a lack of awareness about the steps that a company must meet as soon as it becomes part of a portfolio of an investment fund. Currently there is no legal and tax structure flexibly adjusted to protect investors in the companies under early stage. Difficulties related to the protection of property rights and the  implementation  of  corporate  governance  principles  are  the  basic  factors  that increase the risk faced by private investors and investment funds. Romania has a low level  of  research  \\xe2\\x80\\x93  development  and  innovation  directly  related  to  venture  capital investments  which  require infrastructure  research  \\xe2\\x80\\x93 development and innovation funded with public money. As for the labor market it is too  rigid  not  enhancing  entrepreneurship  making  it  harder  for  companies  to  fire employees. Market Development IPO (Initial Public Offering) is necessary because it is one of the most attractive exit routes for private investors or investment funds. In terms of share of total capital investment in total GDP only Bulgaria is surpassed by Romania the last being situated at half the average of the five analyzed countries. The situation  is  even  worse  when  comparing  investment  risk  because  Romania  shows  the lowest percentage of GDP for the countries of Central and Eastern Europe. To \\xe2\\x80\\x9ccatch\\xe2\\x80\\x9d the analyzed countries Romania should aim to achieve at least a share of the average risk  capital  investments  in  the  countries  analyzed  and  the  best  way  to  do  this  is  by following  the  example  of  the  leader  in  the  region  Poland  which  has  a  capital investment of about 1 billion euros. Considering GDP in 2013 as 143 billion Euros the average and maximum capital investment in the analyzed countries in the region and then deducting the efficiency of investment in year by 70 million euro the result is that the  financing  gap  in  the Private  Equity  and  Venture  capital type  in  Romania  in 2013 was between 20 and 70 million euros. Assuming an average GDP growth of 2.5% in the coming years the cumulative deficit financing of this type in Romania for the period of \\x0cInvestment funds and portofolio of loan guarantees  123the European Multiannual Financial Framework 20142020 can be estimated between 150 and 500 million euros. Compared to the above conclusions we propose the creation of a Venture Capital Fund for innovative SMEs. The solution will be a typical structure of private capital in the form  of  a  venture  fund  established  through  partnerships  and  managed  by  a  fund manager selected and backed by a strong team of advisors (such as RDI experts for an innovation  oriented  fund).  The  fund  will  invest  in  local  SMEs  at  an  early  stage  or growth primarily through equity and quasiequity. To ensure the diversity of the portfolio the maximum size of investment will be up to 15% of the total size of the budget for the fund. According to the rules applicable to state aid (GBER \\xe2\\x80\\x93 General Block Exemption Regulation) private capital will be at least 40%  contribution  to  a  fund  for  SMEs.  Private  investors  will  benefit  from  additional revenue.  Leverage  (Santagada  2012)  will  be  achieved  directly  through  private participation. Given the few venture capital funds in the market the fund is expected to catalyze  additional  investments  in  the  SME  segment  but  a  solution  needed  to  attract private  capital  market  consists  in  providing  incentives  to  private  investors  through  a non pari passu treatment with regard to income distribution. The proposed investment strategy should set a target for the final beneficiaries leaving room for changes (e.g. classified as innovative industry sectors that can develop over time) and be sufficiently prudent when selecting financial product. Indeed during the implementation phase a reasonable level of flexibility can be beneficial for the actual payment of funds.  Business Accelerator support for European and global development of innovative SMEs with high growth potential From  our  point  of  view  Business  Accelerators  should  be  seen  as  an  ongoing combination  of  two  modules  accelerating  entrepreneurship  and  early  stage  business financing. Acceleration  phase  initial  funding  up  to  a  predetermined  amount  selected  by  the financial  intermediaries  to  support  entrepreneurs  (eligible  SMEs)  to  research  assess and  develop  an  initial  concept.  The  first  phase  of  the  acceleration  program  should include  trainings  in  financial  education  entrepreneurship  marketing  innovation (Lesakova  2013)  and  commercialisation  and  mentoring  sessions  with  proven experienced mentors. In order to attract a critical mass of applications eligible for the funding  acceleration  phase intermediary  should  consider  more competitive  sessions  of  applications.  At  the  closure  of  such  procedures  the  awarded the  financial \\t\\t\\x0c\\t124 M\\xc4\\x83d\\xc4\\x83lina Gabriela Anghel Constantin Anghelache Daniel Dumitrescu SMEs (subject to eligibility and quality assessment criteria predefined by the financial intermediary) could receive the initial funding. The business financing early stage In this stage the financial intermediaries (i) provide further  funding  up  to  a  maximum  eligible  cap  for  each  SME  that  successfully completed  the  acceleration  phase;  and  (ii)  finance  the  eligible  SMEs  who  didn\\xe2\\x80\\x99t participated  in  the  acceleration  phase  as  long  as  the  initial  concept  is  developed (provided  that  financing  SMEs  that  only  have  a  business  plan  at  this  stage  is  not permitted). Most equity at this stage should be invested in graduates of the acceleration phase.  The  form  of  support  at  this  phase  could  include  more  in  depth  consultancy  in access to finance sales channels etc. One of the defining characteristics of Romanian market is the lack of any investment funds  operating  in  the  initial  stages  of  a  businesses.  This  puts  Romania  in  direct contrast  to  most  EU  countries  and  jeopardize  the  future  development  of  businesses with growth potential in Romania. More the country lags behind others in terms of RDI activities.  The Instrument provides an integrated approach to supporting startups and innovative SMEs  through key elements to start a successful business preseed financing funding followon  and  additional  business  experience  transmitted  through  trainings  and mentors  bringing  together  competencies  internationalization  expertise  and  funding. Thus  deficiencies  traditionally  related  to  venture  capital  investment  in  undeveloped markets  such  as  lack  of  private  investors  and  insufficient  monitoring  capacity  are addressed. The  recipients  of  this  form  of  support  will  be  innovative  SMEs  with  high  growth potential.  Regarding  the  acquired  company's  shares  it  could  be  in  the  form  of  a minority  stakes  that  can  be  purchased  from  the  founders.  The  maximum  size  of investments  (Soare  et  al.  2015)  to  ensure  diversification  of  the  fund  should  be considered (up to 15% of the size of the total budget allocated to the Fund). At least 10% should be private contribution to acceleration and preseed financing. The leverage will be achieved through private participation. Given that there is no such instruments in  Romania  is  expected  that  the  fund  to  provide  incentives  for  private  investors  that would  offset  the  risk  of  investing  in  such  a  new  instrument  on  the  Romanian  market with a catalyst effect on the community of local entrepreneurs. In such a case private investors may have priority over public investors in terms of return of invested capital and/or have a clear advantage over any other investor audience. The Business Accelerator is a tool that can benefit most of additionality due to the fact that the local venture capital market for early stages of business development is very weak. \\x0c\\tInvestment funds and portofolio of loan guarantees  125Because ESIF new rules envisage a combination of financial instruments and additional financial support in the form of grants technical assistance facility could be linked to financial instruments. Because of the emphasis on the preseed and challenges arising from  different  levels  of  development  of  the  entrepreneurial  environment  in  the  EU countries technical assistance could be established for the following areas \\xef\\x82\\xa7  Financial support for marketing activities to promote the tool for potential applicants and  to  create  general  awareness  among  entrepreneurs  (e.g.  organizing  and participating in events and startup conferences workshops seminars etc.); \\xef\\x82\\xa7  Financial  support  for  the  fund  manager  for  applicants  with  projects  in  niche segments  or  that  presents  a  complex  nature  (e.g.  medical  technology  and biotechnology clean technology engineering IP evaluation etc.); \\xef\\x82\\xa7  Financial  support  for  the  fund  manager  to  coordinate  the  provision  of  additional support  services  (management  legal  and  accounting  services  mentoring  sessions with experts in various fields organizing investors days etc.); \\xef\\x82\\xa7  Financial support for risk management and compliance monitoring necessary for the implementation of the instrument; \\xef\\x82\\xa7  Support  in  the  form  of  training  and  mentoring  for  entrepreneurs  in  finance technology management marketing etc. Private Accelerators in Romania have been already successfully undergone by several companies  such  as  Gems  Foundry  and  the  newly  launched  European  Accelerator programme  in  collaboration  with  European  Center  for  Services  Investments  and Financing that will focus on Fintech SmartCity and Social Innovative Businesses. The programme  will  have  a  new  business  model  that  will  support  innovative  SMEs  to access European Grants for innovation such as Horizon 2020 SME Instrument or grants from Competitiveness Operational Programme. www.ecsif.eu/events.  Conclusions In  a  more  global  and  digitalysed  world  economy  the  innovative  startups  and  SMEs from Romania needs and coherent strategy (Ionescu and Plesanu 2010) to support their efforts in research development and innovation. The above measures are just a part of a package of direct and indirect actions that can be implemented in a sustainable way and that can get use of the European Structural and Investment Funds allocated for Romania for the Multiannual Financial Framework 20142020. \\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\t\\x0c\\t126 \\t\\tReferences M\\xc4\\x83d\\xc4\\x83lina Gabriela Anghel Constantin Anghelache Daniel Dumitrescu Dumitrescu F.
