The initiative stems from the European Commission\'s needs and guidelines  to  strengthen  partnerships  between  "policymakers" and  other  national  financial  promotional  institutions  to  support entrepreneurship  as  countries  from  individual  geographically and  strategically  linked  European  regions  need  to  connect  in finding synergy effects in supporting SMEs start up ecosystems and support innovation systems for fastgrowing companies. Slovene Enterprise Fund (SEF) is a public financial fund and a national   promotional   financial   intermediary   which   offers favourable  financial  incentives  for  small  and  medium  sized enterprises  (SMEs)  startup  and  scale  ups    hight  tech  fast growing  innovative  companies  (3S)  in  Slovenia  to  help  them develop   and   grow.   SEF   offers   a   wide   range   of   financial incentives  for  each  development  phase  in  the  life  cycle  of the company  such  as  grants  for  startups  seed  capital  venture capital microcredits and guarantees for bank loans. SEF also presents a strong element in Support network for 3S in Slovenia and has created a successful partnerships with other partners  such   as  policy  makers   financial  partners  support organisations    and    services    and    research    and    education organizations. But for the future success of different EU regions it is crucial to create a support network not only on the national level but also a support  network  on  the  inter    regional  level.  This  kind  of network should represent the cooperation and partnership among the partner support institutions and this partnership should also influence the cooperation among companies (3S  SMEs startups and scaleups) from the connected region.

STARTING POINTS AND ASSUMPTIONS ON THE SUPPORT OF FASTGROWING COMPANIES Through their contribution to innovation new and small firms are key to enhance aggregate productivity (OECD 2017).  Business dynamics is an important driver of productivity growth. Startups are a key source of productivity gains due to their high levels of innovativeness and increased competitive pressure they put   on   incumbent   firms.   However   a   large   share   of   new enterprises either fails in the first years of activity or remains very small (Calvino et al. 2016).  SMEs and young firms that experience rapid growth can have a considerable impact on aggregate productivity growth including through  innovation  heavy  investments  in  human  capital  new demand  for  advanced  products  and  services  knowledge  spill overs  that  other  enterprises  can  harness  and  impact  on  local entrepreneurial ecosystems.  SMEs    are    key    contributors    to    technological    and    non technological  innovation.  While  not  all  SMEs  are  innovative new  and  small  firms  are  often  behind  innovations  that  are important  for  economic  growth  especially  in  sectors  such  as software      nanotechnology      biotechnology      and      clean technologies.  SMEs  can  exploit  technological  or  commercial opportunities that have been neglected by larger companies or enable the commercialisation of knowledge that would otherwise remain    uncommercialised    in    universities    and    research organisation.  The  changing  nature  of  innovation  and  new  technologies  in particular  information  and  communication  technologies  (ICT) have   empowered   SMEs   as  they  contributed   to   reduce   the structural sizerelated disadvantages smaller firms face in terms of resource access market access and ability to reap economies of scale (OECD 2017).  The   ongoing   digital   transition   offers   startups   and   SMEs opportunities of reaching scale without mass and enhancing their competitiveness through various forms of innovation. New  digital  technologies  facilitate  the  emergence  of  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cborn global\\xe2\\x80\\x9d small  businesses and \\xe2\\x80\\x9clean  startups\\xe2\\x80\\x9d that leverage the Internet  to  lower  fixed  costs  and  outsource  activities  (OECD 2017).  Data  analytics  improve  market  intelligence  and  encourage  the adoption of  new  business  models.  Block  chain  technology  and digitalenabled fintech services are likely to radically transform financial markets especially the ways of addressing information asymmetries and collateral shortages which SMEs tend to suffer the most.  Other   emerging   technologies   such   as   robotics   industrial biotechnology     3D     printing     nanotechnology     are     also announcing  the  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnext  production  revolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  and  farreaching changes  in  markets  and  distribution  and  production  processes wherein SMEs are closely involved.  SME may have a competitive advantage relative to larger firms in global markets as their flexibility and capacity to customiseSMEs are key contributors to economic growth employment and innovation. They also play a key role in the transition towards more  sustainable  and  inclusive  growth  pathways.  However contributions vary widely across the population of SMEs sector and countries. Also the global financial crisis marked a widening gap   in   productivity   trends   relative   to   large   firms   with implications for wage and income gaps. In  the background  of fastevolving technological environment ageing societies and climate change SMEs hold the response to many pressing  socioeconomic  challenges.  At  the  same  time these   megatrends   generate   new   challenges   for   SMEs   and entrepreneurs including changing skills requirements and forms of work shifting relationships within value chains and increasing global competition and a next production revolution.  10                              SYSTEMICS CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS        VOLUME 16  NUMBER 6  YEAR 2018                             ISSN 16904524\\x0cand  differentiate  products  allow  them  to  respond  rapidly  to changing market conditions and shorter product life cycles. This responsiveness  is  determinant  for  the  competitiveness  of  entire supply  chains  and  innovative  small  enterprises  are  often  key partners  of  larger  multinationals  in  developing  new  products  or serving new markets.  SME  participation  in  global  markets  creates  opportunities  of scaling  up  accessing  cheaper  and  higher  quality  inputs  and capital goods (i.e. foreign technologies products and knowhow) accelerating    knowledge    and    knowhow    spillovers    and broadening SME skills set.         There are market failures that have heightened implications for SMEs due to their intrinsic characteristics such as small size or age. In particular diffused market inefficiencies create obstacles for  SMEs  to  access  markets  and  strategic  resources  including finance   management   capacity   and   skills   and   knowledge networks and on public investments in areas such as education and  training  innovation  and  infrastructure  placing  them  at  a competitive disadvantage in the global  and digitalised economy. Due to internal constraints SMEs are disproportionately affected by  market  failures  barriers  and  inefficiencies  in  the  business environment and policy sphere. Innovation   by   SMEs   is   largely   influenced   by   knowledge spillovers access to networks and opportunities to partner with other players including larger enterprises. Boosting SME performance in a rapidly changing environment raises   major   policy   challenges.   The   SME   policy   space   is complex comprising framework conditions broad policies that impact SMEs and specific targeted policies. These  areas  often  cut  across  the  boundaries  of  ministries  and government  agencies  as  well  as  across  levels  of  government. SMEs are often embedded in local ecosystems which represent their  primary  source  of  knowledge  skills  finance  business opportunities and networks. 2.  WHY THE CREATION OF RIGHT SUPPORT ECO SYSTEM CAN FOSTER INNOVATIVE FAST GROWING COMPANIES? Based  on  the  presented  starting  points  and  assumptions  on  the support  of  fastgrowing  companies  it  is  important  to  consider factors affecting framework conditions at the local level and how policies   developed   at   national   level   are   tailored   to   local conditions as well as how they link with policies that are shaped at the regional or territorial level (OECD 2017). Many governments increasingly recognise the need for a cross cutting  perspective  when  developing  policies  and  have  taken steps  in  this  direction.  However  the  synergies  tradeoffs  and complementarities within and across policy areas as well as the implications  for  different  types  of  SMEs  are  often  not  well considered. This is often due to limited evidence and insufficient understanding of the interdependency of policies. A  major  effort  is  needed  to  better  understand  the  combined effects of structural reforms on the SME business environment as well as on the role and impact of policies targeted to SMEs. Such an effort should consider the potential synergies and trade offs taking place across diverse areas of interaction in the policy mix including distortionary effects that  may be introduced  by some policy actions.  The structure performance and evolution of the SME population are impacted by complex policy settings which cut across policy areas  and  government  levels  and  comprise  general  framework conditions   (e.g.   competition   policy   trade   policy   judicial efficiency intellectual property rights regime); policy measures and regulatory standards which target the business sector but are not  explicitly  differentiated  by  firm  size  and  targeted  policy settings  for  which  SMEs  (or  a  subpopulation  of  SMEs)  are explicitly  treated  in  a  differentiated  manner  relative  to  other firms.  Globalisation   has  increased   the  importance  of  crossborder collaboration  in  innovation.  However  across  countries  a  key challenge   for   many   SMEs   is   to   identify   and   connect   to appropriate  knowledge  partners   and   networks  at   the  local national and global levels as well as to develop appropriate skills and  management  practices  for  coordinating  and  integrating knowledge created by external partners with inhouse practices and innovation processes (OECD 2017).  Figure 1 SME Performance     OECD  work  and  policy  dialogue  point  to  some  particular priority policy areas in developing contexts including   Closing the funding gap. A large proportion of SMEs have no  access  to  formal  credit  at  all  and  the  conditions  for accessing longterm credit are even more difficult (OECD 2017). Closing the digital gap. The digital transition opens up new opportunities   for   SMEs   to   access   regional   and   global markets   such   as   through   ecommerce.   It   also   favours regional integration.  Therefore the creation of support network for SMEs including start \\xe2\\x80\\x93  ups (innovative new companies) and scale \\xe2\\x80\\x93  ups (high tech fast growing companies) \\xe2\\x80\\x93 together we call these companies 3S \\xe2\\x80\\x93 so the creation of \\xc2\\xbbSUPPORT NETWORK FOR 3S\\xc2\\xab with different  partners  in  enterprenurial  ecosystem can  be  a  useful model  and  tool  to  faciliate  inovative  entreprenurial  spirit  in different economic environments.  The initiative stems from the European Commission\'s needs and guidelines  to  strengthen  partnerships  between  "policymakers"ISSN 16904524                              SYSTEMICS CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS        VOLUME 16  NUMBER 6  YEAR 2018                             11\\x0c       and    other    national    promotional    institutions    to    support entrepreneurship. Creation of support ecosystem for innovative fast growing companies presents successful partnerships among different partners policy makers national promotional/financial institutions financial partners support organisations and services and research and education organizations. Figure 2 Support network for SMEs Startups Scaleups (3S)  Close    cooperation    and    exchange    of    information    and experience  between  public  authorities  financial  intermediaries and other public and private bodies is crucial to ensure financial products  that  were  suitable  to  the  needs  of  final  recipients  to  contribute  to  the  success  of  small  and  mediumsized enterprises startup    companies    and    fastgrowing    globally    oriented companies from the region. It is also useful that countries from individual geographically and strategically  linked  regions  need  to  connect  in  finding  synergy effects  in  supporting  SMEs  start  up  ecosystems  and  support innovation systems for fastgrowing companies. Figure 3 Creation of support network for SMEs between regions  Yet  for  the  future  success  of  different  regions  it  is  crucial  to create a support network not only on the national level but also a support  network  on  the  inter    regional  level.  This  kind  of network should represent the cooperation and partnership among the partner support institutions and this partnership should also influence   the   cooperation   among   3S   companies   from   the connected region. 3.  GOOD PRACTICE ON THE CASE OF SLOVENE ENTERPRISE FUND   3.1. The role of Slovene Enterprise Fund  Slovene Enterprise Fund (SEF) is a public financial fund and a national  promotional  financial  intermediary  in  Slovenia  which offers  favourable  financial  incentives  for  3S  companies  (small and  medium sized  enterprises  (SMEs)  startups  and  scale  ups (hightech  fast  growing  innovative  companies)  in  Slovenia  to help them develop and grow.  We  support  Slovene  SMEs  including  startups  and  scaleups by improving  their  access  to  finance  through  a  wide  range  of favorable financial products for their development and growth. To this end we design promote and implement equity and debt financial    instruments    that    specifically    target    individual development phase of 3S. SEF is   The leading provider of guarantees for bank loans and thus the promotion of lending activities of SMEs in Slovenia   Main   provider   or   microcredits   for   micro   and   small    enterprises and selfemployed Cocreator of the STARTUP ECOSYSTEM in Slovenia to achieve a global success of startup enterprises Key coinvestor of seed and venture capital in Slovenia as equity financing for fastgrowing enterprises Cocreator    of    a    supportive    environment    for    the entrepreneurial sector in Slovenia         Facilitator of entrepreneurial networks in the international environment.  In    this    role    we    foster    EU    objectives    in    support    of entrepreneurship growth innovation research development and employment.  ADDITIONAL SUBSTANTIVE SUPPORT  \\xc2\\xbbSEF TWIN\\xc2\\xab In addition to financial incentives SEF offers additional activities in  the  form of substantive  support    \\xc2\\xbbSEF  TWIN\\xc2\\xab (education training various workshops coaching accelerator programmes startup schools demo days\\xe2\\x80\\xa6).  Our aim is to ensure proper and updated solutions for existing and   future    market      needs    by    designing    innovative    financial products  addressed  to  SMEs  directly  or  through  our  financial partners (banks business angels private seed and venture capital funds etc.).  Also SEF has decided to create the support network together with government and similar support institutions in specific regions for  3S    while    at    the    same    time    facilitating    cooperation    and networking between businesses and related regions.  3.2. Creation of support network for 3S in Slovenia  SEF  presents  a  strong  element  in  Support  network  for  3S  in Slovenia  and  has  created  a  successful  partnerships  with  other partners  such   as  policy  makers   financial  partners  support organisations    and    services    and    research    and    education organizations.12                              SYSTEMICS CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS        VOLUME 16  NUMBER 6  YEAR 2018                             ISSN 16904524\\x0c                           According to successful partnership with other partners such as policy makers financial partners support organizations /services and  research/education  organizations  in  last  10  years  SEF  has reached a lot of good results experiences and expertise. Figure  4  Support  network  for  SMEs  Startups  Scaleups  in Slovenia the provider of guarantees for bank loans for SMEs. Bank loans can be used for investment projects or to finance working capital.  Guarantees  enable  faster  easier  and  cheaper  bank  loans  for SMEs (lower interest rates lower collateral requirements longer loan maturity etc.). 3.2.2.2.Cooperation with European Investment Fund (EIF) EIF  offers  to  SEF  counter  guarantee  on  issued  guarantee  to SMEs  for  bank  loan  (under  the  COSME  programme    EU programme for the Competitiveness of Enterprises and Small and Mediumsized Enterprises (SMEs)). SEF also cooperate with EIF in  the  microcredit  scheme  (under  the  EaSI  programme    EU Programme  for  Employment  and  Social  Innovation)  in  which EIF cooperate as SEF\\xe2\\x80\\x9ds guarantor.  With microcredits SEF wants to make finance available to micro entrepreneurs and selfemployed. Microfinance consists mainly of   microloans   (less   than   EUR   25000)   tailored   to   micro enterprises (91% of all European businesses) and selfemployed entrepreneurs   who   are   facing   difficulties   in   accessing   the traditional banking services.   3.2.2.3. Cooperation with Business angels and Venture capital funds  SEF  is  a  cornestone  investor  in  Seed  and  Venture  Capital  in Slovenia. We play an important role in creation and development of Slovenian Seed and Venture Capital market. Through our seed and  venture  capital  interventions  we  support  highgrowth  and innovative  scale  ups  by facilitating  access  to  equity for  these companies across the entire life cycle of corporate innovation. By investing in venture and growth capital directly or in cooperation with  Business  Angels  Seed  or  Venture  Capital  Funds  we support perspective SMEs from the earliest stages of intellectual property development into technology transfer to more scale up phases of fast and global growth.  SEF  is actively cooperating  with  Business  Angels  of Slovenia and other private investors that invest into the SEF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s supported startups.  Since  2014  when  SEF  launched  the  seed  capital product  business  angels  and  other  private  investors  invested approx.  32  m  EUR  into  the  enterprises  supported  with  seed capital.  SEF launched first venture capital line in 2010 which enabled a start    of    publicprivate    partnerships    with    venture    capital companies.   Through   the   five   year   investment   period   29 investments were concluded in the amount of 2904m EUR. New venture capital line will be established through the CEFoF which is mentioned above. CEFOF Initiative (a multicountry Central Europe Fund of Funds for venture capital) is the second line of SEF cooperation with VC funds EIF and IIB and it offers new opportunities   for   venture   capital   and   private   equity   funds (existent  or  emerging)  that  have  their  investment  strategies focused   on   fast   growing   young   small   and   mediumsized enterprises and small midcaps.  The launch of CEFoF and the start of the investment process was in December 2017.3.2.1. Partnership with policy makers on national and EU level The Slovene Enterprise Fund is very active in the entrepreneurial sector and has a number of experiences especially regarding the cooperation with key policy makers on the national and EU level. The  cooperation  is  mostly  based  on  providing  the  financial resources for the implementation of financial instruments and creating    a    supportive    environment    for    international cooperation in the region. SEF is on national level mostly cooperating with the Ministry of Economic  Development  and  Technology  which  is  SEF\\xe2\\x80\\x99s  line ministry Ministry of Finance and Ministry of Foreign Affairs. On the  EU  level  most  of  the  cooperation  is  with  the  European Commission and financial institutions EIB and EIF. In   the   last   financial   period   SEF   was   the   main   financial intermediary for  financial instruments cofinanced  through EU Structural   Funds   (European   Regional   Development   Fund European  Social  Fund)  and  other  EU  financial  Instruments (MAP  CIP  COSME  EaSI)  and  is  one  of  the  key  players  in addressing economic and social challenges in Slovenia. Recent project that SEF approached and is participating in as an Investor is the CEFOF Initiative (multicountry Central Europe Fund of Funds) which offers new opportunities for venture capital and private  equity  funds  (existent  or  emerging)  who  have  their investment strategies focused on fast growing young small and mediumsized enterprises and small midcaps. The  cooperation  is  mostly  based  on  providing  the  financial resources for the implementation of financial instruments. 3.2.2. Cooperation with financial partners 3.2.2.1.Cooperation with banks SEF  is  leading  provider  of  bank  guarantees  to  catalyse  SME lending in Slovenia. We cooperate with all banks in Slovenia as ISSN 16904524                              SYSTEMICS CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS        VOLUME 16  NUMBER 6  YEAR 2018                             13\\x0c           3.2.3. Partnership with support organisations and services SEF   has   a   lot   of   useful   relationship   with   other   support organizations  and  services  in  Slovenia  such  as  technological parks      incubators      regional      entrepreneurship      centers accelerators     chambers     of     craft     and      chambers     of commerce\\xe2\\x80\\xa6Together  with  them  the  synergy  effects  can  be reached.  The  most  important  results  of  this  partnership  is\\xe2\\x80\\x9d substantive  support  program\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  for  SMEs  offered  as  additional program of SEF. 3.2.3.1.Partnership with Startup Initiative of Slovenia SEF represents a very important element in the Slovenian startup ecosystem  with  the  main  partner  \\xe2\\x80\\x9cStartup  Initiative\\xe2\\x80\\x9d  which consists  of  representatives  of  incubators   technology  parks startup experts and private investors. Together  with  main  partners  (incubators  technology  parks private  investors  start  up  experts  from  entrepreneurship  sector etc.)  we  have  created  a  strong  and  active  start  up  ecosystem which offers not only favorable financial support for innovative startups  and  scale  ups  but  also  coaching  and  management support for companies. With coaching and management support the financial incentives reach better results. SEF all the time tries to advance START UPS AND SCALE UPS to  global  success  and  wants  to  create  strong  START     UP ECOSYSTEM in SLOVENIA. Within this ecosystem there is First cooperation Start up incentives (grants) scheme which get  startup  money  from  SEF  For  start  up  companies  SEF offers special incentives in the form of grants that enable easier start  up  of  a  young  enterprise.  The  SEF  grants  STARTUP INCENTIVES  to  young  enterprises  (startups  younger  than  14 months) in the first development phase when enterprises are at the  start   of  their  operation  and   have  a  positive  economic significance  and  are  according  to  the  analysis  of  market  gaps assessed  as  extremely  vulnerable  group  in  the  market  with  an endangered existence. In addition to the financial incentives the startup enterprises are also entitled to substantive support from the best domestic and foreign   startup   mentors      \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSEF   TWIN\\xe2\\x80\\x9d   implemented   by partners from start up iniciative together with science incubator of University of Maribor \\xe2\\x80\\x93 Faculty of Economics and Business Technologycal park of Ljubljana \\xe2\\x80\\xa6 Second cooperation Networking activities international start up  conference  the largest and most influential conference on entrepreneurship  startups  investments  and  innovation  in  the European Adriatic & Balkan region;   startup schools start ups weekend start up workshops ... In December 2017 the report \\xe2\\x80\\x9cSTARTUP INVESTMENT & INNOVATION     AND     EMERGING     EUROPE\\xe2\\x80\\x9d1     was published prepared on the basis of the firstever comprehensive startup research on 24 countries of Central and Eastern Europe which provides an excellent starting point for the possibilities of 1\\t\\thttp//www.ewdn.com/2017/12/28/startupinnovationand\\tinvestmentinemergingeuropeagroundbreakingresearchreleased\\tbyewdn/cooperation between the Slovenia and countries in Balkan region in  the  field  of  exchange  information  and  experience  on  the establishment and development of startup ecosystems.  3.3.   Creation of support network for 3S across the EU and other regions  The  Slovene  Enterprise  Fund  (SEF)  represents  also  a  very important element in  the Slovenian  Startup  eco  system  which functions  not  only  at  the  national  level  but  is  becoming  the meeting (bridge) point for young innovative growth companies for the entire territory of the former Yugoslavia and the Balkans. Through the establishment of a strong network of partners and intensive cooperation between them an even better breakthrough of young fastmoving and innovative companies from this region can  be  achieved  on  global  markets.  Partnership  is  emerging among  investors  (public  financial  funds  venture  capital  funds business angels ...) technology parks incubators other support institutions for entrepreneurship. Slovene Startup Ecosystem can be a gateway (first entry point) for startups from least developed startup ecosystems to Western Europe and also to USA.  Therefore we have created the model of support network for 3S between SEF and partner institutions among different countries in the similar region.  A lot of common activities can be done also among  START  UP  ECOSYSTEMS  in  cooperation  countries. The  same  model  can  be  used  also  for  the  creation  of  support ecosystem among different continents not only similar regions.  According to successful partnership with other partners such as policy makers financial partners support organizations /services and  research/education  organizations  in  last  10  years  SEF  has reached a lot of good results experiences and expertise. These could be the part of further cooperation with similar institutions in other EU regions.  SEF has established a lot of efficient contacts and partnerships with other support organizations from other region from EU with the aim to increase the results of financial support.  Therefore  we  can  be  involved  in  a  number  of  initiatives  to promote regional business development and to use our expertise and    experience    to    create    market    impact    through    local implementation of financial instruments also in other EU region  Going forward SEF intends to expand its regional development activity  capitalising  on  the  experience  acquired  through  its involvement  in  the  management  of  financial  instruments  co financed  by Structural  Funds  and  fundoffunds  managers  and through     strategic     partnerships     established     during     the programming period 20072013.  SEF   will   also   intensify   partnerships   with   other   national promotional institutions in Member states or in other regions to collectively  develop  effective  financing  solutions  for  European SMEs. We would like to create 3S support network in specific regions   (Balkan   CEE   region\\xe2\\x80\\xa6)   among   similar   supporting institutions  but  we  would  like  to  facilitate  the  international cooperation and network among 3S in connected regions too.14                              SYSTEMICS CYBERNETICS AND INFORMATICS        VOLUME 16  NUMBER 6  YEAR 2018                             ISSN 16904524\\x0c  Also Startup ecosystem functions not only at the national level but is becoming the meeting (bridge) point for young innovative growth   companies   for   the   entire   territory   of   the   former Yugoslavia  and  the  Balkans  Central  Europe  Region  China USA. Through the establishment of a strong network of partners (business angels  start  up  experts\\xe2\\x80\\xa6) and intensive cooperation between them an even better breakthrough of young fastmoving innovative companies from this region can be achieved on global markets.  Through  the  establishment  of  a  strong  network  of partners and intensive cooperation between them an even better breakthrough of young fastmoving innovative companies from this region can be achieved on global markets. 4.      CONCLUSIONS SMEs    are    key    contributors    to    economic    growth employment and innovation. Startups are a key source of productivity gains due to their high levels  of  innovativeness  and  increased  competitive pressure they put on incumbent firms. SMEs   are   key  contributors  to   technological   and   non technological  innovation.  New  and  small  firms  are  often behind innovations that are important for economic growth especially  in  sectors  such  as  software  nanotechnology biotechnology and clean technologies. Block chain technology and digitalenabled fintech services are likely   to    radically   transform   financial    markets especially the ways of addressing information asymmetries and collateral shortages which SMEs tend to suffer the most. Other  emerging  technologies  such  as  robotics  industrial biotechnology   3D   printing   nanotechnology   are   also announcing   the   \\xe2\\x80\\x9cnext   production   revolution\\xe2\\x80\\x9d   and   far reaching changes in markets and distribution and production processes wherein SMEs are closely involved. Innovation  by  SMEs  is  largely  influenced  by  knowledge spillovers access to networks and opportunities to partner with other players including larger enterprises.
