Because of their propensity to innovative undertaking and risk SMEs contribute significantly to economic growth but are generally less productive and pay the cost of high rates of death and lower rates of profitability. Financing SMEs is risky and uncertain and for innovative SMEs it is even  more  difficult  to  access financing. When financing innovative activities investors perceive high risks and it is even more emphasized in times of crisis when there is an increase in the cost of capital. Institutional support and governmental programmes have an important role in closing financial gap that innovative SMEs are faced with. Because the survival and development of SMEs is to a great extant determined by their ability to access  favorable  financing  the  main  objective  of  this  paper  is  to  provide  policy recommendations for promoting availability of financing to innovative SMEs in order to foster  economic recovery  and  more  dynamic  development  of  Serbia.  The recommendations  are  to  emerge  from  analyzes  and  evaluation  of  currently  available sources of finance for innovative SMEs.

Due to their flexibility vitality and tendency for innovative undertaking and risks they are considered  to  be  the  leading  initiators  of  economic  growth  and  a  single  most important  generator  of  economic  activity.  The  policy  makers  in  developed  EU countries have recognized and acknowledged the role and importance of SMEs in generating high employment and promoting innovativeness and competitiveness of their  economies  as  key  preconditions  for  achieving  smart  sustainable  and comprehensive  development.  SMEs  are  the  most  efficient  parts  of  economies because  they  have  the  ability  to  adjust  to  the  constantly  changing  requests imposed by the global and dynamic market in a more superior way than the large enterprises.  SMEs are the single most important factor on the road to achieving the objectives set by the Europe 2020 Strategy and creating environment suitable for  their  dynamic  development  and  consistent  implementation  of  the  European Charter for SMEs is the core of EU economic policy. Innovation  is  recognized  as  a  key  component  of  economic  growth  sustainable development  and  wealth  of  nations.  SMEs  are  dynamic  flexible  innovative  and growthoriented  and  conduct  a  significant  share  of  research  and  development activities.  In  developed  economies  more  than  half  of  all  SMEs  are  innovative. However SMEs in general are facing a number of obstacles to their survival and development among which difficult access to financing is considered to be the most important  one.  Because  innovative  activities  are  associated  with  higher  risk  and uncertainty it is even harder for innovative SMEs to obtain financing under favorable terms. The  constantly  rising  share  of  SMEs  in  total  GDP  employment  export  and import as well as an increasing number of newly opened enterprises year by year clearly shows that they are becoming a leading factor of economic recovery and development in Serbia as well. SMEs\' share in total number of enterprises in Serbia as well as their role in economic growth and development is growing year after year. According to the latest available official data in 2009 SMEs on average accounted for 99.8% of the total number of economic entities 42.3% of employment 33% of GDP 49.2% of export and 58.0% of the overall import as well as 66.7% of employment 67.8% of turnover and 57.4% of GDP of the non   Financing innovative small and mediumsized enterprises 61financial sector of the Serbian economy.1 The SMEs dominate in almost every sector of the economy. THE ROLE AND IMPORTANCE OF INNOVATIVE SMALL AND MEDIUMSIZED ENTERPRISES  Innovation  is  the  leading  engine  of  economic  growth  and  a  key  element  in making businesses competitive generating new jobs and achieving smart and sustainable development.  It refers to the conversion of knowledge and ideas into benefit in terms of new or improved products services or processes which may be for commercial use or for the public good. Only new products and services or new ways of their production and delivery create value and provide better living standards. Basically the future competitiveness of businesses and good health of population as well as environmental protection will not be possible without excellence  in  research  and  development  that  should  provide  the  necessary knowledge and technology to European industry and households. Turning smart ideas into jobs and growth is set as an imperative in developed marketbased European  economies  and  policy  makers  have  focused  their  attention  on increasing  investments  in  knowledge  and  improving  access  to  finance  for innovation. Thanks to its flexibility and ability to quickly and efficiently adapt to changes  in  the  market  entrepreneurs  have the ability to undertake innovative activities and commercialize innovation much faster than the large enterprises. Innovation as harvesting the fruits of scientific achievement requires much more than the ability of converting new ideas into commercial products. It is necessary to provide material resources and availability of appropriate business skills an adequate system of protection of intellectual property entrepreneurial incentives and innovative activities. Efforts must be directed towards the development of a culture that is dynamic and that considers innovation as a prerequisite for further economic growth and job creation. SMEs have a strong ability to adapt to rapidly changing consumer demands and high potential for using new technologies and providing necessary channels for their commercialization. As such they represent the backbone of innovation in developed economies and there is a rising awareness of their importance for economic growth and development in developing and transitional countries as well.                                                         1 Report on SMEE 2009 Ministry of Economy and Regional Development Development Fund  of  the  Republic  of  Serbia  Republic  Agency  for  the  Development  of  SMEE Belgrade p. 11 2010.   62 Dejan ERIC Isidora BERAHA Sonja DJURICIN that those invest inventions in  creating  new  knowledge  and tradition  of  producing  breakthrough SMEs contribute to dynamism and innovative performances of an economy by providing  mechanisms for  dissemination  and  commercialization  of  new knowledge  and  ideas  produced  in  large  organizations.  Investments  in  new knowledge don   t necessarily need to be commercialized by the organization in which knowledge is originally created. The concept of the knowledge filter refers to a situation when an organization creates knowledge and ideas but does not engage  in  their  implementation  transfer  and  commercialization.  There  are companies and organizations such as universities and research institutes which create  a  potentially  valuable  knowledge  and  ideas  but  don   t  consider  their commercialization as a priority. SMEs are the links between the organizations that implement  and commercialize knowledge. Recognizing  the  huge  potential  for  innovation  and  taking  into  account  the  long European the  European Commission has been engaged on formulating and implementing a set of policies measures and programs aimed at increasing innovation. The first Action Plan for Innovation in Europe adopted in 1996 was intended to raise the level of innovative performance  and  remove  barriers  to  rapid  commercial  exploitation  of  new technologies.  In  the  19982002  period  the  European  Commission  developed seven  programs  which  together  constitute  the  Fifth  Framework  Programme  for Research  and  Technological  Development  (Fifth  Framework  Programme  for Research and Technological Development) with the main objective of promoting innovation and encouraging greater involvement of SMEEs. However  despite  significant  contribution  to  innovation  SMEs  are  often  faced with numerous difficulties in the wider use of innovation and research as well as regarding  the  protection  of  intellectual  property  rights.  For  this  reason  the European  Union  has  set  a  goal  of  strengthening  the  innovative  and  research capacities of SMEEs and increase technology transfer towards them. In Serbia unlike the EU until recently there were no initiatives to support SMEs with high growth rate even though they were known to contribute significantly to dynamism and innovativeness of the economy. Along with rising awareness of the role of innovative SMEs in promoting innovative performances a number of concrete initiatives to support innovative activities of SMEs (incubators clusters innovation centres competition in the field of technological innovation financial support for innovative projects) have appeared. The  total  level  of  research  and  development  activities  in  Serbia  according  to international  standards  is  very  low.  The  largest  investment  is  in  higher    Financing innovative small and mediumsized enterprises 63education while only about 10% of total investment is realized in the corporate sector (EU15 6065%).  According to the European Innovation Scoreboard an instrument set up by the European  Commission  to  monitor  and  conduct  comparative  analysis  of  the innovative  performances  in  the  EU  member  states  and  associate  members (Croatia  Serbia  Turkey  Switzerland  Norway  and  Iceland)  all  countries  are divided  into  following  four  categories  innovation  leaders  innovation  followers moderate innovators and catchingup countries. On the basis of this instrument the  Summary  Innovation  Index  is  calculated  by  using  aggregate  indexes  of national innovative performances. The Summary Innovation Index is calculated as a composite index and contains 29 EIS indicators.    Figure 1. The Summary Innovation Index  Source European Innovation Scoreboard 2009.  By using average performances the Composite Innovation Index is calculated for each of the seven dimensions of innovative activity. The analysis represents a collection of related indicators of innovative performances grouped into three categories of weighted composite indexes indicators of support (high educated and qualified human resources financial support in terms of available financing and  governmental  support  for  innovative  activities);  indicators  of  enterprise   s activity (investments in innovations cooperation among innovative enterprises capacity for intellectual property); indicators of the effects of innovative activities (innovators  in  terms  of  their  number  economic  effects  in  terms  of  economic success of innovations).   64 Dejan ERIC Isidora BERAHA Sonja DJURICIN Serbia was included in the European Innovation Scoreboard for the first time in 2009  which  is  a  positive  step  forward  in  attempt  to  measure  the  innovative potential of the economy and particularly of the SMEE sector. Serbia belongs to the  category  of  catchingup  countries.  With  the  Summary  Innovation  Index  of 22.7 Serbia is significantly below the EU27 level (47.8). Greater  development  of  innovative  SMEs  in  Serbia  largely  depends  on  the improvements  in  their  access  to  favorable  financing  and  on  strengthening currently  very  weak  cooperation  between  them  and  organizations  which generate  knowledge.  Serbia  is  characterized  by  a  significant  potential  to generate intellectual property with the possibility of commercialization. On one hand there are a number of internationally recognized research institutes and organizations while on the other hand the low level of operations in this sector indicates  that  there  is  a  significant  unused  potential  for  research.  The expectations are that the Ministry of Economy and Regional Development and other relevant institutions will provide more effective programmes and measures including grants for financing innovative projects to promote the contribution of innovative SMEs to economic growth and development of the Serbian economy. FINANCING INNOVATIVE SMEs  Access to finance has been identified as the most important factor that determines the survival and development of SMEs. SMEs are often faced with limited access to adequate in terms of conditions and prices financial resources from both money and capital markets. Because of their propensity to innovative undertaking and risk SMEs contribute significantly to economic growth but are generally less productive and pay the cost of high rates of death and lower rates of profitability. Financing SMEs is risky and uncertain and for innovative SMEs it is even more difficult to obtain access to various sources of financing for several reasons. First the returns to innovative  activities  are  often  skewed  and  highly  uncertain.  Second entrepreneurs may possess more information about the nature and characteristics of their products and processes than potential financiers. Third innovative activities are  usually  intangible  thereby  making  the  assessment  of  their  monetary  values difficult before they become commercially successful.1                                                         1 2nd OECD Conference of Ministers Responsible for Small and Mediumsized Enterprises (SMEs)  Promoting  Entrepreneurship  and  Innovative  SMEs  in  a  Global  Economy Towards a more responsible and inclusive globalization Istanbul Turkey 2004 p  5.    Financing innovative small and mediumsized enterprises 65information.  Consequently The  financing  needs  of  innovative  SMEs  are  different  at  different  phases  of development. In the early stage startups rely predominantly on internal funds provided  from  family  friends  and  private  investors  and  the  need  for  external funds arises as they enter the stage of business expansion. At this point they are  still  unsuitable  for  debt  financing  since  their  activities  are  associated  with high  risk  and  uncertainty.  Innovative  SMEs  also  prefer  to  keep  their  financial flexibility by avoiding regular payments and interests.  Public equity capital is not a convenient source of financing either because it is associated with significant fixed  costs  such  as  the  costs  of  underwriting  registration  and  advisory  fees regular  yearly  expenses  related  to  auditing  certification  and  dissemination  of accounting the  survival  and  development  of innovative SMEs depends on their ability to attract private equity capital which is interested  in  investing  in  these  enterprises  because  of  their  high  potential  for growth and profitability. Private equity seems to be the most appropriate source of financing for innovative SMEs in the early stages of their development. As  innovative  SMEs  grow  debt  financing  and  venture  capital  become  more attractive  sources  of  financing.  However  banks  usually  don   t  find  SME   s  loan portfolio profitable because of limited and highly risk return lack of accounting records  lack  of  appropriate  business  plans  or  financial  statements  and  high administrative  and  transaction  costs.  For  that  reason  debt  financing  is  an expensive source of financing and innovative SMEs rely on it mostly in transition and  developing  countries  where  the  equity  market  is  insufficiently  developed. This  is  where  the  governmental  support  becomes  increasingly  important.  The government  can  significantly  reduce  the  risk  that  banks  are  exposed  to  by introducing various programmes such as loans guarantees. Venture capitalists provide innovative SMEs with an access to capital markets. They  implement  several  mechanisms  in  order  to  minimize  the  risk  and uncertainty  associated  with  innovative  activities  such  as  the  evaluation  and examination  of  potential  candidate   s  business  plan  consideration  of management flexibility and experience and potential market size. Furthermore they  demand  preferred  stock  with  numerous  restrictive  covenants  and participation  on  the  board  of  directors  in  return  for  their  investments.  Venture capitalists  make  their  investments  gradually  so  that  they  can  monitor  the profitability of an innovation over time. Venture capital and other forms of high risk capital such as business angels play an important role in financing innovative SMEs but the availability and the use  of  high  risk  capital  differ  significantly  across  the  countries  depending  on   66 Dejan ERIC Isidora BERAHA Sonja DJURICIN cultural  attitudes  towards  entrepreneurship  and  risk  taking  the  supply  of  risk capital and policies that encourage risktaking. One of the alternatives for financing innovative SMEs certainly refers to privateequity  funds.  Many  entrepreneurs  in  innovative  companies  especially  in  the initial  stages  of  development  are  besides  financial  problems  frequently  faced with other problems related to business organization legal affairs marketing and sales and the like. Under these circumstances a partnership with privateequity funds may be a reasonable solution. In addition to funding this type of investors can provide innovative SMSs with other additional services related to some of the above mentioned activities. In this way a true partnership and a relationship of trust is achieved until the moment in time when the company becomes strong enough to talk about different exit strategies for private equity funds. The  problem  related  to  SMEs     access  to  finance  has  been  additionally pronounced with the outbreak of the world financial crisis as these enterprises have suffered a double shock a drastic drop in demand for goods and services and a tightening in credit terms which have severely affected their cash flows. The  creation  survival  and  growth  of  SMEs  especially  innovative  ones  have been significantly challenged by the crisis which hit them harder than the large ones. SMEs are particularly vulnerable in times of crisis not only because the difficulties of accessing favourable financing continued but because new supplyside difficulties appeared. SMEs are generally more vulnerable in times of crisis for many reasons among which are it is more difficult for them to downsize as they  are  already  small;  they  are  individually  less  diversified  in  their  economic activities; they have a weaker financial structure (i.e. lower capitalization); they have a lower or no credit rating; they are heavily dependent on credit and they have fewer financing options.1  In times of crisis it is even more difficult for innovative SMEs to obtain shortterm financing  as  banks  are  under  pressure  and  are  trying  to  preserve  or  strength their capital base. Banks are willing to keep only the strongest clients and are seeking fully collateralized transactions. Along with the increased insolvency of SMEs their inability to access this source of finance is even more emphasized. As a response to the crisis governments in many countries have strengthened banks    balance sheets thus allowing them to grant additional credits to SMEs. Governments  have  also  recapitalized  the  banks  and  extended  the  funds  and                                                         1  The  Impact  of  the  Global  Crisis  on  SME  and  Entrepreneurship  Financing  and  Policy Responses Contribution to the OECD Strategic Response to the Financial and Economic Crisis Centre for Entrepreneurship SMEs and Local Development OECD 2010 pp. 7.    Financing innovative small and mediumsized enterprises 67for  SMEs.  Despite  significant  efforts  put  by guarantees  available the governments in many countries to provide incentives for lending to SMEs these enterprises are still facing serious constrains. When financing innovative activities in times of crisis investors perceive higher risks  due  to  an  increase  in  the  cost  of  capital.  Because  of  reduced  exit opportunities  shrinking  of  fundraising  activities  and  stagnation  or  decline  of investments in new projects it is more difficult to access to venture capital and private  equity.  Under  such  circumstances  innovative  SMEs  are  considering alternative sources of finance such as reserves selffinancing and factoring. In times of crisis it is of crucial importance that governments adopt anti crisis packages  which  include  measures  aimed  at  easing  the  SME  finance.  Many countries  have  put  in  place  different  anticrisis  packages  which  are  mostly consisted  of  actions  aimed  as  stimulation  of  demand  credit  enhancement measures  and  labourmarket  measures.  The  credit  enhancement  measures include mechanisms for improving banks    capacities for financing SMEs.  FINANCING INNOVATIVE SMEs IN SERBIA Innovative  SMEs  in  Serbia  are  in  particularly  difficult  position  regarding  their access  to  finance  because  they  are  always  associated  with  higher  risk  and uncertainty. Debt financing is the most widely used source of external finance by the  Serbian  SMEs  but  is  still  unreachable  for  many  especially  for  innovative enterprises because of high interest rates high banking costs and high collateral requirements.  Due  to  an  evident  shortage  of  both  debt  and  equity  financing obtaining necessary finance is the major obstacle for the development of Serbian SMEs. The availability of financial instruments coming from the capital market is very limited and there is a lack of financial institutions that could provide SMEs with  micro  credit  lines  local  guarantee  schemes  local  guarantee  funds  and informal venture capital investments. The world financial crisis seriously hit the SME sector in Serbia. An increase in the price of capital occurred thus putting in question the further operation and development of SMEs and in particular of innovative ones.  Along with reduced inflow of foreign capital at the beginning of October 2008 the first effects of the crisis imposed new business conditions characterized by a more rigid discipline in  debt  repayment.1  The  crisis  additionally  emphasized  the  importance  of  the                                                         1 Djuricin S.

Financial Support for SME Sector in Serbia Erenet Profile Vol. 5 No. 4 p. 37 2010.   68 Dejan ERIC Isidora BERAHA Sonja DJURICIN government in helping SMEs in general and particularly innovative SMEs to meet their financial needs. From the mid 2009 the negative effects of the global economic crises worsened and made general conditions for doing business even more difficult. Maturity dates have  been  extended  available  credit  sources  decreased  and  interest  rates increased. Under such conditions illiquidity of all participants of the economic and  social  life  has  increased  (Serbian  Government  encountered  special  problems  during  the  talks  with  the  International  Monetary  Fund  on  being  granted  loans  for  budget  liquidity  and  increase  of  deficit).  Such consequences struck the owners of small and mediumsized businesses the most. To make the situation even  worse  financial  system  in  Serbia  has  not  developed  mechanisms  and systems of microfinancing. There are neither micro credits nor real micro credit institutions which offer fast and favourable loans for the SME sector.1 In  Serbia  providing  financial  support  for  SMEs  is  in  accordance  with  the  7th Principle of the European Charter for Small Enterprises. The implementation of the European Charter has resulted in facilitating the access to funding sources for  SMEs  through  the  introduction  of  loan  guarantees  as  well  as  through  the establishment of legislation necessary for the operation of investment funds. The institutions  that  provide  financial  support  to  SME  sector  include  institutions established by the Government of the Republic of Serbia as well as domestic and  international  financial  institutions.  Financial  support  for  SMEs  in  form  of grants  or  loan  funds  under  favourable  terms  is  provided  by  the  Serbian government through the following institutions Ministry of Economy and Regional Development  Development  Fund  of  the  RS  Development  Fund  of  AP Vojvodina  Agency  for  Export  Insurance  and  Financing  Agency  for  Foreign Investment and Export Promotion and National Employment Agency. Despite the large number of banks with a defined program for SME financing and a number of outstanding international financial institutions such as the European Agency for Reconstruction (EAR) and the European Investment Bank (EIB) the Serbian SMEs and especially innovative ones have a hard time obtaining finance under favourable terms. One of the main obstacles to the use of debt financing certainly refers to a high cost of capital. The additional problem lies in the fact that  SME   s  owners  and  managers  often  lack  information  about  the  available funds particularly from the EU. Also on one hand there is a lack of cohesion and                                                         1  Eric  D.  The  need  to  enlarge  sources  of  financing  of  small  and  mediumsized enterprises under the conditions of global crisis Case of Serbia  Erenet Profile Vol. V No. 1. 2010 Budapest p. 18.    Financing innovative small and mediumsized enterprises 69poor coordination between financial and nonfinancial support to SMEs while on the other hand SMEs seem not to fully understand the importance of business activities  such  as  planning  creating  a  business  plan  and  investment  project which are necessary when applying for loans. Difficulties in obtaining external sources of financing have resulted in a greater share of selffinancing in the total capital structure of the Serbian entrepreneurs while it is certainly not a reflection of their financial strength. For these reasons the survival of SMEs is in most cases very uncertain. The access to longterm investment loans for the development and innovation has been enabled only to a small number of highly profitable enterprises. However the analysis of the types of finance that were used by SMEs over time indicates that the structure of finance has changed towards debt financing thus indicating a certain progress in the access to external finance. According to the survey "Status needs and problems of entrepreneurs in Serbia" conducted by the  Republic  Bureau  of  Statistics  at  the  request  of  the  National  Agency  for Regional Development the use of external sources of finance increase by 11% in 2011 in comparison to 2010 and by 25% in comparison to 2005. In particular 44% of respondents financed investments by external sources while 24% used external sources to finance working capital. The most commonly used source of external financing in Serbia refers to commercial banks    loans (28%) while the share of state funds lending by friends or partners guarantees or donations is less  represented.  Due  to  the  incentive  programmes  adopted  by  the  Serbian government the use of commercial loans by SMEs is slowly decreasing in favour of  loans  from  state  funds.  In  2010  only  10%  of  respondents  used  loans  from state funds while in 2011 a 6% increase was recorded. The Serbian SMEs often choose not to relay on commercial banks    loans due to inconvenient credit terms.  Significant  investment  optimism  was  recorded  among  the  respondents.  Some 62.5% of respondents planned new investment activity over the next three years which is a 10% increase in comparison to the previous period. This indicator is very encouraging considering that in the past three years 63% of respondents realized their need to improve technical and technological conditions for doing business through investments. Particularly investment in equipment (63%) was most  commonly  represented  in  the  investment  structure  followed  by  almost twice  lower  investment  in  office  space  (34%)  and  very  modest  investment  in acquiring industrial property rights (5%). It is expected that in the following three years the majority of investments of Serbian SMEs will be in the field of health care  printing  services  information  technology  transport  services  and  motor vehicles servicing.   70 Dejan ERIC Isidora BERAHA Sonja DJURICIN respondent  conducts innovative  activity  and  every The growing need for innovations in Serbia is justified by the fact that according to the Survey every second respondent disposes secondgeneration equipment almost every third more than ten years old equipment and only every fifth has modern technology. The old and obsolete equipment is mostly used by mediumsized enterprises which have the greatest potential to generate employment. In most cases outdated equipment is used by enterprises in processing industry transport and printing services while modern equipment is used in information technology  beauty  and  recreation  salons.  According  to  the  survey  every seventh fourteenth collaborates with other innovative businesses. The 54% of innovations refer to improvements in raw materials and energy savings and 46% to labour savings.  Enhancing  governmental  support  for  innovative  SMEs  in  Serbia  is  becoming increasingly  important  as  they  are  expected  to  contribute  to  the  creation  of modern  knowledgebased  economy.  Because  private  equity  market  is  still underdeveloped  in  Serbia  and  debt  financing  is  expensive  the  government should put in place measures and programs in order to improve the availability of finance to SMEs. Having  recognized  the  importance  and  the  role  of  innovative  SMEs  for  the development of the Serbian economy the government through the Ministry of Economy  and  Regional  Development  and  in  cooperation  with  the  National Agency  for  Regional  Development  has  introduced  support  programs  and measures  to  help  innovative  SMEs  obtain  necessary  financing.  Within  the program  named  "Support  for  strengthening  the  innovativeness  of  SMEs"  an enterprise can apply for a grant in the amount of 1.00015.000 Euros and for the purpose of financing innovative activity the coverage of up to 50% of total costs is provided. This program is aimed at financing innovations in the development of new  products  or  services  significant  improvements  of  the  existing  ones implementation and testing of new production processes purchase of domestic patent  rights  new  product  design  and  marketing  plan  for  a  new  product  or service. Special attention within the program called "Support for the development of innovative clusters" is dedicated to innovative clusters in the initial stage and in developing phase. Enterprises can apply for grants in the amount of 2.000 to 20.000  Euros  for  innovative  clusters  in  the  initial  stage  and  20.000140.000 Euros for innovative clusters in the developing phase.  The operations of the newly established Innovation Fund along with international financial  institutions  and  donors  have  significantly  improved  the  process  of financing innovative SMEs in Serbia. The Fund aims to promote innovation in priority fields of science and technology and to support the implementation of    Financing innovative small and mediumsized enterprises 71innovative  SMEs  and Innovation  Framework  Programme    new technologies in the economy through the development of innovative SMEs. In  this  regard  the  Fund  has  developed  two  programs  Mini  Grants  and Partnership Program. The Mini Grants program is intended for private micro and small  enterprises  in  the  early  stage  of  development  that  have  developed technological  innovation  but  need  financial  support  to  commercialize  it.  The applicant must be a private maximum two years old company founded in Serbia with the majority of domestic capital. On the other hand the Partnership program is designed for enterprises that are struggling to secure funds for transforming innovations into commercially viable products. The primary objective is to expand the  cooperation  between local  strategic  partners investment and venture capital funds to improve private sector   s investments in technology  development  projects.  Additionally  the  program  aims  to  support enterprises in their efforts to conduct research and development activities and ensure the placement of innovative products on foreign markets. Potential users of the program are SMEs maximum five years old founded in Serbia with the majority of domestic capital that posses technological innovation the potential for creating new intellectual property and are internationally competitive. The  development  of  innovative  SMEs  in  Serbia  is  supported  by  the  EU    Competitiveness  and (CIP).  The Programme is aimed at supporting primarily innovative SMEs in the field of ecoinnovation and easier access to capital. The program encourages more intensive use of ICT and contributes to the development of sustainable competitive and inclusive information society and provides incentives for the more advanced use of renewable energy and energy efficiency. Trough    Improved Competitiveness and  Innovation  Programme     (ICIP)  the  EU  provides  3  million  Euros  to  the Ministry  of  Economy  and  Regional  Development  and  the  National  Agency  for Regional  Development innovative  activities  and competitiveness  of  SMEs.  The  main  purpose  of  the  program  is  to  support government agencies in their attempts to promote and coordinate activities that are in line with EU objectives and special needs of the SME sector in Serbia. The program  aims  to  improve  the  quality  of  business  support  for  SMEs  and strengthen  capacity  building  of  institutions  encouraging  the  development  of innovation  and  competitiveness  of  SMEs  and  consequently  of  the  entire economy. Financial funds in the amount of 50 billion Euros provided by the EU 7th Framework Programme for Research and Technological Development (FP7) are also available for SMEs that are willing to introduce innovation and enhance competitiveness  by  increasing  investment  in  research  activities.  The  program encourages  the  cooperation  between  scientific  institutions  and  SME  sector  to intensify innovations and economic development.  the  promotion  of for  72 Dejan ERIC Isidora BERAHA Sonja DJURICIN financial  market introduction  of  new Innovative  SMEs  as  enterprises  with  the  highest  potential  for  conducting innovative  activities  are  considered  as  one  of  the  main  pillars  of  the development  and  growth  of  the  Serbian  economy.  For  that  reason  further improvements  in  their  access  to  financing  continues  to  be  one  of  the  most significant  challenges  in  years  to  come.  The  key  policy  recommendations  to overcome the existing financial gap faced by the Serbian innovative SMEs refer to  three  fields  of  activity.  First  the  government  should  focus  on  promoting availability  of  risk  capital  to  innovative  SMEs.  Second  the  terms  under  which debt financing is available to innovative SMEs should be improved by creating competitive  banking  sector.  Third  SMEs  need  to  be  better  informed  about available financing options. Improving  the  innovative  SME   s  access  to  risk  capital  requires  the  following actions  development  of financial instruments and appropriate regulatory framework including flexible investment regulations  and  viable  exit  mechanisms  improvement  of  the  transparency  of corporate  performance  to  overcome  information  gap  between  SMEs  and potential investors enable investors evaluate the nature and quality of innovative activities  and  reduce  risk  associated  with  innovative  activities  by  introducing guarantee schemes. Given  that  debt  financing  represents  the  most  widely  used  source  of  external financing for Serbian SMEs a proper regulatory framework should be introduced to  encourage  commercial  banks  to  adjust  to  the  specific  needs  of  SMEs  and particularly  of  innovative  ones  to  increase  the  amount  of  funds  available  to SMEs  and  to  improve  the  terms  of  their  credit  offers.  Creating  a  competitive banking sector would significantly enhance the SME   s access to debt financing. Innovative SMEs in Serbia are not fully aware of all financing options that are available to them. For that reason they rely mostly on debt financing which is limited  and  unfavourable.  Managers  and  owners  often  lack  information  about existing government programmes or don   t know how to prepare business plans or  financial  projections  necessary  for  application.    There  is  a  low  level  of managerial skills in Serbia which is a serious obstacle to attracting risk capital. Also improvements are necessary in the field of education of entrepreneurs and owners of innovative SMEs particularly in the key areas of knowledge related to business success. Innovative activity can hardly be successful unless there is an appropriate organizational support. For that reason it is of great importance to spread knowledge among the owners of innovative enterprises and to engage on breaking  down  the  resistance  to  the  inclusion  of  partners.  In  fact  the  owners    Financing innovative small and mediumsized enterprises 73often  believe  that  they  have  to  be  100%  in  control  of  their  businesses  which creates a number of operational problems and leads to inefficiency. In order to prevent the occurrence of such problems it is necessary not only to improve the access to finance but to promote education as well.  CONCLUDING REMARKS Innovation  as  a  conversion  of  knowledge  and  ideas  into  new  or  improved projects or processes is the key prerequisite for achieving sustainable economic growth and development. Due to their flexibility vitality and propensity to risk innovative  SMEs  are  the  backbone  of  innovation  in  developed  economies. However they are facing serious constraints when obtaining financing. Access to financing  has  been  recognized  as  the  major  obstacle  to  the  survival  and development  of  innovative  SMEs  especially  in  times  of  crisis  when  the  risk perceived by investors is higher and the cost of capital is increased. Financing difficulties  are  even  more  emphasized  in  transition  economies  because  of undeveloped  financial  markets  unfavourable  terms  of  debt  financing  and insufficient volume and scope of government support programmes. According to international  standards  the  level  of  innovative  activities  in  Serbia  is  very  low. Limited access to finance is often a key factor that determines the survival and development  of  innovative  SMEs  in  Serbia.  For  that  reason  policy  actions directed towards promoting equity financing creating competitive banking sector and raising awareness of available financing options are necessary. REFERENCE 1.
